The Company is the holding company for William Penn Bank (the\n“Bank”).

If you would like\nto receive a paper copy of our proxy materials free of charge, please follow the instructions included in\nthe Notice.\nIt is anticipated that the Notice will be mailed to shareholders on October 11, 2024.\nThe Notice, this proxy statement and the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year\nended June 30, 2024 are available online at www.proxyvote.com.\nVOTING AND PROXY PROCEDURE\nWho Can Vote at the Meeting\nYou are entitled to vote your shares of Company common stock if the records of the Company\nshow that you held your shares as of the close of business on September 23, 2024. If your shares are held\nin a stock brokerage account or by a bank or other nominees, you are considered the beneficial owner of\nshares held in “street name” and these proxy materials are being forwarded to you by your broker, bank or\nother nominee. As the beneficial owner, you have the right to direct your broker on how to vote your\nshares. Your broker, bank or other nominee has enclosed a voting instruction form for you to use in\ndirecting it on how to vote your shares.\nAs of the close of business on September 23, 2024, 9,231,559 shares of Company common stock\nwere outstanding and entitled to vote. Each share of common stock has one vote. The Company’s\narticles of incorporation generally provide that record holders of the Company’s common stock who\nbeneficially own, either directly or indirectly, in excess of 10% of the Company’s outstanding shares are\nnot entitled to any vote with respect to those shares held in excess of the 10% limit. However, a majority\nof the Company’s disinterested directors may approve a shareholder acquiring and voting in excess of\n10% of the Company’s outstanding shares before the shareholder acquires any shares in excess of the\n10% limit.\n2\nThe Company and the Bank have entered into a written agreement with Tyndall Capital Partners\nLP and Jeffrey Halis with respect to the voting of their shares of Company common stock. For more\ninformation regarding this agreement, see “Shareholder Agreement” below.\nAttending the Meeting\nIf you are a shareholder as of the close of business on September 23, 2024, you may attend and\nparticipate in the virtual annual meeting. If you want to vote your shares of Company common stock held\nin street name at the meeting, you will need a written proxy in your name from the broker, bank or other\nnominee who holds your shares.\nShareholders may attend by using the Zoom application which may be found on your device’s app\nstore or at www.zoom.us. To join the meeting use Meeting ID: 978 4582 9377 and passcode: willpenn or\nuse the following direct link:\nhttps://williampenn.zoom.us/j/97845829377?pwd=8EOctbbtegHmC2QDgdEzcTAeINb7gG.1\nShareholders will be provided with the opportunity to ask questions and vote at the virtual annual\nmeeting. Shareholders who wish to vote during the annual meeting may do so by notifying the Company\nof their desire to do so via the “chat” function on the Zoom platform.\nVote Required\nThe annual meeting will be held only if there is a quorum. A majority of the outstanding shares\nof Company common stock entitled to vote, represented in person or by proxy, constitutes a quorum. If\nyou return valid proxy instructions or attend the meeting in person, your shares will be counted for\npurposes of determining whether there is a quorum, even if you abstain from voting. Broker non-votes\nalso will be counted for purposes of determining the existence of a quorum. A broker non-vote occurs\nwhen a broker, bank or other nominee holding shares for a beneficial owner does not vote on a particular\nproposal because the broker, bank or other nominee does not have discretionary voting power with\nrespect to that item and has not received voting instructions from the beneficial owner.\nIn voting on the election of directors, you may vote in favor of the nominees or withhold votes as\nto the nominees. There is no cumulative voting for the election of directors. Directors are elected by a\nplurality of the votes cast at the annual meeting. “Plurality” means that the nominees receiving the largest\nnumber of votes cast will be elected up to the maximum number of directors to be elected at the annual\nmeeting. The maximum number of directors to be elected at the annual meeting is two. In the election of\ndirectors, votes that are withheld will have no effect on the outcome of the election.\nIn voting on the ratification of the appointment of S.R. Snodgrass, P.C. as the Company’s\nindependent registered public accounting firm, you may vote in favor of the proposal, vote against the\nproposal or abstain from voting. To be approved, this proposal requires the affirmative vote of a majority\nof the votes cast at the annual meeting. In counting votes on this proposal, abstentions and broker non-\nvotes will have no impact on the outcome of the proposal.\n3\nEffect of Not Casting Your Vote\nIf you hold your shares in street name, it is critical that you cast your vote if you want it to count\nin the election of directors (Proposal 1).\nCurrent regulations restrict the ability of your bank or broker to vote your uninstructed shares in\nthe election of directors and other matters on a discretionary basis. Thus, if you hold your shares in street\nname and you do not instruct your bank or broker how to vote in the election of directors, no votes will be\ncast on your behalf. These are referred to as broker non-votes. Your bank or broker will, however,\ncontinue to have discretion to vote any uninstructed shares on the ratification of the appointment of the\nCompany’s independent registered public accounting firm (Proposal 2). If you are a shareholder of\nrecord and you do not cast your vote, no votes will be cast on your behalf on any of the items of business\nat the annual meeting.\nVoting by Proxy\nThis proxy statement is being sent to you by the Board of Directors of the Company to request\nthat you allow your shares of the Company common stock to be represented at the annual meeting by the\npersons named in the enclosed proxy card. All shares of Company common stock represented at the\nmeeting by properly executed and dated proxies will be voted according to the instructions indicated on\nthe proxy card. If you sign, date and return a proxy card without giving voting instructions, your shares\nwill be voted as recommended by the Company’s Board of Directors.\nThe Board of Directors recommends that you vote:\n “FOR” each of the nominees for director; and\n “FOR” the ratification of the appointment of S.R. Snodgrass, P.C. as the\nCompany’s independent registered public accounting firm.\nIf any matter not described in this proxy statement is properly presented at the annual meeting,\nthe persons named in the proxy card will use their judgment to determine how to vote your shares. This\nincludes a motion to adjourn or postpone the meeting to solicit additional proxies. If the annual meeting\nis postponed or adjourned, your shares of Company common stock may also be voted by the persons\nnamed in the proxy card on the new meeting date, unless you have revoked your proxy. The Company\ndoes not know of any other matters to be presented at the annual meeting.\nYou may revoke your proxy at any time before the vote is taken at the annual meeting. To revoke\nyour proxy, you must either advise the Corporate Secretary of the Company in writing before your\nCompany common stock has been voted at the annual meeting, deliver a later-dated valid proxy or attend\nthe meeting virtually and vote your shares. Attendance at the annual meeting will not in itself constitute\nrevocation of your proxy.\nIf your Company common stock is held in street name, you will receive instructions from your\nbroker, bank or other nominee that you must follow to have your shares voted. Your broker, bank or\nother nominee may allow you to deliver your voting instructions by telephone or by the Internet. Please\nsee the instruction form provided by your broker, bank or other nominee that accompanies this proxy\nstatement. If you wish to change your voting instructions after you have returned your voting instruction\nform to your broker, bank or other nominees, you must contact your broker, bank or other nominee.\n4\nParticipants in the Bank’s ESOP and 401(k) Plan\nIf you are a participant in the William Penn Bank Employee Stock Ownership Plan (the “ESOP”)\nor hold shares of Company common stock through the William Penn Bank 401(k) Retirement Savings\nPlan (the “401(k) Plan”), you will receive a voting instruction form from each plan that reflects all shares\nyou may vote under these plans.\nAll shares held by the ESOP are voted by the ESOP trustee, but each participant in the ESOP may\ndirect the trustee on how to vote the shares of Company common stock allocated to his or her account.\nUnallocated shares and allocated shares for which no timely voting instructions are received will be voted\nby the ESOP trustee in the same proportion on each of the proposals as the shares held by participants in\nthe ESOP for which voting instructions were timely received.\nUnder the terms of the 401(k) Plan, you are entitled to direct the trustee how to vote the shares of\nCompany common stock credited to your account in the 401(k) Plan. The 401(k) Plan trustee will vote all\nshares for which it does not receive timely instructions from participants in the same proportion on each\nof the proposals as the shares held by participants in the 401(k) Plan for which voting instructions were\ntimely received.\nThe deadline for returning your voting instruction forms to the trustees of the ESOP and 401(k)\nPlan is November 15, 2024.\nCORPORATE GOVERNANCE\nGeneral\nThe Company periodically reviews its corporate governance policies and procedures to ensure\nthat the Company meets the highest standards of ethical conduct, reports results with accuracy and\ntransparency and maintains full compliance with the laws, rules and regulations that govern the\nCompany’s operations.

These procedures ensure that individuals\nmay submit concerns regarding questionable accounting or auditing matters in a confidential and\nanonymous manner. The Code of Ethics and Business Conduct also prohibits the Company from\nretaliating against any director, executive officer or employee who reports actual or apparent violations of\nthe Code.\nMeetings and Committees of the Board of Directors\nThe Company conducts business through meetings of its Board of Directors and its committees.\nThe Company’s Board of Directors held 12 regular meetings during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2024.\nDuring the fiscal year ended June 30, 2024, no director attended fewer than 75% of the total meetings of\nthe Company’s Board of Directors and committees on which such director served.\nThe following table identifies our standing committees and their members as of September 30,\n2024.

It also handles policies relating to nondiscriminatory employment practices,\nincluding those related to hiring, compensation and promotion. The Compensation Committee reviews all\ncompensation components for our President and Chief Executive Officer, as well as reviews our\nexecutive and employee compensation programs and director compensation. The committee considers our\nfinancial performance, shareholder return, competitive market values, and the compensation of our\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer over recent years when determining appropriate compensation for\nthe President and Chief Executive Officer. In setting executive compensation, the committee ensures that\na significant portion of compensation is connected to and aligned with the long-term interest of\nshareholders. In its oversight of employee compensation programs, prior to making its recommendation to\nthe Board, the committee reviews recommendations from the President and Chief Executive Officer and\nHuman Resources Manager. Decisions by the Compensation Committee with respect to the compensation\nlevels are approved by the full Board of Directors. The Compensation Committee acts under a written\ncharter, a copy of which is available in the “Investor Relations” section of the Company’s website\n(www.williampenn.bank).\nNominating and Corporate Governance Committee. The Nominating and Corporate\nGovernance Committee is responsible for the annual selection of the Board of Directors’ nominees for\nelection as directors and developing and implementing policies and practices relating to corporate\ngovernance, including implementation of and monitoring adherence to the Company’s corporate\ngovernance policy. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee acts under a written charter, a\ncopy of which is available in the “Investor Relations” section of the Company’s website\n(www.williampenn.bank).\nMinimum Qualifications. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee has adopted a\nset of criteria that it considers when it selects individuals to be nominated for election to the Board of\nDirectors. First, a candidate must meet the eligibility requirements set forth in the Company’s Bylaws,\nwhich include an age limitation, a stock ownership requirement and a requirement that the candidate have\nnot been subject to certain criminal or regulatory actions. A candidate also must meet any qualification\nrequirements set forth in any Board or committee governing documents.\nThe Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee will consider the following criteria in\nselecting nominees: contributions to the range of talent, skill and expertise appropriate for the Board;\nfinancial, regulatory and business experience; knowledge of the banking and financial services industries;\nfamiliarity with the operations of public companies and ability to read and understand financial\nstatements; familiarity with the Company’s market area and participation in and ties to local businesses\nand local civic, charitable and religious organizations; personal and professional integrity, honesty and\nreputation; ability to represent the best interests of the shareholders of the Company and the best interests\nof the Bank; ability to devote sufficient time and energy to the performance of his or her duties;\nindependence; current equity holdings in the Company; and any other factors the Nominating and\nCorporate Governance Committee deems relevant, including age, diversity, size of the Board of Directors\nand regulatory disclosure obligations. In its consideration of diversity, the Nominating and Corporate\nGovernance Committee seeks to create a Board that is strong in its collective knowledge and that has a\ndiverse set of skills and experience with respect to management and leadership, vision and strategy,\naccounting and finance, business operations and judgment, industry knowledge and corporate governance.\n7\nIn addition, prior to nominating an existing director for re-election to the Board of Directors, the\nNominating and Corporate Governance Committee will consider and review an existing director’s Board\nand committee attendance and performance; length of Board service; experience, skills and contributions\nthat the existing director brings to the Board; and independence.\nDirector Nomination Process. The process that the Nominating and Corporate Governance\nCommittee follows when it identifies and evaluates individuals to be nominated for election to the Board\nof Directors is as follows:\nFor purposes of identifying nominees for the Board of Directors, the Nominating and Corporate\nGovernance Committee relies on personal contacts of the committee members and other members of the\nBoard of Directors, as well as their knowledge of members of the communities served by the Bank. The\nNominating and Corporate Governance Committee also will consider director candidates recommended\nby shareholders in accordance with the policy and procedures set forth below. The Nominating and\nCorporate Governance Committee has not previously used an independent search firm to identify\nnominees.\nIn evaluating potential nominees, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee\ndetermines whether the candidate is eligible and qualified for service on the Board of Directors by\nevaluating the candidate under the selection criteria set forth above. In addition, the Nominating and\nCorporate Governance Committee will conduct a check of the individual’s background and interview the\ncandidate to further assess the qualities(cid:1)of the prospective nominees and the contributions he or she\nwould make to the Board.\nConsideration of Recommendations by Shareholders. It is the policy of the Nominating and\nCorporate Governance Committee to consider director candidates recommended by shareholders who\nappear to be qualified to serve on the Company’s Board of Directors. The Nominating and Corporate\nGovernance Committee may choose not to consider an unsolicited recommendation if no vacancy exists\non the Board of Directors and the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee does not perceive a\nneed to increase the size of the Board of Directors. In order to avoid the unnecessary use of the\nNominating and Corporate Governance Committee’s resources, the Nominating and Corporate\nGovernance Committee will consider only those director candidates recommended in accordance with the\nprocedures set forth below.\nProcedures to be Followed by Shareholders. To submit a recommendation for a director\ncandidate to the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee, a shareholder should submit the\nfollowing information in writing, addressed to the Chairman of the Nominating and Corporate\nGovernance Committee, care of the Corporate Secretary, at the main office of the Company:\n1. The name of the person recommended as a director candidate;\n2. All information relating to such person that is required to be disclosed in solicitations of\nproxies for election of directors pursuant to Regulation 14A under the Securities\nExchange Act of 1934, as amended;\n3. The written consent of the person being recommended as a director candidate to being\nnamed in the proxy statement as a nominee and to serving as a director if elected;\n8\n4. As to the shareholder making the recommendation, the name and address, as they appear\non the Company’s books, of such shareholder; provided, however, that if the shareholder\nis not a registered holder of the Company’s common stock, the shareholder should submit\nhis or her name and address along with a current written statement from the record holder\nof the shares that reflects ownership of the Company’s common stock; and\n5. A statement disclosing whether such shareholder is acting with or on behalf of any other\nperson and, if applicable, the identity of such person.\nIn order for a director candidate to be considered for nomination at the Company’s annual\nmeeting of shareholders, the recommendation must be received by the Nominating and Corporate\nGovernance Committee at least 120 calendar days prior to the date the Company’s proxy statement was\nreleased to shareholders in connection with the previous year’s annual meeting, advanced by one year.\nBoard Leadership Structure and Risk Oversight\nKenneth J. Stephon serves as our Chairman of the Board and as our President and Chief\nExecutive Officer. Our Board of Directors believes that potential efficiencies result from having the\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer also serve in the role of Chairman of the Board and that our\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer, as the director most familiar with our current business\noperations and industry, is therefore best able to identify the strategic priorities to be discussed by the\nBoard. The Chairman of the Board has no greater nor lesser vote on matters considered by the Board\nthan any other director, and the Chairman does not vote on any related party transaction. All of our\ndirectors, including the Chairman, are bound by fiduciary obligations, imposed by law, to serve the\nbest interests of our shareholders.\nSince the roles of Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer are currently\ncombined, our Board of Directors has appointed William J. Feeney to serve as our lead independent\ndirector. As lead independent director, Mr. Feeney provides leadership to (and reports to) the Board\nof Directors that is focused on enhancing effective corporate governance, providing a source of\nBoard leadership complementary to, collaborative with and independent of the leadership of the\nChairman of the Board and President and Chief Executive Officer, and promoting best practices and\nhigh standards of corporate governance.\nA fundamental part of our risk management is not only understanding the risks we face and\nwhat steps management is taking to manage those risks, but also understanding what level of risk is\nappropriate for us. The involvement of the full Board of Directors in setting our business strategy is\nan important aspect of its assessment of management’s tolerance for risk and its determination of the\nappropriate level of risk for us. While the Board of Directors has the ultimate oversight responsibility\nfor the risk management process, various committees of the Board also have responsibility for risk\nmanagement. In particular, the Audit Committee focuses on financial risk by providing oversight of\nthe quality and integrity of our financial reporting and internal controls, as well as our compliance\nwith legal and regulatory requirements. Our Compensation Committee reviews our compensation\npolicies and practices to help ensure there is a direct relationship between pay levels and corporate\nperformance and return to shareholders.\n9\nBoard Diversity\nOur Board of Directors values diversity and seeks to include directors with a broad range of\nbackgrounds, professional experience, perspectives, and skills. In compliance with Nasdaq listing rules,\nthe following chart shows the diversity of our Board of Directors as of September 23, 2024.

In addition, if the ratification of the independent\nregistered public accounting firm is approved by shareholders at the annual meeting, the Audit Committee\nmay also consider other independent registered public accounting firms in the future if it determines that\nsuch consideration is in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders.\nThe Board of Directors recommends a vote “FOR” the ratification of the appointment of\nS.R. Snodgrass, P.C. as the Company’s independent registered public accounting firm.\nAudit and Non-Audit Fees\nThe following table sets forth the fees billed to the Company for the fiscal years ending June 30,\n2024 and 2023 for services provided by S.R.

In accordance with its charter, the Audit\nCommittee approves, in advance, all audit and permissible non-audit services to be performed by the\nindependent registered public accounting firm. Such approval process ensures that the independent\nregistered public accounting firm does not provide any non-audit services to the Company that are\nprohibited by law or regulation.\nIn addition, the Audit Committee has established a policy regarding pre-approval of all audit and\npermissible non-audit services provided by the independent registered public accounting firm. Requests\nfor services by the independent registered public accounting firm for compliance with the auditor services\npolicy must be specific as to the particular services to be provided. The request may be made with respect\nto either specific services or a type of service for predictable or recurring services.\nAny proposed specific engagement may be presented to the Audit Committee for consideration at\nits next regular meeting or, if earlier consideration is required, to the Audit Committee or one or more of\nits members. The member or members to whom such authority is delegated shall report any specific\napproval of services at the next regular meeting of the Audit Committee. The Audit Committee will\nregularly review summary reports detailing all services being provided to the Company by its independent\nregistered public accounting firm.\nDuring the year ended June 30, 2024, all services were approved, in advance, by the Audit\nCommittee in compliance with these procedures.\nAudit Committee Report\nThe Company’s management is responsible for the Company’s internal control over financial\nreporting. The independent registered public accounting firm is responsible for performing an\nindependent audit of the Company’s consolidated financial statements and issuing an opinion on the\nconformity of those financial statements with generally accepted accounting principles. The Audit\nCommittee oversees the Company’s internal control over financial reporting on behalf of the Board of\nDirectors.\nIn this context, the Audit Committee has met and held discussions with management and the\nindependent registered public accounting firm. Management represented to the Audit Committee that the\nCompany’s consolidated financial statements were prepared in accordance with generally accepted\naccounting principles, and the Audit Committee has reviewed and discussed the consolidated financial\nstatements with management and the independent registered public accounting firm. The Audit\nCommittee discussed with the independent registered public accounting firm all communications required\nby generally accepted accounting standards.\nIn addition, the Audit Committee has received the written disclosures and the letter from the\nindependent registered public accounting firm required by the applicable requirements of the Public\nCompany Accounting Oversight Board and has discussed with the independent registered public\naccounting firm the accounting firm’s independence from the Company and its management. In\nconcluding that the accounting firm is independent, the Audit Committee considered, among other\nfactors, whether the non-audit services provided by the independent registered public accounting firm\nwere compatible with their independence.\n16\nThe Audit Committee discussed with the Company’s independent registered public accounting\nfirm the overall scope and plans for their audit. The Audit Committee meets with the independent\nregistered public accounting firm, with and without management present, to discuss the results of their\nexamination, their evaluation of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting, and the overall\nquality of the Company’s financial reporting process.\nIn performing all of these functions, the Audit Committee acts only in an oversight capacity. In\nits oversight role, the Audit Committee relies on the work and assurances of the Company’s management,\nwhich has the primary responsibility for financial statements and reports, and of the independent\nregistered public accounting firm who, in its report, expresses an opinion on the conformity of the\nCompany’s financial statements to generally accepted accounting principles. The Audit Committee’s\noversight does not provide it with an independent basis to determine that management has maintained\nappropriate accounting and financial reporting principles or policies, or appropriate internal controls and\nprocedures designed to assure compliance with accounting standards and applicable laws and regulations.\nFurthermore, the Audit Committee’s considerations and discussions with management and the\nindependent registered public accounting firm do not assure that the Company’s financial statements are\npresented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, that the audit of the Company’s\nconsolidated financial statements has been carried out in accordance with the standards of the Public\nCompany Accounting Oversight Board or that the Company’s independent registered public accounting\nfirm is in fact “independent.”\nIn reliance on the reviews and discussions referred to above, the Audit Committee recommended\nto the Board of Directors, and the Board has approved, that the audited consolidated financial statements\nbe included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2024 for filing\nwith the Securities and Exchange Commission. The Audit Committee has appointed, subject to\nshareholder ratification, the selection of the Company’s independent registered public accounting firm for\nthe fiscal year ending June 30, 2025.\nAudit Committee of the Board of Directors of William Penn Bancorporation\nD.

Stephon that currently expires on June 30, 2027. On each anniversary of the effective\ndate, the term of the Agreement will automatically extend for an additional twelve months, unless\none party gives the other party notice of intent not to renew the Agreement, in which case the\nAgreement will terminate upon completion of the then-current thirty-six-month term. However, if\nthe Company enters into an agreement to effect a transaction that would be considered a Change in\nControl as defined in the Agreement, then the Agreement will remain in effect while that transaction\nagreement is in effect and (a) if the Change in Control is consummated, the term of the Agreement\nwill extend for twenty-four months following the date of consummation and then terminate, or (b) if\nthe transaction agreement is terminated, the term of the Agreement will extend to the first\nanniversary of its effective date that is more than twelve months following the date on which the\ntransaction agreement is terminated and then the renewal provisions described above will continue to\napply as if the Company had not entered into the transaction agreement.\nThe Agreement provides for, among other things, a minimum annual base salary of $570,000,\neligibility to participate in employee benefit plans and programs maintained by the Company and the\nBank for the benefit of their employees, including the annual incentive, medical, dental, retirement\nand stock-based compensation plans and certain fringe benefits applicable to executive personnel.\nUnder the Agreement, the Bank will also provide Mr. Stephon with an automobile owned or leased\nby the Bank and will pay, or reimburse Mr. Stephon for, all expenses associated with Mr. Stephon’s\nuse of such automobile.\nThe Agreement provides for certain payments to Mr. Stephon following the termination of\nhis employment by the Company and Bank without Cause (as defined in the Agreement) or by Mr.\nStephon for Good Reason (as defined in the Agreement), in either case prior to a Change in Control\n(as defined in the Agreement). Generally, in exchange for signing an effective release of claims\nagainst the Company and the Bank, Mr. Stephon will be entitled to receive a lump sum severance\npayment equal to the sum of his then current annual base salary due for the remaining term of the\nAgreement and two times the highest annual bonus paid to him during the term of the Agreement; a\nlump sum cash payment equal to eighteen times the Bank’s monthly COBRA charge in effect on his\ntermination date for the type of Bank-provided group health plan coverage in effect for Mr. Stephon\non his termination date; any unpaid annual bonus for the completed fiscal year preceding the fiscal\nyear in which his termination occurs (the “Prior Year Bonus”); if, under the applicable annual bonus\nplan, Mr. Stephon would otherwise forfeit his right to earn an annual bonus for the year in which his\ntermination occurs, a lump sum cash payment equal to a pro rata portion of his target annual\nincentive award for such year (the “Pro Rata Bonus”); and accelerated vesting of his outstanding\nequity awards.\nThe Agreement also provides for certain payments to Mr. Stephon following the termination of\nhis employment by the Company and Bank without Cause (as defined in the Agreement) or by Mr.\nStephon for Good Reason (as defined in the Agreement), in either case concurrent with or within twenty-\nfour months following the occurrence of a Change in Control (as defined in the Agreement).

The Company has determined that (i)\n505,601 shares may be issued as restricted stock award shares or restricted stock units, including\nperformance shares and performance units (or 4.0% of total shares of Company common stock sold in our\nsecond-step conversion offering) and (ii) 1,264,003 shares may be issued as stock options or SARs (or\n10.0% of total shares of Company common stock sold in our second-step conversion offering).\nThe minimum vesting period for each award granted under the 2022 Equity Incentive Plan must\nbe at least one year, provided that up to 5% of the shares authorized for issuance under the 2022 Equity\nIncentive Plan may be issued pursuant to awards with minimum vesting periods of less than one year and\nawards to non-employee directors may vest on the earlier of the first anniversary of the grant date and the\nnext annual meeting of shareholders that is at least 50 weeks after the immediately prior annual meeting.\nIn addition, the minimum vesting requirement does not apply to accelerated vesting on account of\nretirement, death, disability, or a Change in Control of the Company as otherwise permitted by the 2022\nEquity Incentive Plan.\nSubject to certain exceptions, generally, if a participant ceases to perform services for the\nCompany and its subsidiaries for any reason (i) all of the participant’s restricted stock, RSUs,\nperformance shares, and performance units that were not vested on the date of such cessation shall be\nforfeited immediately upon such cessation, (ii) all of the participant’s stock options and SARs that were\nexercisable on the date of such cessation shall remain exercisable for, and shall otherwise terminate at the\nend of, a period of 90 days after the date of such cessation, but in no event after the expiration date of the\nstock options or SARs, and (iii) all of the participant’s stock options and SARs that were not exercisable\non the date of such cessation shall be forfeited immediately upon such cessation. The Committee may\n22\nprovide in an award agreement (or otherwise) that a participant shall be eligible for a full or prorated\naward upon a cessation of the participant’s service relationship due to death, disability, involuntary\ntermination without cause, resignation for good reason or retirement. For an award subject to one or more\nperformance objectives, the Committee may provide for payment of any such full or prorated award prior\nto certification of such performance objectives or without regard to whether they are certified.\nA non-employee director’s cessation of service on the Board of Directors shall not be considered\na termination of the non-employee director’s service relationship if the former non-employee director\ncontinues to provide service to the Company or an affiliate of the Company in another capacity (e.g., as a\nconsultant, employee, or member of an advisory board of the Company or an affiliate of the Company)\nwithout interruption in the non-employee director’s period of service; such service in another capacity\nshall be considered service with the Company or an affiliate of the Company with respect to awards\noutstanding to the former non-employee director. Similarly, an employee’s termination of employment\nwith the Company or an affiliate of the Company shall not be considered a termination of the employee’s\nservice relationship if the former employee continues to provide service to the Company or an affiliate of\nthe Company in another capacity (e.g., as a consultant or non-employee director) without interruption in\nthe employee’s period of service; such service in another capacity shall be considered service with the\nCompany or an affiliate of the Company with respect to awards outstanding to the former employee.\nThe Committee may, in its sole discretion, provide that any time-based vesting requirement\napplicable to an award under the 2022 Equity Incentive Plan shall be deemed satisfied in full in the event\nthat a Change in Control (as defined in the 2022 Equity Incentive Plan) of the Company occurs. With\nrespect to an award that is subject to one or more performance objectives, the Committee may, in its sole\ndiscretion, provide that in the event of a Change in Control, achievement of such performance objective\nshall be determined as of the effective date of the Change in Control or such performance objective shall\nbe deemed achieved at the target level of performance.\n23\nDirector Compensation\nThe following table sets forth the compensation received by non-employee directors for their\nservice on our Board of Directors during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2024.\nFees Earned or Stock Option\nName Paid in Cash Awards (2) Awards (3) Total\nCraig Burton (1) $16,500 $ - $ - $16,500\nD.

Sarubbi 49,500 47,172 31,663 128,335\n(1) Mr. Burton and Mr. Niemczura’s terms as directors expired effective as of November 15, 2023.\n(2) Reflects the grant date aggregate fair value of restricted stock awards granted in 2024 under the Company’s 2022\nEquity Incentive Plan, calculated in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 718 for stock-based compensation. The\namounts were calculated based on the Company’s stock price of $12.44 on the date of grant, which was January 23,\n2024. As of June 30, 2024, each non-employee director held 12,135 shares of unvested restricted stock.\n(3) Reflects the grant date aggregate fair value of stock options granted in 2024 under the Company’s 2022 Equity\nIncentive Plan, calculated in accordance with FASB 718 for stock-based compensation based upon a fair value $3.34\nfor each option using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. For further information on the assumptions used to\ncomputes fair value, see footnote 12 to the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in the Company’s\nAnnual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2024. The actual value, if any, realized by any non-employee\ndirector from any option will depend on the extent to which the market value of the common stock exceeds the\nexercise price of the option on the date the option is exercised. Accordingly, there is no assurance that the value\nrealized by any non-employee director will be at or near the value estimated above. As of June 30, 2024, each non-\nemployee director held 30,336 unvested stock options.\nDirector Board Fees. Each director of the Bank also serves on the Board of Directors of the\nCompany. There is no additional compensation paid for service on the Board of Directors of the\nCompany. Mr. Stephon, who is the only director at this time who is also an employee, is not\ncompensated for his service as a director of the Bank or the Company. Non-employee members of\nthe Board of Directors may elect to defer their Board compensation under the William Penn Bank\nDeferred Compensation Plan. No fees were deferred by directors in fiscal year 2024.\nEach non-employee member of our Board of Directors receives an annual retainer of $33,000\nand an additional annual retainer of $16,500 for their service on our Board committees. Our lead\nindependent director also receives an additional annual retainer of $5,400.\nDeferred Compensation Plan for Directors. The William Penn Bank Deferred Compensation\nPlan for Directors provides non-employee directors with the opportunity to defer all or part of their\nannual compensation. Account balances are credited at a rate equal to the highest rate offered on the\nBank certificates of deposit as of December 31st of each plan year. The earnings rate for the 2024\nplan year was 5.13%. Plan distributions commence on the first day of the first month after the earlier\nof (1) a participant’s death, or (2) the later of (i) a participant’s ceasing for any reason (other than\ndeath) to be a member of the board of directors of William Penn Bank or (ii) a participant reaching\nage 70. The deferred compensation plan is payable either in (1) a lump sum payment, (2) 120 equal\nmonthly payments or (3) equal installments at specified future dates agreed upon by the board and\nthe participant. In the event of death, the payments will be made to a designated beneficiary. The\nparticipant may request a withdrawal under the deferred compensation plan for a severe hardship\nprior to age 70.\n24\nDirectors Consultation and Retirement Plan. The William Penn Bank Directors Consultation\nand Retirement Plan provides retirement benefits to the directors of the Bank. The retirement benefit\nis calculated as the greater of (1) average of the director’s total monthly compensation during the 60\ncalendar months immediately prior to retirement, exclusive of committee fees, or (2) $900, times a\nspecified percentage based on years of service as a director (if less than 10 years of serviceௗ—ௗ0%, 10\nbut less than 15 yearsௗ—ௗ50%, and 15 or more yearsௗ—ௗ100%). In the event Mr. Sarubbi or\nMr. Carmody (each a former director of Audubon Savings Bank), does not have 15 years of service\non the Bank’s Board of Directors as of the date of his retirement after having attained the age of 75,\nthen he shall be deemed to have had 15 years of service as a director for purposes of the plan and be\nentitled to receive a retirement benefit upon his termination of service as a director calculated as if\nhis retirement benefit percentage reflected 15 years of service as of date of his retirement date.\nParticipants are eligible for plan benefits upon attainment of ten years of service as a director.\nPlan benefits are payable for up to 120 months. Upon the death of a participant who is receiving\nbenefit payments under the plan prior to his or her death, the remaining number of benefit payments\nto be made under the plan shall be paid to the beneficiary after the participant’s death. Upon the\ndeath of a participant who is not receiving benefit payments under the plan prior to his or her death,\nthe beneficiary shall receive 120 monthly payments. If a beneficiary dies after the participant but\nprior to receiving all payments under the plan, then the remaining payments will be paid to the\nbeneficiary’s estate in the form of a lump sum payment. As of June 30, 2024, all directors are\nparticipants in the plan.\nUpon a Change in Control of the Bank, if the director experiences a termination of service,\nthen the director shall be presumed to have 15 years of service as of the date of such Change in\nControl and shall receive a lump sum payment equal to the present value of the aggregate payments\nthat would have been due the director. Upon a disability, the director shall be presumed to have\n10 years of service and shall receive benefits on the first day of the calendar month after the\ndisability.\nRecoupment/Clawback Policy\nThe Company maintains a Recoupment/Clawback Policy that is designed to enable the\nCompany to recoup erroneously awarded incentive-based compensation in the event that the\nCompany is required to prepare an accounting restatement. The policy is defined to comply with, and\nto be interpreted in a manner consistent with, Section 10D of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as\namended, SEC Rule 10D-1 and Nasdaq Listing Rule 5608. Under the policy, in the event of an\naccounting restatement due to the Company’s material noncompliance with any financial reporting\nrequirement under the securities laws, including any required accounting restatement to correct a\nmaterial error in previously issued financial statements, or that would result in a material\nmisstatement if the error were corrected in the current period or left uncorrected in the current period,\nthe Company must recoup erroneously awarded incentive-based compensation previously paid to the\nCompany’s executive officers in accordance with the terms of the policy. Furthermore, under the\npolicy, the Company is prohibited from indemnifying any executive officer or former executive\nofficer against the loss of erroneously awarded incentive-based compensation and from paying or\nreimbursing an executive officer for purchasing insurance to cover any such loss.\n25\nSECTION 16(A) BENEFICIAL OWNERSHIP REPORTING COMPLIANCE\nSection 16(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 requires the Company’s executive officers\nand directors, and persons who own more than 10% of any registered class of the Company’s equity\nsecurities, to file reports of ownership and changes in ownership with the Securities and Exchange\nCommission. Executive officers, directors and greater than 10% shareholders are required by regulation\nto furnish the Company with copies of all Section 16(a) reports they file.\nBased solely on its review of the copies of the reports it has received and written representations\nprovided to the Company from the individuals required to file the reports, the Company believes that each\nof its executive officers and directors has complied with applicable reporting requirements for\ntransactions in Company common stock during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2024.\nPOLICIES AND PROCEDURES FOR APPROVAL OF\nRELATED PERSON TRANSACTIONS\nWe maintain a Policy and Procedures Governing Related Person Transactions, which is a written\npolicy and set of procedures for the review and approval or ratification of transactions involving related\npersons. Under the policy, related persons consist of directors, director nominees, executive officers,\npersons or entities known to us to be the beneficial owner of more than five percent of any outstanding\nclass of the voting securities of the Company, or immediate family members or certain affiliated entities\nof any of the foregoing persons.\nTransactions covered by the policy consist of any financial transaction, arrangement or\nrelationship or series of similar transactions, arrangements or relationships, in which:\n the aggregate amount involved will or may be expected to exceed $25,000 in any\ncalendar year;\n the Company is, will, or may be expected to be a participant; and\n any related person has or will have a direct or indirect material interest.\nThe policy excludes certain transactions, including:\n any compensation paid to an executive officer of the Company if the Compensation\nCommittee of the Board approved (or recommended that the Board approve) such\ncompensation;\n any compensation paid to a director of the Company if the Board or an authorized\ncommittee of the Board approved such compensation; and\n any transaction with a related person involving consumer and investor financial products\nand services provided in the ordinary course of the Company’s business and on\nsubstantially the same terms as those prevailing at the time for comparable services\nprovided to unrelated third parties or to the Company’s employees on a broad basis (and,\nin the case of loans, in compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002).\n26\nRelated person transactions will be approved or ratified by the Audit Committee. In determining\nwhether to approve or ratify a related person transaction, the Audit Committee will consider all relevant\nfactors, including:\n whether the terms of the proposed transaction are at least as favorable to the Company as\nthose that might be achieved with an unaffiliated third party;\n the size of the transaction and the amount of consideration payable to the related person;\n the nature of the interest of the related person;\n whether the transaction may involve a conflict of interest; and\n whether the transaction involves the provision of goods and services to the Company that\nare available from unaffiliated third parties.\nA member of the Audit Committee who has an interest in the transaction will abstain from voting\non approval of the transaction, but may, if so requested by the chair of the Audit Committee, participate in\nsome or all of the discussion.\nTRANSACTIONS WITH RELATED PERSONS\nThe Sarbanes-Oxley Act generally prohibits loans by the Bank to its executive officers and\ndirectors. However, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act contains a specific exemption from such prohibition for\nloans by the Bank to its executive officers and directors in compliance with federal banking regulations.\nFederal regulations require that all loans or extensions of credit to executive officers and directors of\ninsured institutions must be made on substantially the same terms, including interest rates and collateral,\nas those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with other persons and must not involve more\nthan the normal risk of repayment or present other unfavorable features. The Bank is therefore prohibited\nfrom making any new loans or extensions of credit to executive officers and directors at different rates or\nterms than those offered to the general public. Notwithstanding this rule, federal regulations permit the\nBank to make loans to executive officers and directors at reduced interest rates if the loan is made under a\nbenefit program generally available to all other employees and does not give preference to any executive\nofficer or director over any other employee.\nIn accordance with banking regulations, the Board of Directors reviews all loans made to a\ndirector or executive officer in an amount that, when aggregated with the amount of all other loans to\nsuch person and his or her related interests, exceed the greater of $25,000 or 5% of the Company’s capital\nand surplus (up to a maximum of $500,000) and such loan must be approved in advance by a majority of\nthe disinterested members of the Board of Directors. Additionally, pursuant to the Company’s Code of\nEthics and Business Conduct, all executive officers and directors of the Company must disclose any\nexisting or emerging conflicts of interest to the President and Chief Executive Officer of the Company.\nSuch potential conflicts of interest include, but are not limited to, the following: (i) the Company\nconducting business with or competing against an organization in which a family member of an executive\nofficer or director has an ownership or employment interest; and (ii) the ownership of more than 1% of\nthe outstanding securities (or that represents more than 5% of the total assets of the employee and/or\nfamily member) of any business entity that does business with or is in competition with the Company.\n27\nThe aggregate amount of loans by the Bank to its executive officers and directors and their\naffiliates was $643,865 at June 30, 2024. As of that date, these loans were performing according to\ntheir original terms.\nOther Transactions. William B.K. Parry, Jr. is President of William B. Parry & Son, Ltd., an\ninsurance agency located in Langhorne, Pennsylvania, and also maintains a 17.8% ownership interest\nin the insurance agency. William Penn Bank has purchased certain insurance policies through\nWilliam B. Parry & Son, Ltd. and, during the year ended June 30, 2024, paid insurance premiums of\n$241,914 to William B. Parry & Son Ltd. (or insurers represented by William B. Parry & Son, Ltd.),\nresulting in insurance commissions of $32,318 for the agency for the year ended June 30, 2024.\nSHAREHOLDER AGREEMENT\nOn August 4, 2020, the Company and the Bank entered into a written agreement with Tyndall\nCapital Partners LP and Jeffrey Halis with respect to certain voting and corporate matters. During the\nterm of the agreement, which expires on August 4, 2025, the Tyndall Capital Parties have agreed to vote\nall shares of Company common stock beneficially owned by the Tyndall Capital Parties in accordance\nwith the recommendations of the Company’s Board of Directors on all proposals at any meeting of the\nCompany’s shareholders. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the shareholder agreement provides that, with\nrespect to any such proposal that requires only a majority of votes cast by Company shareholders to be\napproved (as opposed to a proposal requiring a majority or higher percentage of total shares of common\nstock outstanding), the Tyndall Capital Parties may abstain from voting the shares of Company common\nstock they beneficially own in lieu of voting such shares in accordance with the recommendation of our\nboard of directors with respect to the proposal.\nThe shareholder agreement provides that the Tyndall Capital Parties will not acquire any\nadditional shares of Company common stock (except for shares of Company common stock issued in\nexchange for shares of William Penn Bancorp, Inc. as part of the Company’s second-step conversion and\noffering) during the term of agreement. The agreement further provides that the Tyndall Capital Parties\nmay not, without the prior written consent of the Company and the Bank, knowingly directly or\nindirectly, sell, transfer or otherwise dispose of any block of shares of Company common stock that\nconstitutes, in the aggregate, an amount equal to 5.0% or more of the outstanding shares of William Penn\nBancorp, Inc. held by shareholders other than William Penn, MHC (after giving effect to the final\nexchange ratio for the conversion and offering) immediately prior to the effective time of the Company’s\nsecond-step conversion and offering, unless the purchaser or transferee of such shares agrees in writing\nfor the benefit of the Company and the Bank, prior to such sale or transfer, to be bound by the terms of\nthe shareholder agreement and to be subject to all obligations of the Tyndall Capital Parties to the\nCompany and the Bank under the shareholder agreement for the remaining term of the shareholder\nagreement.\nDuring the term of the shareholder agreement, the Tyndall Capital Parties have also agreed,\namong other things, not to (i) solicit proxies in opposition to any recommendations or proposals of the\nBoard of Directors of the Company, (ii) initiate or solicit shareholder proposals or seek to place any\nrepresentatives on the Board of Directors of the Company, (iii) oppose any proposal or director\nnomination submitted by the Board of Directors of the Company to shareholders, (iv) vote for any\nnominee to the Board of Directors of the Company other than those nominated or supported by the Board\nof Directors, (v) seek to exercise any control or influence over the management of the Company or the\nBank, (vi) propose or seek to effect a merger or sale of the Company or (vii) initiate litigation against the\nCompany or the Bank.\n28\nTyndall Capital Partners LP and Jeffrey Halis previously reported to the Company that they held\n342,817 shares of William Penn Bancorp, Inc. common stock, which was converted into 1,117,069 shares\nof Company common stock based on the 3.2585 exchange ratio for the Company’s second-step\nconversion offering that was completed in March 2021. However, based on a review of Schedule 13D\nand Schedule 13G filings required to be made with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission as of\nthe September 23, 2024 record date, the Company believes that Tyndall Capital Partners LP and Jeffrey\nHalis currently beneficially own less than 5% of the Company’s outstanding shares of common stock.\nSHAREHOLDER PROPOSALS AND NOMINATIONS\nThe Company must receive proposals that shareholders seek to include in the proxy statement for\nthe Company’s next annual meeting no later than June 13, 2025. If next year’s annual meeting is held on\na date more than 30 calendar days from November 20, 2025, a shareholder proposal must be received by a\nreasonable time before the Company begins to print and mail its proxy solicitation for such annual\nmeeting. Any shareholder proposals will be subject to the requirements of the proxy rules adopted by the\nSecurities and Exchange Commission.\nThe Company’s Bylaws provide that a person may not be nominated for election as a director of\nthe Company unless that person is nominated by or at the direction of the Company’s Board of Directors\nor by a shareholder who has given appropriate notice to the Company before the meeting. Similarly, a\nshareholder may not bring business before an annual meeting unless the shareholder has given the\nCompany appropriate notice of their intention to bring that business before the meeting. The Company’s\nsecretary must receive notice of the nomination or proposal not less than 90 days before the annual\nmeeting; provided, however, that if less than 100 days’ notice of prior public disclosure of the date of the\nmeeting is given or made to the shareholders, notice by the shareholder to be timely must be received not\nlater than the close of business on the 10th day following the day on which such notice of the date of the\nannual meeting was mailed or such public disclosure was made. A shareholder who desires to raise new\nbusiness must provide certain information to the Company concerning the nature of the new business, the\nshareholder, the shareholder’s ownership in the Company and the shareholder’s interest in the business\nmatter. Similarly, a shareholder wishing to nominate any person for election as a director must provide\nthe Company with certain information concerning the nominee and the proposing shareholder. A copy of\nthe Company’s Bylaws may be obtained from the Company.\nIn addition to satisfying the deadlines in the notice provisions of the Company’s Bylaws, a\nshareholder who intends to solicit proxies in support of nominees submitted under the Bylaws’ provisions\nmust provide the notice required under Rule 14a-19, the SEC’s universal proxy rule, to the Company’s\nCorporate Secretary no later than September 21, 2025, subject to certain exceptions described in the rule.\nSHAREHOLDER COMMUNICATIONS\nThe Company encourages shareholder communications to the Board of Directors and/or\nindividual directors. Shareholders who wish to communicate with the Board of Directors or an individual\ndirector should send their communications to the care of Jonathan T. Logan, Corporate Secretary,\nWilliam Penn Bancorporation, 10 Canal Street, Suite 104, Bristol, Pennsylvania 19007. Communications\nregarding financial or accounting policies should be sent to the attention of the Chairperson of the Audit\nCommittee. All other communications should be sent to the attention of the Chairperson of the\nNominating and Corporate Governance Committee.\n29\nMISCELLANEOUS\nThe Company will pay the cost of this proxy solicitation. The Company will reimburse\nbrokerage firms and other custodians, nominees and fiduciaries for reasonable expenses incurred by them\nin sending proxy materials to the beneficial owners of the Company. In addition to soliciting proxies by\nmail, directors, officers and regular employees of the Company may solicit proxies personally or by\ntelephone. None of these persons will receive additional compensation for these activities.\nFor our 2024 annual meeting, to save significant printing and mailing expenses, the Company is\nfurnishing its proxy statement and annual report via the Internet according to the SEC rules for “notice\nand access” delivery. On October 11, 2024, the Company mailed the Notice to all shareholders, who had\nnot previously elected to receive their proxy materials by mail or electronically, containing instructions on\nhow to access this proxy statement and our Annual Report on Form 10-K and how to vote online. Upon\nreceipt of the Notice, shareholders may choose to request a printed copy of proxy materials at no charge,\nand this preference will be maintained for future mailings.\nTo further reduce costs, if you and others who share your address own your shares in “street\nname,” your broker or other holder of record may be sending only one Annual Report on Form 10-K and\nproxy statement to your address. This practice, known as “householding,” is designed to reduce our\nprinting and postage costs. However, if a shareholder residing at such an address wishes to receive a\nseparate Annual Report on Form 10-K or proxy statement in the future, he or she should contact the\nbroker or other holder of record. If you own your shares in “street name” and are receiving multiple\ncopies of our Annual Report on Form 10-K and proxy statement, you can request householding by\ncontacting your broker or other holder of record.\n30"

BUSINESS\nOUR BUSINESS\nWilliam Penn Bancorporation (“the Company”) is a Maryland corporation that was incorporated in July 2020 to be the successor to\nWilliam Penn Bancorp, Inc. (“William Penn Bancorp”) upon completion of the second-step conversion of William Penn Bank (the\n“Bank”) from the mutual holding company structure to the stock holding company structure. William Penn, MHC was the former mutual\nholding company for William Penn Bancorp prior to completion of the second-step conversion. In conjunction with the second-step\nconversion, each of William Penn, MHC and William Penn Bancorp ceased to exist. The second-step conversion was completed on\nMarch 24, 2021, at which time the Company sold, for gross proceeds of $126.4 million, a total of 12,640,035 shares of common stock\nat $10.00 per share. As part of the second-step conversion, each of the existing 776,647 outstanding shares of William Penn Bancorp\ncommon stock owned by persons other than William Penn, MHC was converted into 3.2585 shares of Company common stock. In\naddition, $5.4 million of cash held by William Penn, MHC was transferred to the Company and recorded as an increase to additional\npaid-in capital following the completion of the second-step conversion.\nThe consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company, and its wholly owned subsidiary, the Bank, as well as the\nBank’s wholly owned subsidiary, WPSLA Investment Corporation (“WPSLA”). WPSLA is a Delaware corporation organized in April\n2000 to hold certain investment securities for the Bank. The Company owns 100% of the outstanding common stock of the Bank, a\nPennsylvania chartered stock savings bank. The Bank offers consumer and commercial banking services to individuals, businesses, and\nnonprofit organizations throughout the Delaware Valley area through twelve full-service branch offices in Bucks and Philadelphia\nCounties in Pennsylvania, and Burlington, Camden, and Mercer Counties in New Jersey. The Company is subject to regulation and\nsupervision by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. The Bank is supervised and regulated by the Federal Deposit\nInsurance Corporation (“FDIC”) and the Pennsylvania Department of Banking and Securities.\nThe Bank’s principal business consists of originating one- to four-family residential real estate mortgage loans, home equity lines of\ncredit, construction residential, one- to four-family investor commercial real estate, non-residential real estate, multi-family and\nconstruction and land loans. We offer a variety of retail deposits to the general public in the areas surrounding our main office and our\nbranch offices. We offer our customers a variety of deposit products with interest rates that are competitive with those of similar products\noffered by other financial institutions operating in our market area. We also utilize borrowings as a source of funds. Our revenues are\nderived primarily from interest on loans and, to a lesser extent, interest on investment securities. We also generate revenues from other\nincome including deposit fees and service charges, realized gains on sales of securities, gains on the sale on the disposition of premises\nand equipment, earnings on bank-owned life insurance, unrealized gains on equity securities, and other income.\nAcquisition History\nOn July 1, 2018, we acquired Audubon Savings Bank (“Audubon”), a New Jersey-chartered mutual savings association headquartered\nin Audubon, New Jersey and with two additional branch offices located in Mount Laurel and Pine Hill, New Jersey. The acquisition of\nAudubon enhanced our market share in Burlington and Camden Counties in New Jersey, and provided the Bank with a physical presence\nin Southern New Jersey.\nOn May 1, 2020, we acquired both (i) Fidelity Savings and Loan Association of Bucks County (“Fidelity”), a Pennsylvania-chartered\nmutual savings bank headquartered in Bristol, Pennsylvania and with a branch office located in Bristol Pennsylvania, and (ii)\nWashington Savings Bank (“Washington”), a Pennsylvania-chartered mutual savings bank headquartered in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania\nand with three additional branch offices located in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. The acquisitions of Fidelity and Washington further\nincreased our market presence in our existing market area.\nMarket Area\nWe are headquartered in Bristol, Pennsylvania and currently operate twelve full-service branch offices in Bucks and Philadelphia\nCounties in Pennsylvania, and in Burlington, Camden, and Mercer Counties in New Jersey. We periodically evaluate our network of\nbanking offices to optimize the penetration in our market area.\nWe consider our primary market area to be the Philadelphia suburbs of central and lower Bucks County and Northeast Philadelphia in\nPennsylvania and the New Jersey counties of Burlington, Camden, Gloucester, and Mercer. This area has historically benefitted from\nhaving a large number of corporate headquarters located within it. The area benefits from having a well-educated employment base and\n3\nthe diversity provided by a large number of industrial, service, retail and high technology businesses. Other employment is provided by\na variety of wholesale trade, manufacturing, federal, state and local governments, hospitals and utilities.\nAccording to the U.S. Census Bureau, as of July 1, 2022, (i) Bucks County had an estimated population of 645,984, representing a 0.1%\ndecrease from April 1, 2020, and a median household income of $107,826 and (ii) Philadelphia County had an estimated population of\n1.6 million, representing a 3.3% decrease from April 1, 2020, and a median household income of $57,537. In addition, (i) Burlington\nCounty had an estimated population of 469,167, representing a 1.6% increase from April 1, 2020, and a median household income of\n$102,615, (ii) Camden County had an estimated population of 527,196, representing a 0.7% increase from April 1, 2020, and a median\nhousehold income of $82,005, (iii) Gloucester County had an estimated population of 308,423, representing a 2.0% increase from April\n1, 2020, and a median household income of $99,668 and (iv) Mercer County had an estimated population of 381,671, representing a\n1.5% decrease from April 1, 2020, and a median household income of $92,697. As of July 1, 2022, the median household income in the\nUnited States was $75,149.\nAs of June 2024, the unemployment rate in Bucks and Philadelphia Counties totaled 3.2% and 4.7%, respectively, and the unemployment\nrate in Burlington, Camden, Gloucester, and Mercer Counties totaled 4.2%, 5.1%, 4.6%, and 4.4%, respectively, as compared to a\nnational unemployment rate of 4.3% for June 2024.\nCompetition\nWe face significant competition for the attraction of deposits and origination of loans. Our most direct competition for deposits and\nloans has historically come from the numerous national, regional and local community financial institutions operating in our market\narea, including a number of independent banks and credit unions, in addition to other financial service companies, such as brokerage\nfirms, mortgage companies and mortgage brokers. In addition, we face competition for investors’ funds from money market funds and\nother corporate and government securities. Competition for loans also comes from the increasing number of non-depository financial\nservice companies entering the mortgage and consumer credit market, such as financial technology companies, securities companies\nand specialty finance companies. We believe that our long-standing presence in Bucks County, Southern and Central New Jersey, and\nNortheast Philadelphia, and our personal service philosophy enhance our ability to compete favorably in attracting and retaining\nindividual and business customers. We actively solicit deposit-related customers and compete for deposits by offering customers\npersonal attention, professional service and competitive interest rates.\nLending Activities\nOur loan portfolio consists primarily of one- to four-family residential mortgage loans, one- to four-family investor commercial real\nestate loans, and commercial non-residential real estate loans. Our loan portfolio also includes multi-family residential loans, home\nequity loans and lines of credit, residential construction, commercial business, commercial construction and land and consumer loans.\nSubstantially all of our loans are secured by properties located within our local markets.\nOne- to Four-Family Residential Loans. One of our primary lending activities is the origination of mortgage loans to enable borrowers\nto purchase or refinance existing homes in our market area. Such loans totaled $127.9 million, or 27.0% of our total loan portfolio, at\nJune 30, 2024.\nWe offer fixed-rate and adjustable-rate mortgage loans with terms up to 30 years. Borrower demand for adjustable-rate loans rather than\nfixed-rate loans is a function of the level of interest rates, the expectations of changes in the level of interest rates, the difference between\nthe interest rates and loan fees offered for fixed-rate mortgage loans and the initial period interest rates and loan fees for adjustable-rate\nloans. The relative amount of fixed-rate mortgage loans (as opposed to adjustable interest rates) and adjustable-rate mortgage loans that\ncan be originated or purchased at any time is largely determined by the demand for each in a competitive environment and the effect\neach has on our interest rate risk. The loan fees charged, interest rates, and other provisions of mortgage loans are determined by us on\nthe basis of our own pricing criteria and competitive market conditions.\nWe offer fixed-rate loans with terms of either 10, 15, 20 or up to 30 years. Our adjustable-rate mortgage loans are also based on a 10,\n15, 20 or up to 30 year amortization schedule. Interest rates and payments on our adjustable-rate mortgage loans adjust every three, five,\nseven or ten years. Interest rates and payments on our adjustable-rate loans generally are adjusted to a rate that is based on the respective\nthree, five, seven or ten year monthly Constant Maturity U.S. Treasury indices.\nThroughout the low interest rate environment that extended through 2021, borrowers generally preferred fixed-rate loans. However,\ndue to the recent rise in interest rate levels in 2022 and 2023, borrowers generally currently prefer our adjustable-rate loan products. We\nanticipate that an increase in adjustable-rate loans would allow us to better offset the adverse effects on our net interest income of an\n4\nincrease in interest rates as compared to fixed-rate mortgages. The increased mortgage payments required under adjustable-rate loans in\na rising interest rate environment, however, could cause an increase in delinquencies and defaults. The marketability of the underlying\nproperty also may be adversely affected in a high interest rate environment. In addition, although adjustable-rate mortgage loans help\nmake our asset base more responsive to changes in interest rates, the extent of this interest rate sensitivity is limited by the annual and\nlifetime interest rate adjustment limits.\nWhile one- to four-family residential real estate loans are normally originated with up to 30-year terms, such loans typically remain\noutstanding for substantially shorter periods because borrowers often prepay their loans in full upon sale of the property pledged as\nsecurity or upon refinancing the original loan. Therefore, average loan maturity is a function of, among other factors, the level of\npurchase and sale activity in the real estate market, prevailing interest rates and the interest rates payable on outstanding loans.\nWe do not make conventional loans with loan-to-value ratios exceeding 95% and generally limit loan-to-value ratios on our conventional\nloans to 80%. Loans with loan-to-value ratios in excess of 80% generally require private mortgage insurance, a government guarantee\nor additional collateral. We require all properties securing mortgage loans to be appraised by licensed independent appraisers from\nappraisal management companies approved by our board of directors. We require title insurance on all first mortgage loans. Borrowers\nmust obtain hazard insurance and/or flood insurance for loans on property located in a flood zone, before closing the loan.\nOur largest one- to four-family residential loan at June 30, 2024 was for $1.4 million and is secured by a single-family residence located\nin Mercer County in New Jersey. This loan is performing in accordance with its terms.\nOne- to Four-Family Investor Commercial Real Estate Loans. One of our other primary lending activities is the origination of loans\nsecured by non-owner occupied one- to four-family residential properties. These borrowers generally include individuals that purchase\nan investment property to generate rental income. Such loans totaled $92.3 million, or 19.5% of our total loan portfolio, at June 30,\n2024.\nWe offer fixed-rate and adjustable-rate non-owner occupied one- to four-family commercial real estate loans with terms up to 25 years.\nBorrower demand for adjustable-rate loans rather than fixed-rate loans is a function of the level of interest rates, the expectations of\nchanges in the level of interest rates, the difference between the interest rates and loan fees offered for fixed-rate mortgage loans and the\ninitial period interest rates and loan fees for adjustable-rate loans. The relative amount of fixed-rate mortgage loans (as opposed to\nadjustable interest rates) and adjustable-rate mortgage loans that can be originated or purchased at any time is largely determined by the\ndemand for each in a competitive environment and the effect each has on our interest rate risk. The loan fees charged, interest rates, and\nother provisions of mortgage loans are determined by us on the basis of our own pricing criteria and competitive market conditions.\nWe offer fixed-rate loans with terms of either 10, 15, 20 or up to 25 years. Our adjustable-rate mortgage loans are also based on a 10,\n15, 20 or up to 25 year amortization schedule. Interest rates and payments on our adjustable-rate mortgage loans adjust every three, five,\nseven or ten years. Interest rates and payments on our adjustable-rate loans generally are adjusted to a rate that is based on the respective\nthree, five, seven or ten year monthly Constant Maturity U.S. Treasury indexes.\nThroughout the low interest rate environment that extended through 2021, borrowers generally preferred fixed-rate loans. However,\ndue to the recent rise in interest rate levels in 2022 and 2023, borrowers generally currently prefer our adjustable-rate loan products. We\nanticipate that adjustable-rate loans would allow us to better offset the adverse effects on our net interest income of an increase in interest\nrates as compared to fixed-rate mortgages. The increased mortgage payments required under adjustable-rate loans in a rising interest\nrate environment, however, could cause an increase in delinquencies and defaults. The marketability of the underlying property also\nmay be adversely affected in a high interest rate environment. In addition, although adjustable-rate mortgage loans help make our asset\nbase more responsive to changes in interest rates, the extent of this interest rate sensitivity is limited by the annual and lifetime interest\nrate adjustment limits.\nWhile non-owner occupied one- to four-family commercial real estate loans are normally originated with up to 25-year terms, such loans\ntypically remain outstanding for substantially shorter periods because borrowers often prepay their loans in full upon sale of the property\npledged as security or upon refinancing the original loan. Therefore, average loan maturity is a function of, among other factors, the\nlevel of purchase and sale activity in the real estate market, prevailing interest rates and the interest rates payable on outstanding loans.\n5\nLoans secured by non-owner occupied properties generally expose a lender to greater risk of non-payment and loss than loans secured\nby owner occupied properties because repayment of such loans depend primarily on the tenant’s continuing ability to pay rent to the\nproperty owner, who is our borrower, or, if the property owner is unable to find a tenant, the property owner’s ability to repay the loan\nwithout the benefit of a rental income stream. In reaching a decision on whether to originate a non-owner occupied one- to four-family\nresidential real estate loan, we consider the net operating income of the property, the borrower’s credit history and profitability, and the\nvalue of the underlying property.\nOur largest one- to four-family investor commercial real estate loan at June 30, 2024 was for $5.4 million and is secured by fifty-five\nsingle-family and multi-family properties located in southern New Jersey. This loan is performing in accordance with its terms.\nNon-Residential Real Estate and Multi-Family Loans. Another one of our other primary lending activities is the origination of fixed\nrate and adjustable-rate mortgage loans secured by commercial real estate, multi-family residential real estate and land. Our non-\nresidential and multi-family real estate loans are generally secured by office buildings, retail and mixed-use properties, condominiums,\napartment buildings, single-family subdivisions and owner-occupied properties used for businesses. At June 30, 2024, our commercial\nand multi-family real estate loan portfolio totaled $174.1 million, or 36.7% of our total loan portfolio, and commercial real estate loans\nsecured by office space totaled $10.8 million, or 2.3% of our total loan portfolio.\nWe originate multi-family and non-residential real estate loans with terms generally up to 25 years. Interest rates and payments on\nadjustable-rate loans adjust every one, three, five and ten years. Interest rates and payments on our adjustable-rate loans generally are\nadjusted to a rate typically equal to the interest rate used for one-to four-family loan products, plus a spread based on creditworthiness\nand risk. Loan amounts generally do not exceed 80% of the appraised value for well-qualified borrowers.\nLoans secured by multi-family residential and non-residential real estate generally have larger balances and involve a greater degree of\nrisk than one- to four-family residential mortgage loans. Of primary concern in multi-family residential and non-residential real estate\nlending is the borrower’s creditworthiness and the feasibility and cash flow potential of the project. Payments on loans secured by\nincome producing properties often depend on successful operation and management of the properties. As a result, repayment of such\nloans may be subject, to a greater extent than residential real estate loans, to adverse conditions in the real estate market or the economy.\nIn reaching a decision on whether to make a multi-family residential or non-residential real estate loan, we consider the net operating\nincome of the property, the borrower’s expertise, credit history and profitability, and the value of the underlying property.\nNon-residential real estate loans include shared national credits, which are participations in loans or loan commitments of at least $20.0\nmillion that are shared by three or more banks. Shared national credit loans are typically variable rate with terms ranging from one to\nseven years. As of June 30, 2023, the Company had one shared national credit loan commitment for $12.5 million with no balance\noutstanding that was a purchased participation classified as pass rated and all payments were current, and the loan was performing in\naccordance with its contractual terms. This shared national credit loan commitment was closed during the three months ended December\n31, 2023.\nOur largest non-residential real estate loan at June 30, 2024 was for $12.5 million, of which $10.9 million was disbursed and outstanding.\nThis loan is secured by a shopping center located in Mercer County in New Jersey and is performing in accordance with its terms.\nHome Equity Loans and Lines of Credit. We offer home equity loans and lines of credit, which have adjustable rates of interest that\nare indexed to the prime rate as published in The Wall Street Journal for terms of up to 20 years. These loans are originated with\nmaximum loan-to-value ratios of 80% of the appraised value of the property, and we require that we have a second lien position on the\nproperty. We also offer secured and unsecured lines of credit for well-qualified individuals and small businesses. Management includes\nthese loans based on the collateral supporting the line of credit in either the non-residential, multi-family, commercial or one-to-four\nfamily categories for the purposes of monitoring and evaluating the portfolio. At June 30, 2024, such loans totaled $30.8 million, or\n6.5% of our total loan portfolio.\nResidential and Commercial Construction Loans and Land Loans. We originate (i) residential construction loans to individuals that\nfinance the construction of owner-occupied residential dwellings for personal use, which we classify within our residential real estate\nloan portfolio, (ii) commercial construction loans for the development of projects including non-owner occupied residential dwellings,\ncondominiums, apartment buildings, single-family subdivisions, single-family investor loans, as well as owner-occupied properties used\nfor business, which we classify within our commercial real estate loan portfolio and (iii) commercial land loans for the purchase and\ndevelopment of raw land.\nOur residential construction loans generally provide for the payment of interest only during the construction phase, which can be up to\n18 months. We also require periodic inspections of the property during the term of the construction. At the end of the construction phase,\n6\nsubstantially all of our loans automatically convert to permanent mortgage loans. Construction loans generally can be made with a\nmaximum loan to value ratio of 80% of the appraised value with maximum terms of 30 years. Our residential construction loans totaled\n$8.8 million, or 1.9% of our total loan portfolio, at June 30, 2024. At June 30, 2024, our largest outstanding residential construction loan\nwas for $2.6 million, of which $1.7 million was disbursed and outstanding, and related to the construction of residential housing located\nin Monmouth County in New Jersey. This loan is performing in accordance with its terms.\nOur construction loans may include loans for the development of real estate for a variety of projects and properties. Generally, the\nowner’s equity must be injected upfront prior to the Bank advancing funds. Interest rates for the construction projects will generally be\nvariable with a lifetime floor, but may be fixed if approved by the appropriate lending authority. Generally, our commercial construction\nloans provide for payment of interest only during the construction phase and may, in the case of an apartment or commercial building,\nconvert to a permanent mortgage loan upon the completion of construction. In the case of a single-family subdivision or construction or\nbuilder loan, as individual lots are sold, the principal balance is reduced by agreed upon release prices at the outset of the loan sufficient\nto liquidate the loan prior to the final sale. In the case of a commercial construction loan, the construction period may be from nine\nmonths to three years. Construction loans are generally made with a maximum of 75% loan-to-value, a maximum 75% loan-to-cost, and\na requirement that guarantors own over 10% of the collateral underlying the loan. We also require periodic inspections of the property\nduring the term of the construction loan. The Bank requires a minimum debt service coverage ratio of 1.25X on a stand-alone basis\nupon conversion to permanent financing.\nRaw land loans are done as an exception to policy to accommodate high quality borrowers who demonstrate strong liquidity positions,\nhigh income, and high net worth. The Bank only extends credit on raw land loans when the extension of credit can be repaid from the\npersonal income of the borrower/guarantor. Raw land loans are generally made with a maximum of 60% loan-to-value and a maximum\n60% loan-to-cost. Approved land loans are generally made with a maximum of 65% loan-to-value and a maximum 65% loan-to-cost.\nGenerally, land loans have a maximum term of two years and require guarantors that own over 10% of the collateral underlying the\nloan. In addition, the land loans in our portfolio are adjustable-rate loans with adjustments occurring every three and five years, based\non the original contract. Interest rate adjustments are based on the Constant Maturity U.S. Treasury indexes plus a spread. Our adjustable-\nrate land loans in generally have an interest rate floor.\nOur commercial construction and land loans totaled $22.7 million, or 4.8% of our total loan portfolio, at June 30, 2024 and were\ncomprised of $20.7 million in commercial construction loans and $2.0 million in land loans at that date. At June 30, 2024, our largest\noutstanding commercial construction and land loan was a commercial land loan for $10.5 million for a commercial development project\nin Somerset County in New Jersey. This loan is performing in accordance with its terms.\nCommercial Business Loans. These loans consist of operating lines of credit secured by general business assets and equipment. The\noperating lines of credit are generally short term in nature with interest rates tied to short-term rates and adjustments occurring daily,\nmonthly, or quarterly based on the original contract. For adjustable loans, there is also an interest rate floor. The equipment loans are\ntypically made with maturities of less than five years and are priced with a fixed interest rate. Longer repayments of up to 15 years can\nbe made depending on the useful life of the equipment being financed. Generally, rates are fixed for not longer than five years and will\nreset, generally based on the Constant Maturity U.S. Treasury indexes plus a spread, if the amortization or maturity of the loan is longer.\nAt June 30, 2024, such loans totaled $15.1 million, or 3.2% of our total loan portfolio. At June 30, 2024, our largest outstanding\ncommercial business loan was for $5.0 million, of which $4.9 million was disbursed and outstanding, for the commercial headquarters\nof an office furniture manufacturer located in Pennsauken Township, New Jersey. This loan is performing in accordance with its terms.\nConsumer Loans. In the past, we have offered a variety of consumer loans, which include student, automobile and personal secured\nand unsecured loans to our customer base. However, we no longer offer student or automobile loans to customers. At June 30, 2024,\nconsumer loans totaled $1.9 million, or 0.4% of our total loan portfolio.\nConsumer loans may entail greater risk than do residential mortgage loans, particularly in the case of consumer loans that are unsecured\nor secured by assets that depreciate rapidly. In such cases, repossessed collateral for a defaulted consumer loan may not provide an\nadequate source of repayment for the outstanding loan and the remaining deficiency often does not warrant further substantial collection\nefforts against the borrower. In addition, consumer loan collections depend on the borrower’s continuing financial stability, and therefore\nare more likely to be adversely affected by job loss, divorce, illness, or personal bankruptcy. Furthermore, the application of various\nfederal and state laws, including federal and state bankruptcy and insolvency laws may limit the amount which can be recovered on such\nloans.\nLoan Origination, Purchases and Sales. Loan originations come from a number of sources. The primary source of loan originations\nare our in-house loan originators, and to a lesser extent, advertising and referrals from customers and local realtors. Historically, we\nhave primarily originated our own loans and retained them in our portfolio. However, we also occasionally purchase loans or\n7\nparticipation interests in loans. As of June 30, 2024, we had an aggregate of $13.3 million in purchased loan participations outstanding.\nLoan participations are subject to the same credit analysis and approvals as loans we originate. We are permitted to review all of the\ndocumentation relating to any loan in which we participate. However, for participation loans, we do not service the loan and, thus, are\nsubject to the policies and procedures of the lead lender with regard to monitoring delinquencies, pursuing collections and instituting\nforeclosure proceedings.\nWe also occasionally sell some of the longer-term fixed-rate one-to-four family mortgage loans that we originate in the secondary market\nbased on prevailing market interest rate conditions, an analysis of the composition and risk of the loan portfolio, liquidity needs and\ninterest rate risk management goals. Generally, loans are sold with recourse and with servicing retained. We did not sell any loans during\nthe years ended June 30, 2024 and 2023. We occasionally sell participation interests in loans and may sell loan participations in the\nfuture.\nLoan Approval Procedures and Authority. Our lending activities follow written, non-discriminatory underwriting standards and loan\norigination procedures established by our board of directors and management.\nWith respect to residential and consumer loans, loans with a total loan commitment of less than $250,000 may be approved by the loan’s\nresidential underwriter, as well as one of the following individuals: the Assistant Vice President of Residential Lending and the Vice\nPresident of Residential Lending. Loans with a total loan commitment of between $250,000 to $1,000,000 must be approved by (i) the\nAssistant Vice President of Residential Lending or the Vice President of Residential Lending, and (ii) either our Director of Loan\nServicing, Chief Retail Officer, Chief Lending Officer or Chief Executive Officer. Loans with a total loan commitment of between\n$1,000,000 and $2,000,000 must be approved by a majority vote from our Officers’ Loan Committee, which consists of our Chief\nExecutive Officer, Chief Lending Officer, Chief Financial Officer, Chief Operating Officer, Chief Retail Officer, and Director of Loan\nServicing. Loans with a total loan commitment in excess of $2,000,000, and up to our legal lending limit, must be approved by majority\nvote from our Directors’ Loan Committee, which consists of our entire board of directors.\nWith respect to commercial loans, loans with a total loan commitment of up to $1,000,000 (and unsecured lines or letters of credit with\ntotal loan commitments of up to $500,000) may be approved by the originating loan officer as well as either our Chief Lending Officer\nor Chief Executive Officer. Loans with a total loan commitment of between $1,000,000 and $5,000,000 (and unsecured lines or letters\nof credit with total loan commitments of between $500,000 and $4,000,000) must generally be approved by majority vote from our\nOfficers’ Loan Committee, and loans with a total loan commitment in excess of $5,000,000 (or $4,000,000 for unsecured lines or letters\nof credit) must be approved by a majority vote from our Directors’ Loan Committee.\nLoans to One Borrower. The maximum amount that we may lend to one borrower and the borrower’s related entities is limited by\nstatute to generally 15% of our stated capital and reserves. At June 30, 2024, our regulatory lending maximum was $18.2 million. The\nBank’s internal lending limits are lower than the levels permitted by regulation and at June 30, 2024, the total exposure with our largest\nlending relationship was $12.9 million, which is the total amount outstanding and committed for three commercial construction loans.\nLoan Commitments. We issue commitments for fixed-rate and adjustable-rate mortgage loans conditioned upon the occurrence of\ncertain events. Commitments to originate mortgage loans are legally binding agreements to lend to our customers and generally expire\nin 30 days.\nDelinquencies. When a borrower fails to make a required loan payment, we take a number of steps to have the borrower cure the\ndelinquency and restore the loan to current status. We generally make initial contact with the borrower when the loan becomes ten to\nfifteen days past due. Generally, if payment is not received by the 30th day of delinquency, additional letters are sent and phone calls\ngenerally are made to the customer. When the loan becomes 120 days past due, we generally commence foreclosure proceedings against\nany real property that secures the loan or attempt to repossess any personal property that secures a consumer loan. If a foreclosure action\nis instituted and the loan is not brought current, paid in full, or refinanced before the foreclosure sale, the real property securing the loan\ngenerally is sold at foreclosure. We may consider loan workout arrangements with certain borrowers under certain circumstances.\nManagement informs the board of directors on a monthly basis of the amount of loans delinquent more than 30 days, all loans in\nforeclosure and all foreclosed and repossessed property that we own.\nInvestment Activities\nWe have legal authority to invest in various types of liquid assets, including, but not limited to, mortgage-backed securities, securities\nof various federal agencies and of state and municipal governments, subordinated debt and certificates of deposit of federally insured\ninstitutions. At June 30, 2024, our investment portfolio consisted primarily of mortgage-backed securities issued by Fannie Mae, Freddie\n8\nMac or Gennie Mae with stated final maturities of 30 years or less, municipal securities with maturities of 20 years or less, corporate\nbonds, and preferred stock.\nOur investment objectives are to provide and maintain liquidity, to maintain a balance of high quality, diversified investments to\nminimize risk, to provide collateral for pledging requirements, to establish an acceptable level of interest rate risk, to provide an alternate\nsource of low-risk investments when demand for loans is weak and to generate a favorable return. Our board of directors has the overall\nresponsibility for our investment portfolio, including approval of our investment policy. Our Chief Operating Officer is the designated\ninvestment officer and is responsible for the daily investment activities and is authorized to make investment decisions consistent with\nour investment policy.\nDeposit Activities and Other Sources of Funds\nGeneral. Deposits and loan repayments are the major sources of our funds for lending and other investment activities. Loan repayments\nare a relatively stable source of funds, while deposit inflows and outflows and loan prepayments are significantly influenced by general\ninterest rates and market conditions.\nDeposit Accounts. The vast majority of our depositors are residents of Southeastern Pennsylvania and Southern and Central New Jersey.\nDeposits are raised primarily from within our primary market area through the offering of a broad selection of deposit instruments,\nincluding checking accounts, money market accounts, regular savings accounts, club savings accounts, certificate accounts and various\nretirement accounts. Deposit account terms vary according to the minimum balance required, the time periods the funds must remain on\ndeposit, and the interest rate among other factors. In determining the terms of our deposit accounts, we consider the rates offered by our\ncompetition, profitability to us, matching deposit and loan products and customer preferences and concerns. We generally review our\ndeposit mix and pricing weekly. Our current strategy is to offer competitive rates, but not be the market leader in every type and maturity.\nBorrowings. If necessary, we borrow from the Federal Home Loan Bank (“FHLB”) of Pittsburgh to supplement our supply of lendable\nfunds and to meet deposit withdrawal requirements. The FHLB functions as a central reserve bank providing credit for member financial\ninstitutions. As a member, we are required to own capital stock in the FHLB of Pittsburgh and are authorized to apply for advances on\nthe security of such stock and certain of our mortgage loans and other assets (principally securities that are obligations of, or guaranteed\nby, the United States), provided certain standards related to credit-worthiness have been met. Advances are made under several different\nprograms, each having its own interest rate and range of maturities. Depending on the program, limitations on the amount of advances\nare based either on a fixed percentage of an institution’s net worth or on the FHLB assessment of the institution’s creditworthiness.\nUnder its current credit policies, the FHLB generally limits advances to 25% of a member’s assets, and short-term borrowings of less\nthan one year may not exceed 10% of the institution’s assets. The FHLB determines specific lines of credit for each member institution.\nThere were $48.0 million of FHLB advances outstanding at June 30, 2024. At June 30, 2024, we had the ability to borrow an additional\n$234.0 million from the Federal Home Loan Bank of Pittsburgh. In addition, as of June 30, 2024, we had $10.0 million of available\ncredit from Atlantic Community Bankers Bank to purchase federal funds and we had $3.6 million of available credit from the Federal\nReserve Bank.\nPersonnel\nAt June 30, 2024, we had 90 full-time employees and two part-time employees, none of whom is represented by a collective bargaining\nunit. We believe our relationship with our employees is good.\nSubsidiaries\nThe Company’s only direct subsidiary is the Bank. The Bank has one wholly owned subsidiary, WPSLA. WPSLA is a Delaware\ncorporation organized in April 2000 to hold certain investment securities for the Bank. At June 30, 2024, WPSLA held $235.4 million\nof the Bank’s $243.8 million securities portfolio.\nREGULATION AND SUPERVISION\nGeneral\nThe Bank is a Pennsylvania-chartered stock savings bank. The Bank’s deposits are insured up to applicable limits by the Federal Deposit\nInsurance Corporation (“FDIC”). The Bank is subject to extensive regulation by the Pennsylvania Department of Banking and Securities,\nas its chartering agency, and by the FDIC, as its primary federal regulator. The Bank is required to file reports with, and is periodically\nexamined by, the FDIC and the Pennsylvania Department of Banking and Securities, concerning its activities and financial condition\n9\nand must obtain regulatory approvals prior to entering into certain transactions, including, but not limited to, mergers with or acquisitions\nof other financial institutions. The Bank is a member of the FHLB of Pittsburgh.\nThe regulation and supervision of the Bank establish a comprehensive framework of activities in which an institution can engage and is\nintended primarily for the protection of depositors and borrowers and, for purposes of the FDIC, the protection of the insurance fund.\nThe regulatory structure also gives the regulatory authorities extensive discretion in connection with their supervisory and enforcement\nactivities and examination policies, including policies with respect to the classification of assets and the establishment of adequate credit\nloss reserves for regulatory purposes.\nAs a bank holding company, the Company must comply with the rules and regulations of the Federal Reserve Board and file certain\nreports with the Federal Reserve Board and is subject to examination by and the enforcement authority of the Federal Reserve Board.\nThe Company is also subject to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission under the federal securities laws.\nAny change in applicable laws or regulations, whether by the Pennsylvania Department of Banking and Securities, the FDIC, the Federal\nReserve Board, the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania or Congress, could have a material adverse impact on the operations and financial\nperformance of the Company and the Bank. In addition, the Company and the Bank will be affected by the monetary and fiscal policies\nof various agencies of the United States Government, including the Federal Reserve Board. In view of changing conditions in the\nnational economy and in the money markets, it is impossible for management to accurately predict future changes in monetary policy\nor the effect of such changes on the business or financial condition of the Company and the Bank.\nSet forth below is a brief description of material regulatory requirements that are or will be applicable to the Company and the Bank.\nThe description is limited to certain material aspects of the statutes and regulations addressed, and is not intended to be a complete\ndescription of such statutes and regulations and their effects on the Company and the Bank.\nBank Regulation\nPennsylvania Savings Bank Law. The Pennsylvania Banking Code of 1965, as amended, contains detailed provisions governing the\norganization, location of offices, rights and responsibilities of directors, officers and employees, as well as corporate powers, savings\nand investment operations and other aspects of the Bank and its affairs. The Pennsylvania Banking Code delegates extensive rule-\nmaking power and administrative discretion to the Pennsylvania Department of Banking and Securities so that the supervision and\nregulation of state-chartered savings banks may be flexible and readily responsive to changes in economic conditions and in savings and\nlending practices. Specifically, under the Pennsylvania Banking Code, the Pennsylvania Department of Banking and Securities is given\nthe authority to exercise such supervision over state-chartered savings banks as to afford the greatest safety to creditors, stockholders\nand depositors, ensure business safety and soundness, conserve assets, protect the public interest and maintain public confidence in such\ninstitutions.\nThe Pennsylvania Banking Code provides, among other powers, that state-chartered savings banks may engage in any activity\npermissible for a national banking association or federal savings association, subject to regulation by the Pennsylvania Department of\nBanking and Securities (which shall not be more restrictive than the regulation imposed upon a national banking association or federal\nsavings association, respectively). Before it engages in an activity allowable for a national banking association or federal savings\nassociation, a state-chartered savings bank must either obtain prior approval from the Pennsylvania Department of Banking and\nSecurities or provide at least 30 days’ prior written notice to the Pennsylvania Department of Banking and Securities. The authority of\nthe Bank under Pennsylvania law, however, may be constrained by federal law and regulation.\nCapital Requirements. Federal regulations require FDIC-insured depository institutions to meet several minimum capital standards: a\ncommon equity Tier 1 capital to risk-based assets ratio of 4.5%, a Tier 1 capital to risk-based assets ratio of 6.0%, a total capital to risk-\nbased assets ratio of 8.0%, and a Tier 1 capital to average assets leverage ratio of 4.0%.\nFor purposes of the regulatory capital requirements, common equity Tier 1 capital is generally defined as common stockholders’ equity\nand retained earnings. Tier 1 capital is generally defined as common equity Tier 1 and additional Tier 1 capital. Additional Tier 1 capital\nincludes certain noncumulative perpetual preferred stock and related surplus and minority interests in equity accounts of consolidated\nsubsidiaries. Total capital includes Tier 1 capital (common equity Tier 1 capital plus additional Tier 1 capital) and Tier 2 capital. Tier 2\ncapital is comprised of capital instruments and related surplus, meeting specified requirements, and may include cumulative preferred\nstock and long-term perpetual preferred stock, mandatory convertible securities, intermediate preferred stock and subordinated debt.\nAlso included in Tier 2 capital is the allowance for loan and lease losses limited to a maximum of 1.25% of risk-weighted assets and,\nfor institutions that made such an election regarding the treatment of accumulated other comprehensive income (“AOCI”), up to 45%\nof net unrealized gains on available for sale equity securities with readily determinable fair market values. Institutions that have not\n10\nexercised the AOCI opt-out have AOCI incorporated into common equity Tier 1 capital (including unrealized gains and losses on\navailable for sale-securities). The Bank exercised the opt-out and therefore does not include AOCI in its regulatory capital\ndeterminations. Calculation of all types of regulatory capital is subject to deductions and adjustments specified in the regulations.\nIn determining the amount of risk-weighted assets for purposes of calculating risk-based capital ratios, all assets, including certain off-\nbalance sheet assets (such as recourse obligations, direct credit substitutes, residual interests) are multiplied by a risk weight factor\nassigned by the regulations based on the risks believed inherent in the type of asset. Higher levels of capital are required for asset\ncategories believed to present greater risk. For example, a risk weight of 0% is assigned to cash and U.S. government securities, a risk\nweight of 50% is generally assigned to prudently underwritten first lien one to four- family residential mortgages, a risk weight of 100%\nis assigned to commercial and consumer loans, a risk weight of 150% is assigned to certain past due loans and a risk weight of between\n0% to 600% is assigned to permissible equity interests, depending on certain specified factors.\nIn addition to establishing the minimum regulatory capital requirements, the regulations limit capital distributions and certain\ndiscretionary bonus payments to management if the institution does not hold a “capital conservation buffer” consisting of 2.5% of\ncommon equity Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted asset above the amount necessary to meet its minimum risk-based capital requirements.\nThe capital conservation buffer requirement began being phased in starting on January 1, 2016 at 0.625% of risk-weighted assets and\nincreased each year until fully implemented at 2.5% on January 1, 2019. At June 30, 2024, the Bank exceeded the fully phased in\nregulatory requirement for the capital conservation buffer.\nFederal banking agencies have established an optional “community bank leverage ratio” of between 8% to 10% tangible equity to\naverage total consolidated assets for qualifying institutions with assets of less than $10 billion of assets. Institutions with capital meeting\nthe specified requirement and electing to follow the alternative framework would be deemed to comply with the applicable regulatory\ncapital requirements, including the risk-based requirements and would be considered well-capitalized under the prompt corrective action\nframework. In April 2020, the Federal banking regulatory agencies modified the original Community Bank Leverage Ratio (CBLR)\nframework and provided that, as of the second quarter 2020, a banking organization with a leverage ratio of 8% or greater and that meets\nthe other existing qualifying criteria may elect to use the community bank leverage ratio framework. The modified rule also states that\nthe community bank leverage ratio requirement will be greater than 8% for the second through fourth quarters of calendar year 2020,\ngreater than 8.5% for calendar year 2021, and greater than 9% thereafter. The transition rule also maintains a two-quarter grace period\nfor a qualifying community banking organization whose leverage ratio falls no more than 100 basis points below the applicable\ncommunity bank leverage ratio requirement. The Bank has elected to adopt the community bank leverage ratio framework. Management\nbelieves, as of June 30, 2024, that the Bank meets all capital adequacy requirements to which it is subject.\nThe Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act required each federal banking agency to revise its risk-based capital\nstandards for insured institutions to ensure that those standards take adequate account of interest-rate risk, concentration of credit risk,\nand the risk of nontraditional activities, as well as to reflect the actual performance and expected risk of loss on multi-family residential\nloans. The FDIC, along with the other federal banking agencies, adopted a regulation providing that the agencies will consider the\nexposure of a bank’s capital and economic value to changes in interest rate risk in assessing a bank’s capital adequacy. The FDIC also\nhas authority to establish individual minimum capital requirements in appropriate cases upon determination that an institution’s capital\nlevel is, or is likely to become, inadequate in light of the particular circumstances.\nStandards for Safety and Soundness. As required by statute, the federal banking agencies adopted final regulations and Interagency\nGuidelines Establishing Standards for Safety and Soundness to implement safety and soundness standards. The guidelines set forth the\nsafety and soundness standards that the federal banking agencies use to identify and address problems at insured depository institutions\nbefore capital becomes impaired. The guidelines address internal controls and information systems, internal audit system, credit\nunderwriting, loan documentation, interest rate exposure, asset growth, asset quality, earnings and compensation, fees and benefits. The\nagencies have also established standards for safeguarding customer information. If the appropriate federal banking agency determines\nthat an institution fails to meet any standard prescribed by the guidelines, the agency may require the institution to submit to the agency\nan acceptable plan to achieve compliance with the standard.\nInvestments and Activities. Under federal law, all state-chartered banks insured by the FDIC have generally been limited to activities\nas principal and equity investments of the type and in the amount authorized for national banks, notwithstanding state law. The Federal\nDeposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act and the FDIC permit exceptions to these limitations. For example, state chartered\nbanks may, with FDIC approval, continue to exercise grandfathered state authority to invest in common or preferred stocks listed on a\nnational securities exchange and in the shares of an investment company registered under federal law. The Bank received grandfathering\nauthority from the FDIC to invest in listed stocks and/or registered shares. The maximum permissible investment is 100% of Tier 1\ncapital, as specified by the FDIC’s regulations, or the maximum amount permitted by Pennsylvania Banking Code of 1965, whichever\nis less. Such grandfathering authority may be terminated upon the FDIC’s determination that such investments pose a safety and\n11\nsoundness risk to the Bank or if the Bank converts its charter or undergoes a change in control. In addition, the FDIC is authorized to\npermit such institutions to engage in other state authorized activities or investments (other than non-subsidiary equity investments) that\nmeet all applicable capital requirements if it is determined that such activities or investments do not pose a significant risk to the Deposit\nInsurance Fund. As of June 30, 2024, the Bank held no marketable equity securities under such grandfathering authority.\nInterstate Banking and Branching. Federal law permits well capitalized and well managed bank holding companies to acquire banks\nin any state, subject to Federal Reserve Board approval, certain concentration limits and other specified conditions. Interstate mergers\nof banks are also authorized, subject to regulatory approval and other specified conditions. In addition, amendments made by the Dodd-\nFrank Act permit banks to establish de novo branches on an interstate basis to the extent that branching is authorized by the law of the\nhost state for the banks chartered by that state.\nPrompt Corrective Regulatory Action. Federal law requires, among other things, that federal bank regulatory authorities take “prompt\ncorrective action” with respect to banks that do not meet minimum capital requirements. For these purposes, the law establishes five\ncapital categories: well capitalized, adequately capitalized, undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized and critically\nundercapitalized.\nThe FDIC has adopted regulations to implement the prompt corrective action legislation. An institution is deemed to be “well\ncapitalized” if it has a total risk-based capital ratio of 10.0% or greater, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 8.0% or greater, a leverage\nratio of 5.0% or greater and a common equity Tier 1 ratio of 6.5% or greater. An institution is “adequately capitalized” if it has a total\nrisk-based capital ratio of 8.0% or greater, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 6.0% or greater, a leverage ratio of 4.0% or greater and a\ncommon equity Tier 1 ratio of 4.5% or greater. An institution is “undercapitalized” if it has a total risk-based capital ratio of less than\n8.0%, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of less than 6.0%, a leverage ratio of less than 4.0% or a common equity Tier 1 ratio of less than\n4.5%. An institution is deemed to be “significantly undercapitalized” if it has a total risk-based capital ratio of less than 6.0%, a Tier 1\nrisk-based capital ratio of less than 4.0%, a leverage ratio of less than 3.0% or a common equity Tier 1 ratio of less than 3.0%. An\ninstitution is considered to be “critically undercapitalized” if it has a ratio of tangible equity (as defined in the regulations) to total assets\nthat is equal to or less than 2.0%. As of June 30, 2024, the Bank was a “well capitalized” institution under the FDIC regulations.\nAt each successive lower capital category, an insured depository institution is subject to more restrictions and prohibitions, including\nrestrictions on growth, restrictions on interest rates paid on deposits, restrictions or prohibitions on payment of dividends, and restrictions\non the acceptance of brokered deposits. Furthermore, if an insured depository institution is classified in one of the undercapitalized\ncategories, it is required to submit a capital restoration plan to the appropriate federal banking agency, and the holding company must\nguarantee the performance of that plan. Based upon its capital levels, a bank that is classified as well-capitalized, adequately capitalized,\nor undercapitalized may be treated as though it were in the next lower capital category if the appropriate federal banking agency, after\nnotice and opportunity for hearing, determines that an unsafe or unsound condition, or an unsafe or unsound practice, warrants such\ntreatment. An undercapitalized bank’s compliance with a capital restoration plan is required to be guaranteed by any company that\ncontrols the undercapitalized institution in an amount equal to the lesser of 5.0% of the institution’s total assets when deemed\nundercapitalized or the amount necessary to achieve the status of adequately capitalized. If an “undercapitalized” bank fails to submit\nan acceptable plan, it is treated as if it is “significantly undercapitalized.” “Significantly undercapitalized” banks must comply with one\nor more of a number of additional restrictions, including but not limited to an order by the FDIC to sell sufficient voting stock to become\nadequately capitalized, requirements to reduce total assets, cease receipt of deposits from correspondent banks or dismiss directors or\nofficers, and restrictions on interest rates paid on deposits, compensation of executive officers and capital distributions by the parent\nholding company. “Critically undercapitalized” institutions are subject to additional measures including, subject to a narrow exception,\nthe appointment of a receiver or conservator within 270 days after it obtains such status.\nThe previously referenced regulations establishing a “community bank leverage ratio” adjusted the referenced categories for qualifying\ninstitutions that opt into the alternative framework for regulatory capital requirements. Institutions that exceed the community bank\nleverage ratio are considered to have met the capital ratio requirements to be “well capitalized” for the agencies’ prompt corrective rules.\nTransaction with Affiliates and Regulation W of the Federal Reserve Regulations. Transactions between banks and their affiliates are\ngoverned by federal law. An affiliate of a bank is any company or entity that controls, is controlled by or is under common control with\nthe bank. In a holding company context, the parent bank holding company and any companies which are controlled by such parent\nholding company are affiliates of the bank (although subsidiaries of the bank itself, except financial subsidiaries, are generally not\nconsidered affiliates). Generally, Section 23A of the Federal Reserve Act and the Federal Reserve Board’s Regulation W limit the extent\nto which the bank or its subsidiaries may engage in “covered transactions” with any one affiliate to an amount equal to 10.0% of such\ninstitution’s capital stock and surplus, and with all such transactions with all affiliates to an amount equal to 20.0% of such institution’s\ncapital stock and surplus. Section 23B applies to “covered transactions” as well as to certain other transactions and requires that all such\ntransactions be on terms substantially the same, or at least as favorable, to the institution or subsidiary as those provided to a non-\n12\naffiliate. The term “covered transaction” includes the making of loans to, purchase of assets from, and issuance of a guarantee to an\naffiliate, and other similar transactions. Section 23B transactions also include the provision of services and the sale of assets by a bank\nto an affiliate. In addition, loans or other extensions of credit by the financial institution to the affiliate are required to be collateralized\nin accordance with the requirements set forth in Section 23A of the Federal Reserve Act.\nSections 22(h) and (g) of the Federal Reserve Act place restrictions on loans to a bank’s insiders, i.e., executive officers, directors and\nprincipal stockholders. Under Section 22(h) of the Federal Reserve Act, loans to a director, an executive officer and to a greater than\n10.0% stockholder of a financial institution, and certain affiliated interests of these, together with all other outstanding loans to such\nperson and affiliated interests, may not exceed specified limits. Section 22(h) of the Federal Reserve Act also requires that loans to\ndirectors, executive officers and principal stockholders be made on terms and conditions substantially the same as offered in comparable\ntransactions to persons who are not insiders and also requires prior board approval for certain loans. In addition, the aggregate amount\nof extensions of credit by a financial institution to insiders cannot exceed the institution’s unimpaired capital and surplus. Section 22(g)\nof the Federal Reserve Act places additional restrictions on loans to executive officers.\nEnforcement. The FDIC has extensive enforcement authority over insured state chartered savings banks, including the Bank. The\nenforcement authority includes, among other things, the ability to assess civil money penalties, issue cease and desist orders and remove\ndirectors and officers. In general, these enforcement actions may be initiated in response to violations of laws and regulations, breaches\nof fiduciary duty and unsafe or unsound practices.\nFederal Insurance of Deposit Accounts. The Bank is a member of the Deposit Insurance Fund, which is administered by the FDIC.\nDeposit accounts in the Bank are insured up to a maximum of $250,000 for each separately insured depositor.\nThe FDIC imposes an assessment for deposit insurance on all depository institutions. Under the FDIC’s risk-based assessment system,\ninsured institutions are assigned to risk categories based on supervisory evaluations, regulatory capital levels and certain other factors.\nAn institution’s assessment rate depends upon the category to which it is assigned, and certain adjustments specified by FDIC\nregulations, with less risky institutions paying lower rates. Assessment rates (inclusive of possible adjustments) for most banks with less\nthan $10 billion of assets currently range from 1 1∕2 to 30 basis points of each institution’s total assets less tangible capital. The FDIC\nmay increase or decrease the scale uniformly, except that no adjustment can deviate more than two basis points from the base scale\nwithout notice and comment rulemaking. The FDIC’s current system represents a change, required by the Dodd-Frank Act, from its\nprior practice of basing the assessment on an institution’s volume of deposits.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act increased the minimum target Deposit Insurance Fund ratio from 1.15% of estimated insured deposits to 1.35% of\nestimated insured deposits. The FDIC was required to seek to achieve the 1.35% ratio by September 30, 2020. Insured institutions with\nassets of $10 billion or more were supposed to fund the increase. The FDIC indicated in November 2018 that the 1.35% ratio was\nexceeded. Insured institutions of less than $10 billion of assets were to receive credits for the portion of their assessments that contributed\nto raising the reserve ratio between 1.15% and 1.35% effective when the fund rate achieves 1.38%. The Dodd-Frank Act eliminated the\n1.5% maximum fund ratio, instead leaving it to the discretion of the FDIC and the FDIC has exercised that discretion by establishing a\nlong range fund ratio of 2%.\nThe FDIC has authority to increase insurance assessments. A significant increase in insurance premiums would likely have an adverse\neffect on the operating expenses and results of operations of the Bank. Future insurance assessment rates cannot be predicted. In October\n2022, the FDIC Board adopted a final rule to increase initial base deposit insurance assessment rate schedules by two basis points\nbeginning in the first quarterly assessment period of 2023. The adoption of this final rule increased the Bank’s annual deposit insurance\npremium by approximately $144 thousand.\nInsurance of deposits may be terminated by the FDIC upon a finding that the institution has engaged in unsafe or unsound practices, is\nin an unsafe or unsound condition to continue operations or has violated any applicable law, regulation, rule order or regulatory condition\nimposed in writing. We do not know of any practice, condition or violation that might lead to termination of deposit insurance.\nPrivacy Regulations. FDIC regulations generally require that the Bank disclose its privacy policy, including identifying with whom it\nshares a customer’s “non-public personal information,” to customers at the time of establishing the customer relationship and annually\nthereafter. In addition, the Bank is required to provide its customers with the ability to “opt-out” of having their personal information\nshared with unaffiliated third parties and not to disclose account numbers or access codes to non-affiliated third parties for marketing\npurposes. The Bank currently has a privacy protection policy in place and believes that such policy is in compliance with the regulations.\nCommunity Reinvestment Act. Under the Community Reinvestment Act, or CRA, as implemented by FDIC regulations, a non-member\nbank has a continuing and affirmative obligation, consistent with its safe and sound operation, to help meet the credit needs of its entire\n13\ncommunity, including low- and moderate-income neighborhoods. The CRA does not establish specific lending requirements or\nprograms for financial institutions, nor does it limit an institution’s discretion to develop the types of products and services that it believes\nare best suited to its particular community, consistent with the CRA. The CRA does require the FDIC, in connection with its examination\nof a non-member bank, to assess the institution’s record of meeting the credit needs of its community and to take such record into\naccount in its evaluation of certain applications by such institution, including applications to acquire branches and other financial\ninstitutions. The CRA requires the FDIC to provide a written evaluation of an institution’s CRA performance utilizing a four-tiered\ndescriptive rating system. The Bank’s latest FDIC CRA rating was “Satisfactory.”\nConsumer Protection and Fair Lending Regulations. Pennsylvania savings banks are subject to a variety of federal statutes and\nregulations that are intended to protect consumers and prohibit discrimination in the granting of credit. These statutes and regulations\nprovide for a range of sanctions for non-compliance with their terms, including imposition of administrative fines and remedial orders,\nand referral to the Attorney General for prosecution of a civil action for actual and punitive damages and injunctive relief. Certain of\nthese statutes authorize private individual and class action lawsuits and the award of actual, statutory and punitive damages and\nattorneys’ fees for certain types of violations.\nUSA PATRIOT Act. The Bank is subject to the USA PATRIOT Act, which gave federal agencies additional powers to address terrorist\nthreats through enhanced domestic security measures, expanded surveillance powers, increased information sharing, and broadened\nanti-money laundering requirements. By way of amendments to the Bank Secrecy Act, Title III of the USA PATRIOT Act provided\nmeasures intended to encourage information sharing among bank regulatory agencies and law enforcement bodies. Further, certain\nprovisions of Title III impose affirmative obligations on a broad range of financial institutions, including banks, thrifts, brokers, dealers,\ncredit unions, money transfer agents, and parties registered under the Commodity Exchange Act.\nOther Regulations\nInterest and other charges collected or contracted for by the Bank are subject to state usury laws and federal laws concerning interest\nrates. Loan operations are also subject to state and federal laws applicable to credit transactions, such as the:\n Home Mortgage Disclosure Act of 1975, requiring financial institutions to provide information to enable the public and public\nofficials to determine whether a financial institution is fulfilling its obligation to help meet the housing needs of the community\nit serves;\n Equal Credit Opportunity Act, prohibiting discrimination on the basis of race, creed or other prohibited factors in extending\ncredit;\n Fair Credit Reporting Act of 1978, governing the use and provision of information to credit reporting agencies; and\n Rules and regulations of the various federal and state agencies charged with the responsibility of implementing such federal\nand state laws.\nThe deposit operations of the Bank also are subject to, among others, the:\n Right to Financial Privacy Act, which imposes a duty to maintain confidentiality of consumer financial records and prescribes\nprocedures for complying with administrative subpoenas of financial records;\n Check Clearing for the 21st Century Act (also known as “Check 21”), which gives “substitute checks,” such as digital check\nimages and copies made from that image, the same legal standing as the original paper check; and\n Electronic Funds Transfer Act and Regulation E promulgated thereunder, which govern automatic deposits to and withdrawals\nfrom deposit accounts and customers’ rights and liabilities arising from the use of automated teller machines and other\nelectronic banking services.\nFederal Reserve System\nThe Federal Reserve Act authorizes the Federal Reserve Board to require depository associations to maintain noninterest-earning\nreserves against their transaction accounts (primarily negotiable order of withdrawal and regular checking accounts). The amounts are\nadjusted annually and, on March 15, 2020, the Federal Reserve Board reduced reserve requirement to 0% effective as of March 26,\n2020, which eliminated reserve requirements for all depository institutions.\n14\nFederal Home Loan Bank System\nThe Bank is a member of the FHLB System, which consists of 12 regional Federal Home Loan Banks. The FHLB provides a central\ncredit facility primarily for member institutions. At June 30, 2024, the Bank had a maximum borrowing capacity from the FHLB of\nPittsburgh of $287.3 million, of which it had $48.0 million in outstanding borrowings. The Bank, as a member of the FHLB of Pittsburgh,\nis required to acquire and hold shares of capital stock in that FHLB. The Bank was in compliance with requirements for the FHLB of\nPittsburgh with an investment of $2.8 million at June 30, 2024.\nHolding Company Regulation\nThe Company is subject to examination, regulation, and periodic reporting under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended,\nas administered by the Federal Reserve Board. The Company is required to obtain the prior approval of the Federal Reserve Board to\nacquire all, or substantially all, of the assets of any bank or bank holding company. Prior Federal Reserve Board approval would be\nrequired for the Company to acquire direct or indirect ownership or control of any voting securities of any bank or bank holding company\nif, after such acquisition, it would, directly or indirectly, own or control more than 5% of any class of voting shares of the bank or bank\nholding company. In addition to the approval of the Federal Reserve Board, prior approval may also be necessary from other agencies\nhaving supervisory jurisdiction over the bank to be acquired before any bank acquisition can be completed.\nA bank holding company is generally prohibited from engaging in non-banking activities, or acquiring direct or indirect control of more\nthan 5% of the voting securities of any company engaged in non-banking activities. One of the principal exceptions to this prohibition\nis for activities found by the Federal Reserve Board to be so closely related to banking or managing or controlling banks as to be a\nproper incident thereto. Some of the principal activities that the Federal Reserve Board has determined by regulation to be so closely\nrelated to banking are: (i) making or servicing loans; (ii) performing certain data processing services; (iii) providing discount brokerage\nservices; (iv) acting as fiduciary, investment or financial advisor; (v) leasing personal or real property; (vi) making investments in\ncorporations or projects designed primarily to promote community welfare; and (vii) acquiring a savings and loan association whose\ndirect and indirect activities are limited to those permitted for bank holding companies.\nThe Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999 authorized a bank holding company that meets specified conditions, including being “well\ncapitalized” and “well managed,” to opt to become a “financial holding company” and thereby engage in a broader array of financial\nactivities than previously permitted. Such activities can include insurance underwriting and investment banking.\nThe Company is subject to the Federal Reserve Board’s capital adequacy guidelines for bank holding companies (on a consolidated\nbasis) which have historically been similar to, though less stringent than, those of the FDIC for the Bank. The Dodd-Frank Act, however,\nrequired the Federal Reserve Board to promulgate consolidated capital requirements for depository institution holding companies that\nare no less stringent, both quantitatively and in terms of components of capital, than those applicable to institutions themselves.\nConsolidated regulatory capital requirements identical to those applicable to the subsidiary banks apply to bank holding companies; as\nis the case with institutions themselves, the capital conservation buffer was phased in between 2016 and 2019. However, the Federal\nReserve Board has provided a “small bank holding company” exception to its consolidated capital requirements, and legislation and the\nrelated issuance of regulations by the Federal Reserve Board has increased the threshold for the exception to $3.0 billion. As a result,\nthe Company is not subject to the capital requirement until such time as its consolidated assets exceed $3.0 billion.\nA bank holding company is generally required to give the Federal Reserve Board prior written notice of any purchase or redemption of\nthen outstanding equity securities if the gross consideration for the purchase or redemption, when combined with the net consideration\npaid for all such purchases or redemptions during the preceding 12 months, is equal to 10% or more of the company’s consolidated net\nworth. The Federal Reserve Board may disapprove such a purchase or redemption if it determines that the proposal would constitute an\nunsafe and unsound practice, or would violate any law, regulation, Federal Reserve Board order or directive, or any condition imposed\nby, or written agreement with, the Federal Reserve Board. There is an exception to this approval requirement for well-capitalized bank\nholding companies that meet certain other conditions.\nThe Federal Reserve Board has issued a policy statement regarding capital distributions, including dividends, by bank holding\ncompanies. In general, the Federal Reserve Board’s policies provide that dividends should be paid only out of current earnings and only\nif the prospective rate of earnings retention by the bank holding company appears consistent with the organization’s capital needs, asset\nquality and overall financial condition. The Federal Reserve Board’s policies also require that a bank holding company serve as a source\nof financial strength to its subsidiary banks by standing ready to use available resources to provide adequate capital funds to those banks\nduring periods of financial stress or adversity and by maintaining the financial flexibility and capital-raising capacity to obtain additional\nresources for assisting its subsidiary banks where necessary. The Dodd-Frank Act codified the source of strength doctrine. Under the\nprompt corrective action laws, the ability of a bank holding company to pay dividends may be restricted if a subsidiary bank becomes\n15\nundercapitalized. In addition, the Federal Reserve Board has issued guidance that requires consultation with the agency prior to a bank\nholding company’s payment of dividends or repurchase of stock under certain circumstances. These regulatory policies could affect the\nability of the Company to pay dividends, repurchase its stock or otherwise engage in capital distributions.\nUnder the Federal Deposit Insurance Act, depository institutions are liable to the FDIC for losses suffered or anticipated by the FDIC\nin connection with the default of a commonly controlled depository institution or any assistance provided by the FDIC to such an\ninstitution in danger of default.\nThe status of the Company as a registered bank holding company under the Bank Holding Company Act does not exempt it from certain\nfederal and state laws and regulations applicable to corporations generally, including, without limitation, certain provisions of the federal\nsecurities laws.\nFederal Securities Laws\nThe common stock of the Company is registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission under the Securities Exchange Act of\n1934. As a result, the Company is required to file quarterly and annual reports with the Securities and Exchange Commission and is\nsubject to the information, proxy solicitation, insider trading restrictions and other requirements under the Securities Exchange Act of\n1934.\nSarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002\nThe Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 is intended to improve corporate responsibility, to provide for enhanced penalties for accounting and\nauditing improprieties at publicly traded companies and to protect investors by improving the accuracy and reliability of corporate\ndisclosures pursuant to the securities laws. We have policies, procedures and systems designed to comply with these regulations, and\nwe review and document such policies, procedures and systems to ensure continued compliance with these regulations.\nChange in Control Regulations\nUnder the Change in Bank Control Act, no person, or group of persons acting in concert, may acquire control of a bank holding company,\nsuch as the Company, unless the Federal Reserve Board has been given 60 days’ prior written notice and not disapproved the proposed\nacquisition. The Federal Reserve Board considers several factors in evaluating a notice, including the financial and managerial resources\nof the acquirer and competitive effects. Control, as defined under the applicable regulations, means the power, directly or indirectly, to\ndirect the management or policies of the company or to vote 25% or more of any class of voting securities of the company. Acquisition\nof more than 10% of any class of a bank holding company’s voting securities constitutes a rebuttable presumption of control under\ncertain circumstances, including where, as will be the case with the Company, the issuer has registered securities under Section 12 of\nthe Securities Exchange Act of 1934.\nIn addition, federal regulations provide that no company may acquire control (as defined in the Bank Holding Company Act) of a bank\nholding company without the prior approval of the Federal Reserve Board. Any company that acquires such control becomes a “bank\nholding company” subject to registration, examination and regulation by the Federal Reserve Board.\nEmerging Growth Company Status\nThe Company is an emerging growth company and, for so long as it continues to be an emerging growth company, the Company may\nchoose to take advantage of exemptions from various reporting requirements applicable to other public companies but not to “emerging\ngrowth companies,” including, but not limited to, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic\nreports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation\nand stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. As an emerging growth company, the Company\nalso is not subject to Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, which would require that our independent auditors review and\nattest as to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. We have also elected to use the extended transition period\nto delay adoption of new or revised accounting pronouncements applicable to public companies until such pronouncements are made\napplicable to private companies. Such an election is irrevocable during the period a company is an emerging growth company.\nAccordingly, our financial statements may not be comparable to the financial statements of public companies that comply with such\nnew or revised accounting standards.\nThe Company will cease to be an emerging growth company upon the earliest of: (i) the end of the fiscal year following the fifth\nanniversary of the completion of its second-step conversion offering; (ii) the first fiscal year after our annual gross revenues are $1.07\n16\nbillion (adjusted for inflation) or more; (iii) the date on which we have, during the previous three-year period, issued more than $1.0\nbillion in non-convertible debt securities; or (iv) the end of any fiscal year in which the market value of our common stock held by non-\naffiliates exceeded $700 million at the end of the second quarter of that fiscal year. Accordingly, our financial statements may not be\ncomparable to the financial statements of public companies that comply with such new or revised accounting standards.\nFEDERAL AND STATE TAXATION\nFederal Income Taxation\nGeneral. We report our income on a fiscal year basis using the accrual method of accounting. The federal income tax laws apply to us\nin the same manner as to other corporations with some exceptions, including particularly our reserve for bad debts discussed below. The\nfollowing discussion of tax matters is intended only as a summary and does not purport to be a comprehensive description of the tax\nrules applicable to us. The tax years corresponding to our fiscal years ended June 30, 2021 through 2024 remain subject to examination\nby the Internal Revenue Service and by Pennsylvania and Philadelphia taxing authorities. The tax years corresponding to our fiscal years\nended June 30, 2020 through 2024 remain subject to examination by New Jersey taxing authorities. For 2024, the Bank’s maximum\nfederal income tax rate was 21.0%.\nThe Company and the Bank have entered into a tax allocation agreement. Because the Company owns 100% of the issued and\noutstanding capital stock of the Bank, the Company and the Bank are members of an affiliated group within the meaning of Section\n1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code, of which group the Company is the common parent corporation. As a result of this affiliation,\nthe Bank may be included in the filing of a consolidated federal income tax return with the Company and, if a decision to file a\nconsolidated tax return is made, the parties agree to compensate each other for their individual share of the consolidated tax liability\nand/or any tax benefits provided by them in the filing of the consolidated federal income tax return.\nBad Debt Reserves. For fiscal years beginning before June 30, 1996, thrift institutions that qualified under certain definitional tests and\nother conditions of the Internal Revenue Code were permitted to use certain favorable provisions to calculate their deductions from\ntaxable income for annual additions to their bad debt reserve. A reserve could be established for bad debts on qualifying real property\nloans, generally secured by interests in real property improved or to be improved, under the percentage of taxable income method or the\nexperience method. The reserve for non-qualifying loans was computed using the experience method. Federal legislation enacted in\n1996 repealed the reserve method of accounting for bad debts and the percentage of taxable income method for tax years beginning after\n1995 and required savings institutions to recapture or take into income certain portions of their accumulated bad debt reserves as of\nDecember 31, 1987. Approximately $2.8 million of income tax related to our accumulated bad debt reserves will not be recognized\nunless the Bank makes a “non-dividend distribution” to the Company as described below.\nDistributions. If the Bank makes “non-dividend distributions” to the Company, the distributions will be considered to have been made\nfrom the Bank’s un-recaptured tax bad debt reserves, including the balance of its reserves as of December 31, 1987, to the extent of the\n“non-dividend distributions,” and then from the Bank’s supplemental reserve for losses on loans, to the extent of those reserves, and an\namount based on the amount distributed, but not more than the amount of those reserves, will be included in the Bank’s taxable income.\nNon-dividend distributions include distributions in excess of the Bank’s current and accumulated earnings and profits, as calculated for\nfederal income tax purposes, distributions in redemption of stock, and distributions in partial or complete liquidation. Dividends paid\nout of the Bank’s current or accumulated earnings and profits will not be included in the Bank’s taxable income.\nThe amount of additional taxable income triggered by a non-dividend is an amount that, when reduced by the tax attributable to the\nincome, is equal to the amount of the distribution. Therefore, if the Bank makes a non-dividend distribution to the Company,\napproximately one and one-half times the amount of the distribution not in excess of the amount of the reserves would be includable in\nincome for federal income tax purposes, assuming a 21.0% federal corporate income tax rate. The Bank does not intend to pay dividends\nthat would result in a recapture of any portion of its bad debt reserves.\nState Taxation\nPennsylvania Taxation. The Bank, as a savings bank conducting business in Pennsylvania, is subject to tax under the Pennsylvania\nMutual Thrift Institutions Tax (“MTIT”) Act, as amended to include thrift institutions having capital stock. The MTIT is a tax upon\nseparately stated net book income, determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles with certain adjustments. In\ncomputing income subject to MTIT taxation, there is an allowance for the deduction of interest income earned on state, federal and local\nobligations, while also disallowing a portion of a thrift’s interest expense associated with such tax-exempt income. The MTIT tax rate\nis 11.5%. Net operating losses, if any, can be carried forward a maximum of three years for MTIT purposes.\n17\nPhiladelphia Taxation. In addition, as a savings bank conducting business in Philadelphia, the Bank is also subject to the City of\nPhiladelphia Business Privilege Tax. The City of Philadelphia Business Privilege Tax is a tax upon net income or taxable receipts\nimposed on persons carrying on or exercising for gain or profit certain business activities within Philadelphia. Pursuant to the City of\nPhiladelphia Business Privilege Tax, the 2024 tax rate was 5.81% on net income and 0.1415% on gross receipts. For regulated industry\ntaxpayers, the tax is the lesser of the tax on net income or the tax on gross receipts. The City of Philadelphia Business Privilege Tax\nallows for the deduction by financial businesses from receipts of (a) the cost of securities and other intangible property and monetary\nmetals sold, exchanged, paid at maturity or redeemed, but only to the extent of the total gross receipts from securities and other intangible\nproperty and monetary metals sold, exchanged, paid out at maturity or redeemed; (b) moneys or credits received in repayment of the\nprincipal amount of deposits, advances, credits, loans and other obligations; (c) interest received on account of deposits, advances,\ncredits, loans and other obligations made to persons resident or having their principal place of business outside Philadelphia; (d) interest\nreceived on account of other deposits, advances, credits, loans and other obligations but only to the extent of interest expenses attributable\nto such deposits, advances, credits, loans and other obligations; and (e) payments received on account of shares purchased by\nstockholders. An apportioned net operating loss may be carried forward for three tax years following the tax year for which it was first\nreported.\nNew Jersey Taxation. The Bank is subject to New Jersey’s Corporation Business Tax at the rate of 9.0% on its separate company\napportioned taxable income. For this purpose, “taxable income” generally means federal taxable income subject to certain adjustments\n(including addition of interest income on state and municipal obligations). Net operating losses may be carried forward for twenty years\nfollowing the tax year for which they were first reported.\nExecutive Officers\nOur executive officers are elected annually by the board of directors and serve at the board’s discretion.

Age\n60.\nITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nRisks Related to Market Interest Rates\nChanges in interest rates may hurt our profits and asset values and our strategies for managing interest rate risk may not be effective.\nLike most financial institutions, our profitability depends to a large extent upon our net interest income, which is the difference between\nour interest income on interest-earning assets, such as loans and securities, and our interest expense on interest-bearing liabilities, such\nas deposits and borrowed funds. Accordingly, our results of operations depend largely on movements in market interest rates and our\nability to manage our interest-rate-sensitive assets and liabilities in response to these movements. Factors such as inflation, recession\nand instability in financial markets, among other factors beyond our control, may affect interest rates.\nIn a rising interest rate environment, we would expect that the rates on our deposits and borrowings would reprice upwards faster than\nthe rates on our longer-term loans and investments, which would be expected to compress our interest rate spread and have a negative\neffect on our profitability. In addition, the high percentage of fixed rate loans in our one- to four-family residential real estate loan\nportfolio would also contribute to the negative effect on our profitability in a rising interest rate environment. Furthermore, increases in\ninterest rates may adversely affect the ability of our borrowers to make loan repayments on adjustable-rate loans, as the interest owed\non such loans would increase as interest rates increase. Conversely, decreases in interest rates can result in increased prepayments of\nloans and mortgage-related securities, as borrowers refinance to reduce their borrowing costs. Under these circumstances, we are subject\nto reinvestment risk as we may have to redeploy such loan or securities proceeds into lower-yielding assets, which might also negatively\nimpact our income.\nFurthermore, the historically low interest rate environment in recent periods has contributed significantly to our loan growth, particularly\nin one- to four-family residential mortgage loans where refinance volume has been relatively high. The increase in market interest rates\nthat we experienced is likely to reduce our loan origination volume, particularly refinance volume, and/or reduce our interest rate spread,\nwhich would have a material adverse effect on our profitability and results of operations.\nAny substantial, unexpected, prolonged change in market interest rates could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition,\nliquidity and results of operations. Changes in the level of interest rates also may negatively affect the value of our assets, including the\nvalue of our available-for-sale investment securities which generally decrease when market interest rates rise.\nChanges in the level of interest rates also may negatively affect our ability to originate real estate loans, the value of our assets, and our\nability to realize gains from the sale of our assets, all of which ultimately affect our earnings. Also, our interest rate risk modeling\ntechniques and assumptions likely may not fully predict or capture the impact of actual interest rate changes on our balance sheet or\nprojected operating results.\nChanges in interest rates can affect: (1) our ability to originate loans; (2) the value of our interest-earning assets and our ability to realize\ngains from the sale of such assets; (3) our ability to obtain and retain deposits in competition with other available investment alternatives;\nand (4) the ability of our borrowers to repay their loans, particularly adjustable or variable-rate loans. Interest rates are highly sensitive\nto many factors, including government monetary policies, domestic and international economic and political conditions and other factors\nbeyond our control.\n19\nRisks Related to Our Lending Activities\nOur emphasis on one- to four-family residential mortgage and commercial real estate loans exposes us to lending risks.\nAt June 30, 2024, $220.2 million, or 46.5%, of our loan portfolio was secured by one- to four-family real estate and we intend to continue\nto make loans of this type in the future. One- to four-family residential mortgage and one- to four-family commercial real estate lending\nis generally sensitive to regional and local economic conditions that significantly impact the ability of borrowers to meet their loan\npayment obligations, making loss levels difficult to predict. Declines in real estate values could cause some of our residential mortgages\nto be inadequately collateralized, which would expose us to a greater risk of loss if we seek to recover on defaulted loans by selling the\nreal estate collateral.\nOur origination of non-owner occupied one- to four-family residential mortgage loans may expose us to increased lending risks.\nAt June 30, 2024, loans secured by non-owner occupied one- to four-family residential properties totaled $92.3 million, or 19.5% of our\nloan portfolio. We intend to continue to make loans secured by non-owner occupied one- to four-family residential properties in the\nfuture. Loans secured by non-owner occupied properties generally expose a lender to greater risk of non-payment and loss than loans\nsecured by owner occupied properties because repayment of such loans depend primarily on the tenant’s continuing ability to pay rent\nto the property owner, who is our borrower, or, if the property owner is unable to find a tenant, the property owner’s ability to repay the\nloan without the benefit of a rental income stream.\nOur recent increase in and planned increase in commercial real estate and commercial lending could expose us to increased lending\nrisks and related credit losses.\nAt June 30, 2024, we had $211.9 million in commercial real estate and business loans (which include non-residential real estate loans,\nmulti-family loans, land loans and commercial loans), which represented 44.7% of our total loan portfolio at that date. Of this amount,\n$158.5 million, or 33.5% of our total loan portfolio, was comprised of non-residential real estate loans made to small and medium-sized\nbusiness located in our market area. Our current business strategy is to continue to increase our originations of commercial real estate\nloans in accordance with our conservative underwriting guidelines. Commercial real estate loans generally expose a lender to greater\nrisk of non-payment and loss than one- to four-family residential mortgage loans because repayment of the loans often depends on the\nsuccessful operation of the properties and the income stream of the borrowers. Such loans typically involve larger loan balances to single\nborrowers or groups of related borrowers compared to one- to four-family residential mortgage loans.\nIn addition, to the extent that borrowers have more than one commercial loan outstanding, an adverse development with respect to one\nloan or one credit relationship could expose us to a significantly greater risk of loss compared to an adverse development with respect\nto a one- to four-family residential real estate loan. Furthermore, if loans that are collateralized by commercial real estate become\ntroubled and the value of the real estate has been significantly impaired, then we may not be able to recover the full contractual amount\nof principal and interest that we anticipated at the time we originated the loan, which could cause us to increase our provision for credit\nlosses and adversely affect our operating results and financial condition.\nIf our allowance for credit losses is not sufficient to cover actual credit losses, our results of operations would be negatively affected.\nIn determining the amount of the allowance for credit losses, we analyze, among other things, our loss and delinquency experience by\nportfolio segments and we consider the effect of existing and forecasted economic conditions. In addition, we make various assumptions\nand judgments about the collectability of our loan portfolio, including the creditworthiness of our borrowers and the value of the real\nestate and other assets serving as collateral for the repayment of many of our loans. If the actual results are different from our estimates,\nor our analyses are inaccurate, our allowance for credit losses may not be sufficient to cover losses inherent in our loan portfolio, which\nwould require additions to our allowance and would decrease our net income. Increasing our loan portfolio, as well as any future credit\ndeterioration, will require us to increase our allowance further in the future.\nIn addition, our banking regulators periodically review our allowance for credit losses and could require us to increase our provision for\ncredit losses. Any increase in our allowance for credit losses or loan charge-offs resulting from these regulatory reviews may have a\nmaterial adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\n20\nThe geographic concentration of our loan portfolio and lending activities makes us vulnerable to a downturn in our local market\narea.\nWhile there is not a single employer or industry in our market area on which a significant number of our customers are dependent, a\nsubstantial portion of our loan portfolio is comprised of loans secured by property located in the suburbs of Philadelphia, particularly in\nBucks and Philadelphia Counties in Pennsylvania and in Southern and Central New Jersey. This makes us vulnerable to a downturn in\nthe local economy and real estate markets. Adverse conditions in the local economy such as unemployment, recession, a catastrophic\nevent or other factors beyond our control could impact the ability of our borrowers to repay their loans, which could impact our net\ninterest income. Decreases in local real estate values caused by economic conditions, recent changes in tax laws or other events could\nadversely affect the value of the property used as collateral for our loans, which could cause us to realize a loss in the event of a\nforeclosure. Further, deterioration in local economic conditions could drive the level of credit losses beyond the level we have provided\nfor in our allowance for credit losses, which in turn could necessitate an increase in our provision for credit losses and a resulting\nreduction to our earnings and capital.\nRisks Related to Economic Conditions\nInflation can have an adverse impact on our business and our customers.\nInflation risk is the risk that the value of assets or income from investments will be worth less in the future as inflation decreases\nthe value of money. Recently, there has been a rise in inflation and the Federal Reserve Board has raised certain benchmark\ninterest rates in an effort to combat inflation. As inflation increases and market interest rates rise, the value of our investment\nsecurities, particularly those with longer maturities, would decrease, although this effect can be less pronounced for floating rate\ninstruments. In addition, inflation generally increases the cost of goods and services we use in our business operations, such as\nelectricity and other utilities, which increases our noninterest expenses. Furthermore, our customers are also affected by inflation\nand the rising costs of goods and services used in their households and businesses, which could have a negative impact on their\nability to repay their loans with us.\nEconomic conditions could result in increases in our level of non-performing loans and/or reduce demand for our products and\nservices, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations.\nProlonged deteriorating economic conditions could significantly affect the markets in which we do business, the value of our loans and\ninvestment securities, and our ongoing operations, costs and profitability. Further, declines in real estate values and sales volumes and\nelevated unemployment levels may result in higher loan delinquencies, increases in our non-performing and classified assets and a\ndecline in demand for our products and services. These events may cause us to incur losses and may adversely affect our financial\ncondition and results of operations. Reduction in problem assets can be slow, and the process can be exacerbated by the condition of the\nproperties securing non-performing loans and the lengthy foreclosure process in Pennsylvania and New Jersey, where the majority of\nour borrowers reside. To the extent that we must work through the resolution of assets, economic problems may cause us to incur losses\nand adversely affect our capital, liquidity, and financial condition.\nRisks Related to our Deferred Tax Assets and Goodwill\nWe may not be able to realize our deferred tax assets.\nWe recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities based on differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases\nof assets and liabilities. At June 30, 2024, we had net deferred tax assets totaling $9.6 million. We have determined that no valuation\nallowance is required as of June 30, 2024, although there is no guarantee that those assets will be fully recognizable in future periods.\nManagement regularly reviews the net deferred tax asset for recoverability based on our history of earnings, expectations for future\nearnings and expected timing of reversals of temporary differences.\nThe value of our goodwill may decline in the future.\nAs of June 30, 2024, we had $4.9 million of goodwill. A significant decline in our expected future cash flows, a significant adverse\nchange in the business climate or slower growth rates, any or all of which could be materially impacted by many of the risk factors\ndiscussed herein, may necessitate our taking charges in the future related to the impairment of our goodwill. Future regulatory actions\ncould also have a material impact on assessments of goodwill for impairment. If the fair value of our net assets improves at a faster rate\nthan the market value of our reporting units, or if we were to experience increases in book values of a reporting unit in excess of the\nincrease in fair value of equity, we may also have to take charges related to the impairment of our goodwill. If we were to conclude that\n21\na future write-down of our goodwill is necessary, we would record the appropriate charge, which could have a material adverse effect\non our results of operations.\nRisks Related to Our Growth Strategy\nWe are subject to certain risks in connection with our history of growing through mergers and acquisitions.\nIn July 2018, we acquired Audubon, a New Jersey-chartered mutual savings association headquartered in Audubon, New Jersey.\nAdditionally, in May 2020, we acquired both Fidelity, a Pennsylvania-chartered mutual savings bank headquartered in Bristol,\nPennsylvania and Washington, a Pennsylvania-chartered mutual savings bank headquartered in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. It is possible\nthat we could acquire other banking institutions, other financial services companies or branches of financial institutions in the future.\nAcquisitions typically involve the payment of a premium over book and trading values and, therefore, may result in the dilution of our\ntangible book value per share. Acquisitions, including those that we have completed, also involve a number of risks and challenges,\nincluding (1) our ability to achieve planned synergies and to integrate the branches and operations we acquire, and the internal controls\nand regulatory functions of the acquired entity into our current operations and (2) the diversion of management’s attention from existing\noperations, which may adversely affect our ability to successfully conduct our business and negatively impact our financial results.\nThe building of market share through our branch office strategy, and our ability to achieve profitability on new branch offices, may\nincrease our expenses and negatively affect our earnings.\nWe believe there may be branch expansion opportunities within our market area and adjacent markets, and we may seek to grow our\ndeposit base by adding branches to our existing twelve-branch network. There are considerable costs involved in opening branch offices,\nespecially in light of the capabilities needed to compete in today’s environment. Moreover, new branch offices generally require a period\nof time to generate sufficient revenues to offset their costs, especially in areas in which we do not have an established presence.\nAccordingly, new branch offices could negatively impact our earnings and may do so for a period of time. Our investments in products\nand services, and the related personnel required to implement new policies and procedures, take time to earn returns and can be expected\nto negatively impact our earnings for the foreseeable future. The profitability of any prospective branch expansion will depend on\nwhether the income that we generate from new branch offices will offset the increased expenses resulting from operating these branch\noffices.\nRisks Related to Liquidity and Dividend Matters\nFinancial challenges at other banking institutions could lead to disruptive and destabilizing deposit outflows, as well as an increase\nin FDIC deposit premiums, which could negatively impact our profitability and results of operations.\nIn March 2023, Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank experienced large deposit outflows, coupled with insufficient liquidity to meet\nwithdrawal demands, resulting in the institutions being placed into FDIC receivership. Additionally in May 2023, First Republic Bank\nexperienced similar circumstances which resulted in the institution being placed into FDIC receivership. The placement of these\ninstitutions into receivership has resulted in market disruption and increased concerns that diminished depositor confidence across the\nbanking industry in general could lead to deposit outflows that could destabilize other institutions. At June 30, 2024, we had $234.0\nmillion in available liquidity with the FHLB of Pittsburgh and $20.2 million in cash and cash equivalents, which was sufficient to cover\n234.9% of our estimated uninsured and uncollateralized deposits, excluding intercompany deposits. Notwithstanding our strong\nliquidity position, large deposit outflows could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nFollowing the placement of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank into FDIC receivership, the federal banking regulators also issued\na joint statement providing that the losses to support the uninsured deposits of those banks would be recovered via a special assessment\non banks. Any special assessments, increases in assessment rates or required prepayments in FDIC insurance premiums, to the extent\nthat they result in increased deposit insurance costs, would reduce our profitability.\nInsufficient liquidity could impair our ability to fund operations and jeopardize our financial condition, growth and prospects.\nWe require sufficient liquidity to fund loan commitments, satisfy depositor withdrawal requests, make payments on our debt obligations\nas they become due, and meet other cash commitments. Liquidity risk is the potential that we will be unable to meet our obligations as\nthey become due because of an inability to liquidate assets or obtain adequate funding at a reasonable cost, in a timely manner and\nwithout adverse conditions or consequences. Our sources of liquidity consist primarily of cash, assets readily convertible to cash (such\nas investment securities), increases in deposits, advances, as needed, from the FHLB of Pittsburgh, and other borrowings. Our access to\nfunding sources in amounts adequate to finance our activities or on acceptable terms could be impaired by factors that affect our\norganization specifically or the financial services industry or economy in general. Any substantial, unexpected, and/or prolonged change\n22\nin the level or cost of liquidity could impair our ability to fund operations and meet our obligations as they become due and could have\na material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may be required to rely more heavily on wholesale funding strategies for funding and liquidity needs if we are unable to\ngenerate core deposits, which could have an adverse effect on our net interest margin and profitability.\nWe must maintain sufficient funds to respond to the needs of depositors and borrowers. Deposits have traditionally been our primary\nsource of funds for use in lending and investment activities. We also receive funds from loan repayments, investment maturities and\nincome on other interest-earning assets. While we emphasize generating transaction accounts, we cannot guarantee if and when this will\noccur. Moreover, deposit balances can decrease if customers perceive alternative investments as providing a better risk/return tradeoff.\nIf we are not able to maintain our lower-cost transactional deposits at a level necessary to fund our asset growth or deposit outflows, we\nmay be forced seek other sources of funds, including other certificates of deposit, FHLB advances, and lines of credit to meet the\nborrowing and deposit withdrawal requirements of our customers, which may be more expensive and have an adverse effect on our net\ninterest margin and profitability.\nIneffective liquidity management could adversely affect our financial results and condition.\nEffective liquidity management is essential for the operation of our business. We require sufficient liquidity to meet customer loan\nrequests, customer deposit maturities/withdrawals, payments on our debt obligations as they come due and other cash commitments\nunder both normal operating conditions and other unpredictable circumstances causing industry or general financial market stress. Our\naccess to funding sources in amounts adequate to finance our activities on terms that are acceptable to us could be impaired by factors\nthat affect us specifically or the financial services industry or economy generally. Factors that could detrimentally impact our access to\nliquidity sources include a downturn in the geographic markets in which our loans and operations are concentrated or difficult credit\nmarkets. Our access to deposits may also be affected by the liquidity needs of our depositors. In particular, a majority of our liabilities\nare checking accounts and other liquid deposits, which are payable on demand or upon several days’ notice, while by comparison, a\nsubstantial majority of our assets are loans, which cannot be called or sold in the same time frame. Although we have historically been\nable to replace maturing deposits and advances as necessary, we might not be able to replace such funds in the future, especially if a\nlarge number of our depositors seek to withdraw their accounts, regardless of the reason. A failure to maintain adequate liquidity could\nmaterially and adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition.\nWe cannot guarantee that we will continue to pay dividends or that, if paid, we will not reduce or eliminate dividends in the future.\nThe holders of our common stock are only entitled to receive such dividends as our Board of Directors may declare out of funds available\nfor such payments under applicable law and regulatory guidance, and, although we have historically declared cash dividends on our\ncommon stock, we are not required to do so. The Federal Reserve Board has issued a policy statement regarding capital distributions,\nincluding dividends, by bank holding companies. In general, the Federal Reserve Board’s policies provide that dividends should be paid\nonly out of current earnings and only if the prospective rate of earnings retention by the bank holding company appears consistent with\nthe organization’s capital needs, asset quality and overall financial condition. The Federal Reserve Board’s policies also require that a\nbank holding company serve as a source of financial strength to its subsidiary banks by standing ready to use available resources to\nprovide adequate capital funds to those banks during periods of financial stress or adversity and by maintaining the financial flexibility\nand capital-raising capacity to obtain additional resources for assisting its subsidiary banks where necessary. Under the prompt corrective\naction laws, the ability of a bank holding company to pay dividends may be restricted if a subsidiary bank becomes undercapitalized. In\naddition, the Federal Reserve Board has issued guidance that requires consultation with the agency prior to a bank holding company’s\npayment of dividends or repurchase of stock under certain circumstances. These regulatory policies could affect the ability of the\nCompany to pay dividends, repurchase its stock or otherwise engage in capital distributions.\nOur inability to receive dividends from the Bank could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of\noperations, as well as our ability to maintain or increase the current level of cash dividends we pay to our stockholders.\nThe Company is a separate and distinct legal entity from the Bank, and a substantial portion of the revenues the Company receives\nconsists of dividends from the Bank. These dividends are the primary funding source for the dividends we pay on our common stock.\nVarious federal and state laws and regulations limit the amount of dividends that the Bank may pay to the Company. In addition, our\nright to participate in a distribution of assets upon the liquidation or reorganization of a subsidiary may be subject to the prior claims of\nthe subsidiary’s creditors. If the Bank is unable to pay dividends to the Company, we might not be able to pay our obligations, or pay\ndividends on our common stock.\n23\nRisks Related to Competitive Matters\nStrong competition within our market area could hurt our profits and slow our growth.\nOur profitability depends upon our continued ability to compete successfully in our market area. We face intense competition both in\nmaking loans and attracting deposits. We continue to face stiff competition for one- to four-family residential loans from other financial\nservice providers, including large national residential lenders, local community banks and credit unions. Other competitors for one- to\nfour-family residential loans include credit unions and mortgage brokers which keep overhead costs and mortgage rates down by selling\nloans and not holding or servicing them. Our competitors for commercial real estate loans include other community banks and\ncommercial lenders, some of which are larger than us and have greater resources and lending limits than we have and offer services that\nwe do not provide. Price competition for loans and deposits might result in us earning less on our loans and paying more on our deposits,\nwhich reduces net interest income. We expect competition to remain strong in the future.\nRisks Related to Operational and Regulatory Matters\nWe depend on our management team to implement our business strategy and execute successful operations and we could be harmed\nby the loss of their services.\nWe depend upon the services of the members of our senior management team who direct our strategy and operations. Our executive\nofficers and lending personnel possess expertise in our markets and key business relationships, and the loss of any one of them could be\ndifficult to replace. Our loss of one or more of these persons, or our inability to hire additional qualified personnel, could impact our\nability to implement our business strategy and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and our ability to compete\nin our markets.\nWe are a community bank and our ability to maintain our reputation is critical to the success of our business. The failure to do so\nmay adversely affect our performance.\nWe are a community bank and our reputation is one of the most valuable assets of our business. A key component of our business\nstrategy is to rely on our reputation for customer service and knowledge of local markets to expand our presence by capturing new\nbusiness opportunities from existing and prospective customers in our market area and contiguous areas. As such, we strive to conduct\nour business in a manner that enhances our reputation. This is done, in part, by recruiting, hiring and retaining employees who share our\ncore values of being an integral part of the communities we serve, delivering superior service to our customers and caring about our\ncustomers. If our reputation is negatively affected by the actions of our employees, by our inability to conduct our operations in a manner\nthat is appealing to current or prospective customers or otherwise, our business and operating results may be materially adversely\naffected. Threats to our reputation can also come from many sources, including adverse sentiment about financial institutions generally,\nunethical practices, employee misconduct, failure to deliver minimum standards of service or quality, compliance deficiencies,\ncybersecurity incidents and questionable or fraudulent activities of our customers. Negative publicity regarding our business, employees,\nor customers, with or without merit, may result in the loss of customers and employees, costly litigation and increased governmental\nregulation, any or all of which could adversely affect our business and operating results.\nWe are dependent on our information technology and telecommunications systems and third-party service providers; systems\nfailures, interruptions and cybersecurity breaches could have a material adverse effect on us.\nOur business is dependent on the successful and uninterrupted functioning of our information technology and telecommunications\nsystems and third-party service providers. The failure of these systems, or the termination of a third-party software license or service\nagreement on which any of these systems is based, could interrupt our operations. Because our information technology and\ntelecommunications systems interface with and depend on third-party systems, we could experience service denials if demand for such\nservices exceeds capacity or such third-party systems fail or experience interruptions. If significant, sustained or repeated, a system\nfailure or service denial could compromise our ability to operate effectively, damage our reputation, result in a loss of customer business,\nand/or subject us to additional regulatory scrutiny and possible financial liability, any of which could have a material adverse effect on\nus.\nOur third-party service providers may be vulnerable to unauthorized access, computer viruses, phishing schemes and other security\nbreaches. We likely will expend additional resources to protect against the threat of such security breaches and computer viruses, or to\nalleviate problems caused by such security breaches or viruses. To the extent that the activities of our third-party service providers or\nthe activities of our customers involve the storage and transmission of confidential information, security breaches and viruses could\nexpose us to claims, regulatory scrutiny, litigation costs and other possible liabilities.\n24\nSecurity breaches and cybersecurity threats could compromise our information and expose us to liability, which would cause our\nbusiness and reputation to suffer.\nIn the ordinary course of our business, we collect and store sensitive data, including our proprietary business information and that of our\ncustomers, suppliers and business partners, as well as personally identifiable information about our customers and employees. The\nsecure processing, maintenance and transmission of this information is critical to our operations and business strategy. We, our\ncustomers, and other financial institutions with which we interact, are subject to ongoing, continuous attempts to penetrate key systems\nby individual hackers, organized criminals, and in some cases, state-sponsored organizations.\nWhile we have established policies and procedures to prevent or limit the impact of cyber-attacks, there can be no assurance that such\nevents will not occur or will be adequately addressed if they do. Although we take protective measures, the security of our computer\nsystems, software, and networks may be vulnerable to breaches, unauthorized access, misuse, computer viruses, or other malicious code\nand cyber-attacks that could have an impact on information security. Because the techniques used to cause security breaches change\nfrequently, we may be unable to proactively address these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures.\nWe outsource a majority of our data processing requirements to certain third-party providers and also outsource certain cybersecurity\nfunctions, such as penetration testing, to third party service providers. Accordingly, our operations are exposed to the risk that these\nvendors will not perform in accordance with the contracted arrangements under service agreements. The failure of these service providers\nto adequately perform such functions could increase our exposure to security breaches and cybersecurity threats. Despite our security\nmeasures, our information technology and infrastructure may be vulnerable to attacks by hackers or breached due to employee error,\nmalfeasance or other malicious code and cyber-attacks that could have an impact on information security. Any such breach or attacks\ncould compromise our networks and the information stored there could be accessed, publicly disclosed, lost or stolen. Any such\nunauthorized access, disclosure or other loss of information could result in legal claims or proceedings, liability under laws that protect\nthe privacy of personal information, and regulatory penalties; disrupt our operations and the services we provide to customers; damage\nour reputation; and cause a loss of confidence in our products and services, all of which could adversely affect our financial condition\nand results of operations.\nWe must keep pace with technological change to remain competitive.\nFinancial products and services have become increasingly technology-driven. Our ability to meet the needs of our customers\ncompetitively, and in a cost-efficient manner, is dependent on the ability to keep pace with technological advances and to invest in new\ntechnology as it becomes available, as well as related essential personnel. In addition, technology has lowered barriers to entry into the\nfinancial services market and made it possible for financial technology companies and other non-bank entities to offer financial products\nand services traditionally provided by banks. The ability to keep pace with technological change is important, and the failure to do so,\ndue to cost, proficiency or otherwise, could have a material adverse impact on our business and therefore on our financial condition and\nresults of operations.\nBecause the nature of the financial services business involves a high volume of transactions, we face significant operational risks.\nWe operate in diverse markets and rely on the ability of our employees and systems to process a high number of transactions. Operational\nrisk is the risk of loss resulting from our operations, including but not limited to, the risk of fraud by employees or outside persons, the\nexecution of unauthorized transactions by employees, errors relating to transaction processing and technology, breaches of our internal\ncontrol system and compliance requirements, and business continuation and disaster recovery. Insurance coverage may not be available\nfor such losses, or where available, such losses may exceed insurance limits. This risk of loss also includes the potential legal actions\nthat could arise as a result of an operational deficiency or as a result of noncompliance with applicable regulations, adverse business\ndecisions or their implementation, and customer attrition due to potential negative publicity. Although our control testing has not\nidentified any significant deficiencies in our internal control system, a breakdown in our internal control system, improper operation of\nour systems or improper employee actions could result in material financial loss to us, the imposition of regulatory action, and damage\nto our reputation.\nActs of terrorism and other external events, such as the emergence of a pandemic or health emergency, could impact our business.\nFinancial institutions have been, and continue to be, targets of terrorist threats aimed at compromising operating and communication\nsystems. Such events could cause significant damage, impact the stability of our facilities and result in additional expenses, reduce the\ndemand for financial services, impair the ability of our borrowers to repay their loans, reduce the value of collateral securing repayment\nof our loans, and result in the loss of revenue. In addition, the emergence of a health emergency, epidemic or pandemic, such as the\nCOVID-19 pandemic, could (i) reduce the demand for loans and other financial services, (ii) result in increases in loan delinquencies,\n25\nproblem assets, and foreclosures, (iii) cause the value of collateral for loans, especially real estate, to decline in value, (iv) reduce the\navailability and productivity of our employees, (v) cause our vendors and counterparties to be unable to meet existing obligations to us,\n(vi) negatively impact the business and operations of third-party service providers that perform critical services for our business, (vii)\ncause the value of our securities portfolio to decline, and (viii) cause the net worth and liquidity of loan guarantors to decline, impairing\ntheir ability to honor commitments to us. Any one or a combination of the above events could have a material, adverse effect on our\nbusiness, financial condition, and results of operations. The occurrence of any of these events could have a material adverse effect on\nour business, operations and financial condition.\nRegulation of the financial services industry is intense, and we may be adversely affected by changes in laws and regulations.\nThe Bank is subject to extensive government regulation, supervision and examination by the FDIC and the Pennsylvania Department of\nBanking and Securities. In addition, the Company is subject to extensive regulation, supervision and examination by the Federal Reserve\nBoard and the Pennsylvania Department of Banking and Securities. Such regulation, supervision and examination govern the activities\nin which we may engage, and are intended primarily for the protection of the deposit insurance fund and the Bank’s depositors and not\nfor the protection of our stockholders. Federal and state regulatory agencies have the ability to take strong supervisory actions against\nfinancial institutions that have experienced increased loan production and losses and other underwriting weaknesses or have compliance\nweaknesses. These actions include the entering into of formal or informal written agreements and cease and desist orders that place\ncertain limitations on their operations. If we were to become subject to a regulatory action, such action could negatively impact our\nability to execute our business plan, and result in operational restrictions, as well as our ability to grow, pay dividends, repurchase stock\nor engage in mergers and acquisitions. See “Regulation — Banking Regulation — Capital Requirements” for a discussion of regulatory\ncapital requirements.\nWe are an emerging growth company, and any decision on our part to comply only with certain reduced reporting and disclosure\nrequirements applicable to emerging growth companies could make our common stock less attractive to investors.\nThe Company is an emerging growth company and, for so long as it continues to be an emerging growth company, the Company may\nchoose to take advantage of exemptions from various reporting requirements applicable to other public companies but not to “emerging\ngrowth companies,” including, but not limited to, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic\nreports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation\nand stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. As an emerging growth company, the Company\nis not subject to Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, which would require that our independent auditors review and attest\nas to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. We have also elected to use the extended transition period to delay\nadoption of new or revised accounting pronouncements applicable to public companies until such pronouncements are made applicable\nto private companies. Accordingly, our financial statements may not be comparable to the financial statements of public companies that\ncomply with such new or revised accounting standards.\nThe Company will cease to be an emerging growth company upon the earliest of: (1) the end of the fiscal year following the fifth\nanniversary of the completion of its second-step conversion offering; (2) the first fiscal year after our annual gross revenues are $1.07\nbillion (adjusted for inflation) or more; (3) the date on which we have, during the previous three-year period, issued more than $1.0\nbillion in non-convertible debt securities; or (4) the end of any fiscal year in which the market value of our common stock held by non-\naffiliates exceeded $700 million as of the end of the second quarter of that fiscal year. Investors may find our common stock less\nattractive if we choose to rely on these exemptions. If some investors find our common stock less attractive as a result of any choices to\nreduce future disclosure, there may be a less active trading market for our common stock and the price of our common stock may be\nmore volatile.\nSocietal responses to climate change could adversely affect our business and performance, including indirectly through impacts on\nour customers.\nConcerns over the long-term impacts of climate change have led and will continue to lead to governmental efforts around the world to\nmitigate those impacts. Consumers and businesses also may change their behavior as a result of these concerns. We and our customers\nwill need to respond to new laws and regulations as well as consumer and business preferences resulting from climate change concerns.\nThe impact on our customers will likely vary depending on their specific attributes, including reliance on or role in carbon intensive\nactivities. Among the impacts to us could be a drop in demand for our products and services, particularly in certain sectors. In addition,\nwe could face reductions in creditworthiness on the part of some customers or in the value of assets securing loans. Our efforts to take\nthese risks into account in making lending and other decisions, including by increasing our business with climate-friendly companies,\nmay not be effective in protecting us from the negative impact of new laws and regulations or changes in consumer or business behavior.\n26\nRisks Related to Accounting Matters\nChanges in management’s estimates and assumptions may have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements and our\nfinancial condition or operating results.\nIn preparing our consolidated financial statements, our management is and will be required under applicable rules and\nregulations to make estimates and assumptions as of a specified date. These estimates and assumptions are based on\nmanagement’s best estimates and experience as of that date and are subject to substantial risk and uncertainty. Materially\ndifferent results may occur as circumstances change and additional information becomes known. Areas requiring significant\nestimates and assumptions by management include our evaluation of the adequacy of our allowance for credit losses and our\ndeterminations with respect to amounts owed for income taxes.\nChanges in accounting standards could affect reported earnings.\nThe regulatory bodies responsible for establishing accounting standards, including the Financial Accounting Standards Board, the\nSecurities and Exchange Commission and other regulatory bodies, periodically change the financial accounting and reporting\nguidance that governs the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. In some cases, we could be required to apply new\nor revised guidance retroactively. These changes can be hard to predict and can materially impact how we record and report our\nfinancial condition and results of operations.\nITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS\nNone.\nITEM 1C. CYBERSECURITY\nCybersecurity is a material part of the Company’s business. As a financial institution offering products through multiple digital delivery\nchannels, cybersecurity incidents could have a material effect on the Company, its results of operations and its reputation. To date, the\nCompany has not experienced any cybersecurity events which have had a material effect (or are reasonably likely to have a material\neffect) on the Company’s business strategy, results of operations, or financial condition. Notwithstanding, the impact of a cyber-incident\ncould have a future impact on the Company’s results of operations or financial condition. Cyber-attacks or other security breaches could\nadversely affect our operations, net income, or reputation.\nOur information security program is managed by our dedicated Chief Technology Officer, whose team is responsible for leading\nenterprise-wide cybersecurity strategy, policy, standards, architecture, and processes. The specific experience of management who\noversee cybersecurity are as follows:\n Our Chief Technology Officer, who has over 40 years of industry experience and has facilitated the management of\ninformation security programs at financial institutions for the past 35 years. Our Chief Technology Officer is\nresponsible for technology vendor selection and managing efficiency initiatives, including the implementation and\nupgrades of core banking technology.\n Our Vice President and Director of Information Technology, who has over 20 years of industry experience and is a\ntechnology subject matter expert responsible for enterprise program management and information technology service\nmanagement.\n Our Chief Risk Officer, who oversees entity-side risk management, including cybersecurity related risk.\nTo ensure that cybersecurity risk management is integrated into the Company’s overall risk management plans, systems and processes,\nmanagement provides regular cybersecurity reports to the Board of Directors on a monthly basis. These reports include updates on the\nCompany’s cyber risks and threats, the status of projects to strengthen our information security systems, assessments of the information\nsecurity program, and updates on the emerging threat landscape. Our program is regularly evaluated by internal and external experts\nwith the results of those reviews reported to senior management and the Board.\nThe Company’s cybersecurity risk mitigation program involves a combination of internal resources and the use of third parties. Through\na third-party vendor, the Company’s internal information technology team performs monthly vulnerability scanning and performs an\nannual risk assessment based on best practices from the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (“CISA”). We also use a\n27\nthird-party vendor to, among other things, undertake periodic penetration and vulnerability testing, and the results of all internal and\nthird-party assessments and testing are reported to the Board of Directors. We actively engage with key vendors, industry participants,\nand intelligence and law enforcement communities as part of our continuing efforts to evaluate and enhance the effectiveness of our\ninformation security policies and procedures.\nThe Company also maintains insurance which may provide coverage for expenses and certain losses incurred in connection with a\ncybersecurity incident.\nITEM 2. PROPERTIES\nAt June 30, 2024, we conducted business through our administrative headquarters located in Bristol, Pennsylvania and our twelve branch\noffices located in Bucks and Philadelphia Counties in Pennsylvania and Burlington, Camden and Mercer Counties in New Jersey. At\nJune 30, 2024, we owned six of our branch office locations, leased building space at five of our branch office locations and leased the\nland at one of our branch office locations. We also lease our administrative headquarters located in Bristol, Pennsylvania and own one\nadditional administrative office located in Camden County, New Jersey. However, we do not currently conduct business operations\nfrom this additional administrative office. At June 30, 2024, the total net book value of our land, buildings, furniture, fixtures and\nequipment was $7.2 million. As of June 30, 2024, the Company has two properties with a total carrying value of $2.2 million in the\nheld for sale classification. The Company intends to sell these properties by December 31, 2024.\nITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS\nWe are involved in routine legal proceedings in the ordinary course of business. Such routine legal proceedings, in the aggregate, are\nbelieved by management to be immaterial to our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nITEM 4. MINE SAFETY DISCLOSURES\nNot applicable.\nPART II\nITEM 5. MARKET FOR REGISTRANT’S COMMON EQUITY, RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS AND ISSUER\nPURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIES\nMarket Information\nThe common stock of the Company is traded on the Nasdaq Capital Market under the ticker symbol “WMPN.”\nHolders\nThe number of shareholders of record of the Company at September 5, 2024 was 502.\nDividends\nThe Company has historically paid dividends to its stockholders. During the fiscal year ended June 30, 2024, the Company paid quarterly\ndividends of $0.03 per common share for an aggregate of $0.12 per common share.\nIn determining the amount of any future dividends, the board of directors will take into account the Company’s financial condition and\nresults of operations, tax considerations, capital requirements and alternative uses for capital, industry standards, and economic\nconditions. The Company cannot guarantee that it will continue to pay dividends or that, if paid, it will not reduce or eliminate dividends\nin the future.\n28\nSecurities Authorized for Issuance Under Equity Compensation Plans\nThe following table sets forth information regarding outstanding options and shares under the Company’s 2022 Equity Incentive Plan\nat June 30, 2024:\n(a) (b) (c)\nNumber of Securities\nRemaining Available\nfor Future Issuance\nNumber of Securities to Weighted-Average Under Equity\nbe Issued Upon Exercise Exercise Price of Compensation Plans\nof Outstanding Options, Outstanding Options, (Excluding Securities\nPlan Category Warrants and Rights Warrants and Rights Reflected in Column (a))\nEquity compensation plan approved by security holders 1,264,000 $ 11.71 4\nEquity compensation plan not approved by security holders — — —\nTotal 1,264,000 $ 11.71 4\nShare Repurchases\nOn March 11, 2022, the Company issued a press release announcing that the Company’s Board of Directors had authorized a stock\nrepurchase program to acquire up to 758,528 shares of the Company’s outstanding common stock, or approximately 5.0% of outstanding\nshares.

The Company intends such\nforward-looking statements to be covered by the safe harbor provisions for forward-looking statements contained in the Private\nSecurities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, and is including this statement for purposes of invoking these safe harbor provisions. Forward-\nlooking statements, which are based on certain assumptions and describe future plans, strategies and expectations of the Company, are\ngenerally identifiable by the use of the words “believe,” “expect,” “intend,” “anticipate,” “estimate,” “project,” “plan,” or similar\nexpressions. The Company’s ability to predict results or the actual effect of future plans or strategies is inherently uncertain and actual\nresults may differ from those predicted. The Company undertakes no obligation to update these forward-looking statements in the future.\nThe Company cautions readers of this report that a number of important factors could cause the Company’s actual results to differ\nmaterially from those expressed in forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause actual results to differ from those predicted and\ncould affect the future prospects of the Company include, but are not limited to: (i) general economic conditions, either nationally or in\nour market area, that are worse than expected; (ii) changes in the interest rate environment that reduce our interest margins, reduce the\nfair value of financial instruments or reduce the demand for our loan products; (iii) increased competitive pressures among financial\nservices companies; (iv) changes in consumer spending, borrowing and savings habits; (v) changes in the quality and composition of\nour loan or investment portfolios, including associated allowances and reserves; (vi) changes in future allowance for credit losses,\nincluding changes required under relevant accounting and regulatory requirements; (vii) the ability to pay future dividends; (viii) changes\nin real estate market values in our market area; (ix) decreased demand for loan products, deposit flows, competition, or decreased demand\nfor financial services in our market area; (x) major catastrophes such as earthquakes, floods or other natural or human disasters and\ninfectious disease outbreaks, the related disruption to local, regional and global economic activity and financial markets, and the impact\nthat any of the foregoing may have on us and our customers and other constituencies; (xi) legislative or regulatory changes that adversely\naffect our business or changes in the monetary and fiscal policies of the U.S. government, including policies of the U.S. Treasury and\nthe Federal Reserve Board; (xii) technological changes that may be more difficult or expensive than expected; (xiii) success or\nconsummation of new business initiatives may be more difficult or expensive than expected; (xiv) our ability to successfully execute\nour business plan and strategies and integrate the business operations of acquired businesses into our business operations; (xv) our ability\nto manage market risk, credit risk and operational risk in the current economic environment; (xvi) adverse changes in the securities\nmarkets; (xvii) the inability of third party service providers to perform; and (xviii) changes in accounting policies and practices, as may\nbe adopted by bank regulatory agencies or the Financial Accounting Standards Board.\nOverview\nOur results of operations depend primarily on our net interest income. Net interest income is the difference between the interest income\nwe earn on our interest-earning assets, consisting primarily of loans, investment securities, including mortgage-backed securities, and\nother interest-earning assets (primarily cash and cash equivalents), and the interest we pay on our interest-bearing liabilities, consisting\nprimarily of interest-bearing checking accounts, money market accounts, statement savings accounts, individual retirement accounts,\ncertificates of deposit and advances from the FHLB of Pittsburgh. Our results of operations also are affected by our provisions for credit\nlosses, noninterest income and noninterest expense. Noninterest income currently consists primarily of service fees, service charges,\nearnings on bank-owned life insurance, net gains on the sale of investment securities and unrealized gains or losses on equity securities.\n30\nNoninterest expense currently consists primarily of salaries and employee benefits, occupancy and equipment, data processing and\nprofessional fees. Our results of operations also may be affected significantly by general and local economic and competitive conditions,\nchanges in market interest rates, governmental policies, and actions of regulatory authorities.\nBusiness Strategy\nThe Company is focused on serving the financial needs of consumers and businesses in our primary markets of Southeastern\nPennsylvania and Southern and Central New Jersey. Through our wholly owned bank subsidiary, William Penn Bank, we deliver a\ncomprehensive range of traditional depository and lending products, online banking services, and cash management tools for small\nbusinesses. Our business strategy is to continue to operate and grow a profitable community-oriented financial institution. We plan to\nachieve this by executing our strategy described below:\nContinuing to emphasize our established relationship-based banking business model.\nOur primary strategic objective is to further our relationship-based business model that emphasizes securing strong, long-lasting\ncustomer relationships. We employ a group of talented employees with relationships in retail, commercial, and small business banking\nthat assist us in our efforts to build relationships and enhance the William Penn brand. We believe that customer satisfaction is a key to\nsustainable growth and profitability. While continually striving to ensure that our products and services meet our customers’ needs, we\nalso encourage our employees to focus on providing personal service and attentiveness to our customers in a proactive manner. We\nbelieve that many opportunities remain to deliver what our customers want in the form of exceptional service and convenience, and we\nintend to continue to focus our operating strategy on taking advantage of these opportunities. Consistent with this strategy, in fiscal\n2022 we began offering private banking services that provide high net worth clients a primary point of contact that is dedicated to their\npersonal and business financial needs.\nFocusing on our commercial lending activities while also maintaining our residential portfolio.\nAt June 30, 2024, $211.9 million, or 44.7%, of our total loan portfolio was secured by commercial non-residential real estate, multi-\nfamily real estate, commercial construction and land, and commercial business loans, compared to $120.4 million, or 25.9%, of our loan\nportfolio at June 30, 2021. We intend to continue to increase our commercial lending activities, particularly with respect to commercial\nreal estate, multi-family residential and commercial business loans, in the future. We believe the recent expansion of our multi-family\nresidential and commercial real estate lending activities has helped to diversify our balance sheet and increase our presence in our market\narea. We have added experienced commercial lending personnel and enhanced our infrastructure in order to implement this component\nof our business strategy.\nAt June 30, 2024, $127.9 million, or 27.0%, of our total loan portfolio was secured by owner-occupied one- to four-family residential\nreal estate loans and we intend to continue to offer this type of lending in the future. We believe there are opportunities to increase our\nresidential mortgage lending in our market area, and we intend to take advantage of these opportunities through our existing lending\nstaff and residential mortgage origination channels.\nWe believe that strong asset quality is a key to long-term financial success, and we have sought to maintain a high level of asset quality\nand mitigate credit risk by using conservative underwriting standards for all of our residential and commercial lending products,\ncombined with diligent monitoring and collection efforts. We will continue to seek commercial and residential lending opportunities in\nour market area that will further our business strategy and that are also consistent with our conservative underwriting standards.\nContinuing to invest in our facilities and expand our branch network through de novo branching.\nWe have been enhancing and optimizing both our facilities and branch network in recent years. We have consolidated most of our non-\nbranch operations into one location located in Bristol, Pennsylvania that opened in November 2019 and we have consolidated our loan\norigination and servicing administration operations into one location located in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania that we acquired in\nconnection with our acquisition of Washington Savings Bank. Effective June 30, 2022, we consolidated three existing Bank branches\ninto one branch based on branch deposit levels and the close geographic proximity of the three consolidating branches. In addition,\neffective December 31, 2022, we consolidated two existing Bank branches into one branch based on branch deposit levels and the close\ngeographic proximity of the two consolidating branches.\nIn the future, we may consider branch expansion opportunities within our market area and adjacent markets, and we may seek to grow\nour deposit base by adding branches to our existing twelve-branch network. We opened a new branch office in Yardley, Pennsylvania\n31\nin March 2021, a new branch office in Doylestown, Pennsylvania in September 2021 and a new branch office in Hamilton Township,\nNew Jersey in December 2021. We will consider opening additional new branches in desirable locations in attractive growth markets.\nImproving our technology platform.\nWe are committed to building a technology platform that enables us to deliver best-in-class products and services to our customers and\nis also scalable to accommodate our long-term growth plans. To accomplish this objective, we have made and are continuing to make\nsubstantial investments in our information technology infrastructure, including data backup, security, accessibility, integration, business\ncontinuity, website development, online and mobile banking technologies, cash management technology and internal/external ease of\nuse. We continue to develop new strategies for streamlining internal and external practices using technology such as online account\nopening, an online education center, and remote appointments.\nEmploying a stockholder-focused management of capital.\nMaintaining a strong capital base is critical to support our long-range business plan. We intend to continue to manage our capital position\nthrough the growth of assets, as well as the utilization of appropriate capital management tools, consistent with applicable regulations\nand policies, and subject to market conditions. Under current federal regulations, subject to limited exceptions, we were not able to\nrepurchase shares of our common stock during the first year following the completion of our second-step conversion offering, which\noccurred on March 24, 2021. On March 11, 2022, the Company issued a press release announcing that the Company’s Board of Directors\nhad authorized a stock repurchase program to acquire up to 758,528 shares of the Company’s outstanding common stock, or\napproximately 5.0% of outstanding shares. That stock repurchase program became effective on March 25, 2022. On June 9, 2022, the\nCompany issued a press release announcing that the Company’s Board of Directors had authorized a second stock repurchase program\nto acquire up to 771,445 shares, or approximately 5.0%, of the Company’s outstanding stock, commencing upon the completion of the\nCompany’s first stock repurchase program. On August 18, 2022, the Company issued a press release announcing that the Company's\nBoard of Directors had authorized a third stock repurchase program to acquire up to 739,385 shares, or approximately 5.0%, of the\nCompany's outstanding common stock, commencing upon the completion of the Company's second stock repurchase program. On\nFebruary 17, 2023, the Company issued a press release announcing that the Company's Board of Directors had authorized a fourth stock\nrepurchase program to acquire up to 698,312 shares, or approximately 5.0%, of the Company's outstanding common stock, commencing\nupon the completion of the Company's third stock repurchase program. The Company completed this stock repurchase program on May\n31, 2023. On May 5, 2023, the Company issued a press release announcing that the Company's Board of Directors had authorized a fifth\nstock repurchase program to acquire up to 1,281,019 shares, or approximately 10.0%, of the Company's outstanding common stock,\ncommencing upon the completion of the Company's fourth stock repurchase program. The Company completed this stock repurchase\nprogram on August 28, 2023. On August 29, 2023, the Company issued a press release announcing that the Company's Board of\nDirectors had authorized a sixth stock repurchase program to acquire up to 1,138,470 shares, or approximately 10.0%, of the Company's\noutstanding common stock. The sixth stock repurchase program was authorized following the completion of the Company’s fifth stock\nrepurchase program on August 28, 2023. The Company completed this stock repurchase program on October 30, 2023. On October 18,\n2023, the Company issued a press release announcing that the Company's Board of Directors had authorized a seventh stock repurchase\nprogram to acquire up 1,046,610 shares, or approximately 10.0%, of the Company's outstanding common stock. The seventh stock\nrepurchase program was authorized following the completion of the Company’s sixth stock repurchase program on October 30, 2023.\nAs of September 5, 2024, there were 49,542 shares remaining to be purchased under the Company’s seventh repurchase program.\nOn July 21, 2021, the Company declared a one-time special dividend of $0.30 per common share, payable August 18, 2021, to common\nshareholders of record at the close of business on August 2, 2021. During the fiscal year ended June 30, 2022, the Company paid regular\ncash dividends of $0.06 per common share, including dividends of $0.03 per common share for the quarters ended March 31, 2022 and\nJune 30, 2022, but did not pay regular cash dividends during the quarters ended September 30, 2021 and December 31, 2022. During\nthe fiscal years ended June 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company paid regular cash dividends totaling an aggregate of $0.12 per common\nshare, consisting of quarterly cash dividends of $0.03 per common share for each of the four fiscal quarters. As previously disclosed,\nthe Company’s Board of Directors had declared a cash dividend of $0.03 per share, that was paid on August 8, 2024, to common\nshareholders of record at the close of business on July 29, 2024. In determining the amount of any future dividends, the board of\ndirectors will consider the Company’s financial condition and results of operations, tax considerations, capital requirements and\nalternative uses for capital, industry standards, and economic conditions. The Company cannot guarantee that it will continue to pay\ndividends or that, if paid, it will not reduce or eliminate dividends in the future.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nWe consider accounting policies involving significant judgments and assumptions by management that have, or could have, a material\nimpact on the carrying value of certain assets or on income to be critical accounting policies. We consider these accounting policies to\n32\nbe our critical accounting policies. The judgments and assumptions we use are based on historical experience and other factors, which\nwe believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could differ from these judgments and estimates under different\nconditions, resulting in a change that could have a material impact on the carrying values of our assets and liabilities and our results of\noperations.\nAllowance for Credit Losses\nWe consider the allowance for credit losses to be a critical accounting policy. Note 2 to the Company’s Consolidated Financial\nStatements for the year ended June 30, 2024 discusses significant accounting policies, including the allowance for credit losses and the\nadoption of Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 326, which changed the methodology under which management calculates its\nreserve for loans, investment securities and unfunded loan commitments, now referred to as the allowance for credit losses. Please refer\nto Note 2 to the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements for detail regarding the Company’s adoption of Accounting Standards\nUpdate (“ASU”) 2016-13: Financial Instruments — Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments\nand the allowance for credit losses. Although we believe that we use the best information available to establish the allowance for credit\nlosses, future adjustments to the allowance may be necessary if economic conditions differ substantially from the assumptions used in\nmaking the evaluation. In addition, the FDIC and the Pennsylvania Department of Banking and Securities, as an integral part of their\nexamination process, periodically review our allowance for credit losses.\nOur financial results are affected by the changes in and the level of the allowance for credit losses. This process involves our analysis\nof complex internal and external variables, and it requires that we exercise judgment to estimate an appropriate allowance for credit\nlosses. As a result of the uncertainty associated with this subjectivity, we cannot assure the precision of the amount reserved, should we\nexperience sizeable loan losses in any particular period. For example, changes in the financial condition of individual borrowers,\neconomic conditions, or the condition of various markets in which collateral may be sold could require us to significantly decrease or\nincrease the level of the allowance for credit losses. Such an adjustment could materially affect net income as a result of the change in\nprovision for credit losses. We also have approximately $3.3 million as of June 30, 2024 in non-performing assets consisting of non-\nperforming loans. Most of these loans are collateral dependent assets where we may have to incur credit losses to write the assets down\nto their current appraised value less selling costs. We continue to assess the collectability of these loans and update our appraisals on\nthese loans each year. To the extent the property values continue to decline, there could be additional losses incurred on these non-\nperforming loans which may be material. In recent periods, we experienced strong asset quality metrics including low levels of\ndelinquencies, net charge-offs and non-performing assets. Management considered market conditions in deriving the estimated\nallowance for credit losses; however, given the continued economic difficulties, the ultimate amount of loss could vary from that\nestimate.\nGoodwill\nThe acquisition method of accounting for business combinations requires us to record assets acquired, liabilities assumed, and\nconsideration paid at their estimated fair values as of the acquisition date. The excess of consideration paid (or the fair value of the\nequity of the acquiree) over the fair value of net assets acquired represents goodwill. Goodwill totaled $4.9 million at June 30, 2024 and\nJune 30, 2023. Goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets are not amortized on a recurring basis, but rather are subject to\nperiodic impairment testing. The provisions of Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) Topic 350 allow an entity to first assess\nqualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform the two-step quantitative goodwill impairment test.\nThe Company performs its annual impairment evaluation on June 30 or more frequently if events and circumstances indicate that the\nfair value of the banking unit is less than its carrying value. During the year ended June 30, 2024, the Company included considerations\nof the current economic environment in its evaluation, and determined that it is not more likely than not that the carrying value of\ngoodwill is impaired. No goodwill impairment exists during the year ended June 30, 2024.\nIncome Taxes\nWe are subject to the income tax laws of the various jurisdictions where we conduct business and estimate income tax expense based\non amounts expected to be owed to these various tax jurisdictions. The estimated income tax expense (benefit) is reported in the\nconsolidated statements of income. The evaluation pertaining to the tax expense and related tax asset and liability balances involves a\nhigh degree of judgment and subjectivity around the ultimate measurement and resolution of these matters.\nAccrued taxes represent the net estimated amount due to or to be received from tax jurisdictions either currently or in the future and are\nreported in other assets on our consolidated statements of financial condition. We assess the appropriate tax treatment of transactions\nand filing positions after considering statutes, regulations, judicial precedent and other pertinent information and maintain tax accruals\n33\nconsistent with our evaluation. Changes in the estimate of accrued taxes occur periodically due to changes in tax rates, interpretations\nof tax laws, the status of examinations by the tax authorities and newly enacted statutory, judicial and regulatory guidance that could\nimpact the relative merits of tax positions. These changes, when they occur, impact accrued taxes and can materially affect our operating\nresults. We regularly evaluate our uncertain tax positions and estimate the appropriate level of reserves related to each of these positions.\nAs of June 30, 2024 and 2023, we had net deferred tax assets totaling $9.6 million and $9.5 million, respectively. We use the asset and\nliability method of accounting for income taxes. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax\nconsequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their\nrespective tax bases. If currently available information raises doubt as to the realization of the deferred tax assets, a valuation allowance\nis established. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years\nin which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. We exercise significant judgment in evaluating the amount\nand timing of recognition of the resulting tax assets and liabilities. These judgments require us to make projections of future taxable\nincome. Management believes, based upon current facts, that it is more likely than not that there will be sufficient taxable income in\nfuture years to realize the deferred tax assets. The judgments and estimates we make in determining our deferred tax assets are inherently\nsubjective and are reviewed on a continual basis as regulatory and business factors change. Any reduction in estimated future taxable\nincome may require us to record a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets. A valuation allowance that results in additional\nincome tax expense in the period in which it is recognized would negatively affect earnings. Our net deferred tax assets were determined\nbased on the current enacted federal tax rate of 21%. Any possible future reduction in federal tax rates, would reduce the value of our\nnet deferred tax assets and result in immediate write-down of the net deferred tax assets though our statement of operations, the effect\nof which would be material.\nBalance Sheet Analysis\nComparison of Financial Condition at June 30, 2024 and 2023\nTotal assets decreased $28.9 million, or 3.4%, to $818.7 million at June 30, 2024, from $847.6 million at June 30, 2023, primarily due\nto a $21.0 million decrease in available for sale and held to maturity investments and a $6.9 million decrease in net loans. The Company\nused $38.0 million of cash during the year ended June 30, 2024 to repurchase shares of stock under its previously announced stock\nrepurchase programs.\nCash and cash equivalents decreased $595 thousand, or 2.9%, to $20.2 million at June 30, 2024, from $20.8 million at June 30, 2023.\nThe decrease in cash and cash equivalents was primarily due to the repurchase of 3,117,615 shares at a total cost of $38.0 million, a $5.5\nmillion decrease in deposits and $1.2 million of cash dividend payments to shareholders, partially offset by a $14.0 million increase in\nadvances from the FHLB of Pittsburgh, approximately $19.3 million of investment principal paydowns, a $6.9 million decrease in net\nloans, and $3.3 million of net proceeds from the purchase and sale of investment securities.\nInvestments\nOur investment portfolio consists primarily of corporate bonds with maturities of five to ten years, municipal securities with maturities\nof five to more than ten years and mortgage-backed securities issued by Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac or Ginnie Mae with stated final\nmaturities of 30 years or less. Total investments decreased $20.6 million, or 7.7%, to $245.8 million at June 30, 2024, from $266.4\nmillion at June 30, 2023. The decrease in investments was primarily due to approximately $19.3 million of principal paydowns of\nsecurities included in the available for sale and held to maturity portfolios and $3.3 million of net proceeds from the purchase and sale\nof investment securities, partially offset by a $1.8 million decrease in the gross unrealized loss on available for sale securities. The\nCompany remains focused on maintaining a high-quality investment portfolio that provides a steady stream of cash flows.\n34\nThe following table sets forth the amortized cost and fair value of investment securities at the dates indicated:\nAt J une 30 ,\n2024 2023\nAmortized Fair Amortized Fair\n(Dollars in thousands) Cost Value Cost Value\nSecurities available for sale:\nMortgage-backed securities $ 112,439 $ 95,125 $ 124,252 $ 106,756\nU.S. agency collateralized mortgage obligations 8,937 7,200 10,074 8,292\nU.S. government agency securities 769 693 3,881 3,932\nMunicipal bonds 19,999 14,969 20,081 14,979\nCorporate bonds 37,200 32,768 37,200 31,168\nTotal securities available for sale 179,344 150,755 195,488 165,127\nSecurities held to maturity:\nMortgage-backed securities 87,526 71,310 94,648 77,373\nU.S. government agency securities 5,482 5,469 4,982 4,880\nMunicipal bonds 48 48 60 60\nTotal securities held to maturity 93,056 76,827 99,690 82,313\nTotal investment securities $ 272,400 $ 227,582 $ 295,178 $ 247,440\nThe following tables set forth the stated maturities and weighted average yields of investment securities at June 30, 2024.

Deposits decreased $5.5 million, or 0.9%, to $629.8 million at June 30, 2024, from $635.3 million\nat June 30, 2023. The decrease in deposits was primarily due to a $31.6 million decrease in money market accounts and an $8.1 million\ndecrease in savings accounts, partially offset by a $16.2 million increase in interest bearing checking accounts and a $14.3 million\nincrease in certificate of deposit accounts.

The\ndecrease in stockholders’ equity was primarily due to the repurchase of 3,117,615 shares at a total cost of $38.0 million, or $12.18 per\nshare, during the year ended June 30, 2024 under the Company’s previously announced stock repurchase programs, the payment of cash\ndividends totaling $1.2 million, and a $226 thousand one-time cumulative effect decrease to retained earnings from the adoption of the\nCurrent Expected Credit Losses (“CECL”) accounting standard. These decreases to stockholders’ equity were partially offset by a $1.4\nmillion decrease in the accumulated other comprehensive loss component of equity related to the unrealized loss on available for sale\nsecurities and $168 thousand of net income during the year ended June 30, 2024.\n38\nResults of Operations for the Years Ended June 30, 2024 and 2023\nSummary\nThe following table sets forth the income summary for the periods indicated:\nYear End ed Ju ne 30,\nChange 2024/2023\n(Dollars in thousands) 2024 2023 $ %\nNet interest income $ 17,121 $ 23,071 $ (5,950) (25.79)%\nRecovery for credit losses (606) — (606) (100.00)\nNon-interest income 2,836 1,950 886 45.44\nNon-interest expenses 20,853 22,019 (1,166) (5.30)\nIncome tax (benefit) expense (458) 200 (658) (329.00)\nNet income $ 168 $ 2,802 $ (2,634) (94.00)\nReturn on average assets 0.02 % 0.33 %\nCore return on average assets(1) (non-GAAP) (0.02) 0.32\nReturn on average equity 0.13 1.56\nCore return on average equity(1) (non-GAAP) (0.16) 1.54\n(1) Core return on average assets and core return on average equity are non-GAAP financial measures. For a reconciliation of these\nnon-GAAP measures, see “—Non-GAAP Financial Information.”\nGeneral\nWe recorded net income of $168 thousand, or $0.02 per basic and diluted share, for the year ended June 30, 2024 compared to net\nincome of $2.8 million, or $0.22 per basic and diluted share, for the year ended June 30, 2023. We recorded a core net loss(1) of $205\nthousand, or $(0.02) per basic and diluted share, for the year ended June 30, 2024 compared to core net income(1) of $2.8 million, or\n$0.22 per basic and diluted share, for the year ended June 30, 2023.\nNet Interest Income\nFor the year ended June 30, 2024, net interest income was $17.1 million, a decrease of $6.0 million, or 25.8%, from the year ended June\n30, 2023. The decrease in net interest income was primarily due to an increase in interest expense on deposits and borrowings, partially\noffset by an increase in interest income on loans. The net interest margin measured 2.30% for the year ended June 30, 2024, compared\nto 2.97% for the year ended June 30, 2023. The decrease in the net interest margin during the year ended June 30, 2024, compared to\nthe same period in 2023, was primarily due to an increase in the average balance of borrowings and deposits and the rise in interest rates\nthat caused an increase in the cost of borrowings and deposits that exceeded the increase in interest income on loans.\nProvision for Credit losses\nDuring the year ended June 30, 2024, we recorded a $606 thousand recovery for credit losses primarily due to consistently low levels\nof net charge-offs, strong asset quality metrics and continued conservative lending practices. During the year ended June 30, 2023, we\ndid not record a provision for credit losses due to improved asset quality metrics and continued low levels of net charge-offs and non-\nperforming assets. Our ACL totaled $3.0 million, or 0.63% of total loans, as of June 30, 2024, compared to $3.3 million, or 0.69% of\ntotal loans, as of June 30, 2023. Our total credit losses coverage ratio(2), including $2.2 million of fair value marks on acquired loans\nand the $3.0 million allowance for credit losses, was 1.08% as of June 30, 2024 compared to 1.20% as of June 30, 2023, including $2.5\nmillion of fair value marks on acquired loans and the $3.3 million allowance for credit losses. As of June 30, 2024, management believes\n(1) Core net income is a non-GAAP financial measure. For a reconciliation of this non-GAAP measure, see “—Non-GAAP Financial\nInformation.”\n(2) Total credit losses coverage ratio is a non-GAAP financial measure. For a reconciliation of this non-GAAP measure, see “—Non-\nGAAP Financial Information.”\n39\nthat the allowance is maintained at a level that represents its best estimate of lifetime credit losses. Total credit losses coverage ratio is\na non-GAAP financial measure that includes the fair value mark on acquired loans.\nManagement uses available information to establish the appropriate level of the allowance for credit losses. Future additions or\nreductions to the allowance may be necessary based on estimates that are susceptible to change as a result of changes in economic\nconditions and other factors. As a result, our allowance for credit losses may not be sufficient to cover actual credit losses, and future\nprovisions for credit losses could materially adversely affect our operating results. In addition, various regulatory agencies, as an integral\npart of their examination process, periodically review our allowance for credit losses.\nNon-Interest Income\nThe following table sets forth a summary of non-interest income for the periods indicated:\nYear End ed J u ne 30,\n(Dollars in thousands) 2024 2023\nService fees $ 883 $ 843\nNet loss on sale of other real estate owned (4) —\nNet gain on sale of securities 102 —\nEarnings on bank-owned life insurance 1,244 1,106\nNet gain on disposition of premises and equipment — 398\nUnrealized gain (loss) on equity securities 387 (629)\nOther 224 232\nTotal $ 2,836 $ 1,950\nFor the year ended June 30, 2024, non-interest income totaled $2.8 million, an increase of $886 thousand, or 45.4%, from the year ended\nJune 30, 2023. The increase was primarily due to a $1.0 million increase in the unrealized gain on equity securities from a $629 thousand\nunrealized loss during the year ended June 30, 2023 to a $387 thousand unrealized gain during the year ended June 30, 2024, as well as\na $137 thousand increase in earnings on bank-owned life insurance and a $102 thousand net gain on the sale of securities recorded\nduring the year ended June 30, 2024. These increases to non-interest income were partially offset by a $398 thousand net gain on the\nsale of premises and equipment primarily associated with the sale of two properties recorded during the year ended June 30, 2023.\nNon-Interest Expense\nThe following table sets forth an analysis of non-interest expense for the periods indicated:\nYear End ed J u ne 30,\n(Dollars in thousands) 2024 2023\nSalaries and employee benefits $ 11,778 $ 12,785\nOccupancy and equipment 2,980 3,258\nData processing 2,032 1,836\nProfessional fees 841 906\nAmortization of intangible assets 163 193\nOther 3,059 3,041\nTotal $ 20,853 $ 22,019\nFor the year ended June 30, 2024, non-interest expense totaled $20.9 million, a decrease of $1.2 million, or 5.3%, from the year ended\nJune 30, 2023. The decrease in non-interest expense was primarily due to a $1.0 million decrease in salaries and employee benefits\nprimarily due to a reduction in the number of full-time employees consistent with the Company’s expense management initiatives and\na $278 thousand decrease in occupancy and equipment expense consistent with the closure of the Bank’s branch office located in\nCollingswood, New Jersey effective December 31, 2022. These decreases to non-interest expense were partially offset by a $196\nthousand increase in data processing expense.\nIncome Taxes\nFor the year ended June 30, 2024, the Company recorded a $458 thousand income tax benefit, reflecting an effective tax rate of (157.9)%,\ncompared to a provision for income taxes of $200 thousand, reflecting an effective tax rate of 6.7%, for the year ended June 30, 2023.\nThe income tax benefit recorded during the year ended June 30, 2024 was primarily due to the $290 thousand loss before income taxes\ncoupled with the $1.2 million of federal tax-exempt income recorded on bank-owned life insurance. The Company recorded a $211\n40\nthousand income tax benefit related to a refund received associated with the carryback of net operating losses under the Coronavirus\nAid, Relief, and Economic Security (“CARES”) Act during the year ended June 30, 2023.\nAverage Balances and Yields\nThe following tables present information regarding average balances of assets and liabilities, the total dollar amounts of interest income\nand dividends from average interest-earning assets, the total dollar amounts of interest expense on average interest-bearing liabilities,\nand the resulting annualized average yields and costs. The yields and costs for the periods indicated are derived by dividing income or\nexpense by the average daily balances of assets or liabilities, respectively, for the periods presented. Loan fees, including prepayment\nfees, are included in interest income on loans and are not material. Non-accrual loans are included in the average balances only.

Our most prominent risk exposures are credit risk,\ninterest rate risk and market risk. Credit risk is the risk of not collecting the interest and/or the principal balance of a loan or investment\nwhen it is due. Interest rate risk is the potential reduction of net interest income as a result of changes in interest rates. Market risk arises\nfrom fluctuations in interest rates that may result in changes in the values of financial instruments, such as available for sale securities\nthat are accounted for at fair value. Other risks that we face are operational risk, liquidity risk and reputation risk. Operational risk\nincludes risks related to fraud, regulatory compliance, processing errors, technology, and disaster recovery. Liquidity risk is the possible\ninability to fund obligations to depositors, lenders or borrowers. Reputation risk is the risk that negative publicity or press, whether true\nor not, could cause a decline in our customer base or revenue.\nManagement of Credit Risk\nThe objective of our credit risk management strategy is to quantify and manage credit risk and to limit the risk of loss resulting from an\nindividual customer default. Our credit risk management strategy focuses on conservatism, diversification within the loan portfolio and\nsignificant levels of monitoring. Our lending practices include conservative exposure limits and underwriting, extensive documentation\nand collection standards. Our credit risk management strategy also emphasizes diversification on both an industry and customer level\nas well as regular credit examinations and management reviews of large credit exposures and credits experiencing deterioration of credit\nquality.\nClassified Assets\nFDIC regulations and our Asset Classification Policy provide that loans and other assets considered to be of lesser quality be classified\nas “substandard,” “doubtful” or “loss” assets. An asset is considered “substandard” if it is inadequately protected by the current net\nworth and paying capacity of the obligor or of the collateral pledged, if any. “Substandard” assets include those characterized by the\n“distinct possibility” that the institution will sustain “some loss” if the deficiencies are not corrected. Assets classified as “doubtful”\nhave all of the weaknesses inherent in those classified as “substandard,” with the added characteristic that the weaknesses present make\n42\n“collection or liquidation in full,” on the basis of currently existing facts, conditions and values, “highly questionable and improbable.”\nAssets classified as “loss” are those considered “uncollectible” and of such little value that their continuance as assets without the\nestablishment of a specific loss reserve is not warranted. We classify an asset as “special mention” if the asset has a potential weakness\nthat warrants management’s escalated level of attention. While such assets are not impaired, management has concluded that if the\npotential weakness in the asset is not addressed, the value of the asset may deteriorate, adversely affecting the repayment of the asset.\nLoans classified as impaired for financial reporting purposes are generally those loans classified as substandard or doubtful for regulatory\nreporting purposes.\nAn insured institution is required to establish allowances for credit losses in an amount deemed prudent by management for loans\nclassified as substandard or doubtful, as well as for other problem loans. General allowances represent loss allowances which have been\nestablished to recognize the inherent losses associated with lending activities, but which, unlike specific allowances, have not been\nallocated to particular problem assets. When an insured institution classifies problem assets as “loss,” it is required to charge off such\namounts. An institution’s determination as to the classification of its assets and the amount of its valuation allowances is subject to\nreview by the FDIC and the Pennsylvania Department of Banking and Securities.\nThe following table sets forth information with respect to our non-performing assets at the dates indicated.\nAt J une 30,\n(Dollars in thousands) 2024 2023\nNon-accrual loans:\nResidential real estate loans:\nOne- to four-family $ 1,221 $ 2,090\nHome equity and HELOCs 426 —\nResidential construction — —\nTotal residential real estate loans 1,647 2,090\nCommercial real estate loans:\nOne- to four-family investor 1,007 832\nMulti-family 194 251\nCommercial non-residential 337 778\nCommercial construction and land — —\nTotal commercial real estate loans 1,538 1,861\nCommercial loans — —\nConsumer loans 126 82\nTotal non-accrual loans 3,311 4,033\nAccruing loans past due 90 days or more:\nResidential real estate loans:\nOne- to four-family — —\nHome equity and HELOCs — —\nResidential construction — —\nTotal residential real estate loans — —\nCommercial real estate loans:\nMulti-family — —\nCommercial non-residential — —\nCommercial construction and land. — —\nTotal commercial real estate loans — —\nCommercial loans — —\nConsumer loans — —\nTotal accruing loans past due 90 days or more — —\nTotal non-performing loans $ 3,311 $ 4,033\nReal estate owned — —\nTotal non-performing assets $ 3,311 $ 4,033\nTotal non-performing loans to total loans 0.70 % 0.84 %\nTotal non-performing assets to total assets 0.40 0.49\n43\nDuring the year ended June 30, 2024, nonperforming assets decreased 20.7% to $3.3 million from $4.2 million as of June 30, 2023. The\nCompany’s ratio of non-performing assets to total assets decreased to 0.40% as of June 30, 2024 from 0.49% as of June 30, 2023.\nTotal nonperforming loans consisted of 30 loans to 27 unrelated borrowers as of June 30, 2024 and June 30, 2023. Interest income on\nnon-performing loans would have increased by approximately $167 thousand and $192 thousand during the years ended June 30, 2024\nand 2023, respectively, if these loans had performed in accordance with their terms during the respective periods. There were no loans\ngreater than 90 days delinquent that remained on accrual status as of June 30, 2024 and 2023.\nThere are circumstances when foreclosure and liquidations are the remedy pursued. However, from time to time, as part of our loss\nmitigation strategy, we may renegotiate the loan terms (i.e., interest rate, structure, repayment term, etc.) based on the economic or legal\nreasons related to the borrower’s financial difficulties. We had no loans modified to borrowers experiencing financial difficulties during\nthe years ended June 30, 2024 and 2023.\nAt June 30, 2024, none of our 30 substandard loans with an aggregate balance of $3.3 million were considered loans modified to\nborrowers experiencing financial difficulties and were included in nonperforming assets. At June 30, 2023, none of our 30 substandard\nloans with an aggregate balance of $4.0 million were considered loans modified to borrowers experiencing financial difficulties and\nwere included in nonperforming assets.\nThe following table provides information about delinquencies in our loan portfolio at the dates indicated:\nAt Ju ne 30 ,\n2024 2023\nDays Past Due Days Past Due\n(Dollars in thousands) 30-59 60-89 90 or more 30-59 60-89 90 or more\nResidential real estate loans:\nOne- to four-family $ 153 $ 539 $ 162 $ 290 $ 457 $ 567\nHome equity and HELOCs 49 — — — — —\nResidential construction — — — — — —\nCommercial real estate loans:\nOne- to four-family investor 85 930 — — 752 —\nMulti-family — — — 251 — —\nCommercial non-residential 60 — 337 — 322 778\nCommercial construction and land — — — — — —\nCommercial loans — — — — — —\nConsumer loans — — 18 — 13 —\nTotal $ 347 $ 1,469 $ 517 $ 541 $ 1,544 $ 1,345\nThe following table summarizes classified and criticized assets of all portfolio types at the dates indicated:\nAt J une 30,\n(Dollars in thousands) 2024 2023\nClassified loans:\nSubstandard $ 3,311 $ 4,033\nDoubtful — —\nLoss — —\nTotal classified loans 3,311 4,033\nSpecial mention 889 1,231\nTotal criticized loans(1) $ 4,200 $ 5,264\n(1) Criticized residential real estate and consumer loans include all residential real estate and consumer loans that were on non-accrual\nstatus and all residential and consumer loans that were greater than 90 days delinquent on the dates presented.\nOn the basis of management’s review of its assets, at June 30, 2024 and 2023, we classified $889 thousand and $1.2 million, respectively,\nof our assets as special mention and $3.3 million and $4.0 million, respectively, of our assets as substandard. We classified none of our\nassets as doubtful or loss at June 30, 2024 or at June 30, 2023. The loan portfolio is reviewed on a regular basis to determine whether\nany loans require classification in accordance with applicable regulations. Not all classified assets constitute nonperforming assets.\n44\nAllowance for Credit Losses on Loans\nThe Company maintains its ACL at a level that management believes to be appropriate to absorb estimated lifetime credit losses as of\nthe date of the Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition. The Company established its allowance in accordance with the guidance\nincluded in ASC 326, Financial Instruments – Credit Losses. The ACL is a valuation reserve established and maintained by charges\nagainst income and is deducted from the amortized cost basis of loans to present the net amount expected to be collected on the loans.\nLoans, or portions thereof, are charged-off against the ACL when they are deemed uncollectible. Expected recoveries do not exceed\nthe aggregate amounts previously charged-off and expected to be charged-off. The ACL is an estimate of lifetime expected credit losses,\nthat considers our historical loss experience, the historical loss experience of a peer group of banks identified by management, current\nconditions and the forecast of future economic conditions. The determination of an appropriate ACL is inherently subjective and may\nhave significant changes from period to period. The methodology for determining the ACL has two main components: evaluation of\nexpected credit losses for certain groups of homogeneous loans that share similar risk characteristics and evaluation of loans that do not\nshare risk characteristics with other loans. The ACL is measured on a collective (pool) basis when similar characteristics exist. The\nCompany’s loan portfolio is segmented by loan types that have similar risk characteristics and behave similarly during economic cycles.\nHistorical credit loss experience is the basis for the estimate of expected credit losses. We apply our historical loss rates and the historical\nloss rates of a group of peer banks identified by management to pools of loans with similar risk characteristics using the Weighted-\nAverage Remaining Maturity (“WARM”) method. The remaining contractual life of the pools of loans with similar risk characteristics\nis adjusted by expected scheduled payments and prepayments. After consideration of the historical loss calculation, management applies\nqualitative adjustments to reflect the current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts not already reflected in the historical\nloss information. Our reasonable and supportable forecast adjustment is based on a regional economic indicator obtained from the St.\nLouis Federal Reserve economic database. The Company selected eight qualitative metrics which were correlated with the Bank and\nits peer group’s historical loss patterns. The eight qualitative metrics include: changes in lending policies and procedures, changes in\nnational and local economic conditions as well as business conditions, changes in the nature, complexity, and volume of the portfolio,\nchanges in the experience, ability, and depth of lenders and lending management, changes in the volume and severity of past due and\nclassified loans, changes in the quality of the Bank’s loan review system, changes in the value of collateral securing the loans, and\nchanges in or the existence of credit concentrations. The adjustments are weighted for relevance before applying to each pool of loans.\nEach quarter, management reviews the recommended adjustment factors and applies any additional adjustments based on local and\ncurrent conditions.\nThe Company has elected to exclude $2.0 million of accrued interest receivable as of June 30, 2024 from the measurement of its ACL.\nWhen a loan is placed on non-accrual status, any outstanding accrued interest is reversed against interest income. Accrued interest on\nloans is reported in the accrued interest receivable and other assets line on the consolidated statements of financial condition.\nThe ACL for individual loans begins with the use of normal credit review procedures to identify whether a loan no longer shares similar\nrisk characteristics with other pooled loans and, therefore, should be individually assessed. We evaluate all commercial loans that meet\nthe following criteria: (1) when it is determined that foreclosure is probable, (2) substandard, doubtful and nonperforming loans when\nrepayment is expected to be provided substantially through the operation or sale of the collateral, (3) when it is determined by\nmanagement that a loan does not share similar risk characteristics with other loans. Credit loss estimates are calculated based on the\nfollowing three acceptable methods for measuring the ACL: 1) the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan’s\noriginal effective interest rate; 2) the loan’s observable market price; or 3) the fair value of the collateral when the loan is collateral\ndependent. Our individual loan evaluations consist primarily of the fair value of collateral method because most of our loans are collateral\ndependent. Collateral values are discounted to consider disposition costs when appropriate. A charge-off is recorded if the fair value of\nthe loan is less than the loan balance.\nThe ACL analysis is presented and discussed quarterly with the current expected credit losses (“CECL”) committee, which consists of\nexecutive management, including the CEO, and is also presented and reviewed with the board of directors. In addition, the FDIC and\nthe Pennsylvania Department of Banking and Securities, as an integral part of their examination process, periodically review our ACL.\n45\nThe following table sets forth the breakdown of the allowance for credit losses by loan category at the dates indicated:\nAt J une 30,\n2024 2023\n% of % of\nAllowance % of Allowance % of\nAmount to Allowance Amount to Allowance\nTotal to Loans in Total to Loans in\n(Dollars in thousands) Amount Allowance Category Amount Allowance Category\nResidential real estate loans:\nOne- to four-family $ 325 10.87 % 0.25 % $ 486 14.67 % 0.36 %\nHome equity and HELOCs 100 3.35 0.33 113 3.42 0.35\nResidential construction 31 1.04 0.35 214 6.46 2.35\nCommercial real estate loans:\nOne- to four-family investor 268 8.97 0.29 569 17.17 0.58\nMulti-family 32 1.07 0.20 89 2.69 0.58\nCommercial non-residential 1,533 51.28 0.97 1,420 42.85 0.90\nCommercial construction and land 147 4.92 0.65 281 8.48 1.80\nCommercial loans 304 10.17 2.01 82 2.48 0.53\nConsumer loans 249 8.33 12.97 59 1.78 2.95\nTotal allowance for credit losses $ 2,989 100.00 % 0.63 % $ 3,313 100.00 % 0.69 %\n46\nThe following table sets forth an analysis of the activity in the allowance for credit losses for the periods indicated:\nAt or For the Y ear E nd ed June 30,\n(Dollars in thousands) 2024 2023\nAllowance at beginning of period $ 3,313 $ 3,409\nImpact of adopting ASU 2016-13 243 —\nRecovery for credit losses (583) —\nCharge-offs:\nResidential real estate loans:\nOne- to four-family — (79)\nHome equity and HELOCs — —\nResidential construction — —\nTotal residential real estate loans — (79)\nCommercial real estate loans:\nOne- to four-family investor — —\nMulti-family — —\nCommercial non-residential — —\nCommercial construction and land — —\nTotal commercial real estate loans — —\nCommercial loans — —\nConsumer loans (13) (32)\nTotal charge-offs (13) (111)\nRecoveries:\nResidential real estate loans:\nOne- to four-family — —\nHome equity and HELOCs — —\nResidential construction — —\nTotal residential real estate loans — —\nCommercial real estate loans:\nOne- to four-family investor — —\nMulti-family — —\nCommercial non-residential — —\nCommercial construction and land — —\nTotal commercial real estate loans — —\nCommercial loans — —\nConsumer loans 29 15\nTotal recoveries 29 15\nNet (charge-offs) recoveries 16 (96)\nAllowance at end of period $ 2,989 $ 3,313\nTotal loans(1) $ 473,561 $ 480,856\nAverage loans outstanding 476,507 483,802\nRatio of allowance to non-accruing loans 90.27 % 82.15 %\nRatio of allowance to total loans 0.63 % 0.69 %\nRatio of net recoveries (charge-offs) to average loans\nOne- to four-family — % (0.06)%\nHome equity and HELOCs — % — %\nResidential construction — % — %\nOne- to four-family investor — % — %\nMulti-family — % — %\nCommercial non-residential — % — %\nCommercial construction and land — % — %\nCommercial loans — % — %\nConsumer loans 0.82 % (0.80)%\nTotal ratio of net recoveries (charge-offs) to average loans — % (0.02)%\nThe allowance for credit losses decreased $324 thousand to $3.0 million at June 30, 2024 from $3.3 million at June 30, 2023. During\nthe year ended June 30, 2024, the changes in the provision for credit losses for each category of loan type were primarily due to\nfluctuations in the outstanding balance of each category of loans collectively evaluated for impairment and the adoption of ASU 2016-\n13. The overall decrease in the allowance can be primarily attributed to consistently low levels of net charge-offs, strong asset quality\nmetrics and continued conservative lending practices.\nThe allowance for credit losses decreased $96 thousand to $3.3 million at June 30, 2023 from $3.4 million at June 30, 2022. During the\nyear ended June 30, 2023, the changes in the provision for loan losses for each category of loan type were primarily due to fluctuations\nin the outstanding balance of each category of loans collectively evaluated for impairment. The overall decrease in the allowance can\nbe primarily attributed to improved asset quality metrics, including continued low levels of net charge-offs and non-performing assets.\n47\nAllowance for Credit Losses on Unfunded Loan Commitments\nThe Company estimates expected credit losses over the contractual period in which the Bank is exposed to credit risk via a contractual\nobligation to extend credit unless that obligation is unconditionally cancellable by the Bank. The allowance for credit losses on unfunded\nloan commitments is included in accrued interest payable and other liabilities in the Company’s Statements of Financial Condition and\nis adjusted through credit loss expense. The estimate includes consideration of the likelihood that funding will occur and an estimate of\nexpected credit losses on commitments expected to be funded over its estimated life.\nAllowance for Credit Losses on Held to Maturity Securities\nThe Company accounts for its held to maturity securities in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 326-20,\nFinancial Instruments – Credit Loss – Measured at Amortized Cost, which requires that the Company measure expected credit losses\non held to maturity debt securities on a collective basis by major security type. The estimate of expected credit losses considers historical\ncredit loss information that is adjusted for current economic conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts.\nThe Company classifies its held to maturity debt securities into the following major security types: mortgage-backed securities, U.S.\ngovernment agency securities and municipal bonds. Generally, the mortgage-backed securities and U.S. government agency securities\nare government guaranteed with a history of no credit losses and the municipal bonds are highly rated with a history of no credit losses.\nCredit ratings of the municipal bonds are reviewed on a quarterly basis. Based on the government guarantee, our historical experience\nincluding no credit losses, and the high credit rating of our municipal bonds, the Company determined that an allowance for credit losses\non its held to maturity portfolio is not required.\nAccrued interest receivable on held to maturity debt securities totaled $170 thousand as of June 30, 2024 and is included within accrued\ninterest receivable and other assets on the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition. This amount is excluded from\nthe estimate of expected credit losses. Generally, held to maturity debt securities are classified as nonaccrual when the contractual\npayment of principal or interest has become 90 days past due or management has serious doubts about the further collectability of\nprincipal or interest. When held to maturity debt securities are placed on nonaccrual status, unpaid interest credited to income is reversed\nagainst interest income.\nAllowance for Credit Losses on Available for Sale Securities\nThe Company measures expected credit losses on available for sale debt securities when the Bank intends to sell, or when it is not more\nlikely than not that it will be required to sell, the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis. If either of the criteria regarding\nintent or requirement to sell is met, the amortized cost basis of the security is written down to fair value through income. For available\nfor sale debt securities that do not meet the previously mentioned criteria, the Company evaluates whether the decline in fair value has\nresulted from credit losses or other factors. In making this assessment, the Company considers the extent to which fair value is less than\namortized cost, any changes to the rating of the security by a rating agency, and adverse conditions specifically related to the security,\namong other factors. If this evaluation indicates that a credit loss exists, the present value of cash flows expected to be collected from\nthe security are compared to the amortized cost basis of the security. If the present value of cash flows expected to be collected is less\nthan the amortized cost basis, a credit loss exists and an allowance for credit losses is recorded for the credit loss, equal to the amount\nthat the fair value is less than the amortized cost basis. Any impairment that has not been recorded through an allowance for credit\nlosses is recognized in other comprehensive income.\nThe ACL on available for sale debt securities is included within securities available for sale on the Consolidated Statements of Financial\nCondition. Changes in the allowance for credit losses are recorded within provision for credit losses on the Consolidated Statements of\nIncome. Losses are charged against the allowance when the Company believes the collectability of an available for sale security is in\njeopardy or when either of the criteria regarding intent or requirement to sell is met.\nAccrued interest receivable on available for sale debt securities totaled $662 thousand as of June 30, 2024 and is included within accrued\ninterest receivable and other assets on the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition. This amount is excluded from\nthe estimate of expected credit losses. Generally, available for sale debt securities are classified as nonaccrual when the contractual\npayment of principal or interest has become 90 days past due or management has serious doubts about the further collectability of\nprincipal or interest. When available for sale debt securities are placed on nonaccrual status, unpaid interest credited to income is reversed\nagainst interest income.\n48\nInterest Rate Risk Management\nInterest rate risk is defined as the exposure to current and future earnings and capital that arises from adverse movements in interest\nrates. Depending on a bank’s asset/liability structure, adverse movements in interest rates could be either rising or falling interest rates.\nFor example, a bank with predominantly long-term fixed-rate assets and short-term liabilities could have an adverse earnings exposure\nto a rising rate environment. Conversely, a short-term or variable-rate asset base funded by longer term liabilities could be negatively\naffected by falling rates. This is referred to as re-pricing or maturity mismatch risk.\nInterest rate risk also arises from changes in the slope of the yield curve (yield curve risk), from imperfect correlations in the adjustment\nof rates earned and paid on different instruments with otherwise similar re-pricing characteristics (basis risk), and from interest rate\nrelated options embedded in our assets and liabilities (option risk).\nOur objective is to manage our interest rate risk by determining whether a given movement in interest rates affects our net interest\nincome and the market value of our portfolio equity in a positive or negative way and to execute strategies to maintain interest rate risk\nwithin established limits. The results at June 30, 2024 indicate a level of risk outside the parameters of our model for net interest income\nvolatility in year one and within the parameters of our model in year two. Our management believes that the June 30, 2024 results\nindicate a profile that reflects interest rate risk exposures in both rising and declining rate environments for both net interest income and\neconomic value.\nModel Simulation Analysis. We view interest rate risk from two different perspectives. The traditional accounting perspective, which\ndefines and measures interest rate risk as the change in net interest income and earnings caused by a change in interest rates, provides\nthe best view of short-term interest rate risk exposure. We also view interest rate risk from an economic perspective, which defines and\nmeasures interest rate risk as the change in the market value of portfolio equity caused by changes in the values of assets and liabilities,\nwhich fluctuate due to changes in interest rates. The market value of portfolio equity, also referred to as the economic value of equity,\nis defined as the present value of future cash flows from existing assets, minus the present value of future cash flows from existing\nliabilities.\nThese two perspectives give rise to income simulation and economic value simulation, each of which presents a unique picture of our\nrisk of any movement in interest rates. Income simulation identifies the timing and magnitude of changes in income resulting from\nchanges in prevailing interest rates over a short-term time horizon (usually one or two years). Economic value simulation reflects the\ninterest rate sensitivity of assets and liabilities in a more comprehensive fashion, reflecting all future time periods. It can identify the\nquantity of interest rate risk as a function of the changes in the economic values of assets and liabilities, and the corresponding change\nin the economic value of equity of the Bank. Both types of simulation assist in identifying, measuring, monitoring and controlling\ninterest rate risk and are employed by management to ensure that variations in interest rate risk exposure will be maintained within\npolicy guidelines.\nWe produce these simulation reports and discuss them with our management Asset and Liability Committee and Board Risk Committee\non at least a quarterly basis. The simulation reports compare baseline (no interest rate change) to the results of an interest rate shock, to\nillustrate the specific impact of the interest rate scenario tested on income and equity. The model, which incorporates all asset and\nliability rate information, simulates the effect of various interest rate movements on income and equity value. The reports identify and\nmeasure our interest rate risk exposure present in our current asset/liability structure. Management considers a static (current position)\nanalysis as well as non-parallel and gradual changes in interest rates and the yield curve in assessing interest rate exposures.\nIf the results produce quantifiable interest rate risk exposure beyond our limits, then the testing will have served as a monitoring\nmechanism to allow us to initiate asset/liability strategies designed to reduce and therefore mitigate interest rate risk. The table below\nsets forth an approximation of our interest rate risk exposure. The simulation uses projected repricing of assets and liabilities at June 30,\n2024. The income simulation analysis presented represents a one-year impact of the interest scenario assuming a static balance sheet.\nVarious assumptions are made regarding the prepayment speed and optionality of loans, investment securities and deposits, which are\nbased on analysis and market information. The assumptions regarding optionality, such as prepayments of loans and the effective lives\nand repricing of non-maturity deposit products, are documented periodically through evaluation of current market conditions and\nhistorical correlations to our specific asset and liability products under varying interest rate scenarios. Because the prospective effects\nof hypothetical interest rate changes are based on a number of assumptions, these computations should not be relied upon as indicative\nof actual results. While we believe such assumptions to be reasonable, assumed prepayment rates may not approximate actual future\nprepayment activity on mortgage-backed securities or agency issued collateralized obligations (secured by one- to four-family loans and\nmultifamily loans). Further, the computation does not reflect any actions that management may undertake in response to changes in\ninterest rates and assumes a constant asset base. Management periodically reviews the rate assumptions based on existing and projected\neconomic conditions and consults with industry experts to validate our model and simulation results.\n49\nThe table below sets forth, as of June 30, 2024, the Company’s net portfolio value, the estimated changes in our net portfolio value and\nnet interest income that would result from the designated instantaneous parallel changes in market interest rates.\nTwelve Month\nNet Interest Net Portfolio\nIncome Value\nPercent Estimated Percent\nChange in Interest Rates (Basis Points) of Change NPV of Change\n+200 (12.31)% $ 149,468 (2.89)%\n+100 (6.10) 151,679 (1.45)\n0 — 153,918 —\n-100 3.57 153,674 (0.16)\n-200 7.21 153,483 (0.28)\nAs of June 30, 2024, based on the scenarios above, net interest income would decrease by approximately 6.10% and 12.31% in a rising\ninterest rate environment. One-year net interest income would increase by approximately 3.57% and 7.21% in a declining interest rate\nenvironment.\nEconomic value at risk would be negatively impacted by both a rise and a decline in interest rates. We have established an interest rate\nfloor of zero percent for measuring interest rate risk.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nWe maintain liquid assets at levels we believe are adequate to meet our liquidity needs. The Bank’s liquidity ratio was 38.5% as of June\n30, 2024 compared to 41.7% as of June 30, 2023. We adjust our liquidity levels to fund deposit outflows, pay real estate taxes on\nmortgage loans, repay our borrowings, and to fund loan commitments. We also adjust liquidity as appropriate to meet asset and liability\nmanagement objectives. Our liquidity ratio is calculated as the sum of total cash and cash equivalents and unencumbered investments\nsecurities divided by the sum of total deposits and advances from the FHLB of Pittsburgh. The Bank maintains a liquidity ratio policy\nthat requires this metric to be above 10.0% to provide for the effective management of extension risk and other interest rate risks.\nOur primary sources of liquidity are deposits, amortization and prepayment of loans and mortgage-backed securities, maturities of\ninvestment securities, other short-term investments, earnings, and funds provided from operations. While scheduled principal\nrepayments on loans and mortgage-backed securities are a relatively predictable source of funds, deposit flows and loan prepayments\nare greatly influenced by market interest rates, economic conditions, and rates offered by our competition. We set the interest rates on\nour deposits to maintain a desired level of total deposits. In addition, we invest excess funds in short-term interest-earning assets, which\nprovide liquidity to meet lending requirements.\nOur cash flows are derived from operating activities, investing activities and financing activities as reported in our Consolidated\nStatements of Cash Flows included with the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nOur primary investing activities are the origination of one- to four-family, non-residential and multi-family real estate and other loans\nand the purchase of investment securities. For the year ended June 30, 2024, our net decrease in loans (principal payments and payoffs\nexceeded originations) totaled $6.9 million compared to a $2.0 million increase for the year ended June 30, 2023. For the years ended\nJune 30, 2024 and 2023, we did not purchase or sell any loans. Cash received from the sales, calls, maturities and pay-downs on securities\ntotaled $24.8 million and $19.0 million for the years ended June 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. We purchased $2.2 million and $9.8\nmillion of securities during the years ended June 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\nDeposit flows are generally affected by the level of interest rates we offer, the interest rates and products offered by local competitors,\nand other factors. Total deposits decreased $5.5 million during the year ended June 30, 2024 primarily due to a $31.6 million decrease\nin money market accounts and an $8.1 million decrease in savings accounts, partially offset by a $16.2 million increase in interest\nbearing checking accounts and a $14.3 million increase in certificate of deposit accounts. Total deposits increased $28.6 million during\nthe year ended June 30, 2023 primarily due to an increase in money market accounts and non-core time deposits. The significant rise\nin interest rates during the Company’s fiscal year ended June 30, 2023 and elevated rate environment during the fiscal year ended June\n30, 2024 created a highly competitive market for deposits and created a shift in our depositors’ preference to these products.\nLiquidity management is both a daily and long-term function of business management. If we require funds beyond our ability to generate\nthem internally, borrowing agreements exist with the FHLB of Pittsburgh to provide advances. As a member of the FHLB of Pittsburgh,\n50\nwe are required to own capital stock in the FHLB of Pittsburgh and are authorized to apply for advances on the security of such stock\nand certain of our mortgage loans and other assets (principally securities which are obligations of, or guaranteed by, the United States),\nprovided certain standards related to credit-worthiness have been met. We had an available borrowing limit of $287.3 million and $295.0\nmillion from the FHLB of Pittsburgh as of June 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. There were $48.0 million and $34.0 million,\nrespectively, of FHLB advances outstanding at June 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\nAt June 30, 2024, we had outstanding commitments to originate loans of $15.7 million, unfunded commitments under lines of credit of\n$65.7 million and $86 thousand of standby letters of credit. At June 30, 2024, certificates of deposit scheduled to mature in less than\none year totaled $154.3 million. Based on prior experience, management believes that a significant portion of such deposits will remain\nwith us, although there can be no assurance that this will be the case. In the event a significant portion of our deposits are not retained\nby us, we will have to utilize other funding sources, such as FHLB advances, in order to maintain our level of assets. Alternatively, we\ncould reduce our level of liquid assets, such as our cash and cash equivalents. In addition, the cost of such deposits may be significantly\nhigher if market interest rates are higher at the time of renewal.\nThe Company is a separate legal entity from the Bank and must provide for its own liquidity. In addition to its operating expenses, the\nCompany is responsible for paying any dividends declared to its stockholders, interest and principal on outstanding debt, if any, and for\nstock repurchases under the Company’s previously announced stock repurchase programs. The Company’s primary source of income\nis dividends received from the Bank. At June 30, 2024, the Company had liquid assets of $6.2 million.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nFor the years ended June 30, 2024 and 2023, we did not engage in any off-balance sheet transactions reasonably likely to have a material\nadverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash-flows.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nFor a discussion of the impact of recent accounting pronouncements, see Note 2 to the notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\nof the Company.\nImpact of Inflation and Changing Prices\nThe consolidated financial statements and related notes of the Company have been prepared in accordance with GAAP, which generally\nrequires the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars without consideration for changes in\nthe relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation. The impact of inflation is reflected in the increased cost of our\noperations. Unlike industrial companies, our assets and liabilities are primarily monetary in nature. As a result, changes in market interest\nrates have a greater impact on performance than the effects of inflation.\nNon-GAAP Financial Information\nWe prepare our financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP. To supplement our financial information presented in accordance\nwith U.S. GAAP, we provide the non-GAAP financial measures discussed below which are used to evaluate our performance and\nexclude the effects of certain transactions and one-time events that we believe are unrelated to our core business and not necessarily\nindicative of our current performance or financial position. Management believes excluding these items facilitates greater visibility into\nour core businesses and underlying trends that may, to some extent, be obscured by inclusion of such items.\n51\nCore Net Income, Core Return on Average Assets, and Core Return on Average Equity\nCore net income excludes certain pre-tax adjustments and the tax impact of such adjustments, and income tax benefits. Core return on\naverage assets and core return on average equity represent our core net income divided by average assets and average equity,\nrespectively. Management believes that the presentation of these non-GAAP measures assists investors in understanding the impact of\nnon-recurring items on our net income and return on average assets and our return on average equity ratios. The following table provides\na reconciliation of our core net income and our core return on average assets and core return on average equity ratios for each of the\nperiods where these non-GAAP measures are presented:\nFor the Year End ed June 30,\n2024 2023\nCalculation of core net income, core return on average assets, and core return on\naverage equity\nNet income (GAAP) $ 168 $ 2,802\nLess pre-tax adjustments:\nNet loss on sale of other real estate owned 4 -\nNet gain on sale of securities (102) -\nNet gain on disposition of premises and equipment - (398)\nUnrealized (gain) loss on equity securities (387) 629\nTax impact of pre-tax adjustments 112 (53)\nIncome tax benefit adjustment - (211)\nCore net (loss) income (non-GAAP) $ (205) $ 2,769\nBasic average common shares outstanding 9,017,723 12,661,882\nDiluted average common shares outstanding 9,074,910 12,692,614\nBasic and diluted earnings per share (GAAP) $ 0.02 $ 0.22\nBasic and diluted core (loss) earnings per share (non-GAAP) $ (0.02) $ 0.22\nAverage assets $ 826,926 $ 860,279\nReturn on average assets (GAAP) 0.02 % 0.33 %\nCore (loss) return on average assets (non-GAAP) (0.02)% 0.32 %\nAverage equity $ 131,848 $ 179,842\nReturn on average equity (GAAP) 0.13 % 1.56 %\nCore (loss) return on average equity (non-GAAP) (0.16)% 1.54 %\nTotal Credit Losses Coverage Ratio\nTotal Credit Losses Coverage Ratio represents the total of our allowance for credit losses and the fair value mark on acquired loans\ndivided by total loans excluding the fair value mark on acquired loans. Management believes the total credit losses coverage ratio\nhelps management and investors better understand the total coverage for credit losses on loans. This non-GAAP data should be\nconsidered in addition to results prepared in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles in the U.S. (GAAP), and\nis not a substitute for, or superior to, GAAP results. The following table provides a reconciliation of the total credit losses coverage\nratio to allowance for credit losses to total loans, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, for the periods presented.\nAs of June 30,\nCalculation of the total credit losses coverage ratio: 2024 2023\nAllowance for credit losses $ 2,989 $ 3,313\nPurchase accounting fair value mark 2,171 2,488\nTotal credit losses coverage $ 5,160 $ 5,801\nGross loans receivable $ 473,561 $ 480,856\nGross loans receivable, excluding purchase accounting fair value mark $ 475,732 $ 483,344\nAllowance for credit losses to total loans (GAAP) 0.63% 0.69%\nTotal credit losses coverage to total loans (non-GAAP) 1.08% 1.20%\n52\nITEM 7A.

CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL\nDISCLOSURE\nNot applicable.\nITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nUnder the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer,\nwe evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and\n15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based upon that evaluation, the\nChief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of the end of the period covered by this report, our disclosure\ncontrols and procedures were effective to ensure (1) that information required to be disclosed in the reports that the Company files or\nsubmits under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified\nin the SEC’s rules and forms; and (2) that they are alerted in a timely manner about material information relating to the Company\nrequired to be filed in its periodic Securities and Exchange Commission filings.\nEvaluation of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nThe Company’s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. The\ninternal control process has been designed under our supervision to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial\nreporting and the preparation of the Company’s financial statements for external reporting purposes in accordance with accounting\nprinciples generally accepted in the United States of America.\nManagement conducted an assessment of the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of June 30,\n2024, utilizing the framework established in the 2013 Internal Control – Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring\nOrganizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Based on this assessment, management has determined that the Company’s\ninternal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2024 were effective.\nOur internal control over financial reporting includes policies and procedures that pertain to the maintenance of records that accurately\nand fairly reflect, in reasonable detail, transactions and dispositions of assets; and provide reasonable assurances that: (1) transactions\nare recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in\nthe United States; (2) receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and the directors\nof the Company; and (3) unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the Company’s assets that could have a material effect on the\nCompany’s financial statements are prevented or timely detected.\nAll internal control systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations. Therefore, even those systems determined to be\neffective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation. Also, projections of\nany evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in\nconditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nThis Annual Report does not include an attestation report of the Company’s registered public accounting firm regarding internal control\nover financial reporting. Management’s report was not subject to attestation by the Company’s registered public accounting firm\npursuant to rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission that permit the Company to provide only management’s report in this\nAnnual Report.\n53\nChanges in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nDuring the quarter or year ended June 30, 2024, there were no changes in the Company’s internal controls over financial reporting that\nhave materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal controls over financial reporting.\nITEM 9B. OTHER INFORMATION\nDuring the three months ended June 30, 2024, no director or officer of the Company adopted or terminated any “Rule 10b5-1 trading\narrangement,” or any “non-Rule 10b-5 trading arrangement,” as such terms are defined in Item 408(a) of Regulation S-K.\nITEM 9C.

FORM 10-K SUMMARY\nNone.\n56\nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\nTo the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of William Penn Bancorporation\nOpinion on the Financial Statements\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated statements of financial condition of William Penn Bancorporation and\nsubsidiaries (the “Company”) as of June 30, 2024 and 2023; the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income\n(loss), changes in stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for the years then ended; and the related notes to the consolidated financial\nstatements (collectively, the financial statements). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects,\nthe financial position of the Company as of June 30, 2024 and 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the\nyears then ended, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\nChange in Accounting Principle\nAs discussed in Note 2 to the financial statements, the Company changed its method of accounting for credit losses effective July\n1, 2023, due to the adoption of Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Topic 326, Financial Instruments – Credit Losses.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the\nCompany’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company\nAccounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent, with respect to the Company, in\naccordance with U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission\nand the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the\naudit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error\nor fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial\nreporting. As part of our audits, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for\nthe purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly,\nwe express no such opinion.\nOur audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due\nto error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis,\nevidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting\nprinciples used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial\nstatements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nWe have served as the Company’s auditor since 2008.\nCranberry Township, Pennsylvania\nSeptember 5, 2024\nS.R.

to be the successor to\nWilliam Penn Bancorp, Inc. (“William Penn Bancorp”) upon completion of the second-step conversion of William Penn Bank (the\n“Bank”) from the two-tier mutual holding company structure to the stock holding company structure. William Penn, MHC was the\nformer mutual holding company for William Penn Bancorp prior to completion of the second-step conversion. In conjunction with the\nsecond-step conversion, each of William Penn, MHC and William Penn Bancorp ceased to exist. The second-step conversion was\ncompleted on March 24, 2021, at which time the Company sold, for gross proceeds of $126.4 million, a total of 12,640,035 shares of\ncommon stock at $10.00 per share. As part of the second-step conversion, each of the existing 776,647 outstanding shares of William\nPenn Bancorp common stock owned by persons other than William Penn, MHC was converted into 3.2585 shares of Company common\nstock. In addition, $5.4 million of cash held by William Penn, MHC was transferred to the Company and recorded as an increase to\nadditional paid-in capital following the completion of the second-step conversion.\nIn connection with the second-step conversion offering, and as previously disclosed, the William Penn Bank Employee Stock Ownership\nPlan (“ESOP”) trustees subscribed for, and intended to purchase, on behalf of the ESOP, 8% of the shares of the Company common\nstock sold in the offering and to fund its stock purchase through a loan from the Company equal to 100% of the aggregate purchase price\nof the common stock. As previously disclosed, as a result of the second-step conversion offering being oversubscribed in the first tier\nof subscription priorities, the ESOP trustees were unable to purchase shares of the Company’s common stock in the second-step\nconversion offering. Subsequent to the completion of the second-step conversion on March 24, 2021, the ESOP trustees purchased\n881,130 shares, or $10.1 million, of the Company’s common stock in the open market. The ESOP did not purchase any additional\nshares of Company common stock in connection with the second-step conversion and offering.\nThe Company owns 100% of the outstanding common stock of the Bank, a Pennsylvania chartered stock savings bank. The Bank offers\nconsumer and commercial banking services to individuals, businesses, and nonprofit organizations throughout the Delaware Valley area\nthrough twelve full-service branch offices in Bucks and Philadelphia Counties in Pennsylvania, and Burlington, Camden, and Mercer\nCounties in New Jersey. William Penn Bancorporation is subject to regulation and supervision by the Board of Governors of the Federal\nReserve System. The Bank is supervised and regulated by the FDIC and the Pennsylvania Department of Banking and Securities.\nNote 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\nPrinciples of Consolidation and Basis of Presentation\nThe consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company, and its wholly owned subsidiary, the Bank, as well as the\nBank’s wholly owned subsidiary, WPSLA. WPSLA is a Delaware corporation organized in April 2000 to hold certain investment\nsecurities for the Bank. At June 30, 2024, WPSLA held $235.4 million of the Company’s $243.8 million investment securities portfolio.\nAll significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated. Management makes significant operating decisions based\nupon the analysis of the entire Company and financial performance is evaluated on a company-wide basis. Accordingly, the various\nfinancial services and products offered are aggregated into one reportable operating segment: community banking as under guidance in\nthe Financial Accounting Standards Board (the “FASB”) ASC Topic 280 for Segment Reporting.\nUse of Estimates in the Preparation of Financial Statements\nThese consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States\nof America (“GAAP”). The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to\nmake estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities\nat the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of income and expenses during the reporting period. The significant\nestimates include the allowance for credit losses, goodwill, intangible assets, income taxes, postretirement benefits, and the fair value\nof investment securities. Actual results could differ from those estimates and assumptions.\nPresentation of Cash Flows\nFor purposes of reporting cash flows, cash and cash equivalents include cash on hand, amounts due from banks, and interest-bearing\ndemand deposits.\nF-7\nRevenue Recognition\nManagement determined that the primary sources of revenue emanating from interest and dividend income on loans and investments\nalong with noninterest revenue resulting from investment security and loan gains (losses), and earnings on bank owned life insurances\nare not within the scope of ASC 606. The main types of noninterest income within the scope of the standard include service charges on\ndeposit accounts and the gain on the sale of properties classified as other real estate owned. The Company has contracts with its deposit\ncustomers where fees are charged if certain parameters are not met. These agreements can be cancelled at any time by either the Company\nor the deposit customer. Revenue from these transactions is recognized on a monthly basis as the Company has an unconditional right\nto the fee consideration. The Company also has transaction fees related to specific transactions or activities resulting from a customer\nrequest or activity that include overdraft fees, online banking fees, interchange fees, ATM fees and other transaction fees. These fees\nare attributable to specific performance obligations of the Company where the revenue is recognized at a defined point in time upon the\ncompletion of the requested service/transaction.\nInvestment Securities\nThe Company classifies and accounts for investment securities as follows:\nHeld to Maturity — Debt securities that management has the positive intent and ability to hold to maturity are classified as “held to\nmaturity” and are recorded at amortized cost. Premiums are amortized and discounts are accreted using the interest method over the\nestimated remaining term of the underlying security.\nAvailable for Sale — Debt securities that will be held for indefinite periods of time that may be sold in response to changes to market\ninterest or prepayment rates, needs for liquidity, and changes in the availability of and the yield of alternative investments, are classified\nas “available for sale” and recorded at fair value, with unrealized gains and losses excluded from earnings and reported net of tax in\nother comprehensive income (loss). Realized gains and losses on the sale of investment securities are recorded as of trade date and\nreported in the Consolidated Statements of Income and determined using the adjusted cost of the specific security sold.\nEquity Investments — The Company has an equity investment accounted for in accordance with both ASC 321-10, Investments - Equity\nSecurities and ASC 323-10, Investments - Equity Method and Joint Ventures. The equity investment has a readily determinable fair value\nand is reported at fair value, with unrealized gains and losses included in earnings. Any dividends received are recorded in interest\nincome. The fair value of equity investments with readily determinable fair values is primarily obtained from third-party pricing services.\nFor additional detail regarding equity securities, see note 5 to these consolidated financial statements.\nRegulatory Stock, at Cost\nCommon stock of the FHLB represents ownership in an institution which is wholly owned by other financial institutions. This restricted\nequity security is accounted for at cost. The Company invests in FHLB stock as required to support borrowing activities, as detailed in\nnote 10 to these consolidated financial statements. Although FHLB stock is an equity interest in a FHLB, it does not have a readily\ndeterminable fair value because its ownership is restricted and it lacks a market. FHLB stock can be sold back only at its par value of\n$100 per share and only to the FHLBs or to another member institution. The Company evaluates this investment for impairment on the\nultimate recoverability of the par value rather than by recognizing temporary declines in value. The Company reviews this stock for\nimpairment based on guidance from FASB ASC Topic 320 for Investments — Debt Securities and FASB ASC Topic 942 for Financial\nServices — Depository and Lending and has concluded that its investment is not impaired.\nLoans\nLoans that management has the intent and ability to hold for the foreseeable future or until maturity or payoff are stated at their\noutstanding unpaid principal balances, net of an allowance for credit losses and any deferred fees and costs. Interest income is accrued\non the unpaid principal balance. Loan origination fees and costs are deferred and recognized as an adjustment of the yield (interest\nincome) of the related loans. Generally, the Company amortizes loan origination fees and costs over the contractual life of the loan.\nThe accrual of interest is generally discontinued when the contractual payment of principal or interest has become 90 days past due or\nmanagement has serious doubts about further collectability of principal or interest, even though the loan is currently performing. A loan\nmay remain on accrual status if it is in the process of collection and is either guaranteed or well secured. When a loan is placed on\nnonaccrual status, unpaid interest credited to income in the current year is reversed and unpaid interest accrued in prior years is charged\nagainst the allowance for credit losses. Interest received on nonaccrual loans generally is either applied against principal or reported as\ninterest income, according to management’s judgment as to the collectability of principal. Generally, loans are restored to accrual status\nF-8\nwhen the obligation is brought current, has performed in accordance with the contractual terms for at least six months and the ultimate\ncollectability of the total contractual principal and interest is no longer in doubt.\nAllowance for Credit Losses on Loans\nThe Company maintains its allowance for credit losses (“ACL”) at a level that management believes to be appropriate to absorb\nestimated credit losses as of the date of the Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition. The Company established its allowance in\naccordance with the guidance included in ASC 326, Financial Instruments – Credit Losses (“ASC 326”). The ACL is a valuation reserve\nestablished and maintained by charges against income and is deducted from the amortized cost basis of loans to present the net amount\nexpected to be collected on the loans. Loans, or portions thereof, are charged-off against the ACL when they are deemed uncollectible.\nExpected recoveries do not exceed the aggregate amounts previously charged-off and expected to be charged-off. The ACL is an\nestimate of expected lifetime credit losses, that considers our historical loss experience, the historical loss experience of a peer group of\nbanks identified by management, current conditions and the forecast of future economic conditions. The determination of an appropriate\nACL is inherently subjective and may have significant changes from period to period. The methodology for determining the ACL has\ntwo main components: evaluation of expected credit losses for certain groups of homogeneous loans that share similar risk characteristics\nand evaluation of loans that do not share risk characteristics with other loans. The ACL is measured on a collective (pool) basis when\nsimilar characteristics exist. The Company’s loan portfolio is segmented by loan types that have similar risk characteristics and behave\nsimilarly during economic cycles.\nHistorical credit loss experience is the basis for the estimate of expected credit losses. We apply our historical loss rates and the historical\nloss rates of a group of peer banks identified by management to pools of loans with similar risk characteristics using the Weighted-\nAverage Remaining Maturity (“WARM”) method. The remaining contractual life of the pools of loans with similar risk characteristics\nis adjusted by expected scheduled payments and prepayments. After consideration of the historical loss calculation, management applies\nqualitative adjustments to reflect the current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts not already reflected in the historical\nloss information. Our reasonable and supportable forecast adjustment is based on a regional economic indicator obtained from the St.\nLouis Federal Reserve economic database. The Company selected eight qualitative metrics which were correlated with the Bank and\nits peer group’s historical loss patterns. The eight qualitative metrics include: changes in lending policies and procedures, changes in\nnational and local economic conditions as well as business conditions, changes in the nature, complexity, and volume of the portfolio,\nchanges in the experience, ability, and depth of lenders and lending management, changes in the volume and severity of past due and\nclassified loans, changes in the quality of the Bank’s loan review system, changes in the value of collateral securing the loans, and\nchanges in or the existence of credit concentrations. The adjustments are weighted for relevance before applying to each pool of loans.\nEach quarter, management reviews the recommended adjustment factors and applies any additional adjustments based on local and\ncurrent conditions.\nThe Company has elected to exclude $2.0 million of accrued interest receivable as of June 30, 2024 from the measurement of its ACL.\nWhen a loan is placed on non-accrual status, any outstanding accrued interest is reversed against interest income. Accrued interest on\nloans is reported in the accrued interest receivable and other assets line on the consolidated statements of financial condition.\nThe ACL for individual loans begins with the use of normal credit review procedures to identify whether a loan no longer shares similar\nrisk characteristics with other pooled loans and, therefore, should be individually assessed. We evaluate all commercial loans that meet\nthe following criteria: (1) when it is determined that foreclosure is probable, (2) substandard, doubtful and nonperforming loans when\nrepayment is expected to be provided substantially through the operation or sale of the collateral, (3) when it is determined by\nmanagement that a loan does not share similar risk characteristics with other loans. Credit loss estimates are calculated based on the\nfollowing three acceptable methods for measuring the ACL: 1) the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan’s\noriginal effective interest rate; 2) the loan’s observable market price; or 3) the fair value of the collateral when the loan is collateral\ndependent. Our individual loan evaluations consist primarily of the fair value of collateral method because most of our loans are collateral\ndependent. Collateral values are discounted to consider disposition costs when appropriate. A charge-off is recorded if the fair value of\nthe loan is less than the loan balance.\nAllowance for Credit Losses on Unfunded Loan Commitments\nThe Company estimates expected credit losses over the contractual period in which the Bank is exposed to credit risk via a contractual\nobligation to extend credit unless that obligation is unconditionally cancellable by the Bank. The allowance for credit losses on unfunded\nloan commitments is included in accrued interest payable and other liabilities in the Company’s Statements of Financial Condition and\nis adjusted through credit loss expense. The estimate includes consideration of the likelihood that funding will occur and an estimate of\nexpected credit losses on commitments expected to be funded over its estimated life.\nF-9\nAllowance for Credit Losses on Held to Maturity Securities\nThe Company accounts for its held to maturity securities in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 326-20,\nFinancial Instruments – Credit Loss – Measured at Amortized Cost, which requires that the Company measure expected credit losses\non held to maturity debt securities on a collective basis by major security type. The estimate of expected credit losses considers historical\ncredit loss information that is adjusted for current economic conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts.\nThe Company classifies its held to maturity debt securities into the following major security types: mortgage-backed securities, U.S.\ngovernment agency securities and municipal bonds. Generally, the mortgage-backed securities and U.S. government agency securities\nare government guaranteed with a history of no credit losses and the municipal bonds are highly rated with a history of no credit losses.\nCredit ratings of the municipal bonds are reviewed on a quarterly basis. Based on the government guarantee, our historical experience\nincluding no credit losses, and the high credit rating of our municipal bonds, the Company determined that an allowance for credit losses\non its held to maturity portfolio is not required.\nAccrued interest receivable on held to maturity debt securities totaled $170 thousand as of June 30, 2024 and is included within accrued\ninterest receivable and other assets on the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition. This amount is excluded from\nthe estimate of expected credit losses. Generally, held to maturity debt securities are classified as nonaccrual when the contractual\npayment of principal or interest has become 90 days past due or management has serious doubts about the further collectability of\nprincipal or interest. When held to maturity debt securities are placed on nonaccrual status, unpaid interest credited to income is reversed\nagainst interest income.\nAllowance for Credit Losses on Available for Sale Securities\nThe Company measures expected credit losses on available for sale debt securities when the Bank intends to sell, or when it is not more\nlikely than not that it will be required to sell, the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis. If either of the criteria regarding\nintent or requirement to sell is met, the amortized cost basis of the security is written down to fair value through income. For available\nfor sale debt securities that do not meet the previously mentioned criteria, the Company evaluates whether the decline in fair value has\nresulted from credit losses or other factors. In making this assessment, the Company considers the extent to which fair value is less than\namortized cost, any changes to the rating of the security by a rating agency, and adverse conditions specifically related to the security,\namong other factors. If this evaluation indicates that a credit loss exists, the present value of cash flows expected to be collected from\nthe security are compared to the amortized cost basis of the security. If the present value of cash flows expected to be collected is less\nthan the amortized cost basis, a credit loss exists and an allowance for credit losses is recorded for the credit loss, equal to the amount\nthat the fair value is less than the amortized cost basis. Any impairment that has not been recorded through an allowance for credit\nlosses is recognized in other comprehensive income.\nThe ACL on available for sale debt securities is included within securities available for sale on the Consolidated Statements of Financial\nCondition. Changes in the allowance for credit losses are recorded within provision for credit losses on the Consolidated Statements of\nIncome. Losses are charged against the allowance when the Company believes the collectability of an available for sale security is in\njeopardy or when either of the criteria regarding intent or requirement to sell is met.\nAccrued interest receivable on available for sale debt securities totaled $662 thousand as of June 30, 2024 and is included within accrued\ninterest receivable and other assets on the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition. This amount is excluded from\nthe estimate of expected credit losses. Generally, available for sale debt securities are classified as nonaccrual when the contractual\npayment of principal or interest has become 90 days past due or management has serious doubts about the further collectability of\nprincipal or interest. When available for sale debt securities are placed on nonaccrual status, unpaid interest credited to income is reversed\nagainst interest income.\nLoan Charge-off Policies\nGenerally, loans are charged down to the net realizable value when the loan is 90 days past due. However, student loans that are included\nin consumer loans are fully charged down when the loan is 180 days past due.\nTransfers of Financial Assets\nTransfers of financial assets, including loan and loan participation sales, are accounted for as sales, when control over the assets has\nbeen surrendered. Control over transferred assets is deemed to be surrendered when: (1) the assets have been isolated from the Company,\n(2) the transferee obtains the right (free of conditions that constrain it from taking advantage of that right) to pledge or exchange the\nF-10\ntransferred assets and (3) the Company does not maintain effective control over the transferred assets through an agreement to repurchase\nthem before their maturity.\nPremises and Equipment\nLand is carried at cost. Premises and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is computed on a straight-\nline basis over the following estimated useful lives of the related assets:\nYears\nOffice buildings and improvements 2 – 33\nFurniture, fixtures, and equipment 1 – 10\nAutomobiles 4\nOther Real Estate Owned\nReal estate owned acquired in settlement of foreclosed loans is carried as a component of other assets at fair value minus estimated cost\nto sell. Prior to foreclosure, the estimated collectible value of the collateral is evaluated to determine whether a partial charge-off of the\nloan balance is necessary. After transfer to real estate owned, any subsequent write-downs are charged against other operating expenses.\nDirect costs incurred in the foreclosure process and subsequent holding costs incurred on such properties are recorded as expenses of\ncurrent operations.\nIncome Taxes\nDeferred taxes are provided on the liability method, whereby deferred tax assets are recognized for deductible temporary differences\nand deferred tax liabilities are recognized for taxable temporary differences. Temporary differences are the differences between the\nreported amounts of assets and liabilities and their tax basis. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when, in the\nopinion of management, it is more likely than not that some portion of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Deferred tax assets\nand liabilities are adjusted for the effects of changes in tax laws and rates on the date of enactment.\nGoodwill and Intangible Assets\nGoodwill results from business acquisitions and represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of acquired tangible assets\nand liabilities and identifiable intangible assets. In certain circumstances, the Company will record a gain on bargain purchase when the\nfair value of the net assets of the acquired company exceeds the fair value of the equity of the acquired company. When calculating\ngoodwill or a gain on bargain purchase in accordance with FASB ASC 805-30-55-3, the Company evaluates whether the fair value of\nequity of the acquired company is a more reliable measure than the fair value of the equity interests transferred. The Company considers\nthe assumptions required to calculate the fair value of equity of an acquired company using discounted cash flow models (income\napproach) and/or change of control premium models (market approach) which are generally based on a higher level of market participant\ninputs and therefore a lower level of subjectivity when compared to the assumptions required to calculate the fair value of equity interests\ntransferred under a fair value pricing model. As a result, the Company considers the calculation of the fair value of the equity of an\nacquired company to be more reliable than the calculation of the fair value of the equity interests transferred. Goodwill is assessed at\nleast annually for impairment and any such impairment will be recognized in the period identified. Intangible assets consist of core\ndeposit intangibles arising from whole bank acquisitions. These intangible assets are measured at fair value and then amortized on an\naccelerated method over their estimated useful lives of ten years.\nLeases\nThe Company accounts for its leases in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 842 – Leases. Most leases are recognized on the statement\nof financial condition by recording a right-of-use asset and lease liability for each lease. The right-of-use asset represents the right to\nuse the asset under lease for the lease term, and the lease liability represents the contractual obligation to make lease payments. The\nright-of-use asset is tested for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount may not be\nrecoverable.\nAs a lessee, the Company enters into operating leases for certain bank branches, office space, and office equipment. The right-of-use\nassets and lease liabilities are initially recognized based on the net present value of the remaining lease payments which include renewal\noptions where the Company is reasonably certain they will be exercised. The net present value is determined using the incremental\ncollateralized borrowing rate at commencement date. The right-of-use asset is measured at the amount of the lease liability adjusted for\nF-11\nany prepaid rent, lease incentives and initial direct costs incurred. The right-of-use asset and lease liability is amortized over the\nindividual lease terms. Lease expense for lease payments is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. For additional\ninformation regarding leases, see note 17 to these consolidated financial statements.\nStock Based Compensation\nThe Company accounts for stock awards and stock options granted to employees and directors based on guidance set forth in FASB\nASC Topic 718 for Compensation — Stock Compensation. Compensation cost is recognized for stock options and restricted stock awards\nissued to employees and directors, based on the fair value of these awards at the grant date. A Black-Scholes model is utilized to estimate\nthe fair value of stock options, while the market price of the Company’s common shares at the date of the grant is used for restricted\nshares. Compensation cost is recognized over the required service period using the straight-line method.\nOff-Balance Sheet Financial Instruments\nIn the ordinary course of business, the Company has entered into off-balance sheet financial instruments consisting of commitments to\nextend credit. Such financial instruments are recorded in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition when they are funded.\nBank-owned Life Insurance\nThe Company funds the purchase of insurance policies on the lives of certain former officers and employees of the Company. The\npolicies were purchased to help offset the increase in the costs of various fringe benefit plans, including healthcare. The Company has\nrecognized any change in cash surrender value of life insurance in other income in the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Income.\nComprehensive Income (Loss)\nThe Company presents a separate financial statement of comprehensive income (loss) that includes net unrealized holding gains and\nlosses on securities available for sale excluded from the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Income and recorded directly to\nstockholders’ equity.\nSegment Reporting\nThe Company acts as an independent community financial services provider and offers traditional banking and related financial services\nto individual, business, and government customers. Through its branch network, the Bank offers a full array of commercial and retail\nfinancial services, including; the taking of time, savings and demand deposits; the making of commercial and mortgage loans; and the\nproviding of other financial services. Management does not separately allocate expenses, including the cost of funding loan demand,\nbetween the commercial and retail operations of the Bank. As such, discrete financial information is not available and segment reporting\nwould not be meaningful.\nReclassifications\nCertain amounts in the previous year financial statements have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation. These\nreclassifications have no impact on prior year net income or stockholders’ equity.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements Adopted\nIn June 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2016-13, Financial\nInstruments - Credit Losses: Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments (Topic 326), which changes the impairment model\nfor most financial assets. This update is intended to improve financial reporting by requiring timelier recording of credit losses on loans\nand other financial instruments held by financial institutions and other organizations. The underlying premise of the update is that\nfinancial assets measured at amortized cost should be presented at the net amount expected to be collected, through an allowance for\ncredit losses that is deducted from the amortized cost basis. The allowance for credit losses should reflect management's current estimate\nof credit losses that are expected to occur over the remaining life of a financial asset. The income statement will be affected for the\nmeasurement of credit losses for newly recognized financial assets, as well as the expected increases or decreases of expected credit\nlosses that have taken place during the period. With certain exceptions, transition to the new requirements will be through a cumulative-\neffect adjustment to opening retained earnings as of the beginning of the first reporting period in which the guidance is adopted. This\nupdate is effective for SEC filers that are eligible to be smaller reporting companies, non-SEC filers, and all other companies, to fiscal\nyears beginning after December 15, 2023, including interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company adopted this guidance using\nF-12\nthe modified retrospective approach for all financial assets measured at amortized cost, including loans, held to maturity debt securities\nand unfunded commitments, as well as available for sale securities. On July 1, 2023, the Company recorded a cumulative effect decrease\nto retained earnings of $187 thousand, net of tax, related to loans and $39 thousand, net of tax, related to unfunded commitments. The\nCompany determined that there was no impact to retained earnings related to available for sale or held to maturity debt securities as a\nresult of adopting this guidance. The results reported for periods beginning on or after July 1, 2023 are presented under ASC 326, while\nprior period amounts continue to be reported in accordance with previously applicable accounting standards.\nThe impact of the change from the incurred loss model to the current expected credit loss model is included in the table below.\nJuly 1, 2023\nAdoption\n(Dollars in thousands) Pre-adoption Impact As Reported\nAssets\nACL on debt securities available for sale $ — $ — $ —\nACL on debt securities held to maturity — — —\nACL on loans\nResidential real estate:\n1 - 4 family 486 (67) 419\nHome equity and HELOCs 113 19 132\nConstruction -residential 214 (174) 40\nCommercial real estate:\n1 - 4 family investor 569 (241) 328\nMulti-family (five or more) 89 (30) 59\nCommercial non-residential 1,420 379 1,799\nConstruction and land 281 (93) 188\nCommercial 82 254 336\nConsumer loans 59 196 255\nLiabilities\nACL on unfunded commitments 101 50 151\n$ 3,414 $ 293 $ 3,707\nIn March 2022, the FASB issued ASU 2022-02, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Troubled Debt Restructurings and\nVintage Disclosures, which eliminates the accounting guidance for troubled debt restructurings by creditors that have adopted CECL\nand enhances the disclosure requirements for modifications of receivables made with borrowers experiencing financial difficulty. In\naddition, the amendments in this ASU require disclosure of current period gross write-offs by year of origination for financing\nreceivables in the existing vintage disclosures. This ASU became effective on July 1, 2023 for the Company. The adoption of this ASU\nresulted in updated disclosures within our financial statements but otherwise did not have a material impact on the Company’s\nconsolidated financial statements.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted\nIn December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures. The\namendments in this ASU were issued to enhance the transparency and decision usefulness of income tax disclosures. The amendments\nin the update address investor requests for more transparency about income tax information through improvements to income tax\ndisclosures primarily related to the rate reconciliation and income taxes paid information. These updates are not expected to have a\nsignificant impact on the Company’s financial statements.\nIn October 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-06, Disclosure Improvements: Codification Amendments in Response to the SEC’s\nDisclosure Update and Simplification Initiative. The amendments in this ASU were issued in response to the SEC’s August 2018 final\nrule that updated and simplified disclosure requirements that the SEC believed were “redundant, duplicative, overlapping, outdated, or\nsuperseded.” The new guidance is intended to align U.S. GAAP requirements with those of the SEC and to facilitate the application of\nU.S. GAAP for all entities. Some of the amendments introduced by the ASU are technical corrections or clarifications of the FASB’s\ncurrent disclosure or presentation requirements. These updates are not expected to have a significant impact on the Company’s financial\nstatements.\nIn January 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-04, Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Facilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate\nF-13\nReform on Financial Reporting, March 2020, to provide temporary optional expedients and exceptions to the U.S. GAAP guidance on\ncontract modifications and hedge accounting to ease the financial reporting burdens of the expected market transition from LIBOR and\nother interbank offered rates to alternative reference rates, such as the Secured Overnight Financing Rate. Entities can elect not to apply\ncertain modification accounting requirements to contracts affected by what the guidance calls “reference rate reform” if certain criteria\nare met. An entity that makes this election would not have to remeasure the contracts at the modification date or reassess a previous\naccounting determination. Also, entities can elect various optional expedients that would allow them to continue applying hedge\naccounting for hedging relationships affected by reference rate reform if certain criteria are met, and can make a one-time election to\nsell and/or reclassify held-to-maturity debt securities that reference an interest rate affected by reference rate reform. The sunset\nprovision included in Topic 848 was based on the expectations of when LIBOR would cease being published. In March 2021, the UK\nFinancial Conduct Authority announced that the intended cessation date of LIBOR would be June 30, 2023, which is beyond the\nestablished sunset date of Topic 848. In December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-06, Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Deferral\nof the Sunset Date of Topic 848. The amendments in this ASU provide temporary relief by deferring the sunset date provision included\nin Topic 848. The amendments in ASU 2023-06 defer the effective date for all entities upon issuance through December 31, 2024. These\nupdates are not expected to have a significant impact on the Company’s financial statements.\nNote 3 - Earnings Per Share\nThe following table presents a calculation of basic and diluted earnings per share for the years ended June 30, 2024 and 2023. Earnings\nper share is computed by dividing net income available to common shareholders by the weighted average number of shares of common\nstock outstanding. The difference between common shares issued and basic average common shares outstanding, for purposes of\ncalculating basic earnings per share, is a result of subtracting unallocated ESOP shares and unvested restricted stock shares. There are\nno convertible securities which would affect the numerator in calculating basic and diluted earnings per share; therefore, the net income\nof $168 thousand and $2.8 million for the years ended June 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, was used as the numerator. See Note 12 to\nthese consolidated financial statements for further discussion of stock grants.\nThe following table sets forth the composition of the weighted average common shares (denominator) used in the basic and diluted\nearnings per share computation.\nYea r En ded\nJune 30,\n(Dollars in thousands, except share and per share amounts) 2024 2023\nBasic and diluted earnings per share:\nNet income $ 168 $ 2,802\nBasic average common shares outstanding 9,017,723 12,661,882\nEffect of dilutive securities 57,187 30,732\nDilutive average shares outstanding 9,074,910 12,692,614\nEarnings per share:\nBasic $ 0.02 $ 0.22\nDiluted $ 0.02 $ 0.22\nAnti-dilutive shares are common stock equivalents with weighted average exercise prices in excess of the weighted average market\nvalue for the periods presented. There were 1,264,000 and 1,197,640 stock options that were anti-dilutive for the years ended June 30,\n2024 and 2023, respectively, and were not included in the table above.\nF-14\nNote 4 – Changes in and Reclassifications Out of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss\nThe following tables present the changes in the balances of each component of accumulated other comprehensive loss (“AOCL”) for\nthe years ended June 30, 2024 and 2023.

The unrealized loss on securities is due to current interest rate levels relative to the Company’s cost. Because the unrealized\nlosses are due to current interest rate levels relative to the Company’s cost and not credit quality, and because the Company does not\nintend to sell the investments and it is not more likely than not that the Company will be required to sell these investments before\nF-17\nrecovery of its amortized cost, which may be at maturity, the Company does not consider the unrealized losses to be credit losses and\nno allowance for credit losses is required at June 30, 2024, and the Company does not consider these investments to be other-than\ntemporarily impaired at June 30, 2023. There were 126 investment securities that were temporarily impaired at June 30, 2023. The\nCompany did not recognize any credit losses on these securities for the year ended June 30, 2024, or other-than temporary impairment\ncharges for the year ended June 30, 2023.\nAt June 30, 2024 and 2023, $2.6 million and $2.5 million, respectively, in the carrying value of investment securities were pledged to\nsecure municipal deposits.\nEquity Securities\nThe Company had one equity security with a fair value of $2.0 million and $1.6 million as of June 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\nDuring the years ended June 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company recorded $387 thousand of unrealized gains and $629 thousand of\nunrealized losses, respectively, which were recorded in Unrealized gain (loss) on equity securities in the Consolidated Statements of\nIncome.\nNote 6 – Loans\nMajor classifications of loans, net of deferred loan fees (costs) of $545 thousand and $653 thousand at June 30, 2024 and 2023,\nrespectively, are summarized as follows:\nJun e 30, Jun e 30,\n2024 2023\n(Dollars in thousands) Amount Percent Amount Percent\nResidential real estate:\n1 - 4 family $ 127,911 27.00 % $ 135,046 28.08 %\nHome equity and HELOCs 30,767 6.50 32,684 6.79\nConstruction -residential 8,802 1.86 9,113 1.90\nCommercial real estate:\n1 - 4 family investor 92,284 19.49 98,160 20.41\nMulti-family (five or more) 15,619 3.30 15,281 3.18\nCommercial non-residential 158,481 33.46 157,555 32.77\nConstruction and land 22,687 4.79 15,584 3.24\nCommercial 15,090 3.19 15,433 3.21\nConsumer loans 1,920 0.41 2,000 0.42\nTotal Loans 473,561 100.00 % 480,856 100.00 %\nAllowance for credit losses (2,989) (3,313)\nNet Loans $ 470,572 $ 477,543\nMortgage loans serviced for others are not included in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition. The total\namount of loans serviced for the benefit of others was approximately $11.2 million and $12.5 million at, June 30, 2024 and 2023,\nrespectively. The Bank retained the related servicing rights for the loans that were sold and receives a 25 basis point servicing fee from\nthe purchasers of the loans. Custodial escrow balances maintained in connection with the foregoing loan servicing are included in\nadvances from borrowers for taxes and insurance.\nCommercial non-residential loans include shared national credits, which are participations in loans or loan commitments of at least\n$20.0 million that are shared by three or more banks. As of June 30, 2023, the Company had one shared national credit loan commitment\nfor $12.5 million with no balance outstanding and that is a purchased participation classified as pass rated and all payments are current\nand the loan is performing in accordance with its contractual terms. This shared national credit loan commitment was closed during the\nthree months ended December 31, 2023. The Company’s accounting policies for shared national credits, including our charge off and\nreserve policy, are consistent with the significant accounting policies disclosed in our financial statements for the Company’s total loan\nportfolio. Shared national credits are subject to the same underwriting guidelines as loans originated by the Company and are subject\nto annual reviews where the risk rating of the loan is evaluated. Additionally, the Company obtains quarterly financial information and\nperforms a financial analysis on a regular basis to ensure that the borrower can comply with the financial terms of the loan. The\ninformation used in the analysis is provided by the borrower through the agent bank.\nF-18\nAllowance for Credit Losses. As previously discussed in the “Recent Accounting Pronouncements” section of Note 2 “Summary of\nSignificant Accounting Policies,” the Company adopted the provisions of ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses:\nMeasurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments (Topic 326). ASU 2016-13 requires estimated credit losses on loans to be\ndetermined based on an expected life of loan model, as compared to an incurred loss model (in effect for periods prior to July 1, 2023).\nAccordingly, the allowance for credit losses disclosures subsequent to July 1, 2023 are not always comparable to prior dates. In addition,\ncertain new disclosures required under ASU 2016-13 are not applicable to prior periods. As a result, the following tables present\ndisclosures separately for each period, where appropriate. New disclosures required under ASU 2016-13 and ASU 2022-02 are only\nshown for the current period. Please refer to Note 2 “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” for a summary of the impact of\nadopting the provisions of ASU 2016-13 on July 1, 2023.\nThe following tables set forth the allocation of the Bank’s allowance for credit losses by loan category at the dates indicated. The portion\nof the credit loss allowance allocated to each loan category does not represent the total available for future losses which may occur\nwithin the loan category since the total credit loss allowance is a valuation allocation applicable to the entire loan portfolio. The Company\ngenerally charges-off the collateral or discounted cash flow deficiency on all loans at 90 days past due and all loans rated substandard\nor worse that are 90 days past due.\nThe following table presents by portfolio segment, the changes in the allowance for credit losses and the recorded investment in loans\nfor the years ended June 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively:\nJune 30, 2024 R esi de ntial real es tate : Commerc ial re al estate:\nHome Equity Construction- 1 - 4 family Multi-family Commercial Construction\n(Dollar amounts in\nthousands) 1 - 4 family and HELOCs residential investor (five or more) non-residential and land Commercial Consumer Total\nAllowance for credit losses:\nBeginning balance $ 486 $ 113 $ 214 $ 569 $ 89 $ 1,420 $ 281 $ 82 $ 59 $ 3,313\nImpact of adopting ASU\n2016-13 (67) 19 (174) (241) (30) 379 (93) 254 196 243\nCharge-offs — — — — — — — — (13) (13)\nRecoveries — — — — — — — — 29 29\nProvision (94) (32) (9) (60) (27) (266) (41) (32) (22) (583)\nEnding Balance $ 325 $ 100 $ 31 $ 268 $ 32 $ 1,533 $ 147 $ 304 $ 249 $ 2,989\nAllowance ending balance:\nIndividually evaluated for\nimpairment $ — $ — $ — $ — $ — $ — $ — $ — $ — $ —\nCollectively evaluated for\nimpairment 325 100 31 268 32 1,533 147 304 249 2,989\nTotal allowance $ 325 $ 100 $ 31 $ 268 $ 32 $ 1,533 $ 147 $ 304 $ 249 $ 2,989\nLoans receivable ending\nbalance:\nIndividually evaluated for\nimpairment $ 1,221 $ 426 $ — $ 1,007 $ 194 $ 337 $ — $ — $ 126 $ 3,311\nCollectively evaluated for\nimpairment 126,690 30,341 8,802 91,277 15,425 158,144 22,687 15,090 1,794 470,250\nTotal portfolio $ 127,911 $ 30,767 $ 8,802 $ 92,284 $ 15,619 $ 158,481 $ 22,687 $ 15,090 $ 1,920 $ 473,561\nF-19\nJune 30, 2023 R esi de ntial real est ate: Commerci al r ea l estate:\nHome Equity Construction- 1 - 4 family Multi-family Commercial Construction\n(Dollar amounts in\nthousands) 1 - 4 family and HELOCs residential investor (five or more) non-residential and land Commercial Consumer Total\nAllowance for credit losses:\nBeginning balance $ 506 $ 113 $ 386 $ 527 $ 110 $ 1,451 $ 166 $ 100 $ 50 $ 3,409\nCharge-offs (79) — — — — — — — (32) (111)\nRecoveries — — — — — — — — 15 15\nProvision 59 — (172) 42 (21) (31) 115 (18) 26 —\nEnding Balance $ 486 $ 113 $ 214 $ 569 $ 89 $ 1,420 $ 281 $ 82 $ 59 $ 3,313\nAllowance ending balance:\nIndividually evaluated for\nimpairment $ — $ — $ — $ — $ — $ — $ — $ — $ — $ —\nCollectively evaluated for\nimpairment 486 113 214 569 89 1,420 281 82 59 3,313\nTotal allowance $ 486 $ 113 $ 214 $ 569 $ 89 $ 1,420 $ 281 $ 82 $ 59 $ 3,313\nLoans receivable ending\nbalance:\nIndividually evaluated for\nimpairment $ 1,209 $ 182 $ — $ 832 $ 251 $ 778 $ — $ — $ — $ 3,252\nCollectively evaluated for\nimpairment 78,237 19,689 9,113 84,891 14,781 142,098 15,584 14,976 643 380,012\nAcquired non-credit impaired\nloans (1) 55,528 12,813 — 12,437 249 14,679 — 457 1,357 97,520\nAcquired credit impaired\nloans (2) 72 — — — — — — — — 72\nTotal portfolio $ 135,046 $ 32,684 $ 9,113 $ 98,160 $ 15,281 $ 157,555 $ 15,584 $ 15,433 $ 2,000 $ 480,856\n(1) Acquired non-credit impaired loans are evaluated collectively, excluding loans that have subsequently moved to non-accrual\nstatus which are individually evaluated for impairment.\n(2) Acquired credit impaired loans are evaluated on an individual basis.\nDuring the year ended June 30, 2024, and exclusive of the impact of the adoption of ASU 2016-13, the changes in the provision for\ncredit losses for each portfolio of loans were primarily due to fluctuations in the outstanding balance of each portfolio of loans\ncollectively evaluated for impairment. The overall decrease in the allowance during the year ended June 30, 2024 can be primarily\nattributed to consistently low levels of net charge-offs, strong asset quality metrics and continued conservative lending practices.\nDuring the year ended June 30, 2023, the changes in the provision for credit losses for each portfolio of loans were primarily due to\nfluctuations in the outstanding balance of each portfolio of loans collectively evaluated for impairment. Specifically, we experienced\nsignificant growth in our commercial construction and land loan portfolio during the year ended June 30, 2023 and a corresponding\nincrease in the provision for credit losses for this portfolio. The overall decrease in the allowance during the year ended June 30, 2023\ncan primarily be attributed to improved credit quality metrics, including continued low levels of net charge-offs and a decrease in non-\nperforming assets.\nUnder the provisions of ASU 2016-13, loans evaluated individually for impairment consist of non-accrual loans. Under the incurred\nloss model in effect prior to the adoption of ASU 2016-13, loans evaluated individually for impairment were referred to as impaired\nloans.\nCredit Quality Information\nThe following tables represent credit exposures by internally assigned grades for the years ended June 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively,\nthat management uses to monitor the credit quality of the overall loan portfolio. The grading analysis estimates the capability of the\nborrower to repay the contractual obligations of the loan agreements as scheduled or at all. All loans greater than 90 days past due are\nconsidered Substandard. The Company’s internal credit risk grading system is based on experiences with similarly graded loans.\nThe Company’s internally assigned grades are as follows:\nPass – loans which are protected by the current net worth and paying capacity of the obligor or by the value of the underlying collateral.\nSpecial Mention – loans where a potential weakness or risk exists, which could cause a more serious problem if not corrected.\nSubstandard – loans that have a well-defined weakness based on objective evidence and are characterized by the distinct possibility that\nthe Bank will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected.\nF-20\nDoubtful – loans classified as doubtful have all the weaknesses inherent in a substandard asset. In addition, these weaknesses make\ncollection or liquidation in full highly questionable and improbable, based on existing circumstances.\nLoss – loans classified as a loss are considered uncollectible, or of such value that continuance as an asset is not warranted.\nThe Bank has a structured loan rating process with several layers of internal and external oversight to help ensure that risk ratings are\naccurate and reflect the present and future capacity of borrowers to repay a loan as agreed. Generally, consumer and residential mortgage\nloans are included in the Pass category unless a specific action, such as nonperformance, repossession, or death occurs to raise awareness\nof a possible credit event. The Company’s Credit Department is responsible for the timely and accurate risk rating of the loans on an\nongoing basis. Every credit which must be approved by Loan Committee or the Board of Directors is assigned a risk rating at time of\nconsideration. The Credit Department also annually reviews commercial relationships of $500,000 or greater to assign or re-affirm risk\nratings.\nF-21\nThe following tables set forth the amounts of the portfolio of classified asset categories for the commercial loan portfolios at June 30,\n2024 and 2023:\nJune 30 , 2 0 24\nTerm Loans Amortized Cost Basis by Origination Fiscal Year Revolving Loans Revolving Loans\nAmortized Converted\n2024 2023 2022 2021 2020 Prior Cost Basis to Term Total\n1 - 4 family investor\nPass $ 3,852 $ 10,948 $ 6,228 $ 17,462 $ 11,855 $ 36,635 $ 2,702 $ 706 $ 90,388\nSpecial Mention — — — — — 889 — — 889\nSubstandard — — 930 — — 77 — — 1,007\nDoubtful — — — — — — — — —\nLoss — — — — — — — — —\nTotal 1 - 4 family\ninvestor $ 3,852 $ 10,948 $ 7,158 $ 17,462 $ 11,855 $ 37,601 $ 2,702 $ 706 $ 92,284\nCurrent period gross\ncharge-offs $ — $ — $ — $ — $ — $ — $ — $ — $ —\nMulti-family (five or\nmore)\nPass $ 331 $ 1,307 $ 1,310 $ 4,072 $ 5,508 $ 2,897 $ — $ — $ 15,425\nSpecial Mention — — — — — — — — —\nSubstandard — — — — — 194 — — 194\nDoubtful — — — — — — — — —\nLoss — — — — — — — — —\nTotal Multi-family $ 331 $ 1,307 $ 1,310 $ 4,072 $ 5,508 $ 3,091 $ — $ — $ 15,619\nCurrent period gross\ncharge-offs $ — $ — $ — $ — $ — $ — $ — $ — $ —\nCommercial non-\nresidential\nPass $ 11,970 $ 20,964 $ 59,973 $ 30,013 $ 15,668 $ 19,465 $ — $ 91 $ 158,144\nSpecial Mention — — — — — — — — —\nSubstandard — — — 319 — 18 — — 337\nDoubtful — — — — — — — — —\nLoss — — — — — — — — —\nTotal Commercial non-\nresidential $ 11,970 $ 20,964 $ 59,973 $ 30,332 $ 15,668 $ 19,483 $ — $ 91 $ 158,481\nCurrent period gross\ncharge-offs $ — $ — $ — $ — $ — $ — $ — $ — $ —\nConstruction and land\nPass $ 4,341 $ 5,797 $ 10,501 $ — $ — $ 2,048 $ — $ — $ 22,687\nSpecial Mention — — — — — — — — —\nSubstandard — — — — — — — — —\nDoubtful — — — — — — — — —\nLoss — — — — — — — — —\nTotal Construction and\nland $ 4,341 $ 5,797 $ 10,501 $ — $ — $ 2,048 $ — $ — $ 22,687\nCurrent period gross\ncharge-offs $ — $ — $ — $ — $ — $ — $ — $ — $ —\nCommercial\nPass $ 593 $ 6,914 $ 7,367 $ — $ 14 $ 202 $ — $ — $ 15,090\nSpecial Mention — — — — — — — — —\nSubstandard — — — — — — — — —\nDoubtful — — — — — — — — —\nLoss — — — — — — — — —\nTotal Commercial $ 593 $ 6,914 $ 7,367 $ — $ 14 $ 202 $ — $ — $ 15,090\nCurrent period gross\ncharge-offs $ — $ — $ — $ — $ — $ — $ — $ — $ —\nInformation presented in the table above is not required for periods prior to the adoption of ASU 2016-13.

Larger\ncommercial loans and commercial real estate loans which are 60 days or more past due are selected for impairment testing in accordance\nwith GAAP. Factors considered by management in determining impairment include payment status and collateral value. The amount of\nimpairment for these types of loans is determined by the difference between the present value of the expected cash flows related to the\nloan, using the original interest rate, and its recorded value, or as a practical expedient in the case of collateralized loans, the difference\nbetween the fair value of the collateral and the recorded amount of the loans. These loans are analyzed to determine if it is probable that\nall amounts will not be collected according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement. If management determines that the value of\nthe impaired loan is less than the recorded investment in the loan (net of previous charge-offs, deferred loan fees or costs and unamortized\npremium or discount), impairment is recognized through an allowance estimate or a charge-off to the allowance for loan losses.\nF-24\nThe following tables include the recorded investment and unpaid principal balances for impaired loans with the associated allowance\namount, if applicable, at June 30, 2023.\nJune 30 , 20 23\nUnpaid Average Interest\nRecorded Principal Related Recorded Income\n(Dollars in thousands) Investment Balance Allowance Investment Recognized\nWith no related allowance recorded:\n1-4 family residential real estate $ 1,209 $ 1,302 $ — $ 1,780 $ —\nHome equity and HELOCs 182 182 — 325 20\nConstruction residential — — — — —\n1 - 4 family investor commercial real estate 832 850 — 179 1\nMulti-family 251 283 — 277 —\nCommercial non-residential 778 783 — 1,042 19\nConstruction and land — — — — —\nCommercial — — — — —\nConsumer — — — — —\nWith an allowance recorded:\n1-4 family residential real estate $ — $ — $ — $ — $ —\nHome equity and HELOCs — — — — —\nConstruction residential — — — — —\n1 - 4 family investor commercial real estate — — — — —\nMulti-family — — — — —\nCommercial non-residential — — — — —\nConstruction and land — — — — —\nCommercial — — — — —\nConsumer — — — — —\nTotal:\n1-4 family residential real estate $ 1,209 $ 1,302 $ — $ 1,780 $ —\nHome equity and HELOCs 182 182 — 325 20\nConstruction residential — — — — —\n1 - 4 family investor commercial real estate 832 850 — 179 1\nMulti-family 251 283 — 277 —\nCommercial non-residential 778 783 — 1,042 19\nConstruction and land — — — — —\nCommercial — — — — —\nConsumer — — — — —\nThe impaired loans table above includes accruing loans with terms that have been modified to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty\nin the amount of $182 thousand that are performing in accordance with their modified terms.

The table above does not include $72 thousand of loans acquired with deteriorated credit quality, which have been\nrecorded at their fair value at acquisition.\nGenerally, the Bank will charge-off the collateral or discounted cash flow deficiency on all impaired loans. Interest income that would\nhave been recorded for the year ended June 30, 2023, had impaired loans been current according to their original terms, amounted to\n$104 thousand.\nConcentration of Credit Risk\nThe Company’s primary business activity as of June 30, 2024 was with customers throughout the Delaware Valley through twelve full-\nservice branch offices located in Bucks and Philadelphia Counties in Pennsylvania, as well as Burlington, Camden, and Mercer Counties\nin New Jersey. Accordingly, the Company has extended credit primarily to residential borrowers and commercial entities in this area\nwhose ability to repay their loans is influenced by the region’s economy.\nF-25\nAs of June 30, 2024, the Company considered its concentration of credit risk to be acceptable. As of June 30, 2024, commercial real\nestate loans secured by retail space totaled approximately $61.9 million, or 13.1% of total loans, and were comprised of $50.9 million\nof non-owner-occupied properties and $11.0 million of owner-occupied properties. The Company’s non-owner occupied commercial\nreal estate loans that are secured by retail space have high occupancy rates with longstanding tenants.\nLoans with Modified Terms to Borrowers Experiencing Financial Difficulty\nDuring the year ended June 30, 2024, there were no loans modified to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty.

The FHLB provides a central\ncredit facility primarily for member institutions. The Bank has a maximum borrowing capacity with the FHLB of Pittsburgh of\napproximately $287.3 million at June 30, 2024. Advances from the FHLB of Pittsburgh consisted of $48.0 million and $34.0 million of\nfixed rate short-term borrowings at June 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. FHLB advances are secured by qualifying assets of the Bank,\nwhich include Federal Home Loan Bank stock and loans. The Bank had $415.9 million and $427.2 million of loans pledged as collateral\nas of June 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.

As of June 30, 2024, the Company has a $3.5 million net operating loss carryforward that\nwill begin to expire by December 31, 2033. A valuation allowance has not been established for deferred tax assets. Realization of the\ndeferred tax assets is dependent on generating sufficient taxable income. Although realization is not assured, management believes it is\nmore likely than not that all of the deferred tax asset will be realized.\nGAAP prescribes a recognition threshold and a measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax\nposition taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. Benefits from tax positions should be recognized in the financial statements only\nwhen it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained upon examination by the appropriate taxing authority that would\nhave full knowledge of all relevant information. A tax position that meets the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold is measured at\nthe largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. Tax positions that\npreviously failed to meet the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold should be recognized in the first subsequent financial reporting\nperiod in which that threshold is met. Previously recognized tax positions that no longer meet the more-likely-than-not recognition\nthreshold should be derecognized in the first subsequent financial reporting period in which that threshold is no longer met. Accounting\nliterature also provides guidance on the accounting for and disclosure of unrecognized tax benefits, interest, and penalties. In accordance\nwith GAAP, interest or penalties incurred for income taxes will be recorded as a component of other expenses. There are no material\nuncertain tax positions at June 30, 2024 or 2023. With few exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to U.S. Federal income tax\nexaminations by taxing authorities for years before 2020.\nF-29\nRetained earnings included $2.8 million at June 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, for which no provision for federal income tax has been\nmade. These amounts represent deductions for bad debt reserves for tax purposes which were only allowed to savings institutions which\nmet certain definitional tests prescribed by the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. The Small Business Job Protection Act of\n1996 eliminated the special bad debt deduction granted solely to thrifts. Under the terms of the Act, there would be no recapture of the\npre-1988 (base year) reserves. However, these pre-1988 reserves would be subject to recapture under the rules of the Internal Revenue\nCode if the Bank itself pays a cash dividend in excess of earnings and profits, or liquidates. The Act also provides for the recapture of\ndeductions arising from “applicable excess reserve” defined as the total amount of reserve over the base year reserve. The Bank’s total\nreserve exceeds the base year reserve and deferred taxes have been provided for this excess.\nNote 12 – Stock Based Compensation\nStock-based compensation is accounted for in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 718 for Compensation — Stock Compensation. The\nCompany establishes fair value for its equity awards to determine their cost. The Company recognizes the related expense for\nemployees over the appropriate vesting period, or when applicable, service period, using the straight-line method. However, consistent\nwith the guidance, the amount of stock-based compensation recognized at any date must at least equal the portion of the grant date\nvalue of the award that is vested at that date. As a result, it may be necessary to recognize the expense using a ratable method.\nOn May 10, 2022, the shareholders of the Company approved the William Penn Bancorporation 2022 Equity Incentive Plan (the\n“Plan”). The Plan provides for the issuance of up to 1,769,604 shares (505,601 restricted stock awards and 1,264,003 stock options)\nof William Penn Bancorporation common stock.\nUnder the Plan, the Company has granted 505,600 shares of restricted stock, net of forfeitures, with a weighted average grant date fair\nvalue of $11.71 per share. To fund the grant of restricted common stock, the Company issued shares from authorized but unissued\nshares. Restricted shares granted under the Plan vest in equal installments over a five year period. Compensation expense related to the\nrestricted shares is recognized ratably over the vesting period in an amount which totals the market price of the Company’s stock at the\ngrant date. The expense recognized for the restricted shares for each of the years ended June 30, 2024 and 2023 was $1.1 million. The\nexpected future compensation expense related to the 313,989 non-vested restricted shares outstanding at June 30, 2024 was $3.5 million\nover a weighted average period of 3.02 years. The expected future compensation expense related to the 383,258 non-vested restricted\nshares outstanding at June 30, 2023 was $4.3 million over a weighted average period of 3.88 years.\nThe following is a summary of the Company's restricted stock activity during the year ended June 30, 2024:\nWeighted\nNumber of Average\nSummary of Non-vested Restricted Stock Award Activity Shares Grant Price\nNon-vested Restricted Stock Awards outstanding July 1, 2023 383,258 $ 11.66\nIssued 26,544 12.44\nVested (95,813) 11.66\nForfeited — —\nNon-vested Restricted Stock Awards outstanding June 30, 2024 313,989 $ 11.73\nThe following is a summary of the Company's restricted stock activity during the year ended June 30, 2023:\nWeighted\nNumber of Average\nSummary of Non-vested Restricted Stock Award Activity Shares Grant Price\nNon-vested Restricted Stock Awards outstanding July 1, 2022 492,960 $ 11.67\nIssued — —\nVested (95,798) 11.66\nForfeited (13,904) 11.82\nNon-vested Restricted Stock Awards outstanding June 30, 2023 383,258 $ 11.66\nThe fair value of the 95,813 shares that vested during the year ended June 30, 2024 was $1.2 million. The fair value of the 95,798 shares\nthat vested during the year ended June 30, 2023 was $914 thousand.\nUnder the Plan, the Company granted 1,264,000 stock options, net of forfeitures, with a weighted average grant date fair value of $3.24\nper share. Stock options granted under the Plan vest in equal installments over a five year period. Stock options were granted at a\nF-30\nweighted average exercise price of $11.71, which represents the fair value of the Company's common stock price on the grant date based\non the closing market price, and have an expiration period of 10 years. The fair value of stock options granted was valued using the\nBlack-Scholes option pricing model using the following weighted average assumptions: expected life of 6.5 years, risk-free rate of return\nof 2.98%, volatility of 24.60%, and a dividend yield of 1.02%. Compensation expense recognized for the stock options for the years\nended June 30, 2024 and 2023 was $796 thousand and $771 thousand, respectively. The expected future compensation expense related\nto the 1,264,000 stock options outstanding at June 30, 2024 was $2.4 million over a weighted average period of 3.02 years.

As of June 30, 2024, exercisable options totaled 479,056 with an average weighted exercise of price of\n$11.66 per share, a weighted average remaining contractual term of approximately 7.88 years, and no aggregate intrinsic value. The\nweighted average remaining contractual term was approximately 8.88 years and there was no aggregate intrinsic value for options\noutstanding as of June 30, 2023. As of June 30, 2023, exercisable options totaled 239,528 with an average weighted exercise of price of\n$11.66 per share, a weighted average remaining contractual term of approximately 8.88 years, and no aggregate intrinsic value.\nNote 13 – Employee and Director Benefit Plans\n401(k) Plan\nThe Bank has a savings plan qualified under Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code which covers substantially all of its employees.\nEmployees can contribute up to 50% of gross pay and the Bank matches 100% of such contributions up to 6%. The Company recorded\n$442 thousand and $421 thousand of expense associated with the 401(k) plan during the years ended June 30, 2024 and 2023,\nrespectively.\nEmployee Stock Ownership Plan (“ESOP”)\nThe Company offers ESOP benefits to employees who meet certain eligibility requirements. In connection with the second-step\nconversion offering, and as previously disclosed, the William Penn Bank ESOP trustees subscribed for, and intended to purchase, on\nbehalf of the ESOP, 8% of the shares of the Company common stock sold in the offering and to fund its stock purchase through a loan\nfrom the Company equal to 100% of the aggregate purchase price of the common stock. As previously disclosed, as a result of the\nsecond-step conversion offering being oversubscribed in the first tier of subscription priorities, the ESOP trustees were unable to\npurchase shares of the Company’s common stock in the second-step conversion offering. Subsequent to the completion of the second-\nF-31\nstep conversion on March 24, 2021, the ESOP trustees purchased 881,130 shares, or $10.1 million, of the Company’s common stock in\nthe open market.\nIn connection with the purchase of the shares, the ESOP borrowed $10.1 million from the Company at a fixed interest rate of 3.25%\nwith a twenty-five-year term to fund the purchase of 881,130 shares. The Company makes annual contributions to the ESOP equal to\nthe ESOP’s debt service or equal to the debt service less the dividends received by the ESOP on unallocated shares. Shares purchased\nwith the loan proceeds were initially pledged as collateral for the term loan and are held in a suspense account for future allocation\namong participants. Contributions to the ESOP and shares released from the suspense account are allocated among the participants on\nthe basis of compensation, as described by the ESOP, in the year of allocation. The ESOP shares pledged as collateral are reported as\nunearned ESOP shares in the Company’s consolidated statements of financial condition. As shares are committed to be released from\ncollateral, the Bank reports compensation expense equal to the current market price of the shares, and the shares become outstanding\nfor earnings-per-share computations. The Company recognized $424 thousand and $395 thousand of ESOP expense associated with the\nrelease of shares from collateral during the years ended June 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\nJu ne 30 ,\n2024 2023\nAllocated shares 240,172 219,141\nShares committed to be released 17,479 17,479\nUnreleased shares 766,027 801,272\nTotal ESOP shares 1,023,678 1,037,892\nFair value of unreleased shares $ 8,732,708 $ 8,132,911\nDirectors Retirement Plan\nThe Bank has a retirement plan for the directors of the Bank. Upon retirement, a director who agrees to serve as a consulting director to\nthe Bank will receive a monthly benefit amount for a period of up to 120 months. The plan was amended in October 2017 to allow credit\nfor service as a director while also serving as an employee. The Company recognized expense of $52 thousand and a credit of $45\nthousand for these benefits in its Consolidated Statements of Income for the years ended June 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. At both\nJune 30, 2024 and 2023, approximately $1.6 million had been accrued under this plan.\nDirector Deferred Compensation Plan\nThe Bank has deferred compensation plans for certain directors of the Bank whereby they can elect to defer their directors’ fees. Under\nthe plans’ provisions, benefits which accrue at the Bank’s highest certificate of deposit rate will be payable upon retirement, death, or\npermanent disability. The Company recognized $40 thousand and $21 thousand of interest expense for these benefits in its Consolidated\nStatements of Income during the years ended June 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. At both June 30, 2024 and 2023, approximately\n$1.1 million had been accrued for this benefit plan.\nNote 14 – Commitments and Contingencies\nThe Company leases several offices as part of its regular business operations. Please refer to note 17 to these consolidated financial\nstatements for further detail regarding the Company's operating lease commitments. Please refer to note 2 to these consolidated financial\nstatements for further detail regarding the how the Company estimates expected credit losses on unfunded loan commitments. In\naddition, the Company is a party to financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk in the normal course of business to meet the\nfinancing needs of its customers. These financial instruments include commitments to extend credit. Those instruments involve, to\nvarying degrees, elements of credit risk in excess of the amount recognized in the Company’s consolidated statements of financial\ncondition.\nA summary of the Company's loan commitments is as follows as of June 30, 2024 and 2023:\nJu ne 30 ,\n(Dollars in thousands) 2024 2023\nCommitments to extend credit $ 15,676 $ 6,877\nUnfunded commitments under lines of credit 65,705 75,372\nStandby letters of credit 86 86\nF-32\nCommitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a customer if there is no violation of any condition established in the contract.\nSince many of the commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon, the total commitment amounts do not necessarily\nrepresent future cash requirements. Commitments generally have 90-day fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may\nrequire payment of a fee. The Company evaluates each customer’s credit worthiness on a case-by-case basis. The amount of collateral\nobtained, if deemed necessary by the Company upon extension of credit, is based on management’s credit evaluation. Collateral held\nvaries, but primarily includes residential and commercial real estate.\nPeriodically, there have been other various claims and lawsuits against the Bank, such as claims to enforce liens, condemnation\nproceedings on properties in which it holds security interests, claims involving the making and servicing of real property loans and other\nissues incident to its business. The Bank is not a party to any pending legal proceedings that it believes would have a material adverse\neffect on its financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nNote 15 - Regulatory Capital Requirements\nThe Bank is subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by the federal banking agencies. Failure to meet the\nminimum capital requirements can initiate certain mandatory and possibly additional discretionary actions by regulators that, if\nundertaken, could have a direct material effect on the Bank’s financial statements. Under capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory\nframework for prompt corrective action, the Bank must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of the Bank’s\nassets, liabilities, and certain off-balance sheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting practices. The Bank’s capital amounts\nand classification are also subject to qualitative judgments by the regulators about components, risk-weightings, and other factors.\nQuantitative measures established by regulation to ensure capital adequacy require the Bank to maintain minimum amounts and ratios\n(described below) of tangible and core capital to total adjusted assets and of total capital to risk-weighted assets.\nAs of June 30, 2024, the most recent notification from the regulators categorized the Bank as “well capitalized” under the regulatory\nframework for prompt corrective action.\nFederal banking agencies have established an optional “community bank leverage ratio” of between 8% to 10% tangible equity to\naverage total consolidated assets for qualifying institutions with assets of less than $10 billion of assets. Institutions with capital meeting\nthe specified requirement and electing to follow the alternative framework would be deemed to comply with the applicable regulatory\ncapital requirements, including the risk-based requirements and would be considered well-capitalized under the prompt corrective action\nframework. In April 2020, the Federal banking regulatory agencies modified the original Community Bank Leverage Ratio (“CBLR”)\nframework and provided that, as of the second quarter 2020, a banking organization with a leverage ratio of 8 percent or greater and that\nmeets the other existing qualifying criteria may elect to use the community bank leverage ratio framework. The modified rule also states\nthat the community bank leverage ratio requirement will be greater than 8 percent for the second through fourth quarters of calendar\nyear 2020, greater than 8.5 percent for calendar year 2021, and greater than 9 percent thereafter. The transition rule also maintains a\ntwo-quarter grace period for a qualifying community banking organization whose leverage ratio falls no more than 100 basis points\nbelow the applicable community bank leverage ratio requirement.\nCBLR Framework\nAs of June 30, 2024 Actual Requirement\n(Dollars in thousands except for ratios) Amount Ratio Amount Ratio\nWilliam Penn Bank:\nTier 1 leverage $ 134,494 16.10% $ 75,164 9.00%\nCBLR Framework\nAs of June 30, 2023 Actual Requirement\n(Dollars in thousands except for ratios) Amount Ratio Amount Ratio\nWilliam Penn Bank:\nTier 1 leverage $ 161,774 18.67% $ 77,989 9.00%\nNote 16 – Fair Value of Financial Instruments\nThe Company follows authoritative guidance under FASB ASC Topic 820 for Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures which defines\nfair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value, and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. The definition of\nfair value under ASC 820 is the exchange price. The guidance clarifies that the exchange price is the price in an orderly transaction\nbetween market participants to sell the asset or transfer the liability in the market in which the reporting entity would transact for the\nF-33\nasset or liability. The definition focuses on the price that would be received to sell the asset or paid to transfer the liability (an exit price),\nnot the price that would be paid to acquire the asset or received to assume the liability (an entry price). The guidance emphasizes that\nfair value is a market-based measurement, not an entity-specific measurement.\nFair value is based on quoted market prices, when available. If listed prices or quotes are not available, fair value is based on fair value\nmodels that use market participant or independently sourced market data which include discount rate, interest rate yield curves, credit\nrisk, default rates and expected cash flow assumptions. In addition, valuation adjustments may be made in the determination of fair\nvalue. These fair value adjustments may include amounts to reflect counter party credit quality, creditworthiness, liquidity, and other\nunobservable inputs that are applied consistently over time. These adjustments are estimated and, therefore, subject to significant\nmanagement judgment, and at times, may be necessary to mitigate the possibility of error or revision in the model-based estimate of the\nfair value provided by the model. The methods described above may produce fair value calculations that may not be indicative of the\nnet realizable value. While the Company believes its valuation methods are consistent with other financial institutions, the use of\ndifferent methods or assumptions to determine fair values could result in different estimates of fair value. FASB ASC Topic 820 for\nFair Value Measurements and Disclosures describes three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value:\nLevel 1: Quoted prices are available in active markets for identical assets or liabilities as of the reported date.\nLevel 2: Pricing inputs are other than quoted prices in active markets, which are either directly or indirectly observable as of the reported\ndate. The nature of these assets and liabilities includes items for which quoted prices are available but traded less frequently,\nand items that are fair valued using other financial instruments, the parameters of which can be directly observed.\nLevel 3: Assets and liabilities that have little to no pricing observability as of the reported date. These items do not have two-way\nmarkets and are measured using management’s best estimate of fair value, where the inputs into the determination of fair value\nrequire significant management judgment or estimation.\nThe following table presents the assets required to be measured and reported on a recurring basis on the Company’s Consolidated\nStatements of Financial Condition at their fair value as of June 30, 2024 and 2023, by level within the fair value hierarchy. Financial\nassets and liabilities are classified in their entirety based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement.\nJune 30, 2 02 4\n(Dollars in thousands) Level I Level II Level III Total\nAssets:\nInvestments available for sale:\nMortgage-backed securities $ — $ 95,125 $ — $ 95,125\nU.S. agency collateralized mortgage obligations — 7,200 — 7,200\nU.S. government agency securities — 693 — 693\nMunicipal bonds — 14,969 — 14,969\nCorporate bonds — 32,768 — 32,768\nEquity securities 2,016 — — 2,016\nTotal Assets $ 2,016 $ 150,755 $ — $ 152,771\nJune 30, 2 02 3\n(Dollars in thousands) Level I Level II Level III Total\nAssets:\nInvestments available for sale:\nMortgage-backed securities $ — $ 106,756 $ — $ 106,756\nU.S. agency collateralized mortgage obligations — 8,292 — 8,292\nU.S. government agency securities — 3,932 — 3,932\nMunicipal bonds — 14,979 — 14,979\nCorporate bonds — 31,168 — 31,168\nEquity securities 1,629 — — 1,629\nTotal Assets $ 1,629 $ 165,127 $ — $ 166,756\nF-34\nAssets and Liabilities Measured on a Non-Recurring Basis\nCertain assets and liabilities may be required to be measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis in periods subsequent to their initial\nrecognition. Generally, nonrecurring valuation is the result of the application of other accounting pronouncements which require assets\nand liabilities to be assessed for impairment or recorded at the lower of cost or fair value.\nIndividually evaluated loans are generally measured for impairment using the fair value of the collateral supporting the loan. Individually\nevaluated loan collateral is based on Level 3 inputs utilizing outside appraisals adjusted by management for sales costs and other\nassumptions regarding market conditions to arrive at fair value. As of June 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company charged-off the collateral\ndeficiency on impaired loans. As a result, there were no specific reserves on individually evaluated loans as of June 30, 2024 and 2023.\nOther real estate owned (“OREO”) is measured at fair value, based on appraisals less cost to sell at the date of foreclosure. Valuations\nare periodically performed by management and the assets are carried at the lower of carrying amount or fair value, less cost to sell.\nIncome and expenses from operations and changes in valuation allowance are included in the net expenses from OREO.\nAs of June 30, 2024 and 2023, there were no assets required to be measured and reported at fair value on a non-recurring basis.\nManagement uses its best judgment in estimating the fair value of the Company's financial instruments; however, there are inherent\nweaknesses in any estimation technique. Therefore, for substantially all financial instruments, the fair value estimates herein are not\nnecessarily indicative of the amounts the Company could have realized in sales transaction on the dates indicated. The estimated fair\nvalue amounts have been measured as of their respective year-ends and have not been reevaluated or updated for purposes of these\nfinancial statements subsequent to those respective dates. As such, the estimated fair values of these financial instruments subsequent\nto the respective reporting dates may be different than the amounts reported at each year-end.\nThe following information should not be interpreted as an estimate of the fair value of the entire Company since a fair value calculation\nis only provided for a limited portion of the Company's assets and liabilities. Due to a wide range of valuation techniques and the degree\nof subjectivity used in making the estimates, comparisons between the Company's disclosures and those of other companies may not be\nmeaningful. The following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair values of the Company’s financial instruments.\nCash and Due from Banks and Interest-Bearing Time Deposits\nThe carrying amounts of cash and amounts due from banks and interest-bearing time deposits approximate their fair value due to the\nrelatively short time between origination of the instrument and its expected realization.\nSecurities Available for Sale and Held to Maturity\nThe fair value of investment and mortgage-backed securities is equal to the available quoted market price. If no quoted market price is\navailable, fair value is estimated using the quoted market price for similar securities.\nEquity Securities\nThe fair value of equity securities is equal to the available quoted market price.\nLoans Receivable\nThe fair value is estimated by discounting future cash flows using current market inputs at which loans with similar terms are adjusted\nfor liquidity and credit risk.\nRegulatory Stock\nThe carrying amount of Federal Home Loan Bank stock approximates fair value because Federal Home Loan Bank stock can only be\nredeemed or sold at par value and only to the respective issuing government supported institution or to another member institution.\nF-35\nBank-Owned Life Insurance\nThe Company reports bank-owned life insurance on its Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition at the cash surrender value. The\ncarrying amount of bank-owned life insurance approximates fair value because the fair value of bank-owned life insurance is equal to\nthe cash surrender value of the life insurance policies.\nAccrued Interest Receivable and Payable\nThe carrying amount of accrued interest receivable and payable approximates fair value.\nDeposits\nFair values for demand deposits, NOW accounts, savings and club accounts, and money market deposits are, by definition, equal to the\namount payable on demand at the reporting date as these products have no stated maturity. Fair values of fixed-maturity certificates of\ndeposit are estimated using a discounted cash flow calculation that applies market interest rates currently being offered on similar\ninstruments with similar maturities.\nAdvances from Federal Home Loan Bank\nFair value of advances from FHLB is estimated using discounted cash flow analyses, based on rates currently available to the Company\nfor advances from FHLB with similar terms and remaining maturities.\nOff-Balance Sheet Financial Instruments\nFair value of commitments to extend credit is estimated using the fees currently charged to enter into similar agreements, considering\nmarket interest rates, the remaining terms and present credit worthiness of the counterparties.\nIn accordance with FASB ASC Topic 825 for Financial Instruments, Disclosures about Fair Value of Financial Instruments, the\nCompany is required to disclose the fair value of financial instruments. The fair value of a financial instrument is the current amount\nthat would be exchanged between willing parties, other than in a distressed sale. Fair value is best determined using observable market\nprices; however, for many of the Company’s financial instruments no quoted market prices are readily available. In instances where\nquoted market prices are not readily available, fair value is determined using present value or other techniques appropriate for the\nparticular instrument. These techniques involve some degree of judgment, and as a result, are not necessarily indicative of the amounts\nthe Company would realize in a current market exchange. Different assumptions or estimation techniques may have a material effect on\nthe estimated fair value.\nThe following tables set forth the carrying value of financial assets and liabilities and the fair value for certain financial instruments that\nare not required to be measured or reported at fair value on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition for the periods indicated.\nThe table below excludes financial instruments for which the carrying amount approximates fair value.\nFair Va lue M easurements at J un e 3 0, 2024\nQuoted Prices Significant Significant\nin Active Markets Other Observable Unobservable\nCarrying Fair for Identical Assets Inputs Inputs\n(Dollars in thousands) Amount Value (Level 1) (Level 2) (Level 3)\nFinancial instruments - assets:\nLoans receivable, net $ 470,572 $ 439,118 $ — $ — $ 439,118\nSecurities held to maturity 93,056 76,827 — 76,827 —\nFinancial instruments - liabilities:\nCertificates of deposit 173,661 171,613 — — 171,613\nAdvances from Federal Home Loan Bank 48,000 48,000 — — 48,000\nOff-balance sheet financial instruments — — — — —\nF-36\nFair Va lue M easurements at J un e 3 0, 2023\nQuoted Prices Significant Significant\nin Active Markets Other Observable Unobservable\nCarrying Fair for Identical Assets Inputs Inputs\n(Dollars in thousands) Amount Value (Level 1) (Level 2) (Level 3)\nFinancial instruments - assets:\nLoans receivable, net $ 477,543 $ 436,636 $ — $ — $ 436,636\nSecurities held to maturity 99,690 82,313 — 82,313 —\nFinancial instruments - liabilities:\nCertificates of deposit 159,377 155,426 — — 155,426\nAdvances from Federal Home Loan Bank 34,000 34,000 — — 34,000\nOff-balance sheet financial instruments — — — — —\nNote 17 — Leases\nA lease is defined as a contract, or part of a contract, that conveys the right to control the use of identified property, plant, or equipment\nfor a period of time in exchange for consideration. Substantially all of the leases in which the Company is the lessee include real estate\nproperty for branches and office space with terms extending through 2043. Topic 842 requires the Company to recognize a right-of-use\n(“ROU”) asset and corresponding lease liability for each of its operating leases. The operating lease ROU asset was $8.3 million and\n$8.9 million as of June 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and the operating lease liability was $8.6 million and $9.1 million as of June\n30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The Company elected not to include short-term leases (i.e., leases with initial terms of twelve months\nof less), or equipment leases (deemed immaterial) on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition.\nThe calculated amount of the ROU assets and lease liabilities are impacted by the length of the lease term and the discount rate used to\npresent value the minimum lease payments. The Company’s lease agreements often include one or more options to renew at the\nCompany’s discretion. If at lease inception, the Company considers the exercising of a renewal option to be reasonably certain, the\nCompany will include the extended term in the calculation of the ROU asset and lease liability. Regarding the discount rate, Topic 842\nrequires the use of the rate implicit in the lease whenever this rate is readily determinable. As this rate is rarely determinable, the\nCompany utilizes its incremental borrowing rate at lease inception, on a collateralized basis, over a similar term.\nJune 30,\n2024\nWeighted average remaining lease term\nOperating leases 15.8 years\nWeighted average discount rate\nOperating leases 2.92 %\nJune 30,\n2023\nWeighted average remaining lease term\nOperating leases 16.4 years\nWeighted average discount rate\nOperating leases 2.89 %\nF-37\nThe Company recorded $891 thousand and $798 thousand of net lease costs during the years ended June 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\nFuture minimum payments for operating leases with initial or remaining terms of one year or more as of June 30, 2024 were as follows:\nJune 30,\n2024\nOperating\n(in thousands) Leases\nFor the year ended June 30,\n2025 $ 825\n2026 620\n2027 636\n2028 649\n2029 659\nThereafter 7,378\nTotal future minimum lease payments $ 10,767\nAmounts representing interest (2,214)\nPresent value of net future minimum lease payments $ 8,553\nNote 18 — Related Party Transactions\nAt June 30, 2024 and 2023 certain directors, executive officers, principal holders of the Company’s common stock, associates of such\npersons, and affiliated companies of such persons were indebted, including undrawn commitments to lend, to the Bank in the aggregate\namount of $3.8 million and $4.0 million, respectively.

Operations\nWilliam Penn Bancorporation (“the Company”) is a Maryland corporation that was incorporated in July 2020 to be the successor to\nWilliam Penn Bancorp, Inc. (“William Penn Bancorp”) upon completion of the second-step conversion of William Penn Bank (the\n“Bank”) from the two-tier mutual holding company structure to the stock holding company structure. William Penn, MHC was the\nformer mutual holding company for William Penn Bancorp prior to completion of the second-step conversion. In conjunction with the\nsecond-step conversion, each of William Penn, MHC and William Penn Bancorp ceased to exist. The second-step conversion was\ncompleted on March 24, 2021, at which time the Company sold, for gross proceeds of $126.4 million, a total of 12,640,035 shares of\ncommon stock at $10.00 per share. As part of the second-step conversion, each of the existing 776,647 outstanding shares of William\nPenn Bancorp common stock owned by persons other than William Penn, MHC was converted into 3.2585 shares of Company common\nstock. In addition, $5.4 million of cash held by William Penn, MHC was transferred to the Company and recorded as an increase to\nadditional paid-in capital following the completion of the second-step conversion.\nIn connection with the second-step conversion offering, the William Penn Bank Employee Stock Ownership Plan (“ESOP”) trustees\nsubscribed for, and intended to purchase, on behalf of the ESOP, 8% of the shares of the Company common stock sold in the offering\nand to fund its stock purchase through a loan from the Company equal to 100% of the aggregate purchase price of the common stock.\nAs a result of the second-step conversion offering being oversubscribed in the first tier of subscription priorities, the ESOP trustees were\nunable to purchase shares of the Company’s common stock in the second-step conversion offering. Subsequent to the completion of\nthe second-step conversion on March 24, 2021, the ESOP trustees purchased 881,130 shares, or $10.1 million, of the Company’s\ncommon stock in the open market. Such shares represent 6.97% of the shares of the Company common stock sold in the offering. The\nESOP did not purchase any additional shares of Company common stock in connection with the second-step conversion and offering.\nThe Company owns 100% of the outstanding common stock of the Bank, a Pennsylvania chartered stock savings bank. The Bank offers\nconsumer and commercial banking services to individuals, businesses, and nonprofit organizations throughout the Delaware Valley area\nthrough twelve full-service branch offices in Bucks County and Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and Burlington, Camden, and Mercer\nCounties in New Jersey. The Company is subject to regulation and supervision by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve\nSystem. The Bank is supervised and regulated by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”) and the Pennsylvania Department\nof Banking and Securities.\nNote 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\nThe unaudited financial statements and other financial information contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q should be read in\nconjunction with the audited financial statements, and related notes, of the Company at and for the year ended June 30, 2024.\nPrinciples of Consolidation and Basis of Presentation\nThe consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company, and its wholly owned subsidiary, the Bank, as well as the\nBank’s wholly owned subsidiary, WPSLA Investment Corporation (“WPSLA”). WPSLA is a Delaware corporation organized in\nApril 2000 to hold certain investment securities for the Bank. At September 30, 2024, WPSLA held $232.3 million of the Bank’s $240.9\nmillion investment securities portfolio. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated. Management\nmakes significant operating decisions based upon the analysis of the entire Company and financial performance is evaluated on a\ncompany-wide basis.\nUse of Estimates in the Preparation of Financial Statements\nThese consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States\nof America (“GAAP”) and in accordance with the rules of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission for Quarterly Reports on Form\n10-Q. The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and\nassumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the\nfinancial statements and the reported amounts of income and expenses during the reporting period. The significant estimates include the\nallowance for credit losses, goodwill, and income taxes. Actual results could differ from those estimates and assumptions.\nThe interim unaudited consolidated financial statements reflect all normal and recurring adjustments, which are, in the opinion of\nmanagement, considered necessary for a fair presentation of the financial condition and results of operations for the periods presented.\nThe results of operations for the three months ended September 30, 2024 are not necessarily indicative of the results of operations that\n8\nmay be expected for the entire fiscal year or any other period. Certain reclassifications have been made in the consolidated financial\nstatements to conform with current year classifications.\nPresentation of Cash Flows\nFor purposes of reporting cash flows, cash and cash equivalents include cash on hand, amounts due from banks, and interest-bearing\ndemand deposits.\nRevenue Recognition\nManagement determined that the primary sources of revenue emanating from interest and dividend income on loans and investments,\nalong with noninterest revenue resulting from investment security and loan gains (losses) and earnings on bank owned life insurances,\nare not within the scope of Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 606. The main types of noninterest income within the scope of\nASC 606 include service charges on deposit accounts. The Company has contracts with its deposit customers where fees are charged if\ncertain parameters are not met. These agreements can be cancelled at any time by either the Company or the deposit customer. Revenue\nfrom these transactions is recognized on a monthly basis as the Company has an unconditional right to the fee consideration. The\nCompany also has transaction fees related to specific transactions or activities resulting from a customer request or activity that include\noverdraft fees, online banking fees, interchange fees, ATM fees and other transaction fees. These fees are attributable to specific\nperformance obligations of the Company where the revenue is recognized at a defined point in time upon the completion of the requested\nservice/transaction.\nSegment Reporting\nThe Company acts as an independent community financial services provider and offers traditional banking and related financial services\nto individual, business, and government customers. Through its branch network, the Bank offers a full array of commercial and retail\nfinancial services, including the taking of time, savings, and demand deposits; the making of commercial and mortgage loans; and the\nproviding of other financial services. Management does not separately allocate expenses, including the cost of funding loan demand,\nbetween the commercial and retail operations of the Bank. As such, discrete financial information is not available and segment reporting\nwould not be meaningful.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted\nIn December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures. The\namendments in this ASU were issued to enhance the transparency and decision usefulness of income tax disclosures. The amendments\nin the update address investor requests for more transparency about income tax information through improvements to income tax\ndisclosures primarily related to the rate reconciliation and income taxes paid information. These updates are not expected to have a\nsignificant impact on the Company’s financial statements.\nIn October 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-06, Disclosure Improvements: Codification Amendments in Response to the SEC’s\nDisclosure Update and Simplification Initiative. The amendments in this ASU were issued in response to the SEC’s August 2018 final\nrule that updated and simplified disclosure requirements that the SEC believed were “redundant, duplicative, overlapping, outdated, or\nsuperseded.” The new guidance is intended to align U.S. GAAP requirements with those of the SEC and to facilitate the application of\nU.S. GAAP for all entities. Some of the amendments introduced by the ASU are technical corrections or clarifications of the FASB’s\ncurrent disclosure or presentation requirements. These updates are not expected to have a significant impact on the Company’s financial\nstatements.\nIn January 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-04, Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Facilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate\nReform on Financial Reporting, March 2020, to provide temporary optional expedients and exceptions to the U.S. GAAP guidance on\ncontract modifications and hedge accounting to ease the financial reporting burdens of the expected market transition from LIBOR and\nother interbank offered rates to alternative reference rates, such as the Secured Overnight Financing Rate. Entities can elect not to apply\ncertain modification accounting requirements to contracts affected by what the guidance calls “reference rate reform” if certain criteria\nare met. An entity that makes this election would not have to remeasure the contracts at the modification date or reassess a previous\naccounting determination. Also, entities can elect various optional expedients that would allow them to continue applying hedge\naccounting for hedging relationships affected by reference rate reform if certain criteria are met, and can make a one-time election to\nsell and/or reclassify held-to-maturity debt securities that reference an interest rate affected by reference rate reform. The sunset\nprovision included in Topic 848 was based on the expectations of when LIBOR would cease being published. In March 2021, the UK\nFinancial Conduct Authority announced that the intended cessation date of LIBOR would be June 30, 2024, which is beyond the\n9\nestablished sunset date of Topic 848. In December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-06, Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Deferral\nof the Sunset Date of Topic 848. The amendments in this ASU provide temporary relief by deferring the sunset date provision included\nin Topic 848. The amendments in ASU 2023-06 defer the effective date for all entities upon issuance through December 31, 2024. These\nupdates are not expected to have a significant impact on the Company’s financial statements.\nAllowance for Credit Losses on Loans\nThe Company maintains its allowance for credit losses (“ACL”) at a level that management believes to be appropriate to absorb\nestimated credit losses as of the date of the Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition. The Company established its allowance in\naccordance with the guidance included in Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 326, Financial Instruments – Credit Losses\n(“ASC 326”). The ACL is a valuation reserve established and maintained by charges against income and is deducted from the amortized\ncost basis of loans to present the net amount expected to be collected on the loans. Loans, or portions thereof, are charged-off against\nthe ACL when they are deemed uncollectible. Expected recoveries do not exceed the aggregate amounts previously charged-off and\nexpected to be charged-off. The ACL is an estimate of expected credit losses, measured over the contractual life of a loan, that considers\nour historical loss experience, the historical loss experience of a peer group of banks identified by management, current conditions and\nforecasts of future economic conditions. The determination of an appropriate ACL is inherently subjective and may have significant\nchanges from period to period. The methodology for determining the ACL has two main components: evaluation of expected credit\nlosses for certain groups of homogeneous loans that share similar risk characteristics and evaluation of loans that do not share risk\ncharacteristics with other loans. The ACL is measured on a collective (pool) basis when similar characteristics exist. The Company’s\nloan portfolio is segmented by loan types that have similar risk characteristics and behave similarly during economic cycles.\nHistorical credit loss experience is the basis for the estimate of expected credit losses. We apply our historical loss rates and the historical\nloss rates of a group of peer banks identified by management to pools of loans with similar risk characteristics using the Weighted-\nAverage Remaining Maturity (“WARM”) method. The remaining contractual life of the pools of loans with similar risk characteristics\nis adjusted by expected scheduled payments and prepayments. After consideration of the historical loss calculation, management applies\nqualitative adjustments to reflect the current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts not already reflected in the historical\nloss information. Our reasonable and supportable forecast adjustment is based on a regional economic indicator obtained from the St.\nLouis Federal Reserve economic database. The Company selected eight qualitative metrics which were correlated with the Bank and\nits peer group’s historical loss patterns. The eight qualitative metrics include: changes in lending policies and procedures, changes in\nnational and local economic conditions as well as business conditions, changes in the nature, complexity, and volume of the portfolio,\nchanges in the experience, ability, and depth of lenders and lending management, changes in the volume and severity of past due and\nclassified loans, changes in the quality of the Bank’s loan review system, changes in the value of collateral securing the loans, and\nchanges in or the existence of credit concentrations. The adjustments are weighted for relevance before applying to each pool of loans.\nEach quarter, management reviews the recommended adjustment factors and applies any additional adjustments based on local and\ncurrent conditions.\nThe Company has elected to exclude $2.0 million of accrued interest receivable as of September 30, 2024 from the measurement of its\nACL. When a loan is placed on non-accrual status, any outstanding accrued interest is reversed against interest income. Accrued interest\non loans is reported in the accrued interest receivable and other assets line on the consolidated statements of financial condition.\nThe ACL for individual loans begins with the use of normal credit review procedures to identify whether a loan no longer shares similar\nrisk characteristics with other pooled loans and, therefore, should be individually assessed. We evaluate all commercial loans that meet\nthe following criteria: (1) when it is determined that foreclosure is probable, (2) substandard, doubtful and nonperforming loans when\nrepayment is expected to be provided substantially through the operation or sale of the collateral, (3) when it is determined by\nmanagement that a loan does not share similar risk characteristics with other loans. Credit loss estimates are calculated based on the\nfollowing three acceptable methods for measuring the ACL: 1) the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan’s\noriginal effective interest rate; 2) the loan’s observable market price; or 3) the fair value of the collateral when the loan is collateral\ndependent. Our individual loan evaluations consist primarily of the fair value of collateral method because most of our loans are collateral\ndependent. Collateral values are discounted to consider disposition costs when appropriate. A charge-off is recorded if the fair value of\nthe loan is less than the loan balance.\nAllowance for Credit Losses on Unfunded Loan Commitments\nThe Company estimates expected credit losses over the contractual period in which the Bank is exposed to credit risk via a contractual\nobligation to extend credit unless that obligation is unconditionally cancellable by the Bank. The allowance for credit losses on unfunded\nloan commitments is included in accrued interest payable and other liabilities in the Company’s Statements of Financial Condition and\n10\nis adjusted through credit loss expense. The estimate includes consideration of the likelihood that funding will occur and an estimate of\nexpected credit losses on commitments expected to be funded over its estimated life.\nAllowance for Credit Losses on Held to Maturity Securities\nThe Company accounts for its held to maturity securities in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 326-20,\nFinancial Instruments – Credit Loss – Measured at Amortized Cost, which requires that the Company measure expected credit losses\non held to maturity debt securities on a collective basis by major security type. The estimate of expected credit losses considers historical\ncredit loss information that is adjusted for current economic conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts.\nThe Company classifies its held to maturity debt securities into the following major security types: mortgage-backed securities, U.S.\ngovernment agency securities and municipal bonds. Generally, the mortgage-backed securities and U.S. government agency securities\nare government guaranteed with a history of no credit losses and the municipal bonds are highly rated with a history of no credit losses.\nCredit ratings of the municipal bonds are reviewed on a quarterly basis. Based on the government guarantee, our historical experience\nincluding no credit losses, and the high credit rating of our municipal bonds, the Company determined that an allowance for credit losses\non its held to maturity portfolio is not required.\nAccrued interest receivable on held to maturity debt securities totaled $116 thousand as of September 30, 2024 and is included within\naccrued interest receivable and other assets on the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition. This amount is excluded\nfrom the estimate of expected credit losses. Generally, held to maturity debt securities are classified as nonaccrual when the contractual\npayment of principal or interest has become 90 days past due or management has serious doubts about the further collectability of\nprincipal or interest. When held to maturity debt securities are placed on nonaccrual status, unpaid interest credited to income is reversed\nagainst interest income.\nAllowance for Credit Losses on Available for Sale Securities\nThe Company measures expected credit losses on available for sale debt securities when the Bank intends to sell, or when it is not more\nlikely than not that it will be required to sell, the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis. If either of the criteria regarding\nintent or requirement to sell is met, the amortized cost basis of the security is written down to fair value through income. For available\nfor sale debt securities that do not meet the previously mentioned criteria, the Company evaluates whether the decline in fair value has\nresulted from credit losses or other factors. In making this assessment, the Company considers the extent to which fair value is less than\namortized cost, any changes to the rating of the security by a rating agency, and adverse conditions specifically related to the security,\namong other factors. If this evaluation indicates that a credit loss exists, the present value of cash flows expected to be collected from\nthe security are compared to the amortized cost basis of the security. If the present value of cash flows expected to be collected is less\nthan the amortized cost basis, a credit loss exists and an allowance for credit losses is recorded for the credit loss, equal to the amount\nthat the fair value is less than the amortized cost basis. Any impairment that has not been recorded through an allowance for credit\nlosses is recognized in other comprehensive income.\nThe ACL on available for sale debt securities is included within securities available for sale on the Consolidated Statements of Financial\nCondition. Changes in the allowance for credit losses are recorded within provision for credit losses on the Consolidated Statements of\nIncome. Losses are charged against the allowance when the Company believes the collectability of an available for sale security is in\njeopardy or when either of the criteria regarding intent or requirement to sell is met.\nAccrued interest receivable on available for sale debt securities totaled $756 thousand as of September 30, 2024 and is included within\naccrued interest receivable and other assets on the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition. This amount is excluded\nfrom the estimate of expected credit losses. Generally, available for sale debt securities are classified as nonaccrual when the contractual\npayment of principal or interest has become 90 days past due or management has serious doubts about the further collectability of\nprincipal or interest. When available for sale debt securities are placed on nonaccrual status, unpaid interest credited to income is reversed\nagainst interest income.\nNote 3 - Earnings Per Share\nThe following table presents a calculation of basic and diluted earnings per share for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and\n2023. Earnings per share is computed by dividing net income available to common stockholders by the weighted average number of\nshares of common stock outstanding. The difference between common shares issued and basic average common shares outstanding, for\npurposes of calculating basic earnings per share, is a result of subtracting unallocated ESOP shares and unvested restricted stock shares.\nThere are no convertible securities which would affect the numerator in calculating basic and diluted earnings per share; therefore, the\n11\nnet loss of $21 thousand and the net income of $179 thousand for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively,\nwere used as the numerators. See Note 11 to these consolidated financial statements for further discussion of stock grants.\nThe following table sets forth the composition of the weighted average common shares (denominator) used in the basic and diluted\nearnings per share computation.\nThree M onth s E nded\nSeptember 30,\n(Dollars in thousands, except share and per share amounts) 2024 2023\nBasic and diluted (loss) earnings per share:\nNet (loss) income $ (21) $ 179\nBasic average common shares outstanding 8,205,411 10,600,522\nEffect of dilutive securities 27,530 20,081\nDilutive average shares outstanding 8,232,941 10,620,603\n(Loss) earnings per share:\nBasic $ (0.00) $ 0.02\nDiluted $ (0.00) $ 0.02\nAnti-dilutive shares are common stock equivalents with weighted average exercise prices in excess of the weighted average market\nvalue for the periods presented. There were 1,264,000 and 1,197,640 stock options that were anti-dilutive for the three months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\nNote 4 – Changes in and Reclassifications Out of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss\nThe following tables present the changes in the balances of each component of accumulated other comprehensive loss (“AOCL”) for\nthe three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023.\n(Dollars in thousands)\nUnrealized Losses on Securities\nAvailable for Sale\nAccumulated Other Comprehensive Loss (1) 2024 2023\nBalance at June 30, $ (22,013) $ (23,378)\nOther comprehensive gain (loss) before reclassifications 4,822 (4,587)\nAmounts reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive loss — —\nPeriod change 4,822 (4,587)\nBalance at September 30, $ (17,191) $ (27,965)\n(1) All amounts are net of tax.

At June 30, 2024, the Company had one security in the less than 12 months loss position and 124\nsecurities in the 12 months or greater loss position. The unrealized loss on securities is due to current interest rate levels relative to the\nCompany’s cost. Because the unrealized losses are due to current interest rate levels relative to the Company’s cost and not credit quality,\nand because the Company does not intend to sell the investments and it is not more likely than not that the Company will be required to\n14\nsell these investments before recovery of its amortized cost, which may be at maturity, the Company does not consider the unrealized\nlosses to be credit losses at September 30, 2024 and June 30, 2024. The Company did not recognize any credit losses on these securities\nfor the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023.\nAt September 30, 2024 and June 30, 2024, $2.7 million and $2.6 million, respectively, in the carrying value of investment securities\nwere pledged to secure municipal deposits.\nEquity Securities\nThe Company had one equity security with a fair value of $2.1 million as of September 30, 2024 and $2.0 million as of June 30, 2024.\nDuring the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company recorded $79 thousand and $73 thousand of unrealized\ngains, respectively, which were recorded in Unrealized gain on equity securities in the Consolidated Statements of Income.\nNote 6 – Loans\nMajor classifications of loans, net of deferred loan fees (costs) of $493 thousand and $545 thousand at September 30, 2024 and June 30,\n2024, respectively, are summarized as follows:\nSeptem ber 30, Jun e 30,\n2024 2024\n(Dollars in thousands) Amount Percent Amount Percent\nResidential real estate:\n1 - 4 family $ 126,419 27.20 % $ 127,911 27.00 %\nHome equity and HELOCs 29,538 6.36 30,767 6.50\nConstruction -residential 9,829 2.11 8,802 1.86\nCommercial real estate:\n1 - 4 family investor 89,424 19.24 92,284 19.49\nMulti-family (five or more) 15,955 3.43 15,619 3.30\nCommercial non-residential 154,612 33.27 158,481 33.46\nConstruction and land 20,873 4.49 22,687 4.79\nCommercial 16,245 3.50 15,090 3.19\nConsumer loans 1,836 0.40 1,920 0.41\nTotal Loans 464,731 100.00 % 473,561 100.00 %\nAllowance for credit losses (2,522) (2,989)\nNet Loans $ 462,209 $ 470,572\nMortgage loans serviced for others are not included in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition.

The Bank retained the related servicing rights for the loans that were sold and receives a 25 basis point servicing\nfee from the purchasers of the loans. Custodial escrow balances maintained in connection with the foregoing loan servicing are included\nin advances from borrowers for taxes and insurance.\nAllowance for Credit Losses. The following tables set forth the allocation of the Bank’s allowance for credit losses by loan category at\nthe dates indicated. The portion of the credit loss allowance allocated to each loan category does not represent the total available for\nfuture losses which may occur within the loan category since the total credit loss allowance is a valuation allocation applicable to the\nentire loan portfolio. The Company generally charges-off the collateral or discounted cash flow deficiency on all loans at 90 days past\ndue and all loans rated substandard or worse that are 90 days past due.\n15\nThe following table presents, by loan portfolio segment, the changes in the allowance for credit losses for the three months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024 and 2023:\nSeptember 30, 2024 R es id ential real es ta te : Commerc ia l r eal estate:\nHome Equity Construction- 1 - 4 family Multi-family Commercial Construction\n(Dollar amounts in thousands) 1 - 4 family and HELOCs residential investor (five or more) non-residential and Land Commercial Consumer Total\nAllowance for credit losses:\nBeginning balance $ 325 $ 100 $ 31 $ 268 $ 32 $ 1,533 $ 147 $ 304 $ 249 $ 2,989\nCharge-offs — — — — — — — — (18) (18)\nRecoveries — — — — — — — — 1 1\nProvision (recovery) (4) (3) 11 (85) 1 (379) (22) 23 8 (450)\nEnding Balance $ 321 $ 97 $ 42 $ 183 $ 33 $ 1,154 $ 125 $ 327 $ 240 $ 2,522\nSeptember 30, 2023 R es id ential real e st at e: C om m ercial real es ta te:\nHome Equity Construction- 1 - 4 family Multi-family Commercial Construction\n(Dollar amounts in thousands) 1-4 family and HELOCs residential investor (five or more) non-residential and Land Commercial Consumer Total\nAllowance for credit losses:\nBeginning balance $ 486 $ 113 $ 214 $ 569 $ 89 $ 1,420 $ 281 $ 82 $ 59 $ 3,313\nImpact of adopting ASU 2016-13 (67) 19 (174) (241) (30) 379 (93) 254 196 243\nCharge-offs — — — — — — — — — —\nRecoveries — — — — — — — — 26 26\nProvision (recovery) (12) (1) (1) (3) (6) (32) 45 4 11 5\nEnding Balance $ 407 $ 131 $ 39 $ 325 $ 53 $ 1,767 $ 233 $ 340 $ 292 $ 3,587\nDuring the three months ended September 30, 2024, the changes in the provision for credit losses for each portfolio of loans were\nprimarily due to fluctuations in the outstanding balance of each portfolio of loans collectively evaluated for impairment. The overall\ndecrease in the allowance during the three months ended September 30, 2024 can be primarily attributed to a decrease in delinquent 1-\n4 family investor loans and commercial non-residential loans, as well as consistently low levels of net charge-offs, strong asset quality\nmetrics and continued conservative lending practices.\nDuring the three months ended September 30, 2023, and exclusive of the impact of the adoption of ASU 2016-13, the changes in the\nprovision for credit losses for each portfolio of loans were primarily due to fluctuations in the outstanding balance of each portfolio of\nloans collectively evaluated for impairment. Specifically, we experienced significant growth in our commercial construction and land\nportfolio during the three months ended September 30, 2023 and a corresponding increase in the provision for credit losses for this\nportfolio. The overall increase in the allowance during the three months ended September 30, 2023 can be primarily attributed to the\npreviously mentioned growth in our commercial construction and land portfolio, partially offset by improved asset quality metrics with\ncontinued low levels of net charge-offs and a decrease in non-performing assets.\nUnder the provisions of ASU 326, loans evaluated individually for impairment consist of non-accrual loans.

The grading analysis estimates the capability of the borrower\nto repay the contractual obligations of the loan agreements as scheduled or at all. All loans greater than 90 days past due are considered\nSubstandard. The Company’s internal credit risk grading system is based on experiences with similarly graded loans.\nThe Company’s internally assigned grades are as follows:\nPass – loans which are protected by the current net worth and paying capacity of the obligor or by the value of the underlying collateral.\nSpecial Mention – loans where a potential weakness or risk exists, which could cause a more serious problem if not corrected.\nSubstandard – loans that have a well-defined weakness based on objective evidence and are characterized by the distinct possibility that\nthe Bank will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected.\nDoubtful – loans classified as doubtful have all the weaknesses inherent in a substandard asset. In addition, these weaknesses make\ncollection or liquidation in full highly questionable and improbable, based on existing circumstances.\nLoss – loans classified as a loss are considered uncollectible, or of such value that continuance as an asset is not warranted.\nThe Bank has a structured loan rating process with several layers of internal and external oversight to help ensure that risk ratings are\naccurate and reflect the present and future capacity of borrowers to repay a loan as agreed. Generally, consumer and residential mortgage\nloans are included in the Pass category unless a specific action, such as nonperformance, repossession, or death occurs to raise awareness\nof a possible credit event. The Company’s Credit Department is responsible for the timely and accurate risk rating of the loans on an\nongoing basis. Every credit which must be approved by Loan Committee or the Board of Directors is assigned a risk rating at time of\nconsideration. The Credit Department also annually reviews commercial relationships of $500,000 or greater to assign or re-affirm risk\nratings.\n17\nThe following tables set forth the amounts of the portfolio of classified asset categories for the commercial loan portfolios at September\n30, 2024 and June 30, 2024:\nSeptember 3 0 , 2024\nTerm Loans Amortized Cost Basis by Origination Fiscal Year Revolving Loans Revolving Loans\nAmortized Converted\n2025 2024 2023 2022 2021 Prior Cost Basis to Term Total\n1 - 4 family investor\nPass $ 421 $ 3,826 $ 9,800 $ 7,056 $ 16,926 $ 46,412 $ 2,446 $ 701 $ 87,588\nSpecial Mention — — — — — 860 — — 860\nSubstandard — — 907 — — 69 — — 976\nDoubtful — — — — — — — — —\nLoss — — — — — — — — —\nTotal 1 - 4 family\ninvestor $ 421 $ 3,826 $ 10,707 $ 7,056 $ 16,926 $ 47,341 $ 2,446 $ 701 $ 89,424\nCurrent period gross\ncharge-offs $ — $ — $ — $ — $ — $ — $ — $ — $ —\nMulti-family (five or\nmore)\nPass $ 487 $ 330 $ 1,298 $ 1,297 $ 4,062 $ 8,299 $ — $ — $ 15,773\nSpecial Mention — — — — — — — — —\nSubstandard — — — — — 182 — — 182\nDoubtful — — — — — — — — —\nLoss — — — — — — — — —\nTotal Multi-family $ 487 $ 330 $ 1,298 $ 1,297 $ 4,062 $ 8,481 $ — $ — $ 15,955\nCurrent period gross\ncharge-offs $ — $ — $ — $ — $ — $ — $ — $ — $ —\nCommercial non-\nresidential\nPass $ 349 $ 11,960 $ 18,643 $ 59,430 $ 29,773 $ 34,034 $ — $ 89 $ 154,278\nSpecial Mention — — — — — — — — —\nSubstandard — — — — 319 15 — — 334\nDoubtful — — — — — — — — —\nLoss — — — — — — — — —\nTotal Commercial non-\nresidential $ 349 $ 11,960 $ 18,643 $ 59,430 $ 30,092 $ 34,049 $ — $ 89 $ 154,612\nCurrent period gross\ncharge-offs $ — $ — $ — $ — $ — $ — $ — $ — $ —\nConstruction and land\nPass $ — $ 5,040 $ 3,321 $ 10,488 $ — $ 2,024 $ — $ — $ 20,873\nSpecial Mention — — — — — — — — —\nSubstandard — — — — — — — — —\nDoubtful — — — — — — — — —\nLoss — — — — — — — — —\nTotal Construction and\nland $ — $ 5,040 $ 3,321 $ 10,488 $ — $ 2,024 $ — $ — $ 20,873\nCurrent period gross\ncharge-offs $ — $ — $ — $ — $ — $ — $ — $ — $ —\nCommercial\nPass $ — $ 863 $ 7,853 $ 7,099 $ — $ 430 $ — $ — $ 16,245\nSpecial Mention — — — — — — — — —\nSubstandard — — — — — — — — —\nDoubtful — — — — — — — — —\nLoss — — — — — — — — —\nTotal Commercial $ — $ 863 $ 7,853 $ 7,099 $ — $ 430 $ — $ — $ 16,245\nCurrent period gross\ncharge-offs $ — $ — $ — $ — $ — $ — $ — $ — $ —\n18\nJune 30 , 2 0 24\nTerm Loans Amortized Cost Basis by Origination Fiscal Year Revolving Loans Revolving Loans\nAmortized Converted\n2024 2023 2022 2021 2020 Prior Cost Basis to Term Total\n1 - 4 family investor\nPass $ 3,852 $ 10,948 $ 6,228 $ 17,462 $ 11,855 $ 36,635 $ 2,702 $ 706 $ 90,388\nSpecial Mention — — — — — 889 — — 889\nSubstandard — — 930 — — 77 — — 1,007\nDoubtful — — — — — — — — —\nLoss — — — — — — — — —\nTotal 1 - 4 family\ninvestor $ 3,852 $ 10,948 $ 7,158 $ 17,462 $ 11,855 $ 37,601 $ 2,702 $ 706 $ 92,284\nCurrent period gross\ncharge-offs $ — $ — $ — $ — $ — $ — $ — $ — $ —\nMulti-family (five or\nmore)\nPass $ 331 $ 1,307 $ 1,310 $ 4,072 $ 5,508 $ 2,897 $ — $ — $ 15,425\nSpecial Mention — — — — — — — — —\nSubstandard — — — — — 194 — — 194\nDoubtful — — — — — — — — —\nLoss — — — — — — — — —\nTotal Multi-family $ 331 $ 1,307 $ 1,310 $ 4,072 $ 5,508 $ 3,091 $ — $ — $ 15,619\nCurrent period gross\ncharge-offs $ — $ — $ — $ — $ — $ — $ — $ — $ —\nCommercial non-\nresidential\nPass $ 11,970 $ 20,964 $ 59,973 $ 30,013 $ 15,668 $ 19,465 $ — $ 91 $ 158,144\nSpecial Mention — — — — — — — — —\nSubstandard — — — 319 — 18 — — 337\nDoubtful — — — — — — — — —\nLoss — — — — — — — — —\nTotal Commercial non-\nresidential $ 11,970 $ 20,964 $ 59,973 $ 30,332 $ 15,668 $ 19,483 $ — $ 91 $ 158,481\nCurrent period gross\ncharge-offs $ — $ — $ — $ — $ — $ — $ — $ — $ —\nConstruction and land\nPass $ 4,341 $ 5,797 $ 10,501 $ — $ — $ 2,048 $ — $ — $ 22,687\nSpecial Mention — — — — — — — — —\nSubstandard — — — — — — — — —\nDoubtful — — — — — — — — —\nLoss — — — — — — — — —\nTotal Construction and\nland $ 4,341 $ 5,797 $ 10,501 $ — $ — $ 2,048 $ — $ — $ 22,687\nCurrent period gross\ncharge-offs $ — $ — $ — $ — $ — $ — $ — $ — $ —\nCommercial\nPass $ 593 $ 6,914 $ 7,367 $ — $ 14 $ 202 $ — $ — $ 15,090\nSpecial Mention — — — — — — — — —\nSubstandard — — — — — — — — —\nDoubtful — — — — — — — — —\nLoss — — — — — — — — —\nTotal Commercial $ 593 $ 6,914 $ 7,367 $ — $ 14 $ 202 $ — $ — $ 15,090\nCurrent period gross\ncharge-offs $ — $ — $ — $ — $ — $ — $ — $ — $ —\n19\nThe Company monitors the credit risk profile by payment activity for residential and consumer loans.

Accordingly, the Company has extended credit primarily to residential borrowers and commercial entities in\nthis area whose ability to repay their loans is influenced by the region’s economy.\nAs of September 30, 2024, the Company considered its concentration of credit risk to be acceptable. As of September 30, 2024,\ncommercial real estate loans secured by retail space totaled approximately $61.5 million, or 13.2% of total loans, and were comprised\nof $50.5 million of non-owner-occupied properties and $11.0 million of owner-occupied properties.

The Company recorded goodwill of $4.9 million and core deposit intangibles of $1.4\nmillion in connection with the 2018 acquisition of Audubon Savings Bank. The Company also recorded core deposit intangibles totaling\n$65 thousand and $197 thousand in connection with the 2020 acquisitions of Fidelity Savings and Loan Association of Bucks County\n(“Fidelity”) and Washington Savings Bank (“Washington”), respectively. As of September 30, 2024 and June 30, 2024, the other\n22\nintangibles consisted of $323 thousand and $356 thousand, respectively, of core deposit intangibles, which are amortized over an\nestimated useful life of ten years.\nThe Company performs its annual impairment evaluation on June 30 or more frequently if events and circumstances indicate that the\nfair value of the banking unit is less than its carrying value. During the year ended June 30, 2024, management included considerations\nof the current economic environment in its evaluation, and determined that it is not more likely than not that the carrying value of\ngoodwill is impaired. No goodwill impairment existed at June 30, 2024. During the three months ended September 30, 2024,\nmanagement considered the current economic environment in its evaluation, and determined based on the totality of its qualitative\nassessment that it is not more likely than not that the carrying value of goodwill is impaired. No goodwill impairment existed during the\nthree months ended September 30, 2024.\nGoodwill and other intangibles are summarized as follows for the periods presented:\nCore Deposit\n(Dollars in thousands) Goodwill Intangibles\nBalance, June 30, 2024 $ 4,858 $ 356\nAdjustments:\nAdditions — —\nAmortization — (33)\nBalance, September 30, 2024 $ 4,858 $ 323\nCore Deposit\n(Dollars in thousands) Goodwill Intangibles\nBalance, June 30, 2023 $ 4,858 $ 519\nAdjustments:\nAdditions — —\nAmortization — (41)\nBalance, September 30, 2023 $ 4,858 $ 478\nAggregate amortization expense was $33 thousand and $41 thousand for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023,\nrespectively.\nNote 9 – Deposits\nDeposits consist of the following major classifications as of September 30, 2024 and June 30, 2024:\n(Dollars in thousands) September 30, 2024 June 30, 2024\nNon-interest bearing checking $ 66,235 $ 64,627\nInterest bearing checking 126,894 132,927\nMoney market accounts 173,957 176,422\nSavings and club accounts 78,859 82,173\nCertificates of deposit 183,844 173,661\n$ 629,789 $ 629,810\nNote 10 – Borrowings\nThe Bank is a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank (“FHLB”) system, which consists of 11 regional Federal Home Loan Banks.\nThe FHLB provides a central credit facility primarily for member institutions. The Bank had a maximum borrowing capacity with the\nFHLB of Pittsburgh of approximately $283.6 million and $287.3 million at September 30, 2024 and June 30, 2024, respectively. FHLB\nadvances are secured by qualifying assets of the Bank, which include Federal Home Loan Bank stock and loans. The Bank had $410.7\nmillion and $415.9 million of loans pledged as collateral as of September 30, 2024 and June 30, 2024, respectively. The Bank, as a\nmember of the FHLB of Pittsburgh, is required to acquire and hold shares of capital stock in the FHLB of Pittsburgh. The Bank was in\ncompliance with the requirements for the FHLB of Pittsburgh with an investment of $2.4 million and $2.8 million at September 30,\n2024 and June 30, 2024, respectively.\n23\nAdvances from the FHLB of Pittsburgh consisted of $39.0 million and $48.0 million of fixed rate short-term borrowings as of September\n30, 2024 and June 30, 2024, respectively.\nAs of September 30, 2024 and June 30, 2024, the Bank had $8.7 million and $8.8 million of loans pledged as collateral to secure a $3.8\nmillion and $3.6 million overnight line of credit from the Federal Reserve Bank, respectively. There was no outstanding balance for the\novernight line of credit from the Federal Reserve Bank as of September 30, 2024 and June 30, 2024. In addition, as of September 30,\n2024 and June 30, 2024, the Bank had $10.0 million of available credit from Atlantic Community Bankers Bank to purchase federal\nfunds.\nNote 11 – Stock Based Compensation\nStock-based compensation is accounted for in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 718 for Compensation — Stock Compensation. The\nCompany establishes fair value for its equity awards to determine their cost. The Company recognizes the related expense for employees\nover the appropriate vesting period, or when applicable, service period, using the straight-line method. However, consistent with the\nguidance, the amount of stock-based compensation recognized at any date must at least equal the portion of the grant date value of the\naward that is vested at that date. As a result, it may be necessary to recognize the expense using a ratable method.\nOn May 10, 2022, the shareholders of the Company approved the William Penn Bancorporation 2022 Equity Incentive Plan (the “Plan”).\nThe Plan provides for the issuance of up to 1,769,604 shares (505,601 restricted stock awards and 1,264,003 stock options) of Company\ncommon stock.\nUnder the Plan, the Company has granted 505,600 shares of restricted stock, net of forfeitures, with a weighted average grant date fair\nvalue of $11.71 per share. To fund the grant of restricted common stock, the Company issued shares from authorized but unissued\nshares. Restricted shares granted under the Plan vest in equal installments over a five year period. Compensation expense related to the\nrestricted shares is recognized ratably over the vesting period in an amount which totals the market price of the Company’s stock at the\ngrant date. The expense recognized for the restricted shares for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was $298 thousand\nand $282 thousand, respectively. The expected future compensation expense related to the 313,989 non-vested restricted shares\noutstanding at September 30, 2024 was $3.2 million over a weighted average period of 2.77 years. The expected future compensation\nexpense related to the 383,258 non-vested restricted shares outstanding at September 30, 2023 was $4.0 million over a weighted average\nperiod of 3.63 years.\nThe following is a summary of the Company's restricted stock activity during the three months ended September 30, 2024:\nWeighted\nNumber of Average\nSummary of Non-vested Restricted Stock Award Activity Shares Grant Price\nNon-vested Restricted Stock Awards outstanding July 1, 2024 313,989 $ 11.73\nIssued — —\nVested — —\nForfeited — —\nNon-vested Restricted Stock Awards outstanding September 30, 2024 313,989 $ 11.73\nThe following is a summary of the Company's restricted stock activity during the three months ended September 30, 2023:\nWeighted\nNumber of Average\nSummary of Non-vested Restricted Stock Award Activity Shares Grant Price\nNon-vested Restricted Stock Awards outstanding July 1, 2023 383,258 $ 11.66\nIssued — —\nVested — —\nForfeited — —\nNon-vested Restricted Stock Awards outstanding September 30, 2023 383,258 $ 11.66\nUnder the Plan, the Company granted 1,264,000 stock options, net of forfeitures, with a weighted average grant date fair value of $3.24\nper share. Stock options granted under the Plan vest in equal installments over a five year period. Stock options were granted at a\nweighted average exercise price of $11.71, which represents the fair value of the Company's common stock price on the grant date based\n24\non the closing market price, and have an expiration period of 10 years. The fair value of stock options granted was valued using the\nBlack-Scholes option pricing model using the following weighted average assumptions: expected life of 6.5 years, risk-free rate of return\nof 2.98%, volatility of 24.60%, and a dividend yield of 1.02%. Compensation expense recognized for the stock options for the three\nmonths ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was $206 thousand and $195 thousand, respectively. The expected future compensation\nexpense related to the 1,264,000 stock options outstanding at September 30, 2024 was $2.2 million over a weighted average period of\n2.77 years. The expected future compensation expense related to the 1,197,640 stock options outstanding at September 30, 2023 was\n$2.8 million over a weighted average period of 3.63 years.\nThe following is a summary of the Company's stock option activity during the three months ended September 30, 2024:\nWeighted\nNumber of Exercise Price\nSummary of Stock Option Activity Options per Shares\nBeginning balance July 1, 2024 1,264,000 $ 11.71\nGranted — —\nExercised\nForfeited — —\nExpired — —\nEnding balance September 30, 2024 1,264,000 $ 11.71\nThe following is a summary of the Company's stock option activity during the three months ended September 30, 2023:\nWeighted\nNumber of Exercise Price\nSummary of Stock Option Activity Options per Shares\nBeginning balance July 1, 2023 1,197,640 $ 11.66\nGranted — —\nExercised — —\nForfeited — —\nExpired — —\nEnding balance September 30, 2023 1,197,640 $ 11.66\nThe weighted average remaining contractual term was approximately 7.72 years and the aggregate intrinsic value was $701 thousand\nfor options outstanding as of September 30, 2024. As of September 30, 2024, exercisable options totaled 479,056 with a weighted\naverage exercise of price of $11.66 per share, a weighted average remaining contractual term of approximately 7.63 years, and the\naggregate intrinsic value was $280 thousand. The weighted average remaining contractual term was approximately 8.63 years and the\naggregate intrinsic value was $976 thousand for options outstanding as of September 30, 2023. As of September 30, 2023, exercisable\noptions totaled 239,528 with a weighted average exercise of price of $11.66 per share, a weighted average remaining contractual term\nof approximately 8.63 years, and the aggregate intrinsic value was $195 thousand.\nNote 12 – Commitments and Contingencies\nThe Company is a party to financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk in the normal course of business to meet the financing needs\nof its customers. These financial instruments include commitments to extend credit. Those instruments involve, to varying degrees,\nelements of credit risk in excess of the amount recognized in the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition.\nA summary of the Company's loan commitments is as follows as of September 30, 2024 and June 30, 2024:\nSeptember 30, June 30,\n(Dollars in thousands) 2024 2024\nCommitments to extend credit $ 35,919 $ 15,676\nUnfunded commitments under lines of credit 61,571 65,705\nStandby letters of credit 118 86\nCommitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a customer if there is no violation of any condition established in the contract.\nSince many of the commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon, the total commitment amounts do not necessarily\nrepresent future cash requirements. Commitments generally have 90-day fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may\n25\nrequire payment of a fee. The Company evaluates each customer’s credit worthiness on a case-by-case basis. The amount of collateral\nobtained, if deemed necessary by the Company upon extension of credit, is based on management’s credit evaluation. Collateral held\nvaries, but primarily includes residential and commercial real estate.\nAs of September 30, 2024 and June 30, 2024, the allowance for credit losses on unfunded lending commitments was $183 thousand and\n$128 thousand, respectively. The provision for credit losses on unfunded lending commitments recognized for three months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024 was $55 thousand. The Company did not record a provision for credit losses on unfunded lending commitments for\nthe three months ended September 30, 2023.\nPeriodically, there have been other various claims and lawsuits against the Bank, such as claims to enforce liens, condemnation\nproceedings on properties in which it holds security interests, claims involving the making and servicing of real property loans and other\nissues incident to its business. The Bank is not a party to any pending legal proceedings that it believes would have a material adverse\neffect on its financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nNote 13 - Regulatory Capital Requirements\nThe Bank is subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by the federal banking agencies. Failure to meet the\nminimum capital requirements can initiate certain mandatory and possibly additional discretionary actions by regulators that, if\nundertaken, could have a direct material effect on the Bank’s financial statements. Under capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory\nframework for prompt corrective action, the Bank must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of the Bank’s\nassets, liabilities, and certain off-balance sheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting practices. The Bank’s capital amounts\nand classification are also subject to qualitative judgments by the regulators about components, risk-weightings, and other factors.\nQuantitative measures established by regulation to ensure capital adequacy require the Bank to maintain minimum amounts and ratios\n(described below) of tangible and core capital to total adjusted assets and of total capital to risk-weighted assets.\nAs of September 30, 2024 and June 30, 2024, the most recent notification from the regulators categorized the Bank as “well capitalized”\nunder the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action.\nFederal banking agencies have established an optional “community bank leverage ratio” of between 8% to 10% tangible equity to\naverage total consolidated assets for qualifying institutions with assets of less than $10 billion of assets. Institutions with capital meeting\nthe specified requirement and electing to follow the alternative framework would be deemed to comply with the applicable regulatory\ncapital requirements, including the risk-based requirements and would be considered well-capitalized under the prompt corrective action\nframework. In April 2020, the Federal banking regulatory agencies modified the original Community Bank Leverage Ratio (CBLR)\nframework and provided that, as of the second quarter 2020, a banking organization with a leverage ratio of 8 percent or greater and that\nmeets the other existing qualifying criteria may elect to use the community bank leverage ratio framework. The modified rule also states\nthat the community bank leverage ratio requirement will be greater than 8 percent for the second through fourth quarters of calendar\nyear 2020, greater than 8.5 percent for calendar year 2021, and greater than 9 percent thereafter. The transition rule also maintains a\ntwo-quarter grace period for a qualifying community banking organization whose leverage ratio falls no more than 100 basis points\nbelow the applicable community bank leverage ratio requirement.\nCBLR Framework\nAs of September 30, 2024 Actual Requirement\n(Dollars in thousands except for ratios) Amount Ratio Amount Ratio\nWilliam Penn Bank:\nTier 1 leverage $ 134,761 16.52% $ 73,433 9.00%\nCBLR Framework\nAs of June 30, 2024 Actual Requirement\n(Dollars in thousands except for ratios) Amount Ratio Amount Ratio\nWilliam Penn Bank:\nTier 1 leverage $ 134,494 16.10% $ 75,164 9.00%\nNote 14 – Fair Value of Financial Instruments\nThe Company follows authoritative guidance under FASB ASC Topic 820 for Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures which defines\nfair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value, and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. The definition of\n26\nfair value under ASC 820 is the exchange price. The guidance clarifies that the exchange price is the price in an orderly transaction\nbetween market participants to sell the asset or transfer the liability in the market in which the reporting entity would transact for the\nasset or liability. The definition focuses on the price that would be received to sell the asset or paid to transfer the liability (an exit price),\nnot the price that would be paid to acquire the asset or received to assume the liability (an entry price). The guidance emphasizes that\nfair value is a market-based measurement, not an entity-specific measurement.\nFair value is based on quoted market prices, when available. If listed prices or quotes are not available, fair value is based on fair value\nmodels that use market participant or independently sourced market data which include: discount rate, interest rate yield curves, credit\nrisk, default rates and expected cash flow assumptions. In addition, valuation adjustments may be made in the determination of fair\nvalue. These fair value adjustments may include amounts to reflect counter party credit quality, creditworthiness, liquidity, and other\nunobservable inputs that are applied consistently over time. These adjustments are estimated and, therefore, subject to significant\nmanagement judgment, and at times, may be necessary to mitigate the possibility of error or revision in the model-based estimate of the\nfair value provided by the model. The methods described above may produce fair value calculations that may not be indicative of the\nnet realizable value. While the Company believes its valuation methods are consistent with other financial institutions, the use of\ndifferent methods or assumptions to determine fair values could result in different estimates of fair value. FASB ASC Topic 820 for\nFair Value Measurements and Disclosures describes three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value:\nLevel 1: Quoted prices are available in active markets for identical assets or liabilities as of the reported date.\nLevel 2: Pricing inputs are other than quoted prices in active markets, which are either directly or indirectly observable as of the reported\ndate. The nature of these assets and liabilities include items for which quoted prices are available but traded less frequently,\nand items that are fair valued using other financial instruments, the parameters of which can be directly observed.\nLevel 3: Assets and liabilities that have little to no pricing observability as of the reported date. These items do not have two-way\nmarkets and are measured using management’s best estimate of fair value, where the inputs into the determination of fair value\nrequire significant management judgment or estimation.\nThe following table presents the assets required to be measured and reported on a recurring basis on the Company’s Consolidated\nStatements of Financial Condition at their fair value as of September 30, 2024 and June 30, 2024, by level within the fair value hierarchy.\nFinancial assets and liabilities are classified in their entirety based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value\nmeasurement.\nSeptemb er 3 0, 2024\n(Dollars in thousands) Level I Level II Level III Total\nAssets:\nInvestments available for sale:\nMortgage-backed securities $ — $ 96,570 $ — $ 96,570\nU.S. agency collateralized mortgage obligations — 7,352 — 7,352\nU.S. government agency securities — 610 — 610\nMunicipal bonds — 15,842 — 15,842\nCorporate bonds — 33,667 — 33,667\nEquity securities 2,095 — — 2,095\nTotal Assets $ 2,095 $ 154,041 $ — $ 156,136\nJune 30, 2 02 4\n(Dollars in thousands) Level I Level II Level III Total\nAssets:\nInvestments available for sale:\nMortgage-backed securities $ — $ 95,125 $ — $ 95,125\nU.S. agency collateralized mortgage obligations — 7,200 — 7,200\nU.S. government agency securities — 693 — 693\nMunicipal bonds — 14,969 — 14,969\nCorporate bonds — 32,768 — 32,768\nEquity securities 2,016 — — 2,016\nTotal Assets $ 2,016 $ 150,755 $ — $ 152,771\n27\nAssets and Liabilities Measured on a Non-Recurring Basis\nCertain assets and liabilities may be required to be measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis in periods subsequent to their initial\nrecognition. Generally, nonrecurring valuation is the result of the application of other accounting pronouncements which require assets\nand liabilities to be assessed for impairment or recorded at the lower of cost or fair value.\nLoans individually evaluated for impairment are generally measured for impairment using the fair value of the collateral supporting the\nloan. Evaluating the collateral for these loans is based on Level 3 inputs utilizing outside appraisals adjusted by management for sales\ncosts and other assumptions regarding market conditions to arrive at fair value. As of September 30, 2024 and June 30, 2024, the\nCompany charged-off the collateral deficiency on loans evaluated individually for impairment. As a result, there were no specific\nreserves on loans evaluated individually for impairment as of September 30, 2024 and June 30, 2024.\nOther real estate owned (OREO) is measured at fair value, based on appraisals less cost to sell at the date of foreclosure. Valuations are\nperiodically performed by management and the assets are carried at the lower of carrying amount or fair value, less cost to sell. Income\nand expenses from operations and changes in valuation allowance are included in the net expenses from OREO.\nAs of September 30, 2024 and June 30, 2024, there were no assets required to be measured and reported at fair value on a non-recurring\nbasis.\nManagement uses its best judgment in estimating the fair value of the Company's financial instruments; however, there are inherent\nweaknesses in any estimation technique. Therefore, for substantially all financial instruments, the fair value estimates herein are not\nnecessarily indicative of the amounts the Company could have realized in sales transaction on the dates indicated. The estimated fair\nvalue amounts have been measured as of their respective year-ends and have not been reevaluated or updated for purposes of these\nfinancial statements subsequent to those respective dates. As such, the estimated fair values of these financial instruments subsequent\nto the respective reporting dates may be different than the amounts reported at each year-end.\nThe following information should not be interpreted as an estimate of the fair value of the entire company since a fair value calculation\nis only provided for a limited portion of the Company's assets and liabilities. Due to a wide range of valuation techniques and the degree\nof subjectivity used in making the estimates, comparisons between the Company's disclosures and those of other companies may not be\nmeaningful. The following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair values of the Company’s financial instruments.\nCash and Due from Banks and Interest-Bearing Time Deposits\nThe carrying amounts of cash and amounts due from banks and interest-bearing time deposits approximate their fair value due to the\nrelatively short time between origination of the instrument and its expected realization.\nSecurities Available for Sale and Held to Maturity\nThe fair value of investment and mortgage-backed securities is equal to the available quoted market price. If no quoted market price is\navailable, fair value is estimated using the quoted market price for similar securities.\nEquity Securities\nThe fair value of equity securities is equal to the available quoted market price.\nLoans Receivable\nThe fair value is estimated by discounting future cash flows using current market inputs at which loans with similar terms are adjusted\nfor liquidity and credit risk.\nRegulatory Stock\nThe carrying amount of Federal Home Loan Bank stock approximates fair value because Federal Home Loan Bank stock can only be\nredeemed or sold at par value and only to the respective issuing government supported institution or to another member institution.\n28\nBank-Owned Life Insurance\nThe Company reports bank-owned life insurance on its Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition at the cash surrender value. The\ncarrying amount of bank-owned life insurance approximates fair value because the fair value of bank-owned life insurance is equal to\nthe cash surrender value of the life insurance policies.\nAccrued Interest Receivable and Payable\nThe carrying amount of accrued interest receivable and payable approximates fair value.\nDeposits\nFair values for demand deposits, NOW accounts, savings and club accounts, and money market deposits are, by definition, equal to the\namount payable on demand at the reporting date as these products have no stated maturity. Fair values of fixed-maturity certificates of\ndeposit are estimated using a discounted cash flow calculation that applies market interest rates currently being offered on similar\ninstruments with similar maturities.\nAdvances from Federal Home Loan Bank\nFair value of advances from Federal Home Loan Bank is estimated using discounted cash flow analyses, based on rates currently\navailable to the Company for advances from Federal Home Loan Bank with similar terms and remaining maturities.\nOff-Balance Sheet Financial Instruments\nFair value of commitments to extend credit is estimated using the fees currently charged to enter into similar agreements, considering\nmarket interest rates, the remaining terms and present credit worthiness of the counterparties.\nIn accordance with FASB ASC Topic 825 for Financial Instruments, Disclosures about Fair Value of Financial Instruments, the\nCompany is required to disclose the fair value of financial instruments. The fair value of a financial instrument is the current amount\nthat would be exchanged between willing parties, other than in a distressed sale. Fair value is best determined using observable market\nprices; however, for many of the Company’s financial instruments, no quoted market prices are readily available. In instances where\nquoted market prices are not readily available, fair value is determined using present value or other techniques appropriate for the\nparticular instrument. These techniques involve some degree of judgment, and as a result, are not necessarily indicative of the amounts\nthe Company would realize in a current market exchange. Different assumptions or estimation techniques may have a material effect on\nthe estimated fair value.\nThe following tables set forth the carrying value of financial assets and liabilities and the fair value for certain financial instruments that\nare not required to be measured or reported at fair value on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition for the periods indicated.\nThe tables below exclude financial instruments for which the carrying amount approximates fair value.\nFair Value M eas urements at Sep tem be r 30, 2024\nQuoted Prices Significant Significant\nin Active Markets Other Observable Unobservable\nCarrying Fair for Identical Assets Inputs Inputs\n(Dollars in thousands) Amount Value (Level 1) (Level 2) (Level 3)\nFinancial instruments - assets:\nLoans receivable, net $ 462,209 $ 440,819 $ — $ — $ 440,819\nSecurities held to maturity 86,835 73,388 — 73,388 —\nFinancial instruments - liabilities:\nCertificates of deposit 183,844 182,347 — — 182,347\nAdvances from Federal Home Loan Bank 39,000 39,000 — — 39,000\nOff-balance sheet financial instruments — — — — —\n29\nFair Va lue M easurements at J un e 3 0, 2024\nQuoted Prices Significant Significant\nin Active Markets Other Observable Unobservable\nCarrying Fair for Identical Assets Inputs Inputs\n(Dollars in thousands) Amount Value (Level 1) (Level 2) (Level 3)\nFinancial instruments - assets:\nLoans receivable, net $ 470,572 $ 439,118 $ — $ — $ 439,118\nSecurities held to maturity 93,056 76,827 — 76,827 —\nFinancial instruments - liabilities:\nCertificates of deposit 173,661 171,613 — — 171,613\nAdvances from Federal Home Loan Bank 48,000 48,000 — — 48,000\nOff-balance sheet financial instruments — — — — —\nNote 15 – Subsequent Events\nQuarterly Cash Dividend\nOn October 16, 2024, the Company declared a cash dividend of $0.03 per share, payable on November 7, 2024, to common shareholders\nof record at the close of business on October 28, 2024.\nAgreement and Plan of Merger\nOn October 31, 2024, the Company and Mid Penn Bancorp, Inc. (“Mid Penn”) entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the\n“Merger Agreement”), pursuant to which the Company will merge with and into Mid Penn with Mid Penn as the surviving corporation\n(the “Merger”). Immediately after the Merger, the Bank will merge with and into Mid Penn Bank, with Mid Penn Bank as the surviving\nbank. Subject to the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement, at the effective time of the Merger, each share of Company common\nstock then issued and outstanding will be converted into the right to receive 0.426 shares of Mid Penn common stock, with cash to be\npaid in lieu of any fractional shares. Mid Penn will also assume all outstanding options to acquire shares of Company common stock\npursuant to their terms. Consummation of the Merger is subject to the satisfaction of customary closing conditions, including receipt of\nnecessary shareholder and regulatory approvals, and the parties currently expect the Merger to be completed in the second quarter of\n2025.\n30\nITEM 2. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF\nOPERATIONS\nForward-Looking Statements\nStatements contained in this report that are not historical facts may constitute forward-looking statements (within the meaning of Section\n21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended), which involve significant risks and uncertainties. The Company intends such\nforward-looking statements to be covered by the safe harbor provisions for forward-looking statements contained in the Private\nSecurities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, and is including this statement for purposes of invoking these safe harbor provisions. Forward-\nlooking statements, which are based on certain assumptions and describe future plans, strategies and expectations of the Company, are\ngenerally identifiable by the use of the words “believe,” “expect,” “intend,” “anticipate,” “estimate,” “project,” “plan,” or similar\nexpressions. The Company’s ability to predict results or the actual effect of future plans or strategies is inherently uncertain and actual\nresults may differ from those predicted. The Company undertakes no obligation to update these forward-looking statements in the future.\nThe Company cautions readers of this report that a number of important factors could cause the Company’s actual results to differ\nmaterially from those expressed in forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause actual results to differ from those predicted and\ncould affect the future prospects of the Company include, but are not limited to: (i) general economic conditions, either nationally or in\nour market area, that are worse than expected; (ii) changes in the interest rate environment that reduce our interest margins, reduce the\nfair value of financial instruments or reduce the demand for our loan products; (iii) increased competitive pressures among financial\nservices companies; (iv) changes in consumer spending, borrowing and savings habits; (v) changes in the quality and composition of\nour loan or investment portfolios; (vi) changes in future allowance for credit losses, including changes required under relevant accounting\nand regulatory requirements; (vii) the ability to pay future dividends; (viii) changes in real estate market values in our market area; (ix)\ndecreased demand for loan products, deposit flows, competition, or decreased demand for financial services in our market area; (x)\nmajor catastrophes such as earthquakes, floods or other natural or human disasters and infectious disease outbreaks, the related disruption\nof any of these events to local, regional and global economic activity and financial markets, and the impact that any of the foregoing\nmay have on us and our customers and other constituencies; (xi) legislative or regulatory changes that adversely affect our business or\nchanges in the monetary and fiscal policies of the U.S. government, including policies of the U.S. Treasury and the Federal Reserve\nBoard; (xii) technological changes that may be more difficult or expensive than expected; (xiii) success or consummation of new\nbusiness initiatives may be more difficult or expensive than expected; (xiv) our ability to successfully execute our business plan and\nstrategies and integrate the business operations of acquired businesses into our business operations (xv) our ability to manage market\nrisk, credit risk and operational risk in the current economic environment; (xvi) adverse changes in the securities markets; (xvii) the\ninability of third party service providers to perform; (xviii) changes in accounting policies and practices, as may be adopted by bank\nregulatory agencies or the Financial Accounting Standards Board; and (xix) the impact of failures or disruptions in or breaches of the\nCompany’s operational or security systems, data or infrastructure, or those of third parties, including as a result of cyberattacks or\ncampaigns.\nThe following factors relating to the Merger and the Merger Agreement, among others, could also cause our financial performance to\ndiffer materially from that expressed in forward-looking statements: (i) the occurrence of any event, change or other circumstances that\ncould give rise to the right of one or both of the parties to terminate the Merger Agreement; (ii) the ability to obtain regulatory approvals\nand satisfy other closing conditions to the Merger, including approval by shareholders of Mid Penn and the Company; (iii) the outcome\nof any legal proceedings that may be instituted against Mid Penn or the Company in connection with the Merger or the transactions\ncontemplated by the Merger Agreement; (iv) the possibility that the Merger may be more expensive to complete than anticipated; (v)\ndiversion of management’s attention from ongoing business operations and opportunities; and (vi) potential adverse reactions or changes\nto business or employee relationships resulting from the announcement or completion of the Merger.\nRecent Developments\nOn October 31, 2024, the Company and Mid Penn entered into the Merger Agreement, pursuant to which the Company will merge with\nand into Mid Penn with Mid Penn as the surviving corporation. Immediately after the Merger, the Bank will merge with and into Mid\nPenn Bank, with Mid Penn Bank as the surviving bank. Subject to the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement, at the effective\ntime of the Merger, each share of Company common stock then issued and outstanding will be converted into the right to receive 0.426\nshares of Mid Penn common stock, with cash to be paid in lieu of any fractional shares. Mid Penn will also assume all outstanding\noptions to acquire shares of Company common stock pursuant to their terms. Consummation of the Merger is subject to the satisfaction\nof customary closing conditions, including receipt of necessary shareholder and regulatory approvals, and the parties currently expect\nthe Merger to be completed in the second quarter of 2025.\n31\nCritical Accounting Policies\nWe consider accounting policies involving significant judgments and assumptions by management that have, or could have, a material\nimpact on the carrying value of certain assets or on income to be critical accounting policies. We consider these accounting policies to\nbe our critical accounting policies. The judgments and assumptions we use are based on historical experience and other factors, which\nwe believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could differ from these judgments and estimates under different\nconditions, resulting in a change that could have a material impact on the carrying values of our assets and liabilities and our results of\noperations.\nAllowance for Credit Losses\nWe consider the allowance for credit losses to be a critical accounting policy. Note 2 to the Company’s Consolidated Financial\nStatements for the period ended September 30, 2024 discusses significant accounting policies, including the allowance for credit losses.\nAlthough we believe that we use the best information available to establish the allowance for credit losses, future adjustments to the\nallowance may be necessary if economic conditions differ substantially from the assumptions used in making the evaluation. In addition,\nthe Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and the Pennsylvania Department of Banking and Securities, as an integral part of their\nexamination process, periodically review our allowance for credit losses.\nOur financial results are affected by the changes in and the level of the allowance for credit losses. This process involves our analysis\nof complex internal and external variables, and it requires that we exercise judgment to estimate an appropriate allowance for credit\nlosses. As a result of the uncertainty associated with this subjectivity, we cannot assure the precision of the amount reserved, should we\nexperience sizeable loan losses in any particular period. For example, changes in the financial condition of individual borrowers,\neconomic conditions, or the condition of various markets in which collateral may be sold could require us to significantly decrease or\nincrease the level of the allowance for credit losses. Such an adjustment could materially affect net income as a result of the change in\nprovision for credit losses. We also have approximately $3.1 million as of September 30, 2024 in non-performing assets consisting of\nnon-performing loans. Most of these assets are collateral dependent loans where we have incurred credit losses to write the assets down\nto their current appraised value less selling costs. We continue to assess the collectability of these loans and update our appraisals on\nthese loans each year. To the extent the property values continue to decline, there could be additional losses incurred on these non-\nperforming loans which may be material. In recent periods, we experienced strong asset quality metrics including low levels of\ndelinquencies, net charge-offs and non-performing assets. Management considered market conditions in deriving the estimated\nallowance for credit losses; however, given the continued economic difficulties, the ultimate amount of loss could vary from that\nestimate.\nGoodwill\nThe acquisition method of accounting for business combinations requires us to record assets acquired, liabilities assumed, and\nconsideration paid at their estimated fair values as of the acquisition date. The excess of consideration paid (or the fair value of the\nequity of the acquiree) over the fair value of net assets acquired represents goodwill. Goodwill totaled $4.9 million at September 30,\n2024. Goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets are not amortized on a recurring basis, but rather are subject to periodic\nimpairment testing. The provisions of Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) Topic 350 allow an entity to first assess qualitative\nfactors to determine whether it is necessary to perform the two-step quantitative goodwill impairment test.\nDuring the three months ended September 30, 2024, management considered the then current economic environment in its evaluation,\nand determined, based on the totality of its qualitative assessment, that it is not more likely than not that the carrying value of goodwill\nis impaired. No goodwill impairment existed during the three months ended September 30, 2024.\nIncome Taxes\nWe are subject to the income tax laws of the various jurisdictions where we conduct business and estimate income tax expense based\non amounts expected to be owed to these various tax jurisdictions. The estimated income tax expense (benefit) is reported in the\nConsolidated Statements of Income. The evaluation pertaining to the tax expense and related tax asset and liability balances involves a\nhigh degree of judgment and subjectivity around the ultimate measurement and resolution of these matters.\nAccrued taxes represent the net estimated amount due to or to be received from tax jurisdictions either currently or in the future and are\nreported in other assets on our Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition. We assess the appropriate tax treatment of transactions\nand filing positions after considering statutes, regulations, judicial precedent and other pertinent information and maintain tax accruals\n32\nconsistent with our evaluation. Changes in the estimate of accrued taxes occur periodically due to changes in tax rates, interpretations\nof tax laws, the status of examinations by the authorities and newly issued or enacted statutory, judicial and regulatory guidance that\ncould impact the relative merits of tax positions. These changes, when they occur, impact accrued taxes and can materially affect our\noperating results. We regularly evaluate our uncertain tax positions and estimate the appropriate level of reserves related to each of these\npositions.\nAs of September 30, 2024, we had net deferred tax assets totaling $8.1 million. We use the asset and liability method of accounting for\nincome taxes. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to\ndifferences between the financial carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. If currently available\ninformation raises doubt as to the realization of the deferred tax assets, a valuation allowance is established. Deferred tax assets and\nliabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences\nare expected to be recovered or settled. We exercise significant judgment in evaluating the amount and timing of recognition of the\nresulting tax assets and liabilities. These judgments require us to make projections of future taxable income. Management believes,\nbased upon current facts, that it is more likely than not that there will be sufficient taxable income in future years to realize the deferred\ntax assets. The judgments and estimates we make in determining our deferred tax assets are inherently subjective and are reviewed on a\ncontinual basis as regulatory and business factors change. Any reduction in estimated future taxable income may require us to record a\nvaluation allowance against our deferred tax assets. A valuation allowance that results in additional income tax expense in the period in\nwhich it is recognized would negatively affect earnings. Our net deferred tax assets were determined based on the current enacted federal\ntax rate of 21%. Any possible future reduction in federal tax rates, would reduce the value of our net deferred tax assets and result in\nimmediate write-down of the net deferred tax assets though our statement of operations, the effect of which would be material.\nComparison of Financial Condition at September 30, 2024 and June 30, 2024\nSummary. Total assets decreased $6.5 million, or 0.8%, to $812.2 million at September 30, 2024, from $818.7 million at June 30, 2024,\nprimarily due to an $8.4 million decrease in net loans and a $2.9 million decrease in investments, partially offset by a $6.3 million\nincrease in cash and cash equivalents.\nCash and cash equivalents increased $6.3 million, or 31.3%, to $26.5 million at September 30, 2024, from $20.2 million at June 30,\n2024. The increase in cash and cash equivalents was primarily due to $9.2 million of investment paydowns and an $8.4 million decrease\nin net loans, partially offset by a $9.0 million decrease in advances from the FHLB of Pittsburgh and the repurchase of $1.5 million of\nshares of stock under previously announced repurchase programs.\nInvestments. Total investments decreased $2.9 million, or 1.2%, to $243.0 million at September 30, 2024, from $245.9 million at June\n30, 2024. The decrease in investments was primarily due to the maturity and principal paydowns of securities included in the available\nfor sale and held to maturity portfolios, partially offset by a $6.3 million decrease in the gross unrealized loss on available for sale\nsecurities. The Company remains focused on maintaining a high-quality investment portfolio that provides a steady stream of cash\nflows both in the current and in rising interest rate environments.\nLoans. Net loans decreased $8.4 million, or 1.8%, to $462.2 million at September 30, 2024, from $470.6 million at June 30, 2024. The\nCompany maintains conservative lending practices and credit pricing discipline, and is focused on lending to borrowers with high credit\nquality within its market footprint.\nDeposits. Deposits remained relatively consistent at $629.8 million at both September 30, 2024 and June 30, 2024. During the quarter\nended September 30, 2024, we experienced a $6.0 million decrease in interest bearing checking accounts, a $3.3 million decrease in\nsavings accounts and a $2.5 million decrease in money market accounts, partially offset by a $10.2 million increase in time deposit\naccounts.\nBorrowings. Borrowings decreased $9.0 million, or 18.8%, to $39.0 million at September 30, 2024, from $48.0 million at June\n30, 2024.\nStockholders’ Equity. Stockholders’ equity increased $3.7 million, or 2.9%, to $128.3 million at September 30, 2024, from $124.6\nmillion at June 30, 2024. The increase in stockholders’ equity was primarily due to a $4.8 million decrease in the accumulated other\ncomprehensive loss component of equity related to the unrealized loss on available for sale securities. This increase to stockholders’\nequity was partially offset by the repurchase of 125,441 shares at a total cost of $1.5 million, or $11.83 per share, during the quarter\nended September 30, 2024 under the Company’s previously announced stock repurchase programs, the payment of a $0.03 per share\nquarterly cash dividend in August 2024 totaling $256 thousand and a $21 thousand net loss recorded during the quarter ended September\n30, 2024.\n33\nBook value per share measured $13.91 as of September 30, 2024 compared to $13.33 as of June 30, 2024, and tangible book value per\nshare measured $13.35 as of September 30, 2024 compared to $12.78 as of June 30, 2024. Tangible book value per share is a non-\nGAAP financial measure that excludes goodwill and other intangible assets. Please refer to the “Non-GAAP Financial Information”\nsection below for a reconciliation of tangible book value per share to book value per share.\nAs previously announced, the Company’s Board of Directors had authorized seven stock repurchase programs to acquire up to 6,433,769\nshares of the Company’s outstanding shares. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had repurchased a total of 6,423,527 shares under\nthese repurchase programs at a total cost of $75.2 million, or $11.70 per share.\nResults of Operations for the Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023\nSummary\nThe following table sets forth the income summary for the periods indicated:\nT hre e Months En d ed Septem be r 30,\nChange Fiscal 2024/2023\n(Dollars in thousands) 2024 2023 $ %\nNet interest income $ 4,141 $ 4,744 $ (603) (12.71)%\n(Recovery) provision for credit losses (395) 5 (400) (8,000.00)\nNon-interest income 650 650 — —\nNon-interest expenses 5,323 5,225 98 1.88\nIncome tax benefit (116) (15) (101) 673.33\nNet (loss) income $ (21) $ 179 $ (200) (111.73)\n(Loss) return on average assets (annualized) (0.01)% 0.09 %\nCore (loss) return on average assets(1) (non-GAAP) (annualized) (0.04) 0.06\n(Loss) return on average equity (annualized) (0.07) 0.47\nCore (loss) return on average equity(1) (non-GAAP) (annualized) (0.26) 0.32\n(1) Core return on average assets and core return on average equity are non-GAAP financial measures. Please refer to the “Non-GAAP\nFinancial Information” section below for a reconciliation of core return on average assets to return on average assets and core return\non average equity to return on average equity.\nGeneral\nThe Company recorded a $21 thousand net loss, or $(0.00) per basic and diluted share, for the three months ended September 30, 2024,\ncompared to net income of $179 thousand, or $0.02 per basic and diluted share, for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The\nCompany recorded a core net loss of $82 thousand, or $(0.01) per basic and diluted share, for the three months ended September 30,\n2024, compared to core net income of $123 thousand, or $0.01 per basic share and $0.03 per diluted share, for the three months ended\nSeptember 30, 2023. Core net income is a non-GAAP financial measure that excludes certain pre-tax adjustments and the tax impact\nof such adjustments, and income tax benefit adjustments. Please refer to the “Non-GAAP Financial Information” section below for\na reconciliation of core net income to net income.\nNet Interest Income\nFor the three months ended September 30, 2024, net interest income was $4.1 million, a decrease of $603 thousand, or 12.7%, from the\nthree months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in net interest income was primarily due to an increase in interest expense on\ndeposits, partially offset by an increase in interest income on loans. The net interest margin measured 2.29% for the three months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024, compared to 2.52% for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in the net interest margin during\nthe three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period in 2023 was primarily due to an increase in interest rates\nduring the period that caused an increase in the cost of deposits and borrowings that exceeded the increase in interest income on loans.\nProvision for Credit Losses\nDuring the three months ended September 30, 2024, we recorded a $395 thousand recovery for credit losses primarily due to a decrease\nin delinquent loans, as well as consistently low levels of net charge-offs, strong asset quality metrics and continued conservative lending\n34\npractices. During the three months ended September 30, 2023, we recorded a $5 thousand provision for credit losses primarily due to\nan increase in our commercial construction and land loans. Our allowance for credit losses totaled $2.5 million, or 0.54% of total loans,\nas of September 30, 2024, compared to $3.0 million, or 0.63% of total loans, as of June 30, 2024. Our total credit losses coverage ratio,\nincluding $2.1 million of fair value marks on acquired loans and the $2.5 million allowance for credit losses, was 0.99% as of September\n30, 2024 compared to 1.08% as of June 30, 2024, including $2.2 million of fair value marks on acquired loans and the $3.0 million\nallowance for credit losses. Based on a review of the loans that were in the loan portfolio at September 30, 2024, management believes\nthat the allowance is maintained at a level that represents its best estimate of lifetime credit losses. Total credit losses coverage ratio is\na non-GAAP financial measure that includes the fair value mark on acquired loans. Please refer to the “Non-GAAP Financial\nInformation” section below for a reconciliation of total credit losses coverage ratio to allowance for credit losses coverage ratio.\nManagement uses available information to establish the appropriate level of the allowance for credit losses. Future additions or\nreductions to the allowance may be necessary based on estimates that are susceptible to change as a result of changes in economic\nconditions and other factors. As a result, our allowance for credit losses may not be sufficient to cover actual loan losses, and future\nprovisions for credit losses could materially adversely affect our operating results. In addition, various bank regulatory agencies, as an\nintegral part of their examination process, periodically review our allowance for credit losses.\nNon-Interest Income\nThe following table sets forth a summary of non-interest income for the periods indicated:\nTh ree Months En ded S eptember 30,\n(Dollars in thousands) 2024 2023\nService fees $ 211 $ 215\nEarnings on bank-owned life insurance 329 294\nUnrealized gain on equity securities 79 73\nOther 31 68\nTotal $ 650 $ 650\nFor the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, non-interest income totaled $650 thousand, respectively. Earnings on bank-\nowned life insurance increased $35 thousand during the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended\nSeptember 30, 2023. This increase to non-interest income was offset by a decrease in other non-interest income.\nNon-Interest Expense\nThe following table sets forth an analysis of non-interest expense for the periods indicated:\nTh ree Months En ded S eptember 30,\n(Dollars in thousands) 2024 2023\nSalaries and employee benefits $ 2,959 $ 2,935\nOccupancy and equipment 706 760\nData processing 506 494\nProfessional fees 328 210\nAmortization of intangible assets 33 41\nOther 791 785\nTotal $ 5,323 $ 5,225\nFor the three months ended September 30, 2024, non-interest expense totaled $5.3 million, an increase of $98 thousand, or 1.9%, from\nthe three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in non-interest expense was primarily due to a $118 thousand increase in\nprofessional fees primarily due to an increase in legal fees.\nIncome Taxes\nFor the three months ended September 30, 2024, the Company recorded a $116 thousand income tax benefit, reflecting an effective tax\nrate of (84.7)%, compared to an income tax benefit of $15 thousand, reflecting an effective tax rate of (9.1)%, for the same period in\n2023. The income tax benefit recorded during these periods was primarily due to the $329 thousand and $294 thousand of federal tax-\nexempt income recorded on bank-owned life insurance recorded during the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023,\nrespectively.\n35\nAsset Quality\nAsset quality metrics remain strong with non-performing assets to total assets decreasing to 0.38% as of September 30, 2024 from 0.40%\nas of June 30, 2024. Total nonperforming loans consisted of 28 loans to 25 unrelated borrowers at September 30, 2024, as compared to\n30 loans to 27 unrelated borrowers at June 30, 2024. Interest income related to non-performing loans would have been approximately\n$53 thousand during the three months ended September 30, 2024 if these loans had performed in accordance with their terms during the\nperiod rather than having been on non-accrual.\nThere are circumstances when foreclosure and liquidations are the remedy pursued. However, from time to time, as part of our loss\nmitigation strategy, we may renegotiate the loan terms (i.e., interest rate, structure, repayment term, etc.) based on the economic or legal\nreasons related to the borrower’s financial difficulties. We had no loans modified to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty during\nthe three months ended September 30, 2024.\n36\nAverage Balances and Yields\nThe following table presents information regarding average balances of assets and liabilities, the total dollar amounts of interest income\nand dividends from average interest-earning assets, the total dollar amounts of interest expense on average interest-bearing liabilities,\nand the resulting annualized average yields and costs. The yields and costs for the periods indicated are derived by dividing income or\nexpense by the average daily balances of assets or liabilities, respectively, for the periods presented. Loan fees, including prepayment\nfees, are included in interest income on loans and are not material. Non-accrual loans are included in the average balances only. Any\nadjustments necessary to present yields on a tax-equivalent basis are insignificant.\nT hre e Months E nd ed September 30 ,\n2024 2023\nAverage Interest and Yield/ Average Interest and Yield/\n(Dollars in thousands) Balance Dividends Cost Balance Dividends Cost\nInterest-earning assets:\nLoans(1) $ 467,047 $ 6,528 5.59 % $ 478,966 $ 6,139 5.13 %\nInvestment securities(2) 244,141 1,549 2.54 263,624 1,711 2.60\nOther interest-earning assets 11,471 171 5.96 11,387 161 5.66\nTotal interest-earning assets 722,659 8,248 4.57 753,977 8,011 4.25\nNon-interest-earning assets 81,204 82,117\nTotal assets $ 803,863 $ 836,094\nInterest-bearing liabilities:\nInterest-bearing checking accounts $ 127,694 456 1.43 % $ 120,997 304 1.00 %\nMoney market deposit accounts 174,752 1,390 3.18 200,726 1,426 2.84\nSavings and club accounts 80,016 11 0.05 87,842 19 0.09\nCertificates of deposit 177,947 1,634 3.67 161,825 981 2.42\nTotal interest-bearing deposits 560,409 3,491 2.49 571,390 2,730 1.91\nFHLB advances and other borrowings 43,065 616 5.72 37,826 537 5.68\nTotal interest-bearing liabilities 603,474 4,107 2.72 609,216 3,267 2.15\nNon-interest-bearing liabilities:\nNon-interest-bearing deposits 58,324 57,049\nOther non-interest-bearing liabilities 16,396 17,855\nTotal liabilities 678,194 684,120\nTotal stockholders' equity 125,669 151,974\nTotal liabilities and equity $ 803,863 $ 836,094\nNet interest income $ 4,141 $ 4,744\nInterest rate spread(3) 1.84 % 2.10 %\nNet interest-earning assets(4) $ 119,185 $ 144,761\nNet interest margin(5) 2.29 % 2.52 %\nRatio of interest-earning assets to interest-bearing\nliabilities 119.75% 123.76%\n(1) Includes nonaccrual loan balances and interest recognized on such loans.\n(2) Includes securities available for sale, securities held to maturity, and equity securities.\n(3) Net interest rate spread represents the difference between the yield on average interest-earning assets and the cost of\naverage interest-bearing liabilities.\n(4) Net interest-earning assets represents total interest-earning assets less total interest-bearing liabilities.\n(5) Net interest margin represents net interest income divided by average total interest-earning assets.\n37\nRate/Volume Analysis\nThe following table sets forth the effects of changing rates and volumes on our net interest income. The rate column shows the effects\nattributable to changes in rate (changes in rate multiplied by prior volume). The volume column shows the effects attributable to changes\nin volume (changes in volume multiplied by current rate). The total column represents the sum of the prior columns. For purposes of\nthis table, changes attributable to both rate and volume which cannot be segregated have been allocated proportionately based on the\nchanges due to rate and volume.\nThree Mon ths Ended Septemb er 30 , 20 24\nCompared to\nThree Months Ended September 30, 2023\nIncrease (Decrease)\nDue to\n(Dollars in thousands) Volume Rate Total\nInterest income:\nLoans $ (875) $ 1,264 $ 389\nInvestment securities (124) (38) (162)\nOther interest-earning assets 1 9 10\nTotal interest-earning assets (998) 1,235 237\nInterest expense:\nInterest-bearing checking accounts 18 134 152\nMoney market deposit accounts (728) 692 (36)\nSavings and club accounts (2) (6) (8)\nCertificates of deposit 106 547 653\nTotal interest-bearing deposits (606) 1,367 761\nFHLB advances and other borrowings 75 4 79\nTotal interest-bearing liabilities (531) 1,371 840\nNet change in net interest income $ (467) $ (136) $ (603)\nNon-GAAP Financial Information\nIn this report, we present the non-GAAP financial measures discussed below, which are used to evaluate our performance and exclude\nthe effects of certain transactions and one-time events that we believe are unrelated to our core business and not necessarily indicative\nof our current performance or financial position. Management believes excluding these items facilitates greater visibility into our core\nbusinesses and underlying trends that may, to some extent, be obscured by inclusion of such items.\nTangible Book Value per Share. Tangible book value per share represents our total equity less goodwill and other intangible assets\ndivided by total common shares outstanding. Management believes tangible book value per share helps management and investors\nbetter understand and assess changes from period to period in stockholders’ equity exclusive of changes in intangible assets. This\nnon-GAAP data should be considered in addition to results prepared in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles\nin the U.S. (GAAP), and is not a substitute for, or superior to, GAAP results. The following table provides a reconciliation of\ntangible book value per share of common stock to book value per share of common stock, the most directly comparable GAAP\nfinancial measure, for the periods presented.\n(Dollars in thousands, except share and per share data)\nAs of September 30, As of June 30,\nCalculation of Tangible Book Value per Share: 2024 2024\nTotal stockholders' equity $ 128,253 $ 124,601\nLess: goodwill and other intangible assets 5,181 5,214\nTotal tangible equity (non-GAAP) 123,072 119,387\nTotal common shares outstanding 9,218,459 9,343,900\nBook value per share (GAAP) $ 13.91 $ 13.33\nTangible book value per share (non-GAAP) $ 13.35 $ 12.78\n38\nTotal Credit Losses Coverage Ratio. Total Credit Losses Coverage Ratio represents the total of our allowance for credit losses and the\nfair value mark on acquired loans divided by total loans excluding the fair value mark on acquired loans.

The Bank’s liquidity ratio was 39.5% as of\nSeptember 30, 2024 compared to 38.5% as of June 30, 2024. We adjust our liquidity levels to fund deposit outflows, pay real estate\ntaxes on mortgage loans, repay our borrowings, and to fund loan commitments. We also adjust liquidity as appropriate to meet asset and\nliability management objectives. Our liquidity ratio is calculated as the sum of total cash and cash equivalents and unencumbered\ninvestments securities divided by the sum of total deposits and total borrowings. The Bank maintains a liquidity ratio policy that requires\nthis metric to be above 10.0% to provide for the effective management of extension risk and other interest rate risks.\nOur primary sources of liquidity are deposits, amortization and prepayment of loans and mortgage-backed securities, maturities of\ninvestment securities, other short-term investments, earnings, and funds provided from operations. While scheduled principal\nrepayments on loans and mortgage-backed securities are a relatively predictable source of funds, deposit flows and loan prepayments\nare greatly influenced by market interest rates, economic conditions, and rates offered by our competition. We set the interest rates on\n40\nour deposits to maintain a desired level of total deposits. In addition, we invest excess funds in short-term interest-earning assets, which\nprovide liquidity to meet lending requirements.\nLiquidity management is both a daily and long-term function of business management. If we require funds beyond our ability to generate\nthem internally, borrowing agreements exist with the FHLB of Pittsburgh to provide advances and with the Federal Reserve Bank to\nprovide an overnight line of credit. We also have available credit from the Atlantic Community Bankers Bank to purchase federal funds.\nAs a member of the FHLB of Pittsburgh, we are required to own capital stock in the FHLB of Pittsburgh and are authorized to apply for\nadvances on the security of such stock and certain of our mortgage loans and other assets (principally securities which are obligations\nof, or guaranteed by, the United States), provided certain standards related to creditworthiness have been met. We had an available\nborrowing limit of $283.6 million with the FHLB of Pittsburgh at September 30, 2024. There were $39.0 million of FHLB of Pittsburgh\nadvances outstanding at September 30, 2024.\nAt September 30, 2024, we had outstanding commitments to originate loans of $35.9 million, unfunded commitments under lines of\ncredit of $61.6 million and $118 thousand of standby letters of credit. At September 30, 2024, certificates of deposit scheduled to mature\nin less than one year totaled $166.1 million. Based on prior experience, management believes that a significant portion of such deposits\nwill remain with us, although there can be no assurance that this will be the case. In the event a significant portion of our deposits are\nnot retained by us, we will have to utilize other funding sources, such as FHLB of Pittsburgh advances, in order to maintain our level of\nassets. Alternatively, we could reduce our level of liquid assets, such as our cash and cash equivalents. In addition, the cost of such\ndeposits may be significantly higher if market interest rates are higher at the time of renewal.\nImpact of Inflation and Changing Prices\nThe consolidated financial statements and related notes of the Company have been prepared in accordance with GAAP, which generally\nrequires the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars without consideration for changes in\nthe relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation. The impact of inflation is reflected in the increased cost of our\noperations. Unlike industrial companies, our assets and liabilities are primarily monetary in nature. As a result, changes in market interest\nrates have a greater impact on performance than the effects of inflation.\nITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nInterest rate risk is defined as the exposure to current and future earnings and capital that arises from adverse movements in interest\nrates. Depending on a bank’s asset/liability structure, adverse movements in interest rates could be either rising or falling interest rates.\nFor example, a bank with predominantly long-term fixed-rate assets and short-term liabilities could have an adverse earnings exposure\nto a rising rate environment. Conversely, a short-term or variable-rate asset base funded by longer term liabilities could be negatively\naffected by falling rates. This is referred to as re-pricing or maturity mismatch risk.\nInterest rate risk also arises from changes in the slope of the yield curve (yield curve risk), from imperfect correlations in the adjustment\nof rates earned and paid on different instruments with otherwise similar re-pricing characteristics (basis risk), and from interest rate\nrelated options embedded in our assets and liabilities (option risk).\nOur objective is to manage our interest rate risk by determining whether a given movement in interest rates affects our net interest\nincome and the market value of our portfolio equity in a positive or negative way and to execute strategies to maintain interest rate risk\nwithin established limits. The analysis at September 30, 2024 indicates a level of risk within the parameters of our model. Our\nmanagement believes that the September 30, 2024 analysis indicates a profile that reflects interest rate risk exposures in both rising and\ndeclining rate environments for both net interest income and economic value.\nModel Simulation Analysis. We view interest rate risk from two different perspectives. The traditional accounting perspective, which\ndefines and measures interest rate risk as the change in net interest income and earnings caused by a change in interest rates, provides\nthe best view of short-term interest rate risk exposure. We also view interest rate risk from an economic perspective, which defines and\nmeasures interest rate risk as the change in the market value of portfolio equity caused by changes in the values of assets and liabilities,\nwhich fluctuate due to changes in interest rates. The market value of portfolio equity, also referred to as the economic value of equity,\nis defined as the present value of future cash flows from existing assets, minus the present value of future cash flows from existing\nliabilities.\nThese two perspectives give rise to income simulation and economic value simulation, each of which presents a unique picture of our\nrisk of any movement in interest rates. Income simulation identifies the timing and magnitude of changes in income resulting from\nchanges in prevailing interest rates over a short-term time horizon (usually one or two years). Economic value simulation reflects the\n41\ninterest rate sensitivity of assets and liabilities in a more comprehensive fashion, reflecting all future time periods. It can identify the\nquantity of interest rate risk as a function of the changes in the economic values of assets and liabilities, and the corresponding change\nin the economic value of equity of the Bank. Both types of simulation assist in identifying, measuring, monitoring, and controlling\ninterest rate risk and are employed by management to ensure that variations in interest rate risk exposure will be maintained within\npolicy guidelines.\nWe produce these simulation reports and discuss them with our management Asset and Liability Committee and Board Risk Committee\non at least a quarterly basis. The simulation reports compare baseline (no interest rate change) to the results of an interest rate shock, to\nillustrate the specific impact of the interest rate scenario tested on income and equity. The model, which incorporates all asset and\nliability rate information, simulates the effect of various interest rate movements on income and equity value. The reports identify and\nmeasure our interest rate risk exposure present in our current asset/liability structure. Management considers a static (current position)\nanalysis as well as non-parallel and gradual changes in interest rates and the yield curve in assessing interest rate exposures.\nIf the results produce quantifiable interest rate risk exposure beyond our limits, then the testing will have served as a monitoring\nmechanism to allow us to initiate asset/liability strategies designed to reduce and therefore mitigate interest rate risk. The table below\nsets forth an approximation of our interest rate risk exposure. The simulation uses projected repricing of assets and liabilities at\nSeptember 30, 2024. The income simulation analysis presented represents a one-year impact of the interest scenario assuming a static\nbalance sheet. Various assumptions are made regarding the prepayment speed and optionality of loans, investment securities and\ndeposits, which are based on analysis and market information. The assumptions regarding optionality, such as prepayments of loans and\nthe effective lives and repricing of non-maturity deposit products, are documented periodically through evaluation of current market\nconditions and historical correlations to our specific asset and liability products under varying interest rate scenarios. Because the\nprospective effects of hypothetical interest rate changes are based on a number of assumptions, these computations should not be relied\nupon as indicative of actual results. While we believe such assumptions to be reasonable, assumed prepayment rates may not approximate\nactual future prepayment activity on mortgage-backed securities or agency issued collateralized obligations (secured by one- to four-\nfamily loans and multi-family loans). Further, the computation does not reflect any actions that management may undertake in response\nto changes in interest rates and assumes a constant asset base. Management periodically reviews the rate assumptions based on existing\nand projected economic conditions and consults with industry experts to validate our model and simulation results.\nThe table below sets forth, as of September 30, 2024, the Bank’s net portfolio value, the estimated changes in our net portfolio value\nand net interest income that would result from the designated instantaneous parallel changes in market interest rates.\nTwelve Month Net Por tfolio\nNet Interest Income Value\nPercent Estimated Percent\nChange in Interest Rates (Basis Points) of Change NPV of Change\n+200 (14.33)% $ 140,414 (2.37)%\n+100 (7.09) 142,245 (1.10)\n0 — 143,825 —\n-100 4.21 144,125 0.21\n-200 8.53 144,025 0.14\nAs of September 30, 2024, based on the scenarios above, net interest income would decrease by approximately 7.09% to 14.33%, over\na one-year time horizon in a rising interest rate environment. One-year net interest income would increase by approximately 4.21% to\n8.53% in a declining interest rate environment.\nEconomic value at risk would be negatively impacted by a rise in interest rates and would be positively impacted by a decline in interest\nrates. We have established an interest rate floor of zero percent for measuring interest rate risk.\nITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES\nUnder the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer,\nwe evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and\n15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based upon that evaluation, the\nChief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of the end of the period covered by this report, our disclosure\ncontrols and procedures were effective to ensure (1) that information required to be disclosed in the reports that the Company files or\nsubmits under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified\nin the SEC’s rules and forms; and (2) that they are alerted in a timely manner about material information relating to the Company\nrequired to be filed in its periodic Securities and Exchange Commission filings.\n42\nDuring the quarter ended September 30, 2024, there were no changes in the Company’s internal controls over financial reporting that\nhave materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal controls over financial reporting.\nPART II — OTHER INFORMATION\nITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS\nThe Company is involved in various legal actions and claims arising in the normal course of business. In the opinion of management,\nthese legal actions and claims are not expected to have a material adverse impact on the Company’s financial condition.\nITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nFor information regarding the Company’s risk factors, refer to the “Risk Factors” in Item 1A of the Company’s Annual Report on Form\n10-K for the year ended June 30, 2024, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on September 5, 2024 (the “Form 10-K”).\nExcept as set forth below, as of September 30, 2024, the risk factors of the Company have not changed materially from those disclosed\nin the Form 10-K.\nFailure to complete the Merger could negatively affect our market price, future business and financial results.\nAlthough we anticipate closing the Merger in the second quarter of 2025, we cannot guarantee when, or whether, the Merger will be\ncompleted. If the Merger is not completed for any reason, we will be subject to a number of material risks, including the following: (i)\ncosts related to the Merger, such as legal, accounting and financial advisory fees, and, in specific circumstances, additional\nreimbursement and termination fees, must be paid even if the Merger is not completed; (ii) declines in our market price to the extent\nthat the current market price of our common stock already reflects a market assumption that the Merger will be completed; (iii) the\ndiversion of management’s attention from the day-to-day business operations and the potential disruption to each company’s employees\nand business relationships during the period before the completion of the Merger may make it difficult to regain financial and market\npositions if the Merger does not occur; and (iv) becoming subject to litigation related to any failure to complete the Merger.\nRegulatory waivers and approvals may not be received or may be received and subsequently expire, be revoked or be amended to\nimpose conditions that are not presently anticipated or cannot be met.\nBefore the transactions contemplated in the Merger Agreement, including the Merger, may be completed, various waivers, approvals or\nconsents must be obtained from various bank regulatory and other authorities, including the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve\nSystem, the FDIC, and the Pennsylvania Department of Banking and Securities. In determining whether to grant these approvals,\nregulatory authorities consider a variety of factors, including the regulatory standing of each party. These approvals could be delayed or\nnot obtained at all, including due to any or all of the following: an adverse development in any party’s regulatory standing or any other\nfactors considered by regulators in granting such approvals; governmental, political, or community group inquiries, investigations or\nopposition; or changes in legislation or the political or regulatory environment generally, including as a result of changes of the U.S.\nexecutive administration, or Congressional leadership and regulatory agency leadership.\nEven if the approvals are granted, they may impose terms and conditions, limitations, obligations or costs, or place restrictions on the\nconduct of the combined company’s business or require changes to the terms of the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement.\nThere can be no assurance that regulators will not impose any such conditions, limitations, obligations, or restrictions or that such\nconditions, limitations, obligations, or restrictions will not have the effect of delaying the completion of any of the transactions\ncontemplated by the Merger Agreement, imposing additional material costs on or materially limiting the revenues of the combined\ncompany following the Merger or otherwise reduce the anticipated benefits of the Merger if the Merger were completed successfully\nwithin the expected timeframe. In addition, there can be no assurance that any such conditions, limitations, obligations, or restrictions\nwill not result in the delay or abandonment of the Merger. The completion of the Merger is conditioned on the receipt of the requisite\nregulatory approvals without the imposition of any materially burdensome regulatory condition and the expiration of all statutory waiting\nperiods. Additionally, the completion of the Merger is conditioned on the absence of certain orders, injunctions, or decrees issued by\nany court or any governmental entity of competent jurisdiction that would prevent, prohibit, or make illegal the completion of the Merger\nor any of the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement.\nDespite the parties’ expected commitment to use their reasonable best efforts to respond to any request for information and resolve any\nobjection that may be asserted by any governmental entity with respect to the Merger Agreement, neither party is required under the\nterms of the Merger Agreement to take any action, commit to take any action, or agree to any condition or restriction in connection with\n43\nobtaining these approvals, that would reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on the combined company and its\nsubsidiaries, taken as a whole, after giving effect to the proposed Merger.\nFurther, such approvals are subject to expiration if the transaction is not consummated within the time period provided in the approval.\nCombining Mid Penn and William Penn may be more difficult, costly or time consuming than expected, and Mid Penn may fail to\nrealize the anticipated benefits of the Merger.\nThe success of the Merger will depend on, among other things, the ability of Mid Penn to integrate the Company into its business in a\nmanner that facilitates growth opportunities and achieves the anticipated benefits of the Merger. If Mid Penn is not able to successfully\nachieve these objectives, the anticipated benefits of the Merger may not be realized fully or at all or may take longer to realize than\nexpected. In addition, the actual cost and savings and anticipated benefits of the Merger could be less than anticipated, and integration\nmay result in additional unforeseen expenses.\nLitigation relating to the Merger could require us to incur significant costs and suffer management distraction, as well as delay\nand/or enjoin the Merger.\nNeither the Company nor Mid Penn is currently able to predict the outcome of any suit arising out of or relating to the Merger that may\nbe filed in the future. If any letters or complaints are filed, absent allegations that are material, the Company and Mid Penn will not\nnecessarily announce such filings. The Company and Mid Penn could be subject to demands or litigation related to the Merger, whether\nor not the Merger is consummated. Such actions may create additional uncertainty relating to the Merger, and responding to such\ndemands and defending such actions may be costly and distracting to management. Although there can be no assurance as to the ultimate\noutcomes of any demand or any subsequent litigation, we do not believe that the resolution of such demands or any subsequent litigation\nwill have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flow.\nThe Company and Mid Penn will be subject to various uncertainties while the Merger is pending that could adversely affect their\nfinancial results or the anticipated benefits of the Merger.\nUncertainty about the effect of the Merger on counterparties to contracts, employees and other parties may have an adverse effect on us\nor the anticipated benefits of the Merger. These uncertainties could cause contract counterparties and others who deal with us or Mid\nPenn to seek to change existing business relationships with us or Mid Penn, and may impair our or Mid Penn’s ability to attract, retain\nand motivate key personnel until the Merger is completed and for a period of time thereafter. Employee retention and recruitment may\nbe particularly challenging prior to the completion of the Merger, as our employees and prospective employees, and the employees and\nprospective employees of Mid Penn, may experience uncertainty about their future roles with the combined organization following the\nMerger.\nThe pursuit of the Merger and the preparation for the integration of the two companies may place a significant burden on management\nand internal resources. Any significant diversion of management attention away from ongoing business and any difficulties encountered\nin the transition and integration process could affect our financial results prior to the completion of the Merger and could limit us from\npursuing attractive business opportunities and making other changes to our business prior to completion of the Merger or termination of\nthe Merger Agreement.\nThe Merger may be completed on different terms from those contained in the Merger Agreement.\nPrior to the completion of the Merger, we and Mid Penn may, by mutual agreement, amend or alter the terms of the Merger Agreement,\nincluding with respect to, among other things, the Merger consideration or any covenants or agreements with respect to the parties’\nrespective operations during the pendency of the Merger Agreement. Any such amendments or alterations may have negative\nconsequences to us.\nThe Merger will not be completed unless important conditions are satisfied or waived, including approval of the Merger Agreement\nby our shareholders and Mid Penn’s shareholders.\nSpecified conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement must be satisfied or waived to complete the Merger. If the conditions are not\nsatisfied or, subject to applicable law, waived, the Merger will not occur or will be delayed and each of Mid Penn and us may lose some\nor all of the intended benefits of the Merger.\n44\nITEM 2.

William Penn recorded a $21 thousand net loss, or $(0.00) per basic and diluted share,\nfor the quarter ended September 30, 2024 compared to net income of $179 thousand, or $0.02 per basic and diluted share, for\nthe quarter ended September 30, 2023. William Penn recorded a core net loss(1) of $82 thousand, or $(0.01) per basic and diluted\nshare, for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 compared to core net income(1) of $123 thousand, or $0.01 per basic and diluted\nshare, for the quarter ended September 30, 2023.\nIn addition, William Penn announced that its Board of Directors has declared a cash dividend of $0.03 per share, payable on\nNovember 7, 2024, to common shareholders of record at the close of business on October 28, 2024.\nKenneth J. Stephon, William Penn’s Chairman, President, and CEO, stated, “We are encouraged by the 50 basis point rate cut\nby the Fed in September and the broader decline in market interest rates, which helped to reduce the equity component of the\nunrealized loss on our available for sale securities by $4.8 million, or 21.9%, during the quarter ended September 30, 2024. We\nbelieve that the September rate cut, and any further rate cuts by the Fed, will help to improve our profitability prospectively due\nto the liability-sensitive position of our balance sheet. Our net interest margin expanded modestly during the quarter,\ndemonstrating a further gain following an inflection point achieved last quarter.\n“During the quarter, we continued to post strong credit quality metrics, with a non-performing assets to total assets ratio of\n0.38% as of September 30, 2024. We also experienced a decrease in delinquent loans during the quarter and we recorded a\n$395 thousand recovery for credit losses during the quarter ended September 30, 2024. Operating expenses remained well-\ncontrolled, with a year-over-year increase of 1.9%.”\nMr. Stephon added, “We maintain our commitment to delivering the maximum value to our shareholders through diligent capital\nmanagement. During our first fiscal quarter, we continued to repurchase shares under our existing stock repurchase programs\nand we repurchased 125,441 shares at a total cost of $1.5 million, an average cost of $11.83 per share. As of September 30,\n2024, we have repurchased a total of 6,423,527 shares, or approximately 50% of shares sold in our second-step conversion, at\na total cost of $75.2 million, an average of $11.70 per share.”\nHighlights for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 are as follows:\n During the quarter ended September 30, 2024, we repurchased 125,441 shares at a total cost of $1.5 million, an\naverage of $11.83 per share. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had repurchased a total of 6,423,527\nshares under its previously announced repurchase programs at a total cost of $75.2 million, or $11.70 per share.\n William Penn recorded a $21 thousand net loss, or $(0.00) per basic and diluted share, and a core net loss(1) of\n$82 thousand, or $(0.01) per basic and diluted share, for the quarter ended September 30, 2024.\n(1) As used in this press release, core net (loss) income is a non-GAAP financial measure. This non-GAAP financial measure excludes certain pre-tax adjustments and the tax\nimpact of such adjustments, and income tax benefit adjustments. For a reconciliation of this and other non-GAAP financial measures to their comparable GAAP measure, see\n“Non-GAAP Reconciliation” at the end of the press release.\n1\n The accumulated other comprehensive loss component of equity related to the unrealized loss on available for\nsale securities decreased $4.8 million, or 21.9%, during the quarter ended September 30, 2024.\n During the quarter ended September 30, 2024, we recorded a $395 thousand recovery for credit losses primarily\ndue to a decrease in delinquent loans, as well as consistently low levels of net charge-offs, strong asset quality\nmetrics and continued conservative lending practices. Non-performing assets to total assets decreased to 0.38%\nas of September 30, 2024 from 0.40% as of June 30, 2024.\n Book value per share measured $13.91 as of September 30, 2024 compared to $13.33 as of June 30, 2024.\nTangible book value per share(2) measured $13.35 as of September 30, 2024 compared to $12.78 as of June 30,\n2024. The increase in both book value per share and tangible book value per share was primarily due to a $4.8\nmillion decrease in the accumulated other comprehensive loss component of equity related to the unrealized\nloss on available for sale securities.\nStatement of Financial Condition\nTotal assets decreased $6.5 million, or 0.8%, to $812.2 million at September 30, 2024, from $818.7 million at June 30, 2024,\nprimarily due to an $8.4 million decrease in net loans and a $2.9 million decrease in investments, partially offset by a $6.3\nmillion increase in cash and cash equivalents.\nCash and cash equivalents increased $6.3 million, or 31.3%, to $26.5 million at September 30, 2024, from $20.2 million at June\n30, 2024. The increase in cash and cash equivalents was primarily due to $9.2 million of investment paydowns and an $8.4\nmillion decrease in net loans, partially offset by a $9.0 million decrease in advances from the Federal Home Loan Bank\n(“FHLB”) of Pittsburgh and the repurchase of $1.5 million of shares of stock under previously announced repurchase programs.\nTotal investments decreased $2.9 million, or 1.2%, to $243.0 million at September 30, 2024, from $245.9 million at June 30,\n2024. The decrease in investments was primarily due to the maturity and principal paydowns of securities included in the\navailable for sale and held to maturity portfolios, partially offset by a $6.3 million decrease in the gross unrealized loss on\navailable for sale securities. The unrealized loss on available for sale securities is due to current interest rate levels relative to\nthe Company’s cost and not credit quality. The Company remains focused on maintaining a high-quality investment portfolio\nthat provides a steady stream of cash flows both in the current and in rising interest rate environments.\nNet loans decreased $8.4 million, or 1.8%, to $462.2 million at September 30, 2024, from $470.6 million at June 30, 2024. The\nCompany maintains conservative lending practices and credit pricing discipline, and is focused on lending to borrowers with\nhigh credit quality within its market footprint.\nDeposits remained relatively consistent at $629.8 million at both September 30, 2024 and June 30, 2024. During the quarter\nended September 30, 2024, we experienced a $6.0 million decrease in interest bearing checking accounts, a $3.3 million decrease\nin savings accounts and a $2.5 million decrease in money market accounts, partially offset by a $10.2 million increase in time\ndeposit accounts.\nBorrowings decreased $9.0 million, or 18.8%, to $39.0 million at September 30, 2024, from $48.0 million at June 30, 2024.\nStockholders’ equity increased $3.7 million, or 2.9%, to $128.3 million at September 30, 2024, from $124.6 million at June 30,\n2024. The increase in stockholders’ equity was primarily due to a $4.8 million decrease in the accumulated other comprehensive\nloss component of equity related to the unrealized loss on available for sale securities. This increase to stockholders’ equity\nwas partially offset by the repurchase of 125,441 shares at a total cost of $1.5 million, or $11.83 per share, during the quarter\nended September 30, 2024 under the Company’s previously announced stock repurchase programs, the payment of a $0.03 per\nshare quarterly cash dividend in August 2024 totaling $256 thousand and a $21 thousand net loss recorded during the quarter\nended September 30, 2024. Book value per share measured $13.91 as of September 30, 2024 compared to $13.33 as of June\n30, 2024, and tangible book value per share(3) measured $13.35 as of September 30, 2024 compared to $12.78 as of June 30,\n2024.\n(2) As used in this press release, tangible book value per share is a non-GAAP financial measure. This non-GAAP financial measure excludes goodwill and other intangible\nassets. For a reconciliation of this and other non-GAAP financial measures to their comparable GAAP measures, see “Non-GAAP Reconciliation” at the end of the press\nrelease.\n2\nNet Interest Income\nFor the quarter ended September 30, 2024, net interest income was $4.1 million, a decrease of $603 thousand, or 12.7%, from\nthe quarter ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in net interest income was primarily due to an increase in interest expense\non deposits, partially offset by an increase in interest income on loans. The net interest margin measured 2.29% for the quarter\nended September 30, 2024, compared to 2.52% for the quarter ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in the net interest\nmargin during the quarter ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period in 2023 was primarily due to an increase in\ninterest rates during the period that caused an increase in the cost of deposits and borrowings that exceeded the increase in\ninterest income on loans.\nNon-interest Income\nFor the quarter ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, non-interest income totaled $650 thousand, respectively. Earnings on\nbank-owned life insurance increased $35 thousand during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 compared to the quarter ended\nSeptember 30, 2023. This increase to non-interest income was offset by a decrease in other non-interest income.\nNon-interest Expense\nFor the quarter ended September 30, 2024, non-interest expense totaled $5.3 million, an increase of $98 thousand, or 1.9%,\nfrom the quarter ended September 30, 2023. The increase in non-interest expense was primarily due to a $118 thousand increase\nin professional fees primarily due to an increase in legal fees.\nIncome Taxes\nFor the quarter ended September 30, 2024, the Company recorded a $116 thousand income tax benefit, reflecting an effective\ntax rate of (84.7)%, compared to a $15 thousand income tax benefit, reflecting an effective tax rate of (9.1)%, for the same\nperiod in 2023. The income tax benefit recorded during these periods was primarily due to the $329 thousand and $294 thousand\nof federal tax-exempt income recorded on bank-owned life insurance recorded during the quarter ended September 30, 2024\nand 2023, respectively.\nAsset Quality\nAsset quality metrics remain strong with non-performing assets to total assets decreasing to 0.38% as of September 30, 2024\nfrom 0.40% as of June 30, 2024. During the quarter ended September 30, 2024, we recorded a $395 thousand recovery for\ncredit losses primarily due to a decrease in delinquent loans, as well as consistently low levels of net charge-offs, strong asset\nquality metrics and continued conservative lending practices. During the quarter ended September 30, 2023, we recorded a $5\nthousand provision for credit losses primarily due to an increase in our commercial construction and land loans. Our allowance\nfor credit losses (“ACL”) totaled $2.5 million, or 0.54% of total loans, as of September 30, 2024, compared to $3.0 million, or\n0.63% of total loans, as of June 30, 2024. Our total credit losses coverage ratio(3), including $2.1 million of fair value marks on\nacquired loans and the $2.5 million ACL, was 0.99% as of September 30, 2024 compared to 1.08% as of June 30, 2024, including\n$2.2 million of fair value marks on acquired loans and the $3.0 million ACL.\nCapital and Liquidity\nAs of September 30, 2024, William Penn’s stockholders’ equity to assets totaled 15.79% and tangible capital to tangible assets(4)\ntotaled 15.25%. The Bank’s capital position remains strong relative to current regulatory requirements. The Bank has elected\nto follow the community bank leverage ratio framework and, as of September 30, 2024, the Bank had a community leverage\nratio of 16.52% and is considered well-capitalized under the prompt corrective action framework.\nThe Bank continues to have substantial liquidity that has been retained in cash or invested in high quality government-backed\nsecurities. In addition, at September 30, 2024, we had the ability to borrow up to $283.6 million from the FHLB of Pittsburgh,\n$10.0 million with the Atlantic Community Bankers Bank, and $3.8 million with the Federal Reserve Bank.\n(3) As used in this press release, total credit losses coverage ratio is a non-GAAP financial measure. This non-GAAP financial measure includes the fair value mark on acquired\nloans. For a reconciliation of this and other non-GAAP financial measures to their comparable GAAP measures, see “Non-GAAP Reconciliation” at the end of the press\nrelease.\n(4) As used in this press release, tangible capital to tangible assets is a non-GAAP financial measure. This non-GAAP financial measure excludes goodwill and other\nintangible assets.
