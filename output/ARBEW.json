(NASDAQ: ARBE) (TASE: ARBE) (\"Arbe\"), a global leader in Perception Radar Solutions, today announced financial results for its third quarter, ended September 30, 2024.\n\n![Arbe_Robotics_Logo](https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/803813/Arbe_Robotics_Logo.jpg)\n\n**Key Q3 and Recent Company Highlights:**\n\n• **OEM Engagements:**\n\n- Arbe experienced significant growth in both the number and the depth of our OEM engagements. The company is in active process with 16 OEMs, 12 of which progressed to the bid stage, and 8 entered the advanced perception project phase.\n\n- Arbe collaborated with a leading European truck manufacturer, which plans to incorporate Arbe's radar chipset into its next-generation sensor suite.\n\n**• Collaborations with Tier-1s:**\n\n- **HiRain Technologies** accelerated the development of an ADAS system for a Chinese OEM, with the aim of replacing LiDAR with Arbe's radar chipset.\n\n- **Sensrad** signed a framework agreement to supply 4D imaging radars, powered by Arbe's technology, to Tianyi Transportation Technology in China.\n\n**• Growing Market Demand:** Arbe observed increasing interest in its radar technology from emerging verticals beyond automotive and is actively working with customers to address these opportunities.\n\n**• Successful Capital Raise:** Arbe completed an offering of up to $49 million, of which $15 million were received upfront and up to $34 million will be received upon the exercise in full for cash of long-term and milestone-linked warrants. The public offering was led by existing investor AWM Investment Company Inc. and joined by new investors. The proceeds will support the planned production ramp-up in 2025. Canaccord Genuity served as the sole bookrunner, with Roth Capital Partners acting as co-manager.\n\n\"This quarter, we made significant progress in testing and deliveries for leading European OEMs,\" said Kobi Marenko, Chief Executive Officer. \"While the selection process has taken longer than anticipated, we remain on track toward achieving our design-in objectives. We are proud to have completed a public offering, welcoming both new and existing investors. This investment demonstrates their confidence in our progress and long-term vision. In Q3, we achieved important milestones with our Tier-1s HiRain and Sensrad. With HiRain, we are enhancing global automotive safety by providing radar capabilities traditionally associated with other sensor technologies. Sensrad's recent agreement underscores the growing demand for advanced innovative radar solutions across industries beyond automotive.\"\n\n**Third Quarter 2024 Financial Highlights**\n\nRevenues for Q3 2024 were $0.1 million, a decrease from $0.5 million in Q3 2023. Backlog as of September 30, 2024, was $0.5 million.\n\nNegative gross profit for Q3 2024 was $0.3 million, compared to a positive gross profit of $0.1 million / 24% in Q3 2023, mainly related to the reduction in revenue with a fixed cost level of expenses.\n\nOperating expenses in Q3 2024 were $12.2 million, compared to $11.7 million in Q3 2023. The increase in operating expenses was primarily driven by an increased investment in outsourced support (both in headcount and overall expenses) as well as an increase in our internal workforce.\n\nNet loss in the third quarter of 2024 increased to $12.6 million, compared to a net loss of $11.7 million in the third quarter of 2023. Net loss in Q3 2024 included $0.1 million of financial expenses, including bond revaluations partially offset by interest deposit gains.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP measurement which excludes expenses for non-cash share-based compensation and for non-recurring items, for Q3 2024, yielded a loss of $8.2 million, compared to a loss of $7.5 million in the third quarter of 2023.\n\n**Balance Sheet & Liquidity**\n\nAs of September 30, 2024, Arbe had $19.1 million in cash and cash equivalents.\n\n**Outlook**\n\n  * Our goal of achieving 4 design-ins with automakers remains unchanged, as we observe continued strong interest in our market-leading offering.\n  * We have strengthened our position in all our RFQ engagements, even though the OEMs have shifted their decision timelines from late 2023 to 2024.\n  * The 2024 annual revenues are expected to be in line with those of 2023, followed by revenue growth in 2025. These revenue projections are based on the intention to be in full production in the second half of 2024, as well as our decision to exclusively focus on getting our chipset into production.\n  * We are committed to maintaining a strong and well-managed balance sheet, focusing on cost-effectiveness and the ability to fund our revenue growth. Adjusted EBITDA for 2024 is projected to be in the range of ($30) million to ($36) million.\n\n\n\n**Conference Call & Webcast Details**\n\nArbe will host a conference call and webcast today at 8:30 am ET.
