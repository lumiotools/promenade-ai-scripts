          "content": "# Exelon Reports Third Quarter 2024 Results\n\n#### October 30, 2024\n\n#### Earnings Release Highlights\n\n  * GAAP net income of $0.70 per share and Adjusted (non-GAAP) operating earnings of $0.71 per share for the third quarter of 2024\n  * Reaffirming full year 2024 Adjusted (non-GAAP) operating earnings guidance range of $2.40-$2.50 per share\n  * Reaffirming adjusted (non-GAAP) operating EPS compounded annual growth target of 5-7% through 2027\n  * Strong utility reliability performance - all utilities achieved top quartile in reliability, with ComEd and Pepco Holdings continuing to achieve top decile in SAIFI and SAIDI performance\n  * DPL filed a natural gas distribution rate case with the Delaware Public Service Commission (DEPSC) in September seeking an increase in gas distribution rates to support investments in infrastructure to maintain safety, reliability, and service for customers, while also offering more predictability in customer bills throughout the year\n\n\n\n**CHICAGO** — Exelon Corporation (Nasdaq: EXC) today reported its financial results for the third quarter of 2024.\n\n\"Our strong third quarter performance highlights the dedication of our 20,000 employees delivering top quartile service despite unprecedented challenges,\" said Exelon President and Chief Executive Officer Calvin Butler. \"This summer, our regions faced record-breaking severe weather, including an historic number of tornadoes in the Chicago area. Yet, we maintained top quartile reliability, with ComEd and Pepco Holdings performing in the top decile. We’re also making progress on our work with regulators to invest in a resilient grid, and doing our part to keep energy affordability front and center. As we approach the end of 2024, we remain focused on building a cleaner and brighter future for our customers and communities.\"\n\n\"Exelon delivered another quarter of strong financial performance, with third quarter adjusted operating earnings of $0.71 per share, and we remain on track to meet our full year earnings guidance of $2.40 to $2.50 per share,\" said Exelon Chief Financial Officer Jeanne Jones. \"Our disciplined approach to financial management, combined with operational excellence, continues to drive strong results across our local energy companies. We are making $34.5 billion of critical investments in our energy infrastructure for our customers, which gives us the confidence to deliver our long-term earnings per share growth target of 5-7% through 2027.\"\n\n**Third Quarter 2024**\n\nExelon's GAAP net income for the third quarter of 2024 remained relatively consistent with the prior period at $0.70 per share. Adjusted (non-GAAP) operating earnings for the third quarter of 2024 increased to $0.71 per share from $0.67 per share in the third quarter of 2023. For the reconciliations of GAAP net income to Adjusted (non-GAAP) operating earnings, refer to the tables beginning on page 3.\n\nThe GAAP net income and Adjusted (non-GAAP) operating earnings in the third quarter of 2024 primarily reflects higher utility earnings due to distribution rate increases at BGE, distribution and transmission rate increases at PHI, timing of distribution earnings and a higher return on regulatory assets at ComEd, and decreased storm costs at PHI. This was partially offset by higher interest expense at PECO, BGE, and PHI; higher credit loss expense at PECO and BGE; higher depreciation and amortization expense at PECO and BGE; and lower carrying costs recovery related to the CMC regulatory asset at ComEd. \n\n### Operating Company Results1\n\n_ComEd_\n\nComEd's third quarter of 2024 GAAP net income increased to $360 million from $333 million in the third quarter of 2023. ComEd's Adjusted (non-GAAP) operating earnings for the third quarter of 2024 increased to $360 million from $338 million in the third quarter of 2023, primarily due to timing of distribution earnings, higher distribution rate base, and higher return on regulatory assets. These were partially offset by a lower allowed distribution ROE, the absence of a return on the pension asset within distribution earnings, and lower carrying costs recovery related to the CMC regulatory asset. Due to revenue decoupling, ComEd's distribution earnings are not affected by actual weather or customer usage patterns.\n\n_PECO_\n\nPECO’s third quarter of 2024 GAAP net income decreased to $117 million from $146 million in the third quarter of 2023. PECO's Adjusted (non-GAAP) operating earnings for the third quarter of 2024 decreased to $118 million from $149 million in the third quarter of 2023, primarily due to increases in credit loss expense, interest expense, and depreciation expense.\n\n_BGE_\n\nBGE’s third quarter of 2024 GAAP net income remained relatively consistent with the prior period at $45 million. BGE's Adjusted (non-GAAP) operating earnings for the third quarter of 2024 decreased to $45 million from $47 million in the third quarter of 2023. GAAP net income remained relatively consistent primarily due to favorable distribution rates, offset by increases in interest expense, depreciation and amortization expense, and credit loss expense. Due to revenue decoupling, BGE's distribution earnings are not affected by actual weather or customer usage patterns.\n\n_PHI_\n\nPHI’s third quarter of 2024 GAAP net income increased to $278 million from $232 million in the third quarter of 2023. PHI’s Adjusted (non-GAAP) operating earnings for the third quarter of 2024 increased to $278 million from $234 million in the third quarter of 2023, primarily due to higher electric distribution and transmission rates, and a decrease in storm costs and various operating expenses, partially offset by an increase in interest expense. Due to revenue decoupling, PHI's distribution earnings related to Pepco Maryland, DPL Maryland, Pepco District of Columbia, and ACE are not affected by actual weather or customer usage patterns.\n\n1Exelon’s four business units include ComEd, which consists of electricity transmission and distribution operations in northern Illinois; PECO, which consists of electricity transmission and distribution operations and retail natural gas distribution operations in southeastern Pennsylvania; BGE, which consists of electricity transmission and distribution operations and retail natural gas distribution operations in central Maryland; and PHI, which consists of electricity transmission and distribution operations in the District of Columbia and portions of Maryland, Delaware, and New Jersey and retail natural gas distribution operations in northern Delaware. **Recent Developments and Third Quarter Highlights**\n\n  * **Dividend:** On October 29, 2024, Exelon's Board of Directors declared a regular quarterly dividend of $0.38 per share on Exelon's common stock. The dividend is payable on December 13, 2024, to Exelon's shareholders of record as of the close of business on November 11, 2024. \n  * **Rate Case Developments:**\n    * **DPL Delaware Natural Gas Distribution Rate Case:** On September 20, 2024, DPL filed an application with the DEPSC to increase its annual natural gas rates by $36 million, reflecting an ROE of 10.65%. DPL currently expects a decision in the first quarter of 2026 but cannot predict if the DEPSC will approve the application as filed. \n  * **Financing Activities:**\n    * On August 28, 2024, ACE issued $175 million of its First Mortgage Bonds, consisting of $75 million of its First Mortgage 5.29% Series Bonds due on August 28, 2034 and $100 million of its First Mortgage 5.49% Series Bonds due on August 28, 2039. ACE used the proceeds of the sale of the ACE Bonds to repay existing indebtedness and for general corporate purposes.\n    * On September 10, 2024, PECO Energy Company (PECO) issued $575 million aggregate principal amount of its First and Refunding Mortgage Bonds, 5.250% Series due September 15, 2054. PECO used the net proceeds from the sale of the Bonds to refinance currently outstanding commercial paper and for general corporate purposes.\n\n\n\n#### Adjusted (non-GAAP) Operating Earnings Reconciliation\n\nAdjusted (non-GAAP) operating earnings for the third quarter of 2024 do not include the following items (after tax) that were included in reported GAAP net income:\n\n**(in millions, except per share amounts)** | **Exelon****Earnings per** **Diluted** **Share** | **Exelon** | **ComEd** | **PECO** | **BGE** | **PHI**  \n---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \n**2024 GAAP net income**| **$0.70** | **$707** | **$360** | **$117** | **$45** | **$278**  \nChange in environmental liabilities (net of taxes of $0)| — | —| — | — | — | —  \nChange in FERC audit liability (net of taxes of $0)| —| —| —| — | — | —  \nCost management charge (net of taxes of $0, and $0, respectively)| —| 1| — | 1| —| —  \n**2024 Adjusted (non-GAAP) operating earnings**| **$0.71** | **$708** | **$360** | **$118** | **$45** | **$278**  \n(in millions, except per share amounts)  | 2024 GAAP net income  \nExelonEarnings per Diluted Share  | $0.70   \nExelon  | $707   \nComEd  | $360   \nPECO  | $117   \nBGE  | $45   \nPHI  | $278   \n(in millions, except per share amounts)  | Change in environmental liabilities (net of taxes of $0)  \nExelonEarnings per Diluted Share  | —   \nExelon  | —  \nComEd  | —   \nPECO  | —   \nBGE  | —   \nPHI  | —  \n(in millions, except per share amounts)  | Change in FERC audit liability (net of taxes of $0)  \nExelonEarnings per Diluted Share  | —  \nExelon  | —  \nComEd  | —  \nPECO  | —   \nBGE  | —   \nPHI  | —  \n(in millions, except per share amounts)  | Cost management charge (net of taxes of $0, and $0, respectively)  \nExelonEarnings per Diluted Share  | —  \nExelon  | 1  \nComEd  | —   \nPECO  | 1  \nBGE  | —  \nPHI  | —  \n(in millions, except per share amounts)  | 2024 Adjusted (non-GAAP) operating earnings  \nExelonEarnings per Diluted Share  | $0.71   \nExelon  | $708   \nComEd  | $360   \nPECO  | $118   \nBGE  | $45   \nPHI  | $278   \n  \nAdjusted (non-GAAP) operating earnings for the third quarter of 2023 do not include the following items (after tax) that were included in reported GAAP net income:\n\n**(in millions, except per share amounts)** | **Exelon****Earnings per** **Diluted** **Share** | **Exelon** | **ComEd** | **PECO** | **BGE** | **PHI**  \n---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \n**2023 GAAP net income**| **$0.70** | **$700** | **$333** | **$146** | **$45** | **$232**  \nMark-to-market impact of economic hedging activities (net of taxes of $4)| 0.01| 12| —| —| —| —  \nAsset retirement obligation (net of taxes of $1)| —| (1)| — | — | — | (1)  \nSeparation costs (net of taxes of $5, $2, $1, $1, and $1, respectively)| 0.01| 14| 5| 3| 2| 4  \nIncome tax-related adjustments (entire amount represents tax expense)| (0.05)| (54)| —| —| —| —  \n**2023 Adjusted (non-GAAP) operating earnings**| **$0.67** | **$671** | **$338** | **$149** | **$47** | **$234**  \n(in millions, except per share amounts)  | 2023 GAAP net income  \nExelonEarnings per Diluted Share  | $0.70   \nExelon  | $700   \nComEd  | $333   \nPECO  | $146   \nBGE  | $45   \nPHI  | $232   \n(in millions, except per share amounts)  | Mark-to-market impact of economic hedging activities (net of taxes of $4)  \nExelonEarnings per Diluted Share  | 0.01  \nExelon  | 12  \nComEd  | —  \nPECO  | —  \nBGE  | —  \nPHI  | —  \n(in millions, except per share amounts)  | Asset retirement obligation (net of taxes of $1)  \nExelonEarnings per Diluted Share  | —  \nExelon  | (1)  \nComEd  | —   \nPECO  | —   \nBGE  | —   \nPHI  | (1)  \n(in millions, except per share amounts)  | Separation costs (net of taxes of $5, $2, $1, $1, and $1, respectively)  \nExelonEarnings per Diluted Share  | 0.01  \nExelon  | 14  \nComEd  | 5  \nPECO  | 3  \nBGE  | 2  \nPHI  | 4  \n(in millions, except per share amounts)  | Income tax-related adjustments (entire amount represents tax expense)  \nExelonEarnings per Diluted Share  | (0.05)  \nExelon  | (54)  \nComEd  | —  \nPECO  | —  \nBGE  | —  \nPHI  | —  \n(in millions, except per share amounts)  | 2023 Adjusted (non-GAAP) operating earnings  \nExelonEarnings per Diluted Share  | $0.67   \nExelon  | $671   \nComEd  | $338   \nPECO  | $149   \nBGE  | $47   \nPHI  | $234  \n  \nNote: Amounts may not sum due to rounding.\n\nUnless otherwise noted, the income tax impact of each reconciling item between GAAP net income and Adjusted (non-GAAP) operating earnings is based on the marginal statutory federal and state income tax rates for each Registrant, taking into account whether the income or expense item is taxable or deductible, respectively, in whole or in part. For all items, the marginal statutory income tax rates for 2024 and 2023 ranged from 24.0% to 29.0%.\n\n**Webcast Information**\n\nExelon will discuss third quarter 2024 earnings in a conference call scheduled for today at 9 a.m. Central Time (10 a.m. Eastern Time).

Follow [@Exelon](https://twitter.com/exelon) on Twitter | X.\n\n**Non-GAAP Financial Measures** In addition to net income as determined under generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (GAAP), Exelon evaluates its operating performance using the measure of Adjusted (non-GAAP) operating earnings because management believes it represents earnings directly related to the ongoing operations of the business. Adjusted (non-GAAP) operating earnings exclude certain costs, expenses, gains and losses, and other specified items. This measure is intended to enhance an investor’s overall understanding of period over period operating results and provide an indication of Exelon’s baseline operating performance excluding items that are considered by management to be not directly related to the ongoing operations of the business. In addition, this measure is among the primary indicators management uses as a basis for evaluating performance, allocating resources, setting incentive compensation targets, and planning and forecasting of future periods. Adjusted (non-GAAP) operating earnings is not a presentation defined under GAAP and may not be comparable to other companies’ presentation. Exelon has provided the non-GAAP financial measure as supplemental information and in addition to the financial measures that are calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP. Adjusted (non-GAAP) operating earnings should not be deemed more useful than, a substitute for, or an alternative to the most comparable GAAP net income measures provided in this earnings release and attachments.

For the reconciliations of GAAP net income to Adjusted (non-GAAP) operating earnings, refer to the tables beginning on page 3.\n\nGAAP net income and Adjusted (non-GAAP) operating earnings in the second quarter of 2024 primarily reflect:\n\n  * Higher utility earnings primarily due to distribution and transmission rate increases at PHI, distribution rate increases at BGE, favorable weather at PECO, favorable impacts of the Pepco multi-year plan reconciliations, and higher transmission peak load at ComEd. This was partially offset by higher interest expense at PECO and BGE and higher depreciation and amortization expense at PECO, BGE, and PHI. \n  * Higher costs at the Exelon holding company due to higher interest expense.\n\n\n\n### Operating Company Results1\n\n_ComEd_\n\nComEd's second quarter of 2024 GAAP net income increased to $270 million from $249 million in the second quarter of 2023. ComEd's Adjusted (non-GAAP) operating earnings for the second quarter of 2024 increased to $285 million from $251 million in the second quarter of 2023, primarily due to timing of distribution earnings, higher transmission peak loads, and higher rate base. These were partially offset by a lower allowed ROE and the absence of a return on the pension asset. Due to revenue decoupling, ComEd's distribution earnings are not affected by actual weather or customer usage patterns. \n\n_PECO_\n\nPECO’s second quarter of 2024 GAAP net income decreased to $90 million from $97 million in the second quarter of 2023. PECO's Adjusted (non-GAAP) operating earnings for the second quarter of 2024 decreased to $93 million from $98 million in the second quarter of 2023, primarily due to increases in interest expense and depreciation expense, partially offset by favorable weather. \n\n_BGE_\n\nBGE’s second quarter of 2024 GAAP net income increased to $44 million from $42 million in the second quarter of 2023. BGE's Adjusted (non-GAAP) operating earnings for the second quarter of 2024 increased to $45 million from $43 million in the second quarter of 2023, primarily due to distribution rate increases, partially offset by an increase in depreciation and amortization expenses and an increase in interest expense. Due to revenue decoupling, BGE's distribution earnings are not affected by actual weather or customer usage patterns.\n\n_PHI_\n\nPHI’s second quarter of 2024 GAAP net income increased to $158 million from $103 million in the second quarter of 2023. PHI’s Adjusted (non-GAAP) operating earnings for the second quarter of 2024 increased to $162 million from $115 million in the second quarter of 2023, primarily due to the favorable impacts of the Pepco Maryland multi-year plans including the recognition of the reconciliations, the absence of an increase in environmental liabilities at Pepco, an increase in ACE and DPL Delaware electric distribution rates, and higher transmission rates at Pepco and DPL, partially offset by increases in depreciation expense and various operating expenses. Due to revenue decoupling, PHI's distribution earnings related to Pepco Maryland, DPL Maryland, Pepco District of Columbia, and ACE are not affected by actual weather or customer usage patterns.  1Exelon’s four business units include ComEd, which consists of electricity transmission and distribution operations in northern Illinois; PECO, which consists of electricity transmission and distribution operations and retail natural gas distribution operations in southeastern Pennsylvania; BGE, which consists of electricity transmission and distribution operations and retail natural gas distribution operations in central Maryland; and PHI, which consists of electricity transmission and distribution operations in the District of Columbia and portions of Maryland, Delaware, and New Jersey and retail natural gas distribution operations in northern Delaware. **Recent Developments and Second Quarter Highlights**\n\n  * **Dividend:** On July 30, 2024, Exelon's Board of Directors declared a regular quarterly dividend of $0.38 per share on Exelon's common stock. The dividend is payable on September 13, 2024, to Exelon's shareholders of record as of the close of business on August 12, 2024. \n  * **Rate Case Developments:**\n    * **Pepco Maryland Electric Distribution Rate Case:** On June 10, 2024, the MDPSC issued an order approving an incremental increase in Pepco's electric distribution rates of $45 million for the 12-month period ending March 31, 2025, reflecting an ROE of 9.5%. The MDPSC did not approve electric distribution rate increases for 2025, 2026, and the 2027 nine-month extension period. \n  * **Financing Activities:**\n    * On March 13, 2024, ComEd issued $800 million of its First Mortgage Bonds, consisting of $400 million of its First Mortgage 5.30% Series Bonds due on June 1, 2034 and $400 million of its First Mortgage 5.65% Series Bonds due on June 1, 2054. ComEd used the proceeds to repay existing indebtedness, outstanding commercial paper obligations, and for general corporate purposes. \n    * On June 6, 2024, BGE issued $800 million of its Notes, consisting of $400 million aggregate principal of its 5.30% notes due June 1, 2034 and $400 million aggregate principal of its 5.65% notes due June 1, 2054.

For all items, the marginal statutory income tax rates for 2024 and 2023 ranged from 24.0% to 29.0%.\n\n**Webcast Information**\n\nExelon will discuss second quarter 2024 earnings in a conference call scheduled for today at 9 a.m. Central Time (10 a.m. Eastern Time).

Adjusted (non-GAAP) operating earnings exclude certain costs, expenses, gains and losses, and other specified items. This measure is intended to enhance an investor’s overall understanding of period over period operating results and provide an indication of Exelon’s baseline operating performance excluding items that are considered by management to be not directly related to the ongoing operations of the business. In addition, this measure is among the primary indicators management uses as a basis for evaluating performance, allocating resources, setting incentive compensation targets, and planning and forecasting of future periods. Adjusted (non-GAAP) operating earnings is not a presentation defined under GAAP and may not be comparable to other companies’ presentation. Exelon has provided the non-GAAP financial measure as supplemental information and in addition to the financial measures that are calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP. Adjusted (non-GAAP) operating earnings should not be deemed more useful than, a substitute for, or an alternative to the most comparable GAAP net income measures provided in this earnings release and attachments.

Additionally, our Exelon team is leading the industry with our innovative approach on safety, now measuring our performance through a Serious Injury Incidence Rate, reaffirming our commitment to the safety of our employees and community members.\"\n\n\"We delivered first quarter 2024 adjusted operating earnings of $0.68 per share while maintaining strong operational performance,\" said Exelon Chief Financial Officer Jeanne Jones. \"Despite mild weather and a challenging storm season, we remain on track to deliver full-year operating earnings of $2.40 to $2.50 per share in 2024 and continue to affirm our sustained growth over the coming years to support the energy transformation in our communities, projecting annualized earnings per share (EPS) growth of 5% to 7% through 2027.\"\n\n**First Quarter 2024**\n\nExelon's GAAP Net Income for the first quarter of 2024 decreased to $0.66 per share from $0.67 per share in the first quarter of 2023. Adjusted (non-GAAP) Operating Earnings for the first quarter of 2024 decreased to $0.68 per share from $0.70 per share in the first quarter of 2023. For the reconciliations of GAAP Net Income to Adjusted (non-GAAP) Operating Earnings, refer to the tables beginning on page 4.\n\nGAAP Net Income and Adjusted (non-GAAP) Operating Earnings in the first quarter of 2024 primarily reflect:\n\n  * Higher utility earnings primarily due to rate increases at BGE and PHI. This was partially offset by higher operating expenses due to increased storm costs at PECO and BGE, lower electric distribution earnings from lower allowed ROE and the absence of a return on pension asset at ComEd, and lower carrying cost recovery related to the carbon mitigation credit (CMC) regulatory asset at ComEd.\n  * Higher costs at the Exelon holding company primarily due to higher interest expense.\n\n\n\n### Operating Company Results1\n\n_ComEd_\n\nComEd's first quarter of 2024 GAAP Net Income decreased to $193 million from $241 million in the first quarter of 2023. ComEd's Adjusted (non-GAAP) Operating Earnings for the first quarter of 2024 decreased to $219 million from $251 million in the first quarter of 2023, primarily due to decreases in electric distribution earnings (reflecting lower allowed ROE due to U.S. Treasury rates no longer applying to distribution revenue) and carrying costs related to the CMC regulatory asset. Due to revenue decoupling, ComEd's distribution earnings are not affected by actual weather or customer usage patterns.\n\n_PECO_\n\nPECO’s first quarter of 2024 GAAP Net Income decreased to $149 million from $166 million in the first quarter of 2023. PECO's Adjusted (non-GAAP) Operating Earnings for the first quarter of 2024 decreased to $149 million from $166 million in the first quarter of 2023, primarily due to an increase in storm costs partially offset by less unfavorable weather.\n\n1Exelon’s four business units include ComEd, which consists of electricity transmission and distribution operations in northern Illinois; PECO, which consists of electricity transmission and distribution operations and retail natural gas distribution operations in southeastern Pennsylvania; BGE, which consists of electricity transmission and distribution operations and retail natural gas distribution operations in central Maryland; and PHI, which consists of electricity transmission and distribution operations in the District of Columbia and portions of Maryland, Delaware, and New Jersey and retail natural gas distribution operations in northern Delaware.\n\n_BGE_\n\nBGE’s first quarter of 2024 GAAP Net Income increased to $264 million from $200 million in the first quarter of 2023. BGE's Adjusted (non-GAAP) Operating Earnings for the first quarter of 2024 increased to $264 million from $199 million in the first quarter of 2023, primarily due to increased revenue due to distribution rate increases. Due to revenue decoupling, BGE's distribution earnings are not affected by actual weather or customer usage patterns.\n\n_PHI_\n\nPHI’s first quarter of 2024 GAAP Net Income increased to $168 million from $155 million in the first quarter of 2023. PHI’s Adjusted (non-GAAP) Operating Earnings for the first quarter of 2024 decreased to $168 million from $173 million in the first quarter of 2023, primarily due to increase in interest expense and operating expenses, partially offset by distribution rate increases. Due to revenue decoupling, PHI's distribution earnings related to Pepco Maryland, DPL Maryland, Pepco District of Columbia, and ACE are not affected by actual weather or customer usage patterns.\n\n**Recent Developments and First Quarter Highlights**\n\n  * **Dividend:** On April 30, 2024, Exelon's Board of Directors declared a regular quarterly dividend of $0.38 per share on Exelon's common stock for the second quarter of 2024. The dividend is payable on June 14, 2024, to shareholders of record of Exelon as of 5 p.m. Eastern time on Monday, May 13, 2024. \n  * **Rate Case Developments:**\n    * **ComEd Refiled Multi-Year Grid Plan:** On March 13, 2024, ComEd refiled its Grid Plan with the ICC. On March 15, 2024, ComEd filed a petition to adjust its multi-year rate plan revenue requirement to increase its distribution rates by $302 million in 2024, $89 million in 2025, $136 million in 2026 and $143 million in 2027, reflecting an ROE 8.905%. ComEd currently expects a decision in the fourth quarter of 2024, but cannot predict if the ICC will approve the application as filed.\n    * **ComEd Rehearing on Multi-Year Rate Plan:** On April 18, 2024, the ICC issued an order which increased the revenue requirements by $150 million in 2024, $186 million in 2025, $221 million in 2026 and $253 million in 2027, reflecting an ROE of 8.905%.\n    * **ComEd Distribution Formula Rate Reconciliation:** On April 26, 2024, ComEd filed its proposed Delivery Reconciliation Amount with the ICC requesting $627 million under Rider Delivery Service Pricing Reconciliation which allows for the reconciliation of the revenue requirement in effect. The 2024 filing reconciles those rates with the actual delivery service costs incurred in 2023. ComEd currently expects a decision in the fourth quarter of 2024, but cannot predict if the ICC will approve the application as filed.\n    * **PECO Pennsylvania Electric Distribution Rate Case:** On March 28, 2024, PECO filed an application with the PAPUC to increase its annual Electric rates by $464 million, which is partially offset by a one-time credit of $64 million in 2025, reflecting an ROE of 10.95%. PECO currently expects a decision in the fourth quarter of 2024 but cannot predict if the PAPUC will approve the application as filed.\n    * **PECO Pennsylvania Natural Gas Distribution Rate Case:** On March 28, 2024, PECO filed an application with the PAPUC to increase its annual natural gas rates by $111 million, reflecting an ROE of 11.15%.

Interim rates went into effect on July 15, 2023, subject to refund. Rates associated with the approved order were effective on April 24, 2024. \n  * **Financing Activities:**\n    * On Feb. 27, 2024, Exelon Corporate issued $1,700 million of notes, consisting of $650 million of its 5.15% notes due March 15, 2029, $650 million of its 5.45% notes due March 15, 2034, and $400 million of its 5.60% notes due March 15, 2053.

Adjusted (non-GAAP) Operating Earnings exclude certain costs, expenses, gains and losses, and other specified items. This measure is intended to enhance an investor’s overall understanding of period over period operating results and provide an indication of Exelon’s baseline operating performance excluding items that are considered by management to be not directly related to the ongoing operations of the business. In addition, this measure is among the primary indicators management uses as a basis for evaluating performance, allocating resources, setting incentive compensation targets, and planning and forecasting of future periods. Adjusted (non-GAAP) Operating Earnings is not a presentation defined under GAAP and may not be comparable to other companies’ presentation. Exelon has provided the non-GAAP financial measure as supplemental information and in addition to the financial measures that are calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP. Adjusted (non-GAAP) Operating Earnings should not be deemed more useful than, a substitute for, or an alternative to the most comparable GAAP Net Income measures provided in this earnings release and attachments.
