Announces Third Quarter 2024 Financial Results\n\nOctober 29, 2024\n\n  * **Net sales of $0.9 billion**\n  * **Net income per diluted share of $2.91, impacted by $50 million product warranty reserve charge**\n  * **Net cash balance of $0.7 billion**\n  * **YTD net bookings of 4.0 GW; 0.4 GW since second quarter earnings call**\n  * **Expected sales backlog of 73.3 GW**\n\n\n\nTEMPE, Ariz.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--  First Solar, Inc. (Nasdaq: FSLR) (the “Company”) today announced financial results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2024. \n\nNet sales for the third quarter were $0.9 billion, a decrease of $0.1 billion from the prior quarter. The decrease was primarily driven by a decrease in the volume of MW sold and a product warranty reserve charge, partially offset by termination payments from certain customers in the U.S. and India. \n\nThe Company reported third quarter net income per diluted share of $2.91, compared to net income per diluted share of $3.25 in the second quarter of 2024. \n\nCash, cash equivalents, restricted cash, restricted cash equivalents, and marketable securities, less debt at the end of the third quarter, decreased to $0.7 billion from $1.2 billion at the end of the prior quarter. The decrease was primarily driven by capital expenditures associated with our new U.S. factories in Alabama and Louisiana along with an increase in working capital. \n\n“As we approach the end of 2024, we remain pleased with the progress made across our business, navigating against a backdrop of industry volatility and political uncertainty, with a continued focus on balancing growth, profitability, and liquidity,” said Mark Widmar, CEO of First Solar. “We expect that our disciplined, long-term approach will allow us to work through the outcomes of the upcoming US elections as well as the continued volatility across the solar manufacturing industry.” \n\nOur 2024 guidance has been updated as follows: \n\n**Prior** |  **Current**  \n---|---  \n**Net Sales** |  $4.4B to $4.6B  |  $4.10B to $4.25B   \n**Gross Margin (1)** |  $2.0B to $2.1B  |  $1.95B to $2.00B   \n**Operating Expenses (2)** |  $455M to $485M  |  $445M to $475M   \n**Operating Income (3)** |  $1.5B to $1.6B  |  $1.48B to $1.54B   \n**Earnings per Diluted Share** |  $13.00 to $14.00  |  $13.00 to $13.50   \n**Net Cash Balance (4)** |  $0.6B to $0.9B  |  $0.5B to $0.7B   \n**Capital Expenditures** |  $1.8B to $2.0B  |  $1.55B to $1.65B   \n**Volume Sold** |  15.6GW to 16.3GW  |  14.2GW to 14.6GW   \n——————————   \n---  \n(1)  |  Assumes $60 million to $75 million of ramp costs and $1.02 billion to $1.05 billion of Section 45X tax credits   \n(2)  |  Assumes $70 million to $80 million of production start-up expense   \n(3)  |  Assumes $130 million to $155 million of production start-up expense and ramp costs, and $1.02 billion to $1.05 billion of Section 45X tax credits   \n(4)  |  Defined as cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash, restricted cash equivalents, and marketable securities, less expected debt at the end of 2024   \n  \nThe guidance figures presented above are forward-looking statements that are subject to a variety of assumptions and estimates, including with respect to certain factors related to the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (the “IRA”). Among other things, such factors include (i) the total Section 45X tax credit and (ii) the timing and ability to monetize such credit. Investors are encouraged to listen to the conference call and to review the accompanying materials, which contain more information about First Solar’s third quarter 2024 financial results, 2024 guidance, and financial outlook. \n\n**Conference Call Details**\n\nFirst Solar has scheduled a conference call for today, October 29, 2024, at 4:30 p.m. ET, to discuss this announcement.

(Nasdaq: FSLR) inaugurated its new $1.1 billion fully vertically integrated thin-film solar manufacturing facility in Lawrence County, Alabama. The facility, which adds 3.5 gigawatts (GW) of fully vertically integrated nameplate solar manufacturing capacity in the United States, is expected to create over 800 new energy technology manufacturing jobs in the state. \n\n![First Solar inaugurated its new $1.1 billion fully vertically integrated thin-film solar manufacturing facility in Lawrence County, Alabama.

(Photo: Business Wire)\n\n“This represents a great day for First Solar and for Lawrence County because this production facility is destined to become a major player in the US renewable energy market,” said Alabama Governor Kay Ivey. “Moreover, the Alabama workers at this facility will help break the nation’s dependence on foreign-made solar panels and contribute to our energy independence.” \n\nThe Lawrence County facility along with First Solar’s three operating factories in Ohio brings the company’s domestic nameplate manufacturing capacity to almost 11 GW and its global capacity to over 21 GW, once fully ramped. First Solar, the largest fully vertically integrated solar manufacturer in the Western Hemisphere, is also constructing a $1.1 billion, 3.5 GW facility in Louisiana, which is expected to be commissioned in the second half of 2025. The company expects to have over 14 GW of annual nameplate capacity in the United States and 25 GW globally by the end of 2026. \n\n“This is the first of two fully vertically integrated solar manufacturing facilities that solidify the role of the Gulf Coast states in enabling America’s all-of-the-above energy strategy,” said Mark Widmar, chief executive officer, First Solar. “This energy technology manufacturing facility produces American solar panels, with American-made components sourced from a supply chain that spans the country. The hundreds of people that operate this facility represent the next generation of American energy workers and are joined by thousands more steelworkers, glassworkers, miners, truck drivers, railroad workers, and others that enable our mission to support our country’s energy security.” \n\nFirst Solar’s advanced, highly differentiated manufacturing process allows it to transform a sheet of glass into ready-to-ship thin film solar panels in approximately four hours. The Alabama facility’s entire solar value chain – equivalent to transformation from semiconductor to wafer to cell to module – operates under one roof, using one tightly controlled process with rigorous quality assurance and control. The Series 7 modules produced in Lawrence County use Alabama-sourced steel, smelted, rolled, and fabricated within a 25-mile radius of the facility. \n\nFirst Solar is unique among the world’s largest solar manufacturers because it is the only US-headquartered company and does not manufacture in China. The company’s operational manufacturing footprint in Ohio and Alabama and Louisiana represent over $4 billion in US manufacturing investments. \n\nA study commissioned by First Solar and conducted by the University of Louisiana at Lafayette projects that as the company grows to 14 GW in annual US nameplate capacity by the end of 2026, it will support an estimated 30,060 direct, indirect, and induced jobs across the country, representing $2.8 billion in annual labor income. Additionally, the study estimates that every direct job First Solar supports in 2026 will support 7.3 jobs nationwide. \n\n**Quotes**\n\n**Ellen McNair, secretary of the Alabama Department of Commerce:** “First Solar's $1.1 billion manufacturing facility in Lawrence County is likely the largest investment project ever undertaken in one of our rural counties, demonstrating that our rural communities are prepared to meet any challenge. This is also a highly positive development for Alabama’s expanding green energy sector and strengthens our state’s growing leadership in the US clean energy industry.” \n\n**Amard Martin, commissioner, Lawrence County:** “The inauguration of First Solar is a tremendous milestone for Alabama, particularly for Lawrence County and District One. First Solar’s investment is not only a step forward in clean energy but also a major boost for our local economy. This project brings much-needed jobs, strengthens our infrastructure, and reinforces Alabama’s position as a leader in innovation and sustainability. We are excited about the opportunities this facility will create for our community and future generations.” \n\n**Bobby Burch, commissioner, Lawrence County:** “From a micro level, having First Solar is great for Lawrence County and its neighboring counties. And from a macro level, American-made First Solar panels, with their advanced technology, will greatly influence the global renewable energy market for future generations.” \n\n**John Bradley, SVP of Economic Development, TVA:** “This marks a significant step forward in advancing our shared goals toward a clean energy future. We are proud to partner with the Alabama Department of Commerce and the Lawrence County Industrial Development Board to support companies creating jobs and investment in our communities and look forward to First Solar’s future business success here in Alabama.” \n\n**About First Solar, Inc.**\n\nFirst Solar is a leading American solar technology company and global provider of responsibly produced eco-efficient solar modules advancing the fight against climate change.

Basis of Presentation\nThe accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements of First Solar, Inc. and its subsidiaries in this Quarterly Report have been prepared\nin accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”) for interim financial information and pursuant to\nthe instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 10 of Regulation S-X of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”). Accordingly, these interim financial\nstatements do not include all of the information and footnotes required by U.S. GAAP for annual financial statements. In the opinion of First Solar\nmanagement, all adjustments (consisting only of normal recurring adjustments) considered necessary for a fair statement have been included. Certain prior\nperiod balances have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation.\nThe preparation of condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the\namounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Despite our intention to establish accurate estimates and reasonable assumptions, actual\nresults could differ materially from such estimates and assumptions. Operating results for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 are not\nnecessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the year ending December 31, 2024 or for any other period. The condensed consolidated balance\nsheet at December 31, 2023 has been derived from the audited consolidated financial statements at that date, but does not include all of the information and\nfootnotes required by U.S. GAAP for complete financial statements. These interim financial statements and notes should be read in conjunction with the\naudited financial statements and notes thereto for the year ended December 31, 2023 included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K, which has been filed with\nthe SEC.\nUnless expressly stated or the context otherwise requires, the terms “the Company,” “we,” “us,” “our,” and “First Solar” refer to First Solar, Inc. and its\nconsolidated subsidiaries, and the term “condensed consolidated financial statements” refers to the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial\nstatements contained in this Quarterly Report.\n2.

During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we sold marketable securities for proceeds of $34.9 million and realized a loss of less than\n$0.1 million on such sales. See Note 8. “Fair Value Measurements” to our condensed consolidated financial statements for information about the fair value of\nour marketable securities.\nThe following tables summarize the unrealized gains and losses related to our available-for-sale marketable securities, by major security type, as of\nSeptember 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 (in thousands):\nAs of September 30, 2024\nAmortized Unrealized Unrealized Allowance for Credit Fair\nCost Gains Losses Losses Value\nU.S. debt $ 10,000 $ — $ 1,178 $ — $ 8,822\nTime deposits 255,869 — — — 255,869\nTotal $ 265,869 $ — $ 1,178 $ — $ 264,691\nAs of December 31, 2023\nAmortized Unrealized Unrealized Allowance for Credit Fair\nCost Gains Losses Losses Value\nForeign debt $ 35,000 $ — $ 91 $ 14 $ 34,895\nU.S. debt 45,625 88 1,614 10 44,089\nTime deposits 76,533 — — 22 76,511\nTotal $ 157,158 $ 88 $ 1,705 $ 46 $ 155,495\nThe contractual maturities of our marketable securities as of September 30, 2024 were as follows (in thousands):\nFair\nValue\nWithin one year $ 255,869\nAfter one year through five years 4,731\nAfter five years through ten years 4,091\nTotal $ 264,691\n8\nTable of Contents\n3. Restricted Marketable Securities\nRestricted marketable securities consisted of the following as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 (in thousands):\nSeptember 30, December 31,\n2024 2023\nForeign government obligations $ 52,368 $ 51,229\nSupranational debt 23,350 15,339\nU.S. debt 116,157 113,326\nU.S. government obligations 19,255 18,416\nTotal restricted marketable securities $ 211,130 $ 198,310\nOur restricted marketable securities represent long-term investments to fund the estimated future cost of collecting and recycling modules covered under our\nsolar module collection and recycling program. We have established a trust under which funds are put into custodial accounts with an established and reputable\nbank, for which First Solar, Inc.; First Solar Malaysia Sdn. Bhd.; and First Solar Manufacturing GmbH are grantors. As of September 30, 2024 and\nDecember 31, 2023, such custodial accounts also included noncurrent restricted cash and cash equivalents balances of $4.5 million and $6.2 million,\nrespectively, which were reported within “Other assets.” Trust funds may be disbursed for qualified module collection and recycling costs (including capital\nand facility related recycling costs), payments to customers for assuming collection and recycling obligations, and reimbursements of any overfunded amounts.\nInvestments in the trust must meet certain investment quality criteria comparable to highly rated government or agency bonds. As necessary, we fund any\nincremental amounts for our estimated collection and recycling obligations on an annual basis based on the estimated costs of collecting and recycling covered\nmodules, estimated rates of return on our restricted marketable securities, and an estimated solar module life of 25 years, less amounts already funded in prior\nyears. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we purchased $7.9 million of restricted marketable securities as part of our ongoing management of\nthe custodial accounts.\nSee Note 8. “Fair Value Measurements” to our condensed consolidated financial statements for information about the fair value of our restricted marketable\nsecurities.

Under the agreement, Cleantech plans to construct certain photovoltaic (“PV”) solar and wind generating assets, which are expected to supply\nelectricity to our manufacturing facility in India.\nDuring 2024, we purchased ownership interests in two subsidiaries of Cleantech for $7.9 million. These subsidiaries own certain of the generation assets that are\nexpected to supply our facility, and we account for our investments in these subsidiaries using the equity method. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024,\nwe recognized $27.3 million of revenue from module sales of 108 megawatts to these subsidiaries. As of September 30, 2024, we had also received advance payments\nof $1.1 million from one of these subsidiaries for future module sales.\n11\nTable of Contents\nAccrued expenses\nAccrued expenses consisted of the following at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 (in thousands):\nSeptember 30, December 31,\n2024 2023\nAccrued property, plant and equipment $ 215,984 $ 210,233\nAccrued freight 91,995 58,494\nProduct warranty liability (1) 54,245 5,920\nAccrued inventory 48,008 101,161\nAccrued compensation and benefits 29,618 55,960\nAccrued other taxes 28,722 26,781\nAccrued interest 3,811 11,011\nOther 48,452 55,269\nAccrued expenses $ 520,835 $ 524,829\n——————————\n(1) See Note 10. “Commitments and Contingencies” to our condensed consolidated financial statements for discussion of our “Product Warranties.”\nOther current liabilities\nOther current liabilities consisted of the following at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 (in thousands):\nSeptember 30, December 31,\n2024 2023\nAccrued litigation (1) $ 21,800 $ 21,800\nLease liabilities (2) 13,313 10,358\nDerivative instruments (3) 3,071 1,744\nContingent consideration (4) — 7,500\nOther 6,069 798\nOther current liabilities $ 44,253 $ 42,200\n——————————\n(1) See Note 10. “Commitments and Contingencies” to our condensed consolidated financial statements for discussion of our legal proceedings.\n(2) See Note 7. “Leases” to our condensed consolidated financial statements for discussion of our lease arrangements.\n(3) See Note 6. “Derivative Financial Instruments” to our condensed consolidated financial statements for discussion of our derivative instruments.\n(4) See Note 10. “Commitments and Contingencies” to our condensed consolidated financial statements for discussion of our contingent consideration arrangements.\n12\nTable of Contents\nOther liabilities\nOther liabilities consisted of the following at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 (in thousands):\nSeptember 30, December 31,\n2024 2023\nLease liabilities (1) $ 99,248 $ 53,725\nDeferred tax liabilities, net 52,937 42,771\nOther taxes payable 35,175 39,431\nProduct warranty liability (2) 16,440 19,571\nContingent consideration (3) 11,000 11,000\nOther 13,338 14,212\nOther liabilities $ 228,138 $ 180,710\n——————————\n(1) See Note 7. “Leases” to our condensed consolidated financial statements for discussion of our lease arrangements.\n(2) See Note 10. “Commitments and Contingencies” to our condensed consolidated financial statements for discussion of our “Product Warranties.”\n(3) See Note 10. “Commitments and Contingencies” to our condensed consolidated financial statements for discussion of our contingent consideration arrangements.\n5. Government Grants\nGovernment grants represent benefits provided by federal, state, or local governments that are not subject to the scope of Accounting Standards Codification\n(“ASC”) 740. We recognize a grant when we have reasonable assurance that we will comply with the grant’s conditions and that the grant will be received.\nGovernment grants whose primary condition is the purchase, construction, or acquisition of a long-lived asset are considered asset-based grants and are\nrecognized as a reduction to such asset’s cost basis, which reduces future depreciation. Other government grants not related to long-lived assets are considered\nincome-based grants, which are recognized as a reduction to the related cost of activities that generated the benefit.\nThe following table presents the benefits recognized from asset-based government grants in our condensed consolidated balance sheets as of September 30,\n2024 and December 31, 2023 (in thousands):\nSeptember 30, December 31,\nBalance Sheet Line Item 2024 2023\nProperty, plant and equipment, net $ 153,668 $ 146,348\nOther assets 5,822 5,860\nIn February 2021, the state government of Tamil Nadu, India granted First Solar certain incentives associated with the construction of our first manufacturing\nfacility in the country. Among other things, such incentives provide a 24% subsidy for eligible capital investments, contingent upon meeting certain minimum\ninvestment and employment commitments. The capital subsidy funding application process begins in the fiscal year following the initial period of module\nproduction and is expected to be paid in six annual installments thereafter. The timing of cash receipts is subject to the completion of audit certifications,\nfunding applications by First Solar, and review by state government authorities. Module production in India began during the year ended December 31, 2023.\nWe expect to submit initial funding applications by the end of 2024. Such credit is reflected on our condensed consolidated balance sheets within “Government\ngrants receivable.”\n13\nTable of Contents\nThe following table presents the benefits recognized from income-based government grants in our condensed consolidated statements of operations for the\nthree and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 (in thousands):\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, September 30,\nIncome Statement Line Item 2024 2023 2024 2023\nCost of sales $ 266,501 $ 204,623 $ 719,508 $ 429,744\nResearch and development — — 4,000 —\nProduction start-up 484 — 484 —\nIn August 2022, the U.S. President signed into law the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (“IRA”). Among other things, the IRA offers a tax credit, pursuant to\nSection 45X of the Internal Revenue Code (“IRC”), for solar modules and solar module components manufactured in the United States and sold to third parties.\nSuch credit may be refundable by the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) or transferable to a third party and is available from 2023 to 2032, subject to phase\ndown beginning in 2030. For eligible components, the credit is equal to (i) $12 per square meter for a PV wafer, (ii) 4 cents multiplied by the capacity of a PV\ncell, and (iii) 7 cents multiplied by the capacity of a PV module. Based on the current form factor of our modules, we expect to qualify for a credit of\napproximately 17 cents per watt for each module produced in the United States and sold to a third party. We recognize such credit as a reduction to “Cost of\nsales” in the period the modules are sold to customers. Such credit is also reflected on our condensed consolidated balance sheets within “Government grants\nreceivable.”\nIn December 2023, we entered into an agreement with Fiserv, Inc. (“Fiserv”) for the sale of $687.2 million of Section 45X tax credits we generated during\n2023 for aggregate cash proceeds of $659.7 million. We received the full cash proceeds during the nine months ended September 30, 2024.\n6. Derivative Financial Instruments\nAs a global company, we are exposed in the normal course of business to various risks, including foreign currency and commodity price risks, that could affect\nour financial position, results of operations, and cash flows. We may use derivative instruments to hedge against these risks and only hold such instruments for\nhedging purposes, not for speculative or trading purposes.\nDepending on the terms of the specific derivative instruments and market conditions, some of our derivative instruments may be assets and others liabilities at\nany particular balance sheet date. We report all of our derivative instruments at fair value and account for changes in the fair value of derivative instruments\nwithin “Accumulated other comprehensive loss” if the derivative instruments qualify for hedge accounting. For those derivative instruments that do not qualify\nfor hedge accounting (i.e., “economic hedges”), we record the changes in fair value directly to earnings. See Note 8. “Fair Value Measurements” to our\ncondensed consolidated financial statements for information about the techniques we use to measure the fair value of our derivative instruments.\n14\nTable of Contents\nThe following tables present the fair values of derivative instruments included in our condensed consolidated balance sheets as of September 30, 2024 and\nDecember 31, 2023 (in thousands):\nSeptember 30, 2024\nOther Current\nOther Current Assets Liabilities\nDerivatives designated as hedging instruments:\nCommodity swap contracts $ — $ 469\nTotal derivatives designated as hedging instruments $ — $ 469\nDerivatives not designated as hedging instruments:\nForeign exchange forward contracts $ 2,228 $ 2,602\nTotal derivatives not designated as hedging instruments $ 2,228 $ 2,602\nTotal derivative instruments $ 2,228 $ 3,071\nDecember 31, 2023\nOther Current\nOther Current Assets Liabilities\nDerivatives designated as hedging instruments:\nCommodity swap contracts $ — $ 344\nTotal derivatives designated as hedging instruments $ — $ 344\nDerivatives not designated as hedging instruments:\nForeign exchange forward contracts $ 1,778 $ 1,400\nTotal derivatives not designated as hedging instruments $ 1,778 $ 1,400\nTotal derivative instruments $ 1,778 $ 1,744\nThe following table presents the pretax amounts related to derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges affecting accumulated other comprehensive\nincome (loss) and our condensed consolidated statements of operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 (in thousands):\nCommodity Swap\nContracts\nBalance as of December 31, 2023 $ (1,493)\nAmounts recognized in other comprehensive income (loss) (1,094)\nAmount reclassified to cost of sales 1,715\nBalance as of September 30, 2024 $ (872)\nBalance as of December 31, 2022 $ (7,242)\nAmounts recognized in other comprehensive income (loss) (962)\nAmount reclassified to cost of sales 5,576\nBalance as of September 30, 2023 $ (2,628)\n15\nTable of Contents\nThe following table presents the effect of derivative instruments not designated as hedges on our condensed consolidated statements of operations for the three\nand nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 (in thousands):\nAmount of Gain (Loss) Recognized in Income Statement\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, September 30,\nIncome Statement Line Item 2024 2023 2024 2023\nForeign exchange forward contracts Foreign currency loss, net $ 12,759 $ 4,533 $ (3,049) $ (9,568)\nForeign Currency Risk\nTransaction Exposure and Economic Hedging\nMany of our subsidiaries have assets and liabilities (primarily cash, receivables, deferred taxes, payables, accrued expenses, lease liabilities, debt, and solar\nmodule collection and recycling liabilities) that are denominated in currencies other than the subsidiaries’ functional currencies. Changes in the exchange rates\nbetween the functional currencies of our subsidiaries and the other currencies in which these assets and liabilities are denominated will create fluctuations in\nour reported condensed consolidated statements of operations. We may enter into foreign exchange forward contracts or other financial instruments to\neconomically hedge assets and liabilities against the effects of currency exchange rate fluctuations. The gains and losses on such foreign exchange forward\ncontracts will economically offset all or part of the transaction gains and losses that we recognize in earnings on the related foreign currency denominated\nassets and liabilities.\nWe also enter into foreign exchange forward contracts to economically hedge balance sheet and other exposures related to transactions between certain of our\nsubsidiaries and transactions with third parties. Such contracts are considered economic hedges and do not qualify for hedge accounting. Accordingly, we\nrecognize gains or losses from the fluctuations in foreign exchange rates and the fair value of these derivative contracts in “Foreign currency loss, net” on our\ncondensed consolidated statements of operations.\nAs of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the notional values of our foreign exchange forward contracts that do not qualify for hedge accounting were\nas follows (notional amounts and U.S. dollar equivalents in millions):\nSeptember 30, 2024\nTransaction Currency Notional Amount USD Equivalent\nSell Canadian dollar CAD 4.2 $3.1\nPurchase Euro €155.5 $173.6\nSell Euro €8.6 $9.6\nPurchase Indian rupee INR 18,055.0 $215.7\nSell Indian rupee INR 83,157.0 $993.3\nPurchase Japanese yen ¥1,464.0 $10.3\nSell Japanese yen ¥563.6 $4.0\nPurchase Malaysian ringgit MYR 193.0 $46.8\nSell Malaysian ringgit MYR 17.0 $4.1\nSell Mexican peso MXN 34.6 $1.8\nPurchase Singapore dollar SGD 14.1 $11.0\nSell Singapore dollar SGD 19.7 $15.4\n16\nTable of Contents\nDecember 31, 2023\nTransaction Currency Notional Amount USD Equivalent\nSell Canadian dollar CAD 4.2 $3.2\nSell Chilean peso CLP 1,372.6 $1.6\nPurchase Euro €98.3 $108.7\nSell Euro €14.1 $15.6\nSell Indian rupee INR 62,967.4 $756.9\nPurchase Japanese yen ¥1,053.6 $7.5\nSell Japanese yen ¥705.2 $5.0\nPurchase Malaysian ringgit MYR 160.7 $35.0\nSell Mexican peso MXN 34.6 $2.0\nPurchase Singapore dollar SGD 6.5 $4.9\nCommodity Price Risk\nFrom time to time, we use commodity swap contracts to mitigate our exposure to commodity price fluctuations for certain raw materials used in the production\nof our modules. During the year ended December 31, 2022, we entered into various commodity swap contracts to hedge a portion of our forecasted cash flows\nfor purchases of aluminum frames between July 2022 and December 2023. Such swaps had an aggregate initial notional value based on metric tons of\nforecasted aluminum purchases, equivalent to $70.5 million, and entitled us to receive a three-month average London Metals Exchange price for aluminum\nwhile requiring us to pay certain fixed prices. The notional amount of the commodity swap contracts proportionately adjusted with forecasted purchases of\naluminum frames.\nDuring the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we entered into various commodity swap contracts to hedge a portion of our forecasted cash flows for\npurchases of steel between April 2024 and December 2024. Such swaps had an aggregate initial notional value based on short tons of forecasted steel\npurchases, equivalent to $7.6 million, and entitle us to receive the price based on the U.S. Midwest Hot-Rolled Coil Steel Index while requiring us to pay\ncertain fixed prices. The notional amount of the commodity swap contracts proportionately adjusts with forecasted purchases of steel. As of September 30,\n2024, the notional value associated with these contracts was $0.2 million.\nThese commodity swap contracts qualify for accounting as cash flow hedges in accordance with ASC 815, and we designated them as such. We report\nunrealized gains or losses on such contracts in “Accumulated other comprehensive loss” and subsequently reclassify applicable amounts into earnings when the\nhedged transactions occur and impact earnings. We determined that these derivative financial instruments were highly effective as cash flow hedges as of\nSeptember 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. In the following 12 months, we expect to reclassify into earnings $0.9 million of net unrealized losses related to\nthese commodity swap contracts that are included in “Accumulated other comprehensive loss” at September 30, 2024 as we realize the earnings effects of the\nrelated forecasted transactions.\n17\nTable of Contents\n7. Leases\nOur lease arrangements include our corporate and administrative offices, warehouses, land for our manufacturing facilities, and certain of our manufacturing\nequipment.

Fair Value Measurements\nThe following is a description of the valuation techniques that we use to measure the fair value of assets and liabilities that we measure and report at fair value\non a recurring basis:\n• Cash Equivalents and Restricted Cash Equivalents. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, our cash equivalents and restricted cash equivalents\nconsisted of money market funds. We value our cash equivalents and restricted cash equivalents using observable inputs that reflect quoted prices for\nsecurities with identical characteristics and classify the valuation techniques that use these inputs as Level 1.\n• Marketable Securities and Restricted Marketable Securities. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, our marketable securities consisted of foreign\ndebt, U.S. debt, and time deposits, and our restricted marketable securities consisted of foreign and U.S. government obligations, supranational debt, and\nU.S. debt. We value our marketable securities and restricted marketable securities using observable inputs that reflect quoted prices for securities with\nidentical characteristics or quoted prices for securities with similar characteristics and other observable inputs (such as interest rates that are observable at\ncommonly quoted intervals). Accordingly, we classify the valuation techniques that use these inputs as either Level 1 or Level 2 depending on the inputs\nused. We also consider the effect of our counterparties’ credit standing in these fair value measurements.\n• Derivative Assets and Liabilities. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, our derivative assets and liabilities consisted of foreign exchange\nforward contracts involving major currencies and commodity swap contracts involving major commodity prices. Since our derivative assets and liabilities\nare not traded on an exchange, we value them using standard industry valuation models. As applicable, these models project future cash flows and discount\nthe amounts to a present value using market-based observable inputs, including credit risk, foreign exchange rates, forward and spot prices for currencies,\nand forward prices for commodities. These inputs are observable in active markets over the contract term of the derivative instruments we hold, and\naccordingly, we classify the valuation techniques as Level 2. In evaluating credit risk, we consider the effect of our counterparties’ and our own credit\nstanding in the fair value measurements of our derivative assets and liabilities, respectively.\n19\nTable of Contents\nAt September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the fair value measurements of our assets and liabilities measured on a recurring basis were as follows (in\nthousands):\nFair Value Measurements at Reporting\nDate Using\nQuoted Prices\nin Active Significant\nMarkets for Other Significant\nIdentical Observable Unobservable\nSeptember 30, Assets Inputs Inputs\n2024 (Level 1) (Level 2) (Level 3)\nAssets:\nCash equivalents:\nMoney market funds $ 402,381 $ 402,381 $ — $ —\nRestricted cash equivalents:\nMoney market funds 4,463 4,463 — —\nMarketable securities:\nU.S. debt 8,822 — 8,822 —\nTime deposits 255,869 255,869 — —\nRestricted marketable securities 211,130 — 211,130 —\nDerivative assets 2,228 — 2,228 —\nTotal assets $ 884,893 $ 662,713 $ 222,180 $ —\nLiabilities:\nDerivative liabilities $ 3,071 $ — $ 3,071 $ —\nFair Value Measurements at Reporting\nDate Using\nQuoted Prices\nin Active Significant\nMarkets for Other Significant\nIdentical Observable Unobservable\nDecember 31, Assets Inputs Inputs\n2023 (Level 1) (Level 2) (Level 3)\nAssets:\nCash equivalents:\nMoney market funds $ 1,105,684 $ 1,105,684 $ — $ —\nRestricted cash equivalents:\nMoney market funds 6,192 6,192 — —\nMarketable securities:\nForeign debt 34,895 — 34,895 —\nU.S. debt 44,089 — 44,089 —\nTime deposits 76,511 76,511 — —\nRestricted marketable securities 198,310 — 198,310 —\nDerivative assets 1,778 — 1,778 —\nTotal assets $ 1,467,459 $ 1,188,387 $ 279,072 $ —\nLiabilities:\nDerivative liabilities $ 1,744 $ — $ 1,744 $ —\n20\nTable of Contents\nFair Value of Financial Instruments\nAt September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the carrying values and fair values of our financial instruments not measured at fair value were as follows (in\nthousands):\nSeptember 30, 2024 December 31, 2023\nCarrying Fair Carrying Fair\nValue Value Value Value\nAssets:\nGovernment grants receivable - noncurrent $ 871,745 $ 835,068 $ 152,208 $ 107,111\nLiabilities:\nLong-term debt, including current maturities (1) $ 464,550 $ 448,862 $ 500,000 $ 453,015\n——————————\n(1) Excludes unamortized issuance costs and debt arrangements with an original maturity of less than one year.\nThe carrying values in our condensed consolidated balance sheets of our current trade accounts receivable, restricted cash, current government grants\nreceivable, accounts payable, accrued expenses, and debt arrangements with an original maturity of less than one year approximated their fair values due to\ntheir nature and relatively short maturities; therefore, we excluded them from the foregoing table. The fair value measurements for our noncurrent government\ngrants receivable and long-term debt are considered Level 2 measurements under the fair value hierarchy.\nCredit Risk\nWe have certain financial and derivative instruments that subject us to credit risk. These consist primarily of cash, cash equivalents, marketable securities,\naccounts receivable, restricted cash, restricted cash equivalents, restricted marketable securities, foreign exchange forward contracts, and commodity swap\ncontracts. We are exposed to credit losses in the event of nonperformance by the counterparties to our financial and derivative instruments. We place these\ninstruments with various high-quality financial institutions and limit the amount of credit risk from any one counterparty. We monitor the credit standing of our\ncounterparty financial institutions. Our net sales are primarily concentrated among a limited number of customers. We monitor the financial condition of our\ncustomers and perform credit evaluations whenever considered necessary. We typically require some form of payment security from our customers, including,\nbut not limited to, advance payments, parent guarantees, letters of credit, bank guarantees, or surety bonds.\n21\nTable of Contents\n9. Debt\nOur debt arrangements consisted of the following at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 (in thousands):\nBalance (USD)\nSeptember 30, December 31,\nLoan Agreement Currency 2024 2023\nRevolving Credit Facility USD $ — $ —\nIndia Credit Facility USD 464,550 500,000\nIndia JPM Working Capital Facility INR 29,057 60,827\nIndia HSBC Working Capital Facility INR 70,474 —\nIndia Citibank Working Capital Facility INR 17,917 —\nTotal debt principal 581,998 560,827\nLess: unamortized issuance costs (416) (521)\nTotal debt 581,582 560,306\nLess: current portion (208,261) (96,238)\nNoncurrent portion $ 373,321 $ 464,068\nRevolving Credit Facility\nIn June 2023, we entered into a credit agreement with several financial institutions as lenders and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. as administrative agent, which\nprovides us with a senior secured credit facility (the “Revolving Credit Facility”) with an aggregate borrowing capacity of $1.0 billion. Borrowing under the\nRevolving Credit Facility bears interest at a rate per annum equal to, at our option, (i) the Term Secured Overnight Financing Rate (“Term SOFR”), plus a\ncredit spread of 0.10%, plus a margin that ranges from 1.25% to 2.25% or (ii) an alternate base rate as defined in the credit agreement, plus a margin that\nranges from 0.25% to 1.25%. The margins under the Revolving Credit Facility are based on the Company’s net leverage ratio or, if the Company elects to\nswitch to a credit ratings-based system after the investment grade ratings trigger date occurs (as defined in the credit agreement), the Company’s public debt\nrating.\nIn addition to paying interest on outstanding principal under the Revolving Credit Facility, we are required to pay an unused commitment fee that ranges from\n0.125% to 0.375% per annum based on the same factors discussed above and the daily unused commitments under the facility. We are also required to pay (i) a\nletter of credit fee based on the applicable margin for Term SOFR loans on the face amount of each letter of credit, (ii) a letter of credit fronting fee as agreed\nby the Company and such issuing lender, and (iii) other customary letter of credit fees. Our Revolving Credit Facility matures in June 2028.\nAs of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had no outstanding debt or letters of credit under our Revolving Credit Facility. Loans and letters of\ncredit issued under the Revolving Credit Facility are secured by liens on substantially all of the Company’s tangible and intangible assets.\nIndia Credit Facility\nIn July 2022, FS India Solar Ventures Private Limited (“FSISV”), our indirect wholly-owned subsidiary, entered into a finance agreement (the “India Credit\nFacility”) with the U.S. International Development Finance Corporation for aggregate borrowing of up to $500.0 million for the development and construction\nof asolar module manufacturing facility in India. Principal on the India Credit Facility is payable in scheduled semi-annual installments beginning in August\n2024 through the facility’s expected maturity in August 2029. The India Credit Facility is guaranteed by First Solar, Inc.\n22\nTable of Contents\nIndia JPM Working Capital Facility\nIn December 2022, FSISV entered into a working capital facility agreement (the “India JPM Working Capital Facility”) with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. for\nthe issuance of bank guarantees, bonds, and other similar forms of security. During 2023, the India JPM Working Capital Facility was amended to include\ncertain working capital loans of up to INR 6.2 billion ($74.8 million). The outstanding balance matures in the first quarter of 2025. The India JPM Working\nCapital Facility is guaranteed by First Solar, Inc.\nIndia HSBC Working Capital Facility\nIn February 2024, FSISV entered into a working capital facility agreement (the “India HSBC Working Capital Facility”) with the Hongkong and Shanghai\nBanking Corporation Limited, which provides certain working capital loans of up to INR 8.2 billion ($98.4 million). The outstanding balance matures in the\nfirst quarter of 2025. The India HSBC Working Capital Facility is guaranteed by First Solar, Inc.\nIndia Citibank Working Capital Facility\nIn August 2024, FSISV entered into a working capital facility agreement (the “India Citibank Working Capital Facility”) with Citibank, N.A., which provides\ncertain working capital loans of up to INR 4.5 billion ($53.8 million). The outstanding balance matures in the first quarter of 2025. The India Citibank Working\nCapital Facility is guaranteed by First Solar, Inc.\n10. Commitments and Contingencies\nCommercial Commitments\nDuring the normal course of business, we enter into commercial commitments in the form of letters of credit and surety bonds to provide financial and\nperformance assurance to third parties. As of September 30, 2024, the issued and outstanding amounts and available capacities under these commitments were\nas follows (in millions):\nIssued and\nOutstanding Available Capacity\nRevolving Credit Facility (1) $ — $ 250.0\nBilateral facilities (2) 185.4 119.4\nSurety bonds 28.6 225.0\n——————————\n(1) Our Revolving Credit Facility provides us with a sub-limit of $250.0 million to issue letters of credit, at a fee based on the applicable margin for Term SOFR loans, a\nfronting fee, and other customary letter of credit fees.\n(2) Of the total letters of credit issued under the bilateral facilities, $9.3 million was secured with cash.\nProduct Warranties\nWhen we recognize revenue for sales of modules, we accrue liabilities for the estimated future costs of meeting our limited warranty obligations. We estimate\nour limited product warranty liability for power output and defects in materials and workmanship under normal use and service conditions based on return rates\nfor each series of module technology and other factors. We make and revise these estimates based primarily on the number of solar modules under warranty\ninstalled at customer locations, our historical experience with and projections of warranty claims, and our estimated per-module replacement costs. We also\nmonitor our expected future module performance through certain quality and reliability testing and actual performance in certain field installation sites. From\ntime to time, we have taken remediation actions with respect to affected modules beyond our limited warranties and may elect to do so in the future, in which\ncase we would incur additional expenses. Such potential voluntary future remediation\n23\nTable of Contents\nactions beyond our limited warranty obligations may be material to our condensed consolidated statements of operations if we commit to any such remediation\nactions.\nProduct warranty activities during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were as follows (in thousands):\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nProduct warranty liability, beginning of period $ 23,695 $ 31,969 $ 25,491 $ 33,787\nAccruals for new warranties issued 1,413 1,310 4,463 3,155\nSettlements (4,578) (1,326) (9,922) (4,519)\nChanges in estimate of product warranty liability 50,155 (5,806) 50,653 (6,276)\nProduct warranty liability, end of period $ 70,685 $ 26,147 $ 70,685 $ 26,147\nCurrent portion of warranty liability $ 54,245 $ 7,647 $ 54,245 $ 7,647\nNoncurrent portion of warranty liability $ 16,440 $ 18,500 $ 16,440 $ 18,500\nWe have identified manufacturing issues affecting certain Series 7 modules manufactured in 2023 and 2024 that may cause the modules to experience\npremature power loss once installed in the field. The ultimate loss we will incur for these manufacturing issues will depend on the extent of the premature\npower loss that is experienced in relation to the obligations under our limited product warranties, as well as any additional commitments we may make to\nremediate the affected modules. Based on currently available information and certain assumptions and estimates, we believe a reasonable estimate of the\naggregate losses related to these manufacturing issues will range from approximately $50 million to $100 million. At this time, no individual amount within\nthat range is a better estimate than any other amount. Accordingly, as of September 30, 2024, we increased our product warranty liability by the low end of the\nrange, which we recorded as a reduction to revenue. The estimated range set forth above was based on our evaluation of the currently available information,\nincluding select samples of module performance data from several locations, the estimated number of affected modules, and projections of probable costs to\nremediate the issues. As additional information becomes available to us, our estimate of the aggregate losses related to these manufacturing issues may change,\nand any change in estimate may also result in a change to our product warranty liability.\nDuring the three months ended September 30, 2023, we revised our warranty estimate based on updated information regarding our warranty claims, which\nreduced our module warranty liability by $5.7 million. This updated information reflected lower-than-expected warranty claims for our older series of module\ntechnology and revisions to projected settlements, resulting in reductions to our projected module return rate.\nIndemnifications\nIn certain limited circumstances, we have provided indemnifications to customers or other parties under which we are contractually obligated to compensate\nsuch parties for losses they suffer resulting from a breach of a representation, warranty, or covenant; the resolution of specific matters associated with a\nproject’s development or construction; guarantees of a third party’s payment or performance obligations; or any disallowance or lack of the right to claim all or\nany portion of certain tax credits. For contracts that have such indemnification provisions, we initially recognize a liability under ASC 460 for the estimated\npremium that would be required by a guarantor to issue the same indemnity in a standalone arm’s-length transaction with an unrelated party. We may base these\nestimates on the cost of insurance or other instruments that cover the underlying risks being indemnified and may purchase such instruments to mitigate our\nexposure to potential indemnification payments. We subsequently measure such liabilities at the greater of the initially estimated premium or the contingent\nliability required to be recognized under ASC 450. We recognize any indemnification liabilities as a reduction of earnings associated with the related\ntransaction.\n24\nTable of Contents\nAfter an indemnification liability is recorded, we derecognize such amount pursuant to ASC 460 depending on the nature of the indemnity, which derecognition\ntypically occurs upon expiration or settlement of the arrangement, and any contingent aspects of the indemnity are accounted for in accordance with ASC 450.\nAs of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we accrued $2.5 million and $3.3 million of current indemnification liabilities, respectively. As of\nSeptember 30, 2024, the maximum potential amount of future payments under our indemnifications was $688.8 million.\nContingent Consideration\nAs part of our acquisition of Evolar AB (“Evolar”) in May 2023, we agreed to pay additional consideration of up to $42.5 million to the selling shareholders\ncontingent upon the successful achievement of certain technical milestones. As of December 31, 2023, we recorded $7.5 million of current liabilities and\n$11.0 million of long-term liabilities for such contingent obligations based on their estimated fair values. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024,\nwe paid $7.5 million of contingent consideration to the selling shareholders, and $11.0 million remains in our long-term liabilities as of September 30, 2024.\nSolar Module Collection and Recycling Liability\nWe previously established a module collection and recycling program, which has since been discontinued, to collect and recycle modules sold and covered\nunder such program once the modules reach the end of their service lives. For legacy customer sales contracts that are covered under this program, we agreed\nto pay the costs for the collection and recycling of qualifying solar modules, and the end-users agreed to notify us, disassemble their solar power systems,\npackage the solar modules for shipment, and revert ownership rights over the modules back to us at the end of the modules’ service lives. Accordingly, we\nrecorded any collection and recycling obligations within “Cost of sales” at the time of sale based on the estimated cost to collect and recycle the covered solar\nmodules.\nWe estimate the cost of our collection and recycling obligations based on the present value of the expected future cost of collecting and recycling the solar\nmodules, which includes estimates for the cost of packaging materials; the cost of freight from the solar module installation sites to a recycling center; material,\nlabor, and capital costs; and by-product credits for certain materials recovered during the recycling process. We base these estimates on our experience\ncollecting and recycling solar modules and certain assumptions regarding costs at the time the solar modules will be collected and recycled. In the periods\nbetween the time of sale and the related settlement of the collection and recycling obligation, we accrete the carrying amount of the associated liability and\nclassify the corresponding expense within “Selling, general and administrative” expense on our condensed consolidated statements of operations.\nOur module collection and recycling liability was $139.0 million and $135.1 million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. See Note\n3. “Restricted Marketable Securities” to our condensed consolidated financial statements for more information about our arrangements for funding this liability.\nLegal Proceedings\nIn July 2021, Southern Power Company and certain of its affiliates (“Southern”) filed an arbitration demand with the American Arbitration Association against\ntwo subsidiaries of the Company, alleging breach of the engineering, procurement, and construction (“EPC”) agreements for five projects in the United States,\nfor which the Company’s subsidiaries served as the EPC contractor. The arbitration demand asserts breach of obligations to design and engineer the projects in\naccordance with the EPC agreements, particularly as such obligations relate to the procurement of tracker systems and inverters. The Company and its\nsubsidiaries denied the claims, and defended the claims in arbitration hearings, which concluded in February 2023. In May 2023, the parties submitted their\nfinal proposals of individual award claims to the arbitration panel. In July 2023, the arbitration panel entered an interim award to Southern for $35.6 million,\nwhich was paid during the year ended December 31, 2023. As a result, we recognized a loss for such interim award in our results of operations for the year\nended December 31, 2023. The\n25\nTable of Contents\nfinal arbitration award, which did not change the results of the interim award, was signed on November 6, 2023. On February 2, 2024, First Solar commenced\nan action in the New York County Supreme Court seeking to vacate certain aspects of the final award. On May 6, 2024, such action was denied. First Solar has\nelected not to appeal, and considers this matter closed.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2022, we received several indemnification demands from certain customers, for whom we provided EPC services,\nregarding claims that such customers’ PV tracker systems infringe, in part, on patents owned by Rovshan Sade (“Plaintiff”), the owner of a company called\nTrabant Solar, Inc. In January 2023, we were notified by two of our customers that Plaintiff served them with patent infringement complaints, and we have\nassumed the defense of these claims. We have conducted due diligence on the patents and claims and believe that we will prevail in the actions. In April 2023,\nwe commenced an Inter Partes Review (“IPR”) before the United States Patent and Trademark Office seeking to invalidate such claims. In November 2023, the\nUnited States Patent Trial and Appeal Board declined to hear the First Solar IPR. In July 2024, Plaintiff’s counsel filed a motion seeking to withdraw as\ncounsel. The court granted the motion and issued a 45-day stay of all proceedings while Plaintiff seeks new representation. In September 2024, Plaintiff filed a\nmotion seeking a stay of all proceedings for 90 days, claiming health issues. The court granted the motion and issued an additional stay of all proceedings until\nJanuary 2025. Because all case discovery has been stayed, at this time we are not in a position to assess the likelihood of any potential loss or adverse effect on\nour financial condition or to estimate the amount or range of possible loss, if any, from these actions.\nIn April 2019, a subcontractor of First Solar sustained certain injuries while performing work at a former project site and, in May 2019, commenced legal\naction against a subsidiary of the Company. In June 2023, a jury awarded damages of approximately $51.3 million to the plaintiff. On September 21, 2023, the\nSuperior Court of California for Monterey County ruled, in response to a motion for remittitur filed by the Company, that the damages awarded to the plaintiff\nwere excessive and reduced the award from $51.3 million to $21.8 million. The plaintiff and defendant have appealed and cross appealed varying aspects of the\nverdict and the remittitur. Accordingly, due to the uncertainty surrounding the multiple decisions and appeals, as of September 30, 2024, we recorded a\n$21.8 million accrued litigation payable included in “Other current liabilities” in our condensed consolidated balance sheet. We believe the full amount of\nawarded damages will be covered by our various insurance policies. Accordingly, we also recorded a $21.8 million receivable included in “Other current\nassets” in our condensed consolidated balance sheet as of September 30, 2024. The plaintiff did not accept the reduced award by the court ordered deadline of\nOctober 10, 2023, and, as a result, the $21.8 million award has been vacated and a new trial will be scheduled. We, in conjunction with our insurance carriers,\nare challenging the initial verdict in an appellate court, and the plaintiff is cross appealing from the decision to reduce the award, among other issues, stemming\nfrom the trial. The parties are awaiting a briefing schedule from the Appellate Court.\nOn September 29, 2023 and June 5, 2024, the Company received subpoenas from the Division of Enforcement of the SEC seeking documents and information\nrelating to the Company’s operations in India, the Company's entry into a PV module supply agreement with an India-based customer, and certain aspects of\nthe Company's technology roadmap, among other things. The Company is cooperating with the SEC and cannot predict the ultimate timing, scope, or outcome\nof this matter.\nWe are party to other legal matters and claims in the normal course of our operations. While we believe the ultimate outcome of these matters and claims will\nnot have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows, the outcome of such matters and claims is not determinable\nwith certainty, and negative outcomes may adversely affect us.\n26\nTable of Contents\n11. Revenue from Contracts with Customers\nWe recognize revenue for module sales at a point in time following the transfer of control of the modules to the customer, which typically occurs upon delivery\nof the modules to the location specified in the terms of the underlying contract. Our customer contracts generally contain provisions that require us to pay the\ncustomer liquidated damages if we fail to deliver modules by scheduled dates or if we fail to deliver modules that meet certain U.S. domestic content\nrequirements. We recognize these liquidated damages as a reduction of revenue in the period we transfer control of the modules to the customer. Our customer\ncontracts also generally contain provisions that entitle us to a termination payment if the customer defaults on its contractual obligations and we terminate the\ncontract. We account for such terminations as contract modifications in the period in which the contract is terminated. We recognize revenue for bill-and-hold\narrangements at the point in time the customer obtains control of the modules when all of the following criteria have been met: (i) the arrangement is\nsubstantive, (ii) the modules are segregated and identified separately as belonging to the customer, (iii) the modules are ready for physical transfer to the\ncustomer, and (iv) we do not have the ability to use the modules or direct them to another customer.\nThe following table reflects the changes in our contract liabilities, which we classify as “Deferred revenue,” for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 (in\nthousands):\nSeptember 30, December 31,\n2024 2023 Nine Month Change\nDeferred revenue $ 1,965,381 $ 2,005,183 $ (39,802) (2)%\nDuring the nine months ended September 30, 2024, our contract liabilities decreased by $39.8 million primarily due to the recognition of revenue for sales of\nsolar modules for which payment was received in prior years, partially offset by advance payments received in the current year for future sales of solar\nmodules. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we recognized revenue of $284.0 million and $320.3 million, respectively, that was\nincluded in the corresponding contract liability balance at the beginning of the periods.\nAs of September 30, 2024, we had entered into contracts with customers for the future sale of 72.8 GW of solar modules for an aggregate transaction price of\n$21.7 billion, which we expect to recognize as revenue through 2030 as we transfer control of the modules to the customers. This volume and transaction price\nexclude contracts with customers in India for which payment has not been fully secured. This transaction price also excludes estimates of variable\nconsideration associated with (i) future module technology improvements, including enhancements to certain energy related attributes, (ii) sales freight in\nexcess of defined thresholds, (iii) changes to certain commodity prices, and (iv) the module wattage committed for delivery, among other things. As a result,\nthe revenue recognized from such contracts may increase or decrease in future periods relative to the original transaction price. These contracts may also be\nsubject to amendments as agreed to by the parties to the contract. These amendments may increase or decrease the volume of modules to be sold under the\ncontract, change delivery schedules, or otherwise adjust the expected revenue under these contracts.\nSee Note 16. “Segment Reporting” for the disaggregation of revenue by reportable segment.\n27\nTable of Contents\n12. Share-Based Compensation\nThe following table presents share-based compensation expense recognized in our condensed consolidated statements of operations for the three and nine\nmonths ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 (in thousands):\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nCost of sales $ 505 $ 1,238 $ 2,920 $ 3,513\nSelling, general and administrative 5,610 5,905 16,484 16,668\nResearch and development 677 1,047 2,603 2,959\nProduction start-up 4 8 (20) 69\nTotal share-based compensation expense $ 6,796 $ 8,198 $ 21,987 $ 23,209\nAs of September 30, 2024, we had $35.3 million of unrecognized share-based compensation expense related to unvested restricted stock and performance\nunits, which we expect to recognize over a weighted-average period of approximately 1.2 years.\nIn March 2020 and May 2021, the compensation committee of our board of directors approved grants of performance units (“PU” or “PUs”) for key executive\nofficers to be earned over multi-year performance periods, which ended in December 2022 and December 2023, respectively. Vesting of the 2020 and 2021\ngrants of PUs was contingent upon the specific attainment targets of each grant, which targets include metrics such as contracted revenue, module wattage,\nreturn on capital, cost per watt, incremental average selling price, and operating income metrics. In March 2023, the compensation committee certified the\nachievement of the vesting conditions applicable to the 2020 grants, which approximated the target level of performance. In February 2024, the compensation\ncommittee certified the achievement of the vesting conditions applicable to the 2021 grants, which approximated the maximum level of performance.\nAccordingly, each participant received one share of common stock for each vested PU granted, net of any tax withholdings.\nIn March 2022, March 2023, and March 2024, the compensation committee approved additional grants of PUs for key executive officers; such grants are\nexpected to be earned over a multi-year performance period ending in December 2024, December 2025, and December 2026, respectively. Vesting of the 2022,\n2023, and 2024 grants of PUs is contingent upon the specific attainment targets of each grant, which targets include metrics such as contracted revenue, cost\nper watt, return on capital, production, incremental average selling price, and operating margin metrics.\nVesting of PUs is also contingent upon the employment of program participants through the applicable vesting dates, with limited exceptions in case of death,\ndisability, a qualifying retirement, or a change-in-control of First Solar. Outstanding PUs are included in the computation of diluted net income per share based\non the number of shares that would be issuable if the end of the reporting period were the end of the contingency period.\n28\nTable of Contents\n13. Income Taxes\nThe Inflation Reduction Act. In August 2022, the U.S. President signed into law the IRA, which revised U.S. tax law by, among other things, including a new\ncorporate alternative minimum tax of 15% on certain large corporations, imposing a 1% excise tax on stock buybacks, and providing various incentives to\naddress climate change, including the introduction of the advanced manufacturing production credit under Section 45X of the IRC. The provisions of the IRA\nare generally effective for tax years beginning after 2022. Certain developments to technical guidance and regulations include the following:\n• In May 2023, the U.S. Treasury Department and the IRS issued initial guidance on various sections of the IRC, including Section 45X.\n• In December 2023, the U.S. Treasury Department and the IRS issued a notice of proposed rulemaking and public hearing providing initial guidance\nconfirming certain key aspects of the Section 45X credit.\n• In March 2024, the U.S. Treasury Department and the IRS issued final regulations on the direct payment election under Section 6417 of the IRC. The\nfinal regulations apply to tax years ending on or after March 11, 2024, but taxpayers may choose to apply the rules in the final regulations in taxable\nyears ending before March 11, 2024, provided the final regulations are applied in their entirety and in a consistent manner. The final regulations\nmostly adopted and confirmed the proposed regulations previously issued in June 2023.\n• In April 2024, the U.S. Treasury Department and the IRS issued final regulations on the elective transfer provisions under Section 6418 of the IRC.\nThe final regulations apply to taxable years ending on or after April 30, 2024, but taxpayers may choose to apply the rules in the final regulations in\ntaxable years ending before April 30, 2024, provided the final regulations are applied in their entirety and in a consistent manner. The final regulations\nmostly adopted and confirmed the proposed regulations previously issued in June 2023.\nGiven the complexities of the IRA, which is pending additional technical guidance and final regulations from the U.S. Treasury Department and the IRS, we\nexpect to continue to monitor these developments and evaluate their potential future impact to our results of operations.\nForeign tax credit regulations. In November 2022, the U.S. Treasury Department released proposed foreign tax credit (“FTC”) regulations addressing various\naspects of the U.S. FTC regime. Among other items, these proposed regulations provide certain exceptions for determining creditable foreign withholding\ntaxes. Taxpayers may rely on these proposed regulations, which apply to tax years beginning on or after December 28, 2021. As a result of these proposed\nregulations, foreign withholding taxes will continue to be creditable. In July 2023, the U.S. Treasury Department issued Notice 2023-55, which provides\ntemporary relief for taxpayers in determining whether a foreign tax is eligible for a foreign tax credit for taxable years beginning on or after December 28,\n2021, and ending before December 31, 2023. In December 2023, the U.S. Treasury Department issued Notice 2023-80, which extends this relief period until\nfuture guidance is issued.\nPillar Two. In December 2021, the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development released model rules for a new global minimum tax framework\n(“Pillar Two”). Certain governments in countries in which we operate have enacted local Pillar Two legislation, with an effective date from January 1, 2024.\nWe currently do not expect Pillar Two to have a material impact on our 2024 financial statements. As these legislative changes develop and expand, we expect\nto continue to monitor the changes and evaluate their potential impact to our results of operations.\n29\nTable of Contents\nOur effective tax rate was 6.4% for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. Although the effective tax rate was consistent across both periods, we\nidentified certain primary drivers, which included (i) lower excess tax benefits associated with share-based compensation and (ii) a higher inclusion percentage\nof Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income, net of the applicable Section 250 deduction, partially offset by (iii) higher income earned in low tax jurisdictions. Our\nprovision for income taxes differed from the amount computed by applying the U.S. statutory federal income tax rate of 21% primarily due to the effect of tax\nlaw changes associated with the IRA described above.\nDuring the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we reversed our position to indefinitely reinvest the accumulated earnings of a foreign subsidiary and\nrecorded discrete tax expense of approximately $6 million. There were no other changes to our indefinite reinvestment assertions during the period.\nOur Malaysian subsidiary has been granted a long-term tax holiday that expires in 2027. The tax holiday, which generally provides for a full exemption from\nMalaysian income tax, is conditional upon our continued compliance with certain employment and investment thresholds, which we are currently in\ncompliance with and expect to continue to comply with through the expiration of the tax holiday in 2027.\nOur Vietnamese subsidiary has been granted a long-term tax incentive that generally provides a full exemption from Vietnamese income tax through 2023,\nfollowed by reduced annual tax rates of 5% through 2032 and 10% through 2036. Such long-term tax incentive is conditional upon our continued compliance\nwith certain revenue and research and development (“R&D”) spending thresholds, which we are currently in compliance with and expect to continue to comply\nwith through the expiration of the tax holiday.\nWe are subject to audit by federal, state, local, and foreign tax authorities. We are currently under examination in India, Chile, Singapore, the United States, and\nthe States of Georgia and Tennessee. We believe that adequate provisions have been made for any adjustments that may result from tax examinations. However,\nthe outcome of tax examinations cannot be predicted with certainty. If any issues addressed by our tax examinations are not resolved in a manner consistent\nwith our expectations, we could be required to adjust our provision for income taxes in the period such resolution occurs.\n30\nTable of Contents\n14.

The following discussion and analysis of our business, financial condition,\nand results of operations should be read in conjunction with our condensed consolidated financial statements and the related notes thereto included in this\nQuarterly Report on Form 10-Q.\n35\nTable of Contents\nExecutive Overview\nWe are a leading American solar technology company and global provider of responsibly produced eco-efficient PV solar energy solutions. Developed at our\nR&D labs in California and Ohio, we manufacture and sell PV solar modules with an advanced thin film semiconductor technology that provide a high-\nperformance, lower-carbon and lower-water alternative to conventional crystalline silicon PV solar modules, and the smallest environmental footprint in the\nindustry. From raw material sourcing through end-of-life module recycling, we are committed to reducing the environmental impacts and enhancing the social\nand economic benefits of our products. Our PV solar modules are produced using a fully integrated, continuous process that does not rely on Chinese\ncrystalline silicon supply chains.\nWe are the world’s largest thin film PV solar module manufacturer and the largest PV solar module manufacturer in the Western Hemisphere. We recently\ncommenced operations at our fourth manufacturing facility in the United States and are in the process of expanding our manufacturing capacity, including the\nconstruction of our fifth manufacturing facility in the United States, which is expected to commence operations in the second half of 2025. With a global\nfootprint that spans the United States, India, Malaysia, and Vietnam, we expect to have an annual manufacturing capacity of over 25 GW by 2026.\nCertain of our financial results and other key operational developments for the three months ended September 30, 2024 include the following:\n• Net sales for the three months ended September 30, 2024 increased by 11% to $0.9 billion compared to $0.8 billion for the same period in 2023. The\nincrease was primarily driven by an increase in the volume of modules sold to third parties and termination payments associated with certain customer\ncontract terminations in the U.S. and India, partially offset by a current period reduction in revenue related to manufacturing issues affecting certain\nSeries 7 modules manufactured in 2023 and 2024. We currently believe the primary causes of the issues have been identified and we have taken\nactions to address such issues.\n• Gross profit as a percentage of net sales for the three months ended September 30, 2024 increased 3.2 percentage points to 50.2% from 47.0% for the\nsame period in 2023. The increase in gross profit was primarily due to termination payments associated with certain customer contract terminations in\nthe U.S. and India and a higher sales mix of modules qualifying for the advanced manufacturing production credit under Section 45X of the IRC,\npartially offset by a current period reduction in revenue related to manufacturing issues affecting certain Series 7 modules manufactured in 2023 and\n2024 and higher module storage costs.\n• During the three months ended September 30, 2024, we commenced production of Series 7 modules at our first manufacturing facility in Alabama,\nbringing our total installed nameplate production capacity across all our facilities to approximately 19.4 GW. During the three months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024, we produced 3.8 GW and sold 3.0 GW of solar modules. During 2024, we expect to produce between 15.6 GW and 15.9 GW and\nsell between 14.2 GW and 14.6 GW of solar modules.\n• In July 2024, our dedicated R&D innovation center in Ohio was formally commissioned. This R&D facility features a high-tech pilot manufacturing\nline, which is expected to enable the production of full-sized prototypes of thin film and tandem PV modules, supporting the implementation of our\ntechnology roadmap.\n36\nTable of Contents\nMarket Overview\nSolar energy is one of the fastest growing forms of renewable energy with numerous economic and environmental benefits that make it an attractive\ncomplement to or substitute for traditional forms of energy generation. Over the past decade, the cost of producing electricity from PV solar power systems has\ndecreased to levels that are competitive with or below the wholesale price of electricity in many markets. This price decline has opened new possibilities to\ndevelop systems in many locations with limited or no financial incentives, thereby promoting the widespread adoption of solar energy. Other technological\ndevelopments in the renewable energy industry, such as the advancement of energy storage capabilities, have further enhanced the prospects of solar energy as\nan alternative to traditional forms of energy generation. In addition to these economic benefits, solar energy has substantial environmental benefits. For\nexample, PV solar power systems generate no greenhouse gas or other emissions and use minimal amounts of water compared to traditional energy generation\nassets. As a result of these and other factors, worldwide solar markets continue to develop and expand.\nRecently enacted government support programs have contributed and are expected to continue to contribute to this momentum by providing solar module\nmanufacturers, project developers, and project owners with certain subsidies, such as grant funding provided by the U.S. Department of Energy, and tax\nincentives, such as tax credits available under the IRA, to accelerate the ongoing transition to clean energy. Among other things, the IRA (i) reinstates the 30%\ninvestment tax credit for qualifying solar projects that meet certain wage and apprenticeship requirements, (ii) extends the production tax credit to include\nenergy generated from solar projects, (iii) provides incremental investment and production tax credits for solar projects that meet certain domestic content and\nlocation requirements, and (iv) offers tax credits for solar modules and solar module components manufactured in the United States and sold to third parties.\nSupply and demand. As a result of the market opportunities described above, we recently commenced production of Series 7 modules at our first manufacturing\nfacility in Alabama and are in the process of expanding our manufacturing capacity, including the construction of our fifth manufacturing facility in the United\nStates, which is expected to commence operations in the second half of 2025. We continue to evaluate opportunities for future expansion worldwide. We\nbelieve manufacturers of solar cells and modules, particularly those in China, have significant installed production capacity, relative to global demand, and the\nability for additional capacity expansion. Accordingly, we believe the solar industry may experience periods of structural imbalance between supply and\ndemand, which could lead to periods of pricing volatility. Further, demand for solar energy in key markets, such as the United States, India, and Europe, may\nbe affected by the nature and extent of commitments to the renewable energy transition at the local and global levels. For example, certain large oil and gas and\nenergy companies have experienced investor pressure to pursue returns commensurate with those currently associated with fossil fuel projects. Notwithstanding\nthese considerations, utility and corporate demand for clean energy, and overall electric load growth, especially as a result of artificial intelligence-driven data\ncenter demand, continue to increase. In light of such market realities, we continue to advocate for industrial and trade policies that provide a level playing field\nfor manufacturers of solar cells and modules. We also continue to focus on our strategies and points of differentiation, which include our advanced module\ntechnology, our manufacturing process and distributed manufacturing presence, our R&D capabilities, the sustainability advantage of our modules, and our\nfinancial stability.\n37\nTable of Contents\nPricing competition. The solar industry has been characterized by intense pricing competition, both at the module and system levels. This competition may\nresult in an environment in which pricing falls rapidly, which could potentially increase demand for solar energy solutions but constrain the ability for module\nmanufacturers and project developers to sustain meaningful and consistent profitability. Our results of operations could be adversely affected if competitors\nreduce pricing below their costs, bid aggressively low prices for module sale agreements, or are able to operate at minimal or negative operating margins for\nsustained periods of time. For certain of our competitors, including many in China, these practices may be enabled by their direct or indirect access to\nsovereign capital or other forms of state support. Although module average selling prices in many global markets have declined, near-term module pricing in\nthe United States, our primary market, remains relatively stable due, in part, to the rising demand for domestically manufactured modules as a result of the\nIRA.\nDiverse offerings. We face intense competition from manufacturers of crystalline silicon solar modules and other emerging technologies. Solar module\nmanufacturers compete with one another on sales price per watt, which may be influenced by several module value attributes, including energy yield, wattage\n(through a larger form factor or an improved conversion efficiency), degradation, sustainability, and reliability. Sales price per watt may also be influenced by\nwarranty terms, customer payment terms, and/or module content attributes. We believe that utility-scale solar will continue to be a compelling offering and will\ncontinue to represent an increasing portion of the overall electricity generation mix. However, this focus on utility-scale module offerings exists within a\ncurrent market environment that includes rooftop and distributed generation solar, which may influence our future offerings.\nWe continue to devote significant resources to support the implementation of our technology roadmap and improve the energy output of our modules. In the\ncourse of our R&D activities, we explore various technologies in our efforts to sustain competitive differentiation of our modules. Such technologies include\nthe development of bifacial modules, the implementation of our CuRe program, and ongoing research and development of multi-junction solar modules.\n• Bifacial. While conventional solar modules are monofacial, meaning their ability to produce energy is a function of direct and diffuse irradiance on\ntheir front side, most module manufacturers offer bifacial modules that also capture diffuse irradiance on the back side of a module. Bifaciality\ncompromises nameplate efficiency, but by converting both front and rear side irradiance, such technology may improve the overall energy production\nof a module relative to nameplate efficiency when applied in certain applications, which could potentially lower the overall levelized cost of electricity\n(“LCOE”) of a system when compared to systems using monofacial solar modules. We recently began commercial production of bifacial solar\nmodules at certain of our manufacturing facilities and delivered our first bifacial modules to customers. Our bifacial module features an innovative\ntransparent back contact which, in addition to converting both front and rear side irradiance, allows infrared light to pass through rather than be\nabsorbed as heat. This design lowers the operational temperature of the module, resulting in a higher energy yield.\n• CuRe. Our CuRe program is intended to improve our current semiconductor structure by replacing copper with certain other elements that are\nexpected to enhance module performance by improving its bifaciality characteristics, improving its temperature coefficient, and improving its\nwarranted degradation. As a result of these performance improvements, our PV solar modules are expected to produce more energy in real world\noperating conditions over their estimated useful lives than crystalline silicon modules with the same nameplate capacity. We currently expect to\ncomplete the lead line implementation of our CuRe technology in late 2024 and intend to begin a phased replication of the technology across our fleet\nin late 2025.\n38\nTable of Contents\n• Multi-junction. We continue to evaluate opportunities to develop and leverage other solar cell technologies in multi-junction applications that combine\nour thin film PV technology with another high efficiency PV semiconductor, with each layer optimized for a different range of the solar spectrum. We\nbelieve such applications, which are expected to utilize at least one thin-film semiconductor, have the potential to significantly increase the efficiency\nof PV modules beyond the limits of traditional single-junction devices. Our acquisition of Evolar is expected to accelerate the development of high\nefficiency multi-junction devices by integrating Evolar’s expertise with First Solar’s existing R&D capabilities.\nProduct efficiencies. The efficiencies gained from the vertical integration of our manufacturing model and our continued ability to reduce costs allow us to\ncompete favorably in markets where pricing for modules and systems is highly competitive. Our cost competitiveness is based in large part on our advanced\nthin film semiconductor technology, module wattage, proprietary manufacturing process (which enables us to produce a CdTe module in a matter of hours\nusing a continuous and highly automated industrial manufacturing process, as opposed to a batch process), and focus on operational excellence. In addition, our\nCdTe modules use approximately 2% to 3% of the amount of semiconductor material that is used to manufacture conventional crystalline silicon solar\nmodules. The cost of polysilicon is a significant driver of the manufacturing cost of crystalline silicon solar modules, and the timing and rate of change in the\ncost of silicon feedstock and polysilicon could lead to changes in solar module pricing levels.\nEnergy performance. In many climates our solar modules provide certain energy production advantages relative to competing crystalline silicon solar modules.\nFor example, our CdTe solar technology provides:\n• a superior temperature coefficient, which results in stronger system performance in typical high insolation climates as the majority of a system’s\ngeneration, on average, occurs when module temperatures are well above 25°C (standard test conditions);\n• a superior spectral response in humid environments where atmospheric moisture alters the solar spectrum relative to standard test conditions;\n• a better partial shading response than competing crystalline silicon technologies, which may experience significantly lower energy generation than\nCdTe solar technologies when partial shading occurs; and\n• an immunity to cell cracking and its resulting power output loss, a common failure often observed in crystalline silicon modules caused by poor\nmanufacturing, handling, weather, or other conditions.\nIn addition to these technological advantages, we warrant that our solar modules will produce at least 98% of their labeled power output rating during the first\nyear, with the warranty coverage reducing by a degradation factor between 0.3% and 0.5%, depending on the module series, every year thereafter throughout\nthe limited power output warranty period of up to 30 years. As a result of these and other factors, our solar modules can produce more annual energy in real\nworld operating conditions than conventional crystalline silicon modules with the same nameplate capacity.\nWhile our modules are generally competitive in cost, reliability, and performance attributes, there can be no guarantee such competitiveness will continue to\nexist in the future to the same extent or at all. Any declines in the competitiveness of our products could result in further declines in the average selling prices\nof our modules and additional margin compression. Accordingly, we continue to focus on enhancing the competitiveness of our solar modules through our\nmodule technology and cost reduction roadmaps.\n39\nTable of Contents\nCertain Trends and Uncertainties\nWe believe that our business, financial condition, and results of operations may be favorably or unfavorably impacted by the following trends and uncertainties.\nSee Item 1A. “Risk Factors” of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 for discussions of other risks (the “Risk Factors”) that\nmay affect us.\nOur business is evolving worldwide and is shaped by the varying ways in which our offerings can be compelling and economically viable solutions to energy\nneeds in various markets. In addressing electricity demands, we are focused on providing utility-scale module offerings in key geographic markets that we\nbelieve have a significant need for mass-scale PV solar electricity, including markets throughout the United States, India, and Europe. We closely evaluate and\nmonitor the appropriate level of resources required to support such markets and their associated sales opportunities. When deployed in utility-scale\napplications, our modules provide energy at a lower LCOE compared to traditional forms of energy generation, making them an attractive alternative to or\nreplacement for aging fossil fuel-based generation resources. Accordingly, future retirements of aging energy generation resources represent a significant\nincrease in the potential market for solar energy.\nDemand for our PV solar module offerings depends, in part, on market factors outside our control. For example, many governments have proposed or enacted\npolicies or support programs intended to encourage renewable energy investments to achieve decarbonization objectives and/or establish greater energy\nindependence. While we compete in markets that do not require solar-specific government subsidies or support programs, our net sales and profits remain\nsubject to variability based on the availability and size of government subsidies and economic incentives. Adverse changes in these factors could increase the\ncost of utility-scale systems, which could reduce demand for our solar modules. Recent developments to government support programs include the following:\n• United States. In August 2022, the U.S. President signed the IRA into law, which is intended to accelerate the country’s ongoing transition to clean\nenergy. Among other things, the financial incentives provided by the IRA have significantly increased demand for modules manufactured in the\nUnited States. Accordingly, the demand for these solar modules is expected to increase domestic manufacturing in the near term, which may result in\nlocalized supply chain constraints and periods of inflationary pricing for certain of our key raw materials. The financial incentives provided by the\nIRA have also increased demand for solar modules in general due to the incremental tax credit available for the qualified production of clean hydrogen\nthat is powered by renewable resources. There are currently several critical and complex aspects of the IRA pending further technical guidance and\nfinal regulations from the IRS and the U.S. Treasury Department. Given the complexities of the IRA, we continue to evaluate the extent of benefits\navailable to us, which we expect will favorably impact our results of operations in future periods. For example, we currently expect to qualify for the\nadvanced manufacturing production credit under Section 45X of the IRC, which provides certain specified benefits for solar modules and solar\nmodule components manufactured in the United States and sold to third parties. See Note 5. “Government Grants” and Note 13. “Income Taxes” to\nour condensed consolidated financial statements for discussion of our expectation of the financial benefits available to us under the IRA and\ndevelopments to technical guidance and regulations, respectively.\n• United States. In September 2023, the U.S. Department of Energy Solar Energy Technologies Office (“SETO”) announced the Advancing U.S. Thin-\nFilm Solar Photovoltaics Funding Opportunity, which provides up to $44 million for qualifying solar R&D projects related to CdTe development and\nthe manufacturing of perovskite tandem PV products. In May 2024, SETO announced the award recipients for this funding opportunity, which\nincluded two of our R&D projects. These grants are intended to accelerate and expand domestic solar R&D to strengthen U.S. solar manufacturing\nand contribute to renewable energy targets.\n40\nTable of Contents\n• India. In March 2023, the government of India allocated financial incentives under the Production Linked Incentive (“PLI”) scheme to certain PV\nmodule manufacturers, including First Solar. The PLI scheme is expected to provide aggregate funding of INR 185 billion ($2.2 billion), of which\nINR 11.8 billion ($141 million) was allocated to First Solar, to promote the manufacturing of high efficiency solar modules in India and to reduce\nIndia’s dependency on foreign imports of solar modules. Under the PLI scheme, manufacturers were selected through a competitive bid process and\nmay be entitled to receive certain cash incentives over a five-year period following the commissioning of their manufacturing facilities. Among other\nthings, such incentives are subject to attaining certain minimum thresholds for module efficiency and temperature coefficient and require that a certain\nproportion of raw materials be sourced from the domestic market. Such conditions will be evaluated on a quarterly basis from 2026 through 2031. At\nthis time, it is uncertain to what extent we may qualify for such incentives.\nDemand for our solar energy solutions also depends on domestic or international trade policies and government regulations, which may be proposed, revised,\nand/or enacted across short- and long-term time horizons with varying degrees of impact to our net sales, profit, and manufacturing operations. Changes in\nthese policies and regulations could adversely impact the competitive landscape of solar markets, which could reduce demand for our solar modules. Recent\nrevisions or proposed changes to trade policy and government regulations include the following:\n• United States. The United States currently imposes antidumping and countervailing duties (“AD/CVDs”) on certain imported crystalline silicon PV\ncells and modules from China and Taiwan. Such AD/CVDs can change over time pursuant to annual reviews conducted by the U.S. Department of\nCommerce (“USDOC”), and a decline in duty rates or the USDOC’s failure to fully enforce U.S. AD/CVD laws could have an adverse impact on our\noperating results. In August 2023, the USDOC issued final affirmative circumvention rulings, finding that solar panels completed in Cambodia,\nMalaysia, Thailand, and Vietnam using parts and components produced in China circumvent the pre-existing AD/CVD orders on China. Such duties\napply to circumventing imports on or after June 6, 2024, as well as any circumventing imports prior to that date that are not used or installed on or\nbefore December 3, 2024. Our operating results could be adversely impacted if the USDOC and other U.S. government agencies do not enforce the\naffirmative circumvention rulings as expected or if pending litigation challenges result in a modification of the rulings. Conversely, effective\nenforcement could positively impact our operating results.\n• United States. In October 2023, a coalition of U.S. aluminum extruders and a labor union filed AD/CVD petitions with the USDOC and the U.S.\nInternational Trade Commission (“USITC”) related to aluminum extrusions from 15 countries. The USDOC and USITC have initiated investigations\nbased on the petitions. We import certain items that appear to be within the scope of the investigations. The USITC issued affirmative preliminary\nAD/CVD determinations in November 2023, and its final AD/CVD determinations are expected to be announced on October 30, 2024. The USDOC\nissued preliminary and final AD determinations in May and September 2024, respectively, both of which found that our Malaysian supplier of\naluminum extrusions was not dumping.\n• United States. In April 2024, the American Alliance for Solar Manufacturing Trade Committee, which includes First Solar, filed a set of AD/CVD\npetitions with the USDOC and the USITC to impose duties on certain unfairly traded solar products from Cambodia, Malaysia, Thailand, and\nVietnam. The investigations could potentially lead to the imposition of AD/CVD orders on such solar products. In June 2024, the USITC issued\naffirmative preliminary determinations. In early October 2024, the USDOC announced preliminary affirmative determinations in the CVD\ninvestigations, finding that silicon solar cells and panels from Cambodia, Malaysia, Thailand, and Vietnam are unfairly subsidized at rates ranging\nfrom de minimis to nearly 300%, depending on the particular foreign producer. The USDOC has imposed provisional CVDs accordingly. The USDOC\nis expected to announce preliminary determinations in the AD investigations in November 2024.\n41\nTable of Contents\n• India. The Approved List of Models and Manufacturers (“ALMM”) was introduced in 2021 as a non-tariff barrier to incentivize local manufacturing\nof PV modules by approving the list of models and manufacturers who can participate in certain solar development projects. The ALMM is approved\nby the Ministry of New and Renewable Energy, and any modifications to the list and its application may affect future investments in solar module\nmanufacturing in India. In April 2024, the government of India reimposed the ALMM, thereby requiring solar project developers to procure qualifying\nmodules from companies on the list, which includes our Indian manufacturing facility. Our operating results could be adversely impacted if the\nALMM requirements are significantly relaxed to allow modules to be imported from other countries. Also in April 2024, the ALMM was amended to\ninclude specific minimum conversion efficiency thresholds for CdTe solar technologies starting at 18% for solar lighting, 18.5% for rooftop\napplications, and 19% for utility-scale applications.\nOur ability to provide solar modules on economically attractive terms is also affected by the availability and cost of logistics services associated with the\nprocurement of raw materials or equipment used in our manufacturing process and the shipping, handling, storage, and distribution of our modules. To mitigate\ncertain logistics costs, we employ commercial contract structures that provide additional consideration to us if the cost of logistics services, excluding\ndemurrage and detention, exceeds defined thresholds. We may also adjust our shipping plans to include additional lead times for module deliveries and/or\nutilize our network of U.S. distribution centers to mitigate logistics costs. Additionally, our manufacturing capacity expansions are expected to bring production\nactivities closer to customer demand, further mitigating our exposure to the cost of ocean freight.\nWe generally price and sell our solar modules on a per watt basis. As of September 30, 2024, we had entered into contracts with customers for the future sale of\n72.8 GW of solar modules for an aggregate transaction price of $21.7 billion, which we expect to recognize as revenue through 2030 as we transfer control of\nthe modules to our customers. This volume and transaction price exclude contracts with customers in India for which payment has not been fully secured. This\nvolume includes contracts for the sale of 37.3 GW of solar modules with anticipated price adjustments for future module technology improvements, including\nenhancements to certain energy related attributes. Based on these potential improvements, the contracted module volume as of September 30, 2024, the\nexpected timing such improvements being incorporated into our manufacturing process, and the expected timing of module deliveries, such adjustments, if\nrealized, could result in additional revenue of up to $0.7 billion, the majority of which would be recognized between 2026 and 2028. In addition to these price\nadjustments, certain of our contracts with customers may include favorable price adjustments associated with sales freight in excess of defined thresholds\nand/or favorable or unfavorable price adjustments associated with changes to (i) certain commodity prices, (ii) the module wattage committed for delivery, and\n(iii) the volume of modules sold that meet certain U.S. domestic content requirements. As a result, the revenue recognized from such contracts may increase or\ndecrease in future periods relative to the original transaction price.\nWe monitor our modules’ expected performance through quality and reliability testing, as well as actual performance in certain field installation sites. Any\ndeclines in the expected performance attributes of our modules could adversely impact our financial results due to declines in the average selling prices of our\nmodules and additional margin compression. For example, the recently identified manufacturing issues affecting certain Series 7 modules may adversely\nimpact the average selling prices of our modules or the carrying value of our inventories. These manufacturing issues may also increase product warranty\nclaims by our customers to resolve the premature power loss in affected modules. The remediation of any identified issues in our manufacturing process may\nresult in increased costs as we resolve the identified issues. Any future manufacturing issues, including any additional commitment made by us to remediate the\naffected modules beyond our limited warranty, could also adversely impact our reputation, financial position, operating results, and cash flows. We may also be\nsubject to certain other risks and uncertainties surrounding module performance as described in Item 1A. “Risk Factors – Problems with product quality or\nperformance may cause us to incur significant and/or unexpected contractual damages and/or warranty and related expenses, damage our market reputation,\nand prevent us from maintaining or increasing our market share.”\n42\nTable of Contents\nWe continue to increase the nameplate production capacity of our existing manufacturing facilities by improving our production throughput, increasing module\nwattage, and reducing manufacturing yield losses. Additionally, we are in the process of expanding our manufacturing capacity by approximately 5.8 GW,\nincluding the construction of our fifth manufacturing facility in the United States, as well as capacity expansion at our existing facilities. This additional\ncapacity, and any other potential investments to add to or otherwise modify our existing manufacturing capacity in response to market demand and competition,\nmay require significant internal and possibly external sources of capital, and may be subject to certain risks and uncertainties described in Item 1A. “Risk\nFactors” of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.\nResults of Operations\nThe following table sets forth our condensed consolidated statements of operations as a percentage of net sales for the three and nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024 and 2023:\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nNet sales 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 %\nCost of sales 49.8 % 53.0 % 52.1 % 63.0 %\nGross profit 50.2 % 47.0 % 47.9 % 37.0 %\nSelling, general and administrative 5.2 % 6.3 % 5.2 % 6.5 %\nResearch and development 5.7 % 5.1 % 5.4 % 5.0 %\nProduction start-up 3.0 % 1.5 % 2.6 % 2.5 %\nLitigation loss — % — % — % 1.6 %\nGain on sales of businesses, net — % — % — % — %\nOperating income 36.3 % 34.1 % 34.8 % 21.3 %\nForeign currency loss, net (0.6)% (0.1)% (0.7)% (0.5)%\nInterest income 2.5 % 2.9 % 2.8 % 3.4 %\nInterest expense, net (1.0)% (0.5)% (1.0)% (0.3)%\nOther expense, net (0.3)% (0.1)% (0.2)% (0.1)%\nIncome tax expense (1.6)% (2.8)% (2.3)% (1.5)%\nNet income 35.3 % 33.5 % 33.4 % 22.3 %\nSegment Overview\nOur primary segment is our modules business, which involves the design, manufacture, and sale of CdTe solar modules, which convert sunlight into electricity.\nThird-party customers of our modules segment include system developers, independent power producers, utilities, commercial and industrial companies, and\nother system owners and operators. Our residual business operations include certain project development activities, O&M services, the results of operations\nfrom PV solar power systems we owned and operated in certain international regions, and the sale of such systems to third-party customers.\nNet sales\nWe generally price and sell our solar modules on a per watt basis. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we sold the majority of our\nsolar modules to developers and operators of systems in the United States, and substantially all of our modules business sales were denominated in U.S. dollars.\nWe recognize revenue for module sales at a point in time following the transfer of control of the modules to the customer, which typically occurs upon delivery\nof the modules to the location specified in the terms of the underlying contract. Net sales from our residual business operations primarily consists of revenue\nrecognized for sales of development projects or completed systems, including any modules installed in such systems and any revenue from energy generated by\nsuch systems.\n43\nTable of Contents\nThe following table shows net sales by reportable segment for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023:\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, September 30,\n(Dollars in thousands) 2024 2023 Three Month Change 2024 2023 Nine Month Change\nModules $ 886,655 $ 800,393 $ 86,262 11 % $ 2,688,854 $ 2,139,220 $ 549,634 26 %\nOther 1,013 697 316 45 % 3,404 20,829 (17,425) (84)%\nNet sales $ 887,668 $ 801,090 $ 86,578 11 % $ 2,692,258 $ 2,160,049 $ 532,209 25 %\nNet sales increased $86.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023 primarily due to a\n9% increase in the volume of modules sold to third parties and termination payments of $72.3 million associated with certain customer contract terminations in\nthe U.S. and India, partially offset by a current period reduction in revenue of approximately $50 million related to manufacturing issues affecting certain\nSeries 7 modules manufactured in 2023 and 2024.\nNet sales increased $532.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 primarily due to a\n21% increase in the volume of modules sold to third parties and an increase in termination payments of $93.4 million associated with certain customer contract\nterminations in the U.S. and India, partially offset by approximately $50 million for the manufacturing issues discussed above and the recognition of contingent\nearnouts in the previous period for historical project sales related to our residual business operations.\nCost of sales\nOur modules business cost of sales includes the cost of raw materials and components for manufacturing solar modules, such as glass, transparent conductive\ncoatings, CdTe and other thin film semiconductors, laminate materials, connector assemblies, edge seal materials, and frames or back rails. In addition, our cost\nof sales includes direct labor for the manufacturing of solar modules and manufacturing overhead, such as engineering, equipment maintenance, quality and\nproduction control, and information technology. Our cost of sales also includes depreciation of manufacturing plant and equipment, facility-related expenses,\nenvironmental health and safety costs, and costs associated with shipping, warranties, and solar module collection and recycling (excluding accretion). Cost of\nsales for our residual business operations includes project-related costs, such as development costs (legal, consulting, transmission upgrade, interconnection,\npermitting, and other similar costs), EPC costs (consisting primarily of solar modules, inverters, electrical and mounting hardware, project management and\nengineering, and construction labor), and site-specific costs.\nThe following table shows cost of sales by reportable segment for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023:\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, September 30,\n(Dollars in thousands) 2024 2023 Three Month Change 2024 2023 Nine Month Change\nModules $ 438,274 $ 433,034 $ 5,240 1 % $ 1,395,972 $ 1,363,050 $ 32,922 2 %\nOther 4,083 (8,119) 12,202 N/A 6,083 (1,647) 7,730 N/A\nCost of sales $ 442,357 $ 424,915 $ 17,442 4 % $ 1,402,055 $ 1,361,403 $ 40,652 3 %\n% of net sales 49.8 % 53.0 % 52.1 % 63.0 %\n44\nTable of Contents\nCost of sales increased $17.4 million, or 4%, and decreased 3.2 percentage points as a percent of net sales for the three months ended September 30, 2024\ncompared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in cost of sales was driven by a $5.2 million increase in our modules segment cost of\nsales primarily due to (i) higher costs of $47.3 million due to an increase in the volume of modules sold and (ii) higher module storage costs of $22.6 million.\nThese increases were partially offset by (iii) a higher sales mix of modules qualifying for the advanced manufacturing production credit under Section 45X of\nthe IRC, which decreased cost of sales by $60.4 million. The increase in cost of sales was also driven by (iv) a $12.2 million increase in our residual business\noperations’ cost of sales primarily due to a favorable prior period settlement with a former supplier, which resulted in an $8.4 million benefit to cost of sales.\nCost of sales increased $40.7 million, or 3%, and decreased 10.9 percentage points as a percent of net sales for the nine months ended September 30, 2024\ncompared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in cost of sales was driven by a $32.9 million increase in our modules segment cost of\nsales primarily due to (i) higher costs of $309.9 million due to an increase in the volume of modules sold and (ii) higher module storage costs of $66.5 million.\nThese increases were partially offset by (iii) the recognition of the above-mentioned advanced manufacturing production credit, which decreased cost of sales\nby $288.3 million, (iv) lower sales freight of $36.1 million, and (v) lower production ramp costs of $30.0 million. The increase in cost of sales was also driven\nby (vi) a $7.7 million increase in our residual business operations’ cost of sales as operations continue to wind down.\nGross profit\nGross profit may be affected by numerous factors, including the selling prices of our modules and the selling prices of projects and services included in our\nresidual business operations, our manufacturing costs, the capacity utilization of our manufacturing facilities, and foreign exchange rates.

There were no other changes to our indefinite reinvestment assertions\nduring the period.\n48\nTable of Contents\nIncome tax expense decreased $7.7 million during the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023\nprimarily due to higher prior period losses in certain jurisdictions for which no tax benefit could be recorded, partially offset by higher pretax income and the\neffect of tax law changes associated with the proposed FTC regulations.\nIncome tax expense increased $28.0 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023\nprimarily due to higher pretax income, lower excess tax benefits associated with share-based compensation, and the discrete tax expense associated with the\nreversal of our indefinite reinvestment assertion described above, partially offset by higher prior period losses in certain jurisdictions for which no tax benefit\ncould be recorded.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nIn preparing our condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP, we make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts of\nreported assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses, as well as the disclosure of contingent liabilities. Some of our accounting policies require the application of\nsignificant judgment in the selection of the appropriate assumptions for making these estimates. By their nature, these judgments are subject to an inherent\ndegree of uncertainty. We base our judgments and estimates on our historical experience, our forecasts, and other available information as appropriate. We\nbelieve the judgments and estimates involved in accrued solar module collection and recycling, product warranties, and government grants have the greatest\npotential impact on our condensed consolidated financial statements. The actual results experienced by us may differ materially and adversely from our\nestimates. To the extent there are material differences between our estimates and the actual results, our future results of operations will be affected. For a\ndescription of the accounting policies that require the most significant judgment and estimates in the preparation of our condensed consolidated financial\nstatements, refer to our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. There have been no material changes to our accounting policies\nduring the nine months ended September 30, 2024.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nIn December 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2023-09, Income Taxes (Topic 740) —\nImprovements to Income Tax Disclosures, which requires greater disaggregation of an entity’s income tax disclosures. Among other things, ASU 2023-09\nrequires entities to disclose (i) specific categories in the effective tax rate reconciliation, (ii) pretax income or loss from continuing operations, separated\nbetween domestic and foreign jurisdictions, (iii) income tax expense or benefit from continuing operations, separated by federal, state, and foreign\njurisdictions, and (iv) income taxes paid to federal, state, and foreign jurisdictions. ASU 2023-09 is effective for public companies for annual periods beginning\nafter December 15, 2024; although early adoption is permitted, we do not intend to do so. We are currently evaluating the impact ASU 2023-09 will have on\nour consolidated financial statements and associated disclosures.\n49\nTable of Contents\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nAs of September 30, 2024, we believe that our cash, cash equivalents, marketable securities, cash flows from operating activities, and contracts with customers\nfor the future sale of solar modules will be sufficient to meet our working capital and capital expenditure needs for at least the next 12 months. In addition, we\nhave availability under our Revolving Credit Facility, which is unused as of September 30, 2024. As necessary, we also believe we will have adequate access to\nthe capital markets. We monitor our working capital to ensure we have adequate liquidity, both domestically and internationally. We intend to maintain\nappropriate debt levels based upon cash flow expectations, our overall cost of capital, and expected cash requirements for operations, including near-term\nconstruction activities and purchases of manufacturing equipment for our newest manufacturing facilities in the United States. However, our ability to raise\ncapital on terms commercially acceptable to us could be constrained if there is insufficient lender or investor interest due to company-specific, industry-wide,\nor broader market concerns. Any incremental debt financing could result in increased debt service expenses and/or restrictive covenants, which could limit our\nability to pursue our strategic plans.\nAs of September 30, 2024, we had $1.3 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities compared to $2.1 billion as of December 31, 2023. This\ndecrease was primarily driven by purchases of property, plant and equipment for our U.S. and Indian facilities, various operating expenditures, and certain\nadvance payments for raw materials, partially offset by proceeds from the sale of Section 45X tax credits and net cash receipts from module sales. As of\nSeptember 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, $0.5 billion and $1.2 billion of our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities, respectively, was held by\nour foreign subsidiaries and was primarily based in U.S. dollar denominated holdings. Our investment policy seeks to preserve our investment principal and\nmaintain adequate liquidity to meet our cash flow requirements, while at the same time optimizing the return on our investments. Such policy applies to all\ninvested funds, whether managed internally or externally. Pursuant to such policy, we place our investments with a diversified group of high-quality financial\ninstitutions and limit the concentration of such investments with any one counterparty. We place significant emphasis on the creditworthiness of financial\ninstitutions and assess the credit ratings and financial health of our counterparty financial institutions when making investment decisions.\nWe utilize a variety of tax planning and financing strategies in an effort to ensure that our worldwide cash is available in the locations in which it is needed. If\ncertain international funds were needed for our operations in the United States, we may be required to accrue and pay certain U.S. and foreign taxes to\nrepatriate such funds. We maintain the intent and ability to permanently reinvest our accumulated earnings outside the United States, with the exception of\ncertain subsidiaries for which applicable income taxes have been recorded as of September 30, 2024. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we\nreversed our position to indefinitely reinvest the accumulated earnings of a foreign subsidiary, allowing us to repatriate $1.0 billion of offshore funds to support\nour strategic investments in the United States. Our worldwide cash may also be affected by changes to foreign government banking regulations that restrict our\nability to move funds among various jurisdictions under certain circumstances, which could negatively impact our access to capital, resulting in an adverse\neffect on our liquidity and capital resources.\nAlthough we compete in markets that do not require solar-specific government subsidies or support programs, such incentives continue to influence the\ndemand for PV solar energy around the world. For example, the financial incentives provided by the IRA are expected to increase both the demand for, and the\ndomestic manufacturing of, solar modules in the United States. We continue to evaluate the extent of benefits available to us by the IRA, which are expected to\nfavorably impact our liquidity and capital resources in future periods. For example, we currently expect to qualify for the advanced manufacturing production\ncredit under Section 45X of the IRC, which provides certain specified benefits for solar modules and solar module components manufactured in the United\nStates and sold to third parties. Such credit may be refundable by the IRS or transferable to a third party and is available from 2023 to 2032, subject to phase\ndown beginning in 2030. Based on the current form factor of our modules, we expect to qualify for a credit of approximately 17 cents per watt for each module\nproduced in the United States and sold to a third party. Accordingly, we expect the advanced manufacturing production credit will provide us with a significant\n50\nTable of Contents\nsource of funding throughout its 10-year period. In December 2023, we entered into an agreement with Fiserv for the sale of $687.2 million of Section 45X tax\ncredits we generated during 2023 for aggregate cash proceeds of $659.7 million. We received the full cash proceeds during the nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024. For more information about certain risks associated with the benefits available to us under the IRA, see Item 1A. “Risk Factors” of our\nAnnual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. See Note 5. “Government Grants” to our condensed consolidated financial statements for\nfurther information about government grants.\nAs a result of various market opportunities and increased demand for our products, we commenced production of Series 7 modules at our third manufacturing\nfacility in Ohio and our first manufacturing facility in India during 2023 and at our first manufacturing facility in Alabama during the three months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024. We are in the process of expanding our manufacturing capacity, including the construction of our fifth manufacturing facility in the United\nStates, which is expected to commence operations in the second half of 2025. We anticipate our remaining investment in this U.S. facility to be approximately\n$0.9 billion, which is expected to be incurred throughout 2024 and 2025. The capital expenditures necessary to expand our capacity may be financed, in part,\nby cash on hand, advance payments from customers for module sales in future periods, the advanced manufacturing production credit described above, and/or\nnear-term bridge financing instruments.\nIn addition to the expansion described above, we continue to increase the nameplate production capacity of our existing manufacturing facilities by improving\nour production throughput, increasing module wattage, and reducing manufacturing yield losses. We have a demonstrated history of innovation, continuous\nimprovement, and manufacturing success driven by our significant investments in various R&D initiatives. We continue to invest significant financial resources\nin such initiatives, including the completion of a dedicated R&D innovation center in the United States to support the implementation of our technology\nroadmap. This facility features a high-tech pilot manufacturing line, which is expected to enable the production of full-sized prototypes of thin film and tandem\nPV modules. Such R&D facility was commissioned in July 2024. During 2024, we expect to spend approximately $1.6 billion for capital expenditures,\nincluding the new facilities mentioned above, and upgrades to machinery and equipment that we believe will further increase our module wattage and expand\ncapacity and throughput at our facilities. These capital investments, and any other potential investments to implement our technology roadmap, may require\nsignificant internal and possibly external sources of capital, and may be subject to certain risks and uncertainties described in Item 1A. “Risk Factors” of our\nAnnual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.\nWe have also committed and expect to continue to commit significant working capital to purchase various raw materials used in our module manufacturing\nprocess. Our failure to obtain raw materials and components that meet our quality, quantity, and cost requirements in a timely manner could interrupt or impair\nour ability to manufacture our solar modules or increase our manufacturing costs. Accordingly, we may enter into long-term supply agreements to mitigate\npotential risks related to the procurement of key raw materials and components, and such agreements may be noncancelable or cancelable with a significant\npenalty. For example, we have entered into long-term supply agreements for the purchase of certain specified minimum volumes of substrate glass and cover\nglass for our PV solar modules. We have the right to terminate certain of these agreements upon payment of specified termination penalties (which, in\naggregate, are up to $503.5 million as of September 30, 2024 and decline over the remaining supply periods). Additionally, for certain strategic suppliers, we\nhave made, and may in the future be required to make, certain advance payments to secure the raw materials necessary for our module manufacturing.\nWe have also committed certain financial resources to fulfill our solar module collection and recycling obligations and have established a trust under which\nthese funds are put into custodial accounts with an established and reputable bank. As of September 30, 2024, such funds were comprised of restricted\nmarketable securities of $211.1 million and associated restricted cash and cash equivalents balances of $4.5 million. As of September 30, 2024, our module\ncollection and recycling liability was $139.0 million. Trust funds may be disbursed for qualified module collection and recycling costs (including capital and\nfacility related recycling costs), payments to customers for assuming collection and recycling obligations, and reimbursements of any overfunded amounts.\nInvestments in the trust must meet certain investment quality criteria comparable to highly rated government or\n51\nTable of Contents\nagency bonds. As necessary, we adjust the funded amounts for our estimated collection and recycling obligations based on the estimated costs of collecting and\nrecycling covered modules, estimated rates of return on our restricted marketable securities, and an estimated solar module life of 25 years, less amounts\nalready funded in prior years.\nAs of September 30, 2024, we had no off-balance sheet debt or similar obligations, other than financial assurance related instruments, which are not classified\nas debt. We do not guarantee any third-party debt. See Note 10. “Commitments and Contingencies” to our condensed consolidated financial statements for\nfurther information about our financial assurance related instruments.\nCash Flows\nThe following table summarizes key cash flow activity for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 (in thousands):\nNine Months Ended\nSeptember 30,\n2024 2023\nNet cash provided by operating activities $ 407,003 $ 41,151\nNet cash used in investing activities (1,341,921) (299,630)\nNet cash (used in) provided by financing activities (5,879) 276,114\nEffect of exchange rate changes on cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash, and restricted cash equivalents (2,805) (855)\nNet (decrease) increase in cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash, and restricted cash equivalents $ (943,602) $ 16,780\nOperating Activities\nThe increase in net cash provided by operating activities was primarily driven by proceeds from the sale of Section 45X tax credits and higher cash receipts\nfrom module sales in the current period, partially offset by an increase in payments made to suppliers compared to the prior period.\nInvesting Activities\nThe increase in net cash used in investing activities was primarily due to lower proceeds from the sales and maturities of marketable securities in the current\nperiod and higher purchases of property, plant and equipment in the current period for our U.S. and Indian facilities, partially offset by lower purchases of\nmarketable securities and restricted marketable securities in the current period.\nFinancing Activities\nThe decrease in net cash provided by financing activities was primarily due to repayment of debt in the current period.\nItem 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk\nThere have been no material changes to the information previously provided under Item 7A. of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2023.\n52\nTable of Contents\nItem 4. Controls and Procedures\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nWe carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial\nOfficer, of the effectiveness of our “disclosure controls and procedures” as defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e). Based on that evaluation,\nour Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that as of September 30, 2024 our disclosure controls and procedures were effective to\nensure that information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and\nreported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including\nour Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.\nChanges in Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nWe also carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial\nOfficer, of our “internal control over financial reporting” as defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) to determine whether any changes in our\ninternal control over financial reporting occurred during the three months ended September 30, 2024 that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to\nmaterially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. Based on that evaluation, there were no such changes in our internal control over financial\nreporting that occurred during the three months ended September 30, 2024.\nCEO and CFO Certifications\nWe have attached as exhibits to this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q the certifications of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, which are\nrequired in accordance with the Exchange Act. We recommend that this Item 4. be read in conjunction with those certifications for a more complete\nunderstanding of the subject matter presented.\nLimitations on the Effectiveness of Controls\nControl systems, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the control systems’ objectives are being\nmet. Further, the design of any system of controls must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of all controls must be considered\nrelative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues\nand instances of fraud, if any, within our company have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be\nfaulty and that breakdowns can occur because of error or mistake. Control systems can also be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by\ncollusion of two or more people, or by management override of the controls. The design of any system of controls is also based in part upon certain\nassumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential\nfuture conditions. Over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or deterioration in the degree of compliance with policies or\nprocedures.\n53\nTable of Contents\nPART II. OTHER INFORMATION\nItem 1. Legal Proceedings\nSee Note 10. “Commitments and Contingencies” under the heading “Legal Proceedings” of our condensed consolidated financial statements for legal\nproceedings and related matters.\nItem 1A. Risk Factors\nIn addition to the other information set forth in this report, you should carefully consider the factors discussed in Item 1A. “Risk Factors” of our Annual Report\non Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, which could materially affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. The\nrisks described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K are not the only risks we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we\ncurrently consider immaterial may also materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. Except for the risk\nfactor set forth below, there have been no material changes in the risk factors contained in our Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nProblems with product quality or performance may cause us to incur significant and/or unexpected contractual damages and/or warranty and related\nexpenses, damage our market reputation, and prevent us from maintaining or increasing our market share.\nWe perform a variety of module quality and life tests under different environmental conditions upon which we base our assessments of future module\nperformance over the duration of the warranty. However, if our thin film solar modules perform below expectations, we could experience significant warranty\nand related expenses, damage to our market reputation, and erosion of our market share. With respect to our modules, we provide a limited warranty covering\ndefects in materials and workmanship under normal use and service conditions for up to 12.5 years. We also typically warrant that modules installed in\naccordance with agreed-upon specifications will produce at least 98% of their labeled power output rating during the first year, with the warranty coverage\nreducing by a degradation factor every year thereafter throughout the limited power output warranty period of up to 30 years. Among other things, our solar\nmodule warranty also covers the resulting power output loss from cell cracking.\nWe have identified manufacturing issues affecting certain Series 7 modules manufactured in 2023 and 2024 that may cause the modules to experience\npremature power loss once installed in the field. We currently believe the primary causes of the issues have been identified and we have taken actions to\naddress such issues. The ultimate loss we will incur for these manufacturing issues will depend on the extent of the premature power loss that is experienced in\nrelation to the obligations under our limited product warranties, as well as any additional commitments we may make to remediate the affected modules. Based\non currently available information and certain assumptions and estimates, we believe a reasonable estimate of the aggregate losses related to these\nmanufacturing issues will range from approximately $50 million to $100 million. At this time, no individual amount within that range is a better estimate than\nany other amount. Accordingly, we increased our product warranty liability by the low end of the range. The estimated range set forth above was based on our\nevaluation of the currently available information, including select samples of module performance data from several locations, the estimated number of\naffected modules, and projections of probable costs to remediate the issues. If any of our estimates or assumptions related to the above referenced\nmanufacturing issues are not accurate, we may be required to accrue additional expenses, which could adversely impact our reputation, financial position,\noperating results, and cash flows.\nIf any of the other assumptions used in estimating our module warranties prove incorrect, we may also be required to accrue additional expenses, which could\nadversely impact our financial position, operating results, and cash flows. Although we have taken significant precautions to avoid future manufacturing issues\nfrom occurring, any manufacturing issues, including any additional commitments made by us to take remediation actions in respect of affected modules beyond\nthe stated remedies in our warranties, could also adversely impact our reputation, financial position, operating results, and cash flows.\n54\nTable of Contents\nAlthough our module performance warranties extend for up to 30 years, our oldest solar modules manufactured during the qualification of our pilot production\nline have only been in use since 2001. Accordingly, our warranties are based on a variety of quality and life tests that enable predictions of durability and future\nperformance. These predictions, however, could prove to be materially different from the actual performance during the warranty period, causing us to incur\nsubstantial expense to repair or replace defective solar modules or provide financial remuneration in the future. For example, our solar modules could suffer\nvarious failures, including breakage, delamination, corrosion, or performance degradation in excess of expectations, and our manufacturing operations or\nsupply chain could be subject to material or process variations that could cause affected modules to fail or underperform compared to our expectations. These\nrisks could be amplified as we implement design and process changes in connection with our efforts to improve our products and module wattage as part of our\nlong-term strategic plans. In addition, if we increase the number of installations in extreme climates, we may experience increased failure rates due to\ndeployment into such field conditions. Any widespread product failures may damage our market reputation, cause our net sales to decline, require us to repair\nor replace the defective modules or provide financial remuneration, and result in us taking voluntary remedial measures beyond those required by our standard\nwarranty terms to enhance customer satisfaction, which could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, financial position, operating results, and cash\nflows.\nIn resolving claims under both the limited defect and power output warranties, we typically have the option of either repairing or replacing the covered\nmodules or, under the limited power output warranty, providing additional modules to remedy the power shortfall or making certain cash payments; however,\nhistorical versions of our module warranty did not provide a refund remedy. Consequently, we may be obligated to repair or replace the covered modules under\nsuch historical programs. As our manufacturing process may change from time-to-time in accordance with our technology roadmap, we may elect to stop\nproduction of older versions of our modules that would constitute compatible replacement modules. In some jurisdictions, our inability to provide compatible\nreplacement modules could potentially expose us to liabilities beyond the limitations of our module warranties, which could adversely impact our reputation,\nfinancial position, operating results, and cash flows.\nIn addition to our limited solar module warranties described above, for PV solar power systems we have constructed for customers in prior periods, we have\nprovided limited warranties for defects in engineering design, installation, and balance of systems (“BoS”) part workmanship for a period of one to two years\nfollowing the substantial completion of a system or a block within the system. BoS parts represent mounting, electrical, and other parts used in PV solar power\nsystems. In resolving claims under such BoS warranties, we have the option of remedying the defect through repair or replacement. As with our modules, these\nwarranties are based on a variety of quality and life tests that enable predictions of durability and future performance. Any underperformance or failures in BoS\nequipment beyond our expectations may also adversely impact our reputation, financial position, operating results, and cash flows.\nIn addition, our contracts with customers may include provisions with particular product specifications, minimum wattage requirements, and specified delivery\nschedules. These contracts may be terminated, or we may incur significant liquidated damages or other damages, if we fail to perform our contractual\nobligations. In addition, our costs to perform under these contracts may exceed our estimates, which could adversely impact our profitability. Any failures to\ncomply with our contracts for the sale of our modules could adversely impact our reputation, financial position, operating results, and cash flows.\n55\nTable of Contents\nItem 5. Other Information\nFrom time to time, our directors and officers may adopt plans for the purchase or sale of our securities. Such plans may be designed to satisfy the affirmative\ndefense conditions of Rule 10b5-1 under the Exchange Act or may constitute non-Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangements (as defined in Item 408(c) of Regulation\nS-K). During the three months ended September 30, 2024, none of our officers or directors adopted or terminated non-Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangements.\nHowever, certain of our officers adopted Rule 10b5-1 trading plans for the sale of our securities.
