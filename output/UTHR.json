Total revenues in the third quarter of 2024 grew 23 percent year-over-year to $748.9 million, compared to $609.4 million in the third quarter of 2023. \n\n\"I’m proud of the close to 1,300 Unitherians who have contributed to yet another record revenue quarter and reaching a $3 billion annual revenue run rate in the third quarter,\" said **Martine Rothblatt, Ph.D.** , Chairperson and Chief Executive Officer of United Therapeutics. \"On top of our stellar revenue performance, 2025 marks the start of a multi-year cascade of clinical data reads and regulatory events that should continue to propel our growth through the balance of the decade and beyond, with data expected for the _TETON_ studies in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis and _ADVANCE OUTCOMES_ in pulmonary arterial hypertension; data from the miroliver _ELAP_ phase 1 study now underway for acute liver failure; and, importantly, the launch of our UKidney human clinical program for which we expect to file an investigational new drug application shortly.\" \n\n**Michael Benkowitz** , President and Chief Operating Officer of United Therapeutics, added, \"Our team’s efforts have once again translated into outstanding financial results, achieving record revenue for a sixth straight quarter that underscores the increasing demand for our innovative products serving pulmonary hypertension and high-risk neuroblastoma patients. Tyvaso remains our biggest near-term growth driver, and we are encouraged by the underlying dynamics driving its continued uptake in pulmonary arterial hypertension and pulmonary hypertension associated with interstitial lung disease.\" \n\n**Third Quarter 2024 Financial Results**\n\nKey financial highlights include (dollars in millions, except per share data): \n\n**Three Months Ended****September 30,**| **Dollar Change**| **Percentage Change**  \n---|---|---  \n**2024**| **2023**  \nTotal revenues |  $ |  748.9 |  $ |  609.4 |  $ |  139.5 |  23 %   \nNet income |  $ |  309.1 |  $ |  267.6 |  $ |  41.5 |  16 %   \nNet income, per basic share |  $ |  6.93 |  $ |  5.71 |  $ |  1.22 |  21 %   \nNet income, per diluted share |  $ |  6.39 |  $ |  5.38 |  $ |  1.01 |  19 %   \n  \n**Revenues**\n\nThe table below presents the components of total revenues (dollars in millions): \n\n**Three Months Ended****September 30,**| **Dollar Change**| **Percentage****Change**  \n---|---|---  \n**2024**| **2023**  \nNet product sales:   \nTyvaso DPI®(1)|  $ |  274.6 |  $ |  205.1 |  $ |  69.5 |  34 %   \nNebulized Tyvaso®(1)|  159.2 |  120.7 |  38.5 |  32 %   \nTotal Tyvaso |  433.8 |  325.8 |  108.0 |  33 %   \nRemodulin®(2)|  128.3 |  131.1 |  (2.8 |  ) |  (2) %   \nOrenitram®|  113.2 |  92.0 |  21.2 |  23 %   \nUnituxin®|  61.1 |  51.3 |  9.8 |  19 %   \nAdcirca®|  7.0 |  7.3 |  (0.3 |  ) |  (4) %   \nOther |  5.5 |  1.9 |  3.6 |  189 %   \n**Total revenues**| **$**| **748.9**| **$**| **609.4**| **$**| **139.5**| **23 %**  \n  \n(1) |  Net product sales include both the drug product and the respective inhalation device.   \n---|---  \n(2) |  Net product sales include sales of infusion devices, including the Remunity® Pump.   \n  \nTotal Tyvaso revenues grew by 33 percent to $433.8 million in the third quarter of 2024, compared to $325.8 million in the third quarter of 2023. This growth was primarily due to an increase in quantities sold, driven by the commercial launch of Tyvaso DPI in June 2022 and continued growth in commercial utilization by patients with pulmonary hypertension associated with interstitial lung disease and, to a lesser extent, price increases. \n\nThe growth in Tyvaso DPI revenues resulted primarily from an increase in quantities sold and, to a lesser extent, a price increase. The increase in Tyvaso DPI quantities sold was due to continued growth in the number of patients following the product’s launch and, to a lesser extent, increased commercial utilization following the implementation of the Part D redesign under the Inflation Reduction Act (**IRA**). \n\nThe growth in nebulized Tyvaso revenues resulted primarily from an increase in quantities sold and, to a lesser extent, a price increase. \n\nThe decrease in Remodulin revenues resulted from a decrease in international Remodulin revenues, partially offset by an increase in U.S. Remodulin revenues, driven by an increase in quantities sold. \n\nThe growth in Orenitram revenues resulted primarily from an increase in quantities sold and, to a lesser extent, a price increase. The increase in quantities sold was driven, at least in part, by increased commercial utilization following the implementation of the Part D redesign under the IRA, and an increase in the average dose. \n\nThe growth in Unituxin revenues resulted from a price increase and an increase in quantities sold. \n\nThe table below presents the breakdown of total revenues between the United States and rest-of-world (**ROW**) (in millions): \n\n**Three Months Ended September 30,**  \n---  \n**2024**| **2023**  \n**U.S.**| **ROW**| **Total**| **U.S.**| **ROW**| **Total**  \nNet product sales:   \nTyvaso DPI(1)|  $ |  274.6 |  $ |  — |  $ |  274.6 |  $ |  205.1 |  $ |  — |  $ |  205.1   \nNebulized Tyvaso(1)|  145.2 |  14.0 |  159.2 |  118.1 |  2.6 |  120.7   \nTotal Tyvaso |  419.8 |  14.0 |  433.8 |  323.2 |  2.6 |  325.8   \nRemodulin(2)|  115.4 |  12.9 |  128.3 |  111.6 |  19.5 |  131.1   \nOrenitram |  113.2 |  — |  113.2 |  92.0 |  — |  92.0   \nUnituxin |  57.6 |  3.5 |  61.1 |  48.8 |  2.5 |  51.3   \nAdcirca |  7.0 |  — |  7.0 |  7.3 |  — |  7.3   \nOther |  4.3 |  1.2 |  5.5 |  1.7 |  0.2 |  1.9   \n**Total revenues**| **$**| **717.3**| **$**| **31.6**| **$**| **748.9**| **$**| **584.6**| **$**| **24.8**| **$**| **609.4**  \n  \n(1) |  Net product sales include both the drug product and the respective inhalation device.   \n---|---  \n(2) |  Net product sales include sales of infusion devices, including the Remunity Pump.   \n  \n**Expenses**\n\n**Cost of sales.** The table below summarizes cost of sales by major category (dollars in millions): \n\n**Three Months Ended****September 30,**| **Dollar Change**| **Percentage Change**  \n---|---|---  \n**2024**| **2023**  \n**Category:**  \nCost of sales |  $ |  81.8 |  $ |  69.1 |  $ |  12.7 |  18 %   \nShare-based compensation expense(1)|  1.3 |  1.0 |  0.3 |  30 %   \n**Total cost of sales**| **$**| **83.1**| **$**| **70.1**| **$**| **13.0**| **19 %**  \n  \n(1) |  See _Share-based compensation_ below.   \n---|---  \n  \n_Cost of sales, excluding share-based compensation._ Cost of sales for the three months ended September 30, 2024 increased as compared to the same period in 2023, primarily due to an increase in Tyvaso DPI royalty expense driven by growth in Tyvaso DPI revenues. \n\n**Research and development.** The table below summarizes the nature of research and development expense by major expense category (dollars in millions): \n\n**Three Months Ended****September 30,**| **Dollar Change**| **Percentage Change**  \n---|---|---  \n**2024**| **2023**  \n**Category:**  \nExternal research and development(1)|  $ |  51.7 |  $ |  47.2 |  $ |  4.5 |  10 %   \nInternal research and development(2)|  43.9 |  34.3 |  9.6 |  28 %   \nShare-based compensation expense(3)|  7.4 |  3.6 |  3.8 |  106 %   \nOther(4)|  0.5 |  (0.4 |  ) |  0.9 |  225 %   \n**Total research and development expense**| **$**| **103.5**| **$**| **84.7**| **$**| **18.8**| **22 %**  \n  \n(1) | _External research and development_ primarily includes fees paid to third parties (such as clinical trial sites, contract research organizations, and contract laboratories) for preclinical and clinical studies and payments to third-party contract manufacturers before FDA approval of the relevant product.   \n---|---  \n(2) | _Internal research and development_ primarily includes salary-related expenses for research and development functions, internal costs to manufacture product candidates before FDA approval, and internal facilities-related expenses, including depreciation, related to research and development activities.   \n(3) |  See _Share-based compensation_ below.   \n(4) | _Other_ primarily includes upfront fees and milestone payments to third parties under license agreements related to development-stage products and adjustments to the fair value of our contingent consideration obligations.   \n  \n_Research and development, excluding share-based compensation._ Research and development expense for the three months ended September 30, 2024 increased as compared to the same period in 2023, primarily due to increased expenditures related to manufactured organ and organ alternative projects. \n\n**Selling, general, and administrative.** The table below summarizes selling, general, and administrative expense by major category (dollars in millions): \n\n**Three Months Ended****September 30,**| **Dollar Change**| **Percentage Change**  \n---|---|---  \n**2024**| **2023**  \n**Category:**  \nGeneral and administrative(1)|  $ |  100.4 |  $ |  90.4 |  $ |  10.0 |  11 %   \nLitigation accrual |  65.1 |  — |  65.1 |  NM(2)  \nSales and marketing |  20.7 |  20.7 |  — |  — %   \nShare-based compensation expense(3)|  33.0 |  16.5 |  16.5 |  100 %   \n**Total selling, general, and administrative expense**| **$**| **219.2**| **$**| **127.6**| **$**| **91.6**| **72 %**  \n  \n(1) |  Excluding litigation accrual.

General and administrative expense for the three months ended September 30, 2024 increased as compared to the same period in 2023, primarily due to an increase in personnel expense due to growth in headcount. \n\n_Litigation accrual._ In the third quarter of 2024, we accrued a liability of $65.1 million related to ongoing litigation with Sandoz Inc., reflecting the amount of damages we calculated based on factual findings made by the court and included in our submission to the court regarding damages. We currently do not expect that the amount of any loss in excess of the accrual would be material to our financial statements; however, the amount ultimately payable, if any, could be higher or lower than this amount depending on the final judgment entered by the court, the amount of post judgment interest, and the outcome of any appeals. The litigation accrual is included within _selling, general, and administrative_ in our consolidated statements of operations. \n\n**Share-based compensation.** The table below summarizes share-based compensation expense by major category (dollars in millions): \n\n**Three Months Ended****September 30,**| **Dollar Change**| **Percentage Change**  \n---|---|---  \n**2024**| **2023**  \n**Category:**  \nStock options |  $ |  8.0 |  $ |  6.0 |  $ |  2.0 |  33 %   \nRestricted stock units |  27.2 |  12.5 |  14.7 |  118 %   \nShare tracking awards plan |  5.9 |  2.1 |  3.8 |  181 %   \nEmployee stock purchase plan |  0.6 |  0.5 |  0.1 |  20 %   \n**Total share-based compensation expense**| **$**| **41.7**| **$**| **21.1**| **$**| **20.6**| **98 %**  \n  \nThe increase in share-based compensation expense for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the same period in 2023, was primarily due to an increase in restricted stock unit expense due to a greater number of awards remaining outstanding for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the same period in 2023. \n\n**Other income (expense), net.** The change in _other income (expense), net_ for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the same period in 2023, was primarily due to net unrealized gains on equity securities. \n\n**Income tax expense.**_Income tax expense_ for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was $79.5 million and $84.2 million, respectively. Our effective income tax rate (**ETR**) for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was 20 percent and 24 percent, respectively. Our ETR for the three months ended September 30, 2024 decreased compared to our ETR for the three months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to increased excess tax benefits from share-based compensation. \n\n**Share repurchase.** In March 2024, we entered into an accelerated share repurchase agreement (the **ASR agreement**) with Citibank, N.A. (**Citi**). Under the ASR agreement, we made an aggregate upfront payment of $1.0 billion to Citi and received an aggregate initial delivery of 3,275,199 shares of our common stock on March 27, 2024, representing approximately 80 percent of the total shares that would be repurchased under the ASR agreement measured based on the closing price of our common stock on March 25, 2024. \n\nThe share repurchase under the ASR agreement was divided into two tranches, resulting in upfront payments of $300 million and $700 million, respectively. The final settlement of the $300 million tranche occurred in June 2024, and we received an additional 181,772 shares of our common stock upon settlement. The final settlement of the $700 million tranche occurred in September 2024, and we received an additional 90,403 shares of our common stock upon settlement. In total, we repurchased 3,547,374 shares of our common stock under the ASR agreement that we currently hold as treasury stock on our consolidated balance sheet. \n\n**Webcast**\n\nWe will host a webcast to discuss our third quarter 2024 financial results on Wednesday, October 30, 2024, at 9:00 a.m. Eastern Time.

(**LBE**) announced that the 500th lung transplant utilizing LBE’s centralized _ex vivo_ lung perfusion (**EVLP**) service was completed last month. These 500 transplants were the result of evaluating over 800 donated lungs using centralized EVLP since 2014. \n\nThe 500th transplant was completed in Jacksonville at [**Mayo Clinic in Florida**](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mayoclinic.org%2F&esheet=54139623&newsitemid=20241023762679&lan=en-US&anchor=Mayo+Clinic+in+Florida&index=1&md5=a8b14646ea6e1814753432cbc4165b05). “We are honored to work with United Therapeutics in this important collaboration that continues to increase the number of lungs that can be transplanted and is a significant step forward for transplant patients,” said **John Haney, M.D., M.P.H.** , Chair of the Department of Cardiothoracic Surgery at Mayo Clinic in Florida. “Mayo Clinic is committed to using and developing the latest medical advances and innovations that will have tremendous benefits not only for our patients, but other patients at institutions throughout the U.S.” \n\n“At United Therapeutics, our founding purpose has always been to save and improve lives through innovative technologies like those that expand the availability of transplantable organs and organ alternatives,” said **Martine Rothblatt, Ph.D.** , Chairperson and Chief Executive Officer of United Therapeutics. “We are proud of the groundbreaking accomplishments at LBE, and this important milestone serves as a testament to directly fulfilling our public benefit purpose by providing life-changing opportunities for those in need. This critical effort would not be possible without the tireless dedication of the LBE staff, the skilled physicians and hospital teams with whom we partner, and the patients and families we serve. Together, we are making a profound difference in the lives of so many, and we are deeply grateful for the trust placed in us.” \n\nLungs are among the most fragile and difficult organs to transplant. They are susceptible to injuries and infections, with only about 20 percent of donor lungs in the U.S. initially meeting the standard for transplant. About 300 people die every year waiting for a lung transplant – and this number only includes patients who can get on the waiting list. Close to 1,400 people are waiting for a lung transplant, and many thousands more could benefit from a transplant if more viable lungs were available, according to the United Network for Organ Sharing, the organization that oversees the nation's organ transplant system. \n\nEVLP is a technique used to evaluate donor lungs outside of the human body. It has emerged as an important tool for transplant physicians to increase the number of lungs available for transplant. EVLP involves flushing, ventilating, and heating donor lungs to normal body temperatures while gathering data on the lungs for real-time transmission for review by transplant physicians and other transplant program team members. For example, when lungs do not meet standard direct-to-transplant criteria, they are often discarded. With the help of EVLP, lungs can be monitored and clinically assessed to help transplant centers determine transplant suitability. \n\nIn each case, LBE clinical specialists review donor information with transplant centers and organ procurement organizations to determine whether the proposed organ is suitable for EVLP. LBE clinical specialists then use an FDA-approved EVLP device, or alternatively as part of a clinical trial, an EVLP device under development by LBE called the Centralized Lung Evaluation System (**CLES**), to gather data. LBE transmits EVLP data and communicates with transplant practitioners in real time using its proprietary OrganVue™ software. \n\nLBE’s staff of more than 30 professionals provide EVLP services at facilities located in Silver Spring, Maryland, and Jacksonville, Florida. Since 2014, LBE has received lungs from donor institutions as far afield as Alaska and Puerto Rico for centralized EVLP evaluation. Following EVLP, lungs have been accepted for transplant at 25 centers in North America spanning from a southernmost point of Miami to Toronto to the north, and St. Louis to the west. \n\nAdded Dr. Rothblatt: “As we look ahead at the unmet need, we are committed to building on the success of our centers of excellence in Maryland and Florida and are planning to open additional centralized EVLP centers in North America.” \n\nLBE’s centralized EVLP service is part of the broader xeno and organ alternative development platform at United Therapeutics. This platform consists of four key technologies – xenotransplantation, bio-artificial organ alternatives, regenerative medicine, and 3D bioprinting – providing manufactured alternatives for four human organs – heart, kidney, liver, and lung. United Therapeutics’ Miromatrix subsidiary recently initiated a phase 1 study of miroliverELAP™, the first bioengineered organ alternative to enter human clinical studies. United Therapeutics plans to initiate the first clinical study of the UKidney™ xenokidney in 2025, contingent on satisfactory FDA review of an investigational new drug application and concurrent investigational new animal drug application. \n\n**About Lung Bioengineering**\n\nLung Bioengineering Inc. (**LBE**) owns and operates the first and only full-service ex-vivo lung perfusion (**EVLP**) centers in the United States. The company was formed as a subsidiary of United Therapeutics in 2014 to be a leading provider of EVLP services. Our EVLP centers are driven by data and powered 24/7, 365 days a year, by the expertise of our LBE clinical specialists. LBE’s integrated EVLP service aims to reduce resource burdens from donation to transplant and increase organ utilization. LBE’s vision is a world where no one waits for a lifesaving transplant to become a reality. The organization is dedicated to achieving this vision one organ at a time.

The symposium will be held at the Omni Boston Hotel at the Seaport, Momentum ABC Ballroom, Level 5. ___\n\n___**About Tyvaso® Inhalation Solution and Tyvaso DPI® Inhalation Powder**___\n\n ___**INDICATION**___\n\n ___TYVASO (treprostinil) Inhalation Solution and TYVASO DPI (treprostinil) Inhalation Powder are prostacyclin mimetics indicated for the treatment of:___\n\n___Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH; WHO Group 1) to improve exercise ability. Studies with TYVASO establishing effectiveness predominately included patients with NYHA Functional Class III symptoms and etiologies of idiopathic or heritable PAH (56%) or PAH associated with connective tissue diseases (33%).___\n\n___The effects diminish over the minimum recommended dosing interval of 4 hours; treatment timing can be adjusted for planned activities.___\n\n___While there are long-term data on use of treprostinil by other routes of administration, nearly all clinical experience with inhaled treprostinil has been on a background of an endothelin receptor antagonist (ERA) and/or a phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE-5) inhibitor. The controlled clinical experience with TYVASO was limited to 12 weeks in duration.___\n\n___Pulmonary hypertension associated with interstitial lung disease (PH-ILD; WHO Group 3) to improve exercise ability. The study with TYVASO establishing effectiveness predominately included patients with etiologies of idiopathic interstitial pneumonia (IIP) (45%) inclusive of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), combined pulmonary fibrosis and emphysema (CPFE) (25%), and WHO Group 3 connective tissue disease (22%).___\n\n___**IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION**___\n\n ___**WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS**___\n\n ___TYVASO and TYVASO DPI are pulmonary and systemic vasodilators. In patients with low systemic arterial pressure, either product may produce symptomatic hypotension.___\n\n___Both products inhibit platelet aggregation and increase the risk of bleeding.___\n\n___Co-administration of a cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2C8 enzyme inhibitor (e.g., gemfibrozil) may increase exposure (both C max and AUC) to treprostinil. Co-administration of a CYP2C8 enzyme inducer (e.g., rifampin) may decrease exposure to treprostinil. Increased exposure is likely to increase adverse events associated with treprostinil administration, whereas decreased exposure is likely to reduce clinical effectiveness. ___\n\n___Like other inhaled prostaglandins, TYVASO and TYVASO DPI may cause acute bronchospasm. Patients with asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), or other bronchial hyperreactivity, are at increased risk for bronchospasm. Ensure that such patients are treated optimally for reactive airway disease prior to and during treatment with TYVASO and TYVASO DPI.___\n\n___**DRUG INTERACTIONS/SPECIFIC POPULATIONS**___\n\n ___The concomitant use of either product with diuretics, antihypertensives, or other vasodilators may increase the risk of symptomatic hypotension.___\n\n___Human pharmacokinetic studies with an oral formulation of treprostinil (treprostinil diolamine) indicated that co-administration of the cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2C8 enzyme inhibitor, gemfibrozil, increases exposure (both C max and AUC) to treprostinil. Co-administration of the CYP2C8 enzyme inducer, rifampin, decreases exposure to treprostinil. It is unclear if the safety and efficacy of treprostinil by the inhalation route are altered by inhibitors or inducers of CYP2C8. ___\n\n___Limited case reports of treprostinil use in pregnant women are insufficient to inform a drug-associated risk of adverse developmental outcomes. However, pulmonary arterial hypertension is associated with an increased risk of maternal and fetal mortality. There are no data on the presence of treprostinil in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production.___\n\n___Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established.___\n\n___Across clinical studies used to establish the effectiveness of TYVASO in patients with PAH and PH‑ILD, 268 (47.8%) patients aged 65 years and over were enrolled.

One of the things that I so value about this company is our commitment to walk the talk.” \n\nAs a PBC, United Therapeutics is obligated to report its progress toward its public benefit purpose— _to provide a brighter future for patients through the development of novel pharmaceutical therapies, and technologies that expand the availability of transplantable organs_. It pursues this purpose alongside its obligations to balance the interests of its other stakeholders, including employees, shareholders, the environment, and the local communities in which it operates. \n\nUnited Therapeutics aligns its environmental, social, and governance (**ESG**) priorities and performance with its PBC goals. The following are some highlights from this year’s Report: \n\n  * The company served more than **14,500** patients, including more than 100 benefiting from its centralized _ex vivo_ lung perfusion (**EVLP**) service in 2023, and more than 400 since service launch; \n  * Its patient assistance program has enabled more than **32,000 patients** secure access to treatments since 2010; \n  * More than **90 percent** of its employees agree, year-after-year since 2018, that United Therapeutics is a **Great Place to Work** ; \n  * With the LEED Gold certification of its _Phase Five_ Warehouse, approximately **26% of United Therapeutics’ properties are LEED certified** , including its LEED Platinum site net zero commercial building called the _Unisphere;_\n  * United Therapeutics remains a steadfast contributor to, and consumer of, renewable power through the **7-MW capacity onsite solar fields** it maintains on its properties. \n\n\n\n“Patient needs drive everything we do at UT,” said **James Edgemond** , Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer of United Therapeutics. “As Chris notes, we believe in the links across issues, which is why our PBC goals align with our patients, our people, and our planet. We manage the balance across our resources—human, financial, and environmental—to achieve better, long-lasting outcomes.” \n\nAlongside the publication of this Report, United Therapeutics also announced the launch of its updated corporate responsibility website.
