The 23.4% is based on a federal tax statutory rate of 21.0% and a combined state income tax rate net of federal benefits of 2.4%. The 23.6% is based on a federal tax statutory rate of 21.0% and a\ncombined state income tax rate net of federal benefits of 2.6%.\nHamilton Lane | Global Leader in the Private Markets 20\nTerms\nAdjusted EBITDA is an internal measure of profitability. We believe Adjusted EBITDA is useful to investors because it enables them to better evaluate the performance of our core business\nacross reporting periods. Adjusted EBITDA represents net income excluding (a) interest expense on our outstanding debt, (b) income tax expense, (c) depreciation and amortization expense, (d)\nequity-based compensation expense, (e) non-operating gain (loss) and (f) certain other significant items that we believe are not indicative of our core performance.\nFee Related Earnings (\"FRE\") is used to highlight earnings from recurring management fees. FRE represents net income excluding (a) incentive fees and related compensation, (b) interest\nincome and expense, (c) income tax expense, (d) equity in income of investees, (e) non-operating gain (loss) and (f) certain other significant items that we believe are not indicative of our core\nperformance. We believe FRE is useful to investors because it provides additional insight into the operating profitability of our business. FRE is presented before income taxes.\nNon-GAAP earnings per share measures our per-share earnings excluding certain significant items that we believe are not indicative of our core performance and assuming all Class B and\nClass C units in HLA were exchanged for Class A common stock in HLI. Non-GAAP earnings per share is calculated as adjusted net income divided by adjusted shares outstanding. Adjusted net\nincome is income before taxes fully taxed at our estimated statutory tax rate and excludes any impact of changes in carrying amount of our redeemable non-controlling interest. Adjusted\nshares outstanding for the three and six months ended September 30, 2023 and 2024 and March 31, 2024 are equal to weighted-average shares of Class A common stock outstanding -\ndiluted. We believe adjusted net income and non-GAAP earnings per share are useful to investors because they enable them to better evaluate total and per-share operating performance\nacross reporting periods.\nOur assets under management (\"AUM\"), as presented in these materials, comprise the assets associated with our customized separate accounts and specialized funds. AUM does not include\nthe assets associated with our distribution management services. We classify assets as AUM if we have full discretion over the investment decisions in an account. We calculate our AUM as the\nsum of:\n(1) the net asset value of our clients' and funds' underlying investments;\n(2) the unfunded commitments to our clients' and funds' underlying investments; and\n(3) the amounts authorized for us to invest on behalf of our clients and fund investors but not committed to an underlying investment.\nManagement fee revenue is based on a variety of factors and is not linearly correlated with AUM. However, we believe AUM is a useful metric for assessing the relative size and scope of our\nasset management business.\nOur assets under advisement (\"AUA\") comprise assets from clients for which we do not have full discretion to make investments in their account. We generally earn revenue on a fixed fee basis\non our AUA client accounts for services including asset allocation, strategic planning, development of investment policies and guidelines, screening and recommending investments, monitoring\nand reporting on investments and investment manager review and due diligence. Advisory fees vary by client based on the amount of annual commitments, services provided and other factors.\nSince we earn annual fixed fees from the majority of our AUA clients, the growth in AUA from existing accounts does not have a material impact on our revenues. However, we view AUA growth\nas a meaningful benefit in terms of the amount of data we are able to collect and the degree of influence we have with fund managers.\nFee-earning assets under management (Fee-earning \"AUM\" or \"FEAUM\") is a metric we use to measure the assets from which we earn management fees. Our fee-earning AUM comprise assets\nin our customized separate accounts and specialized funds from which we derive management fees that are generally derived from applying a certain percentage to the appropriate fee base.\nWe classify customized separate account revenue as management fees if the client is charged an asset-based fee, which includes the majority of our discretionary AUM accounts but also\nincludes certain non-discretionary AUA accounts. Our fee-earning AUM is equal to the amount of capital commitments, net invested capital and net asset value of our customized separate\naccounts and specialized funds depending on the fee terms. The vast majority of our customized separate accounts and specialized funds earn fees based on commitments or net invested\ncapital, which are not affected by market appreciation or depreciation. Therefore, revenues and fee-earning AUM are not significantly affected by changes in market value. Our calculations of\nfee-earning AUM may differ from the calculations of other asset managers, and as a result, this measure may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other asset managers. Our\ndefinition of fee-earning AUM is not based on any definition that is set forth in the agreements governing the customized separate accounts or specialized funds that we manage.\nHamilton Lane Incorporated (or \"HLI\"), a Delaware corporation, was formed for the purpose of completing an initial public offering (\"IPO\") and related transactions in order to carry on the\nbusiness of Hamilton Lane Advisors, L.L.C. (\"HLA\") as a publicly-traded entity. As of the closing of our IPO on March 6, 2017, HLI became the sole managing member of HLA.\nHamilton Lane | Global Leader in the Private Markets 21\nDisclosures\nSome of the statements in this presentation may constitute \"forward-looking statements\" within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 21E of the Securities\nExchange Act of 1934 and the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
