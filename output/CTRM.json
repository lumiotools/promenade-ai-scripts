This variation was mainly driven by the decrease in our Available Days (defined below)\nfrom 1,859 days in the three months ended September 30, 2023, to 929 days in the three months ended September\n30, 2024, following the sale of seven dry bulk vessels during the six months ended June 30, 2024 and the sale of\nthree dry bulk vessels in the fourth quarter of 2023, as partially offset by the acquisition of the M/V Magic Celeste\non August 16, 2024. This decrease in Available Days was partially offset by an increase in prevailing charter rates of\nour dry bulk vessels.\nThere was a decrease in voyage expenses to $1.0 million in the three months ended September 30, 2024, from $1.3\nmillion in the same period of 2023, which was mainly associated with a decrease in bunkers consumption.\nVessel operating expenses decreased by $4.9 million to $5.2 million in the three months ended September 30, 2024\nfrom $10.1 million in the same period of 2023, mainly reflecting the decrease in the Ownership Days of our fleet to\n966 days in the three months ended September 30, 2024, from 1,859 days in the same period in 2023.\nManagement fees in the three months ended September 30, 2024 amounted to $1.1 million, whereas in the same\nperiod of 2023, management fees totaled $1.8 million. This decrease in management fees is due to the decrease in\nthe total number of Ownership Days for which our managers charge us a daily management fee following the sales\nof the dry bulk vessels mentioned above, partly offset by a management fee adjustment for inflation under our\nAmended and Restated Master Management Agreement with effect from July 1, 2024.\nThe decrease in depreciation and amortization costs by $2.2 million to $3.7 million in the three months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024, from $5.9 million in the same period of 2023, mainly reflects the decrease in our Ownership\nDays following the sale of seven dry bulk vessels during the six months ended June 30, 2024 and the sale of three\ndry bulk vessels in the fourth quarter of 2023.\nGeneral and administrative expenses in the three months ended September 30, 2024, amounted to $1.5 million,\nwhereas, in the same period of 2023, general and administrative expenses totaled $1.6 million. This decrease mainly\nstemmed from lower professional fees during the period.\nDuring the three months ended September 30, 2024, we incurred net interest costs and finance costs amounting to\n$(1.5) million compared to $1.9 million during the same period in 2023. The decrease is due to the drop in our\nweighted average indebtedness, as well as an increase in interest income we earned from our time and cash deposits\n3\ndue to increased cash balances during the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared with the same\nperiod of 2023.\nOther income, net in the three months ended September 30, 2024, amounted to $0.4 million, which includes (i) a\nloss of $1.8 million from our investments in listed equity securities, (ii) dividend income on equity securities of $1.8\nmillion and (iii) dividend income of $0.4 million from our investment in 140,000 1.00% Series A Fixed Rate Cumulative\nPerpetual Convertible Preferred Shares of Toro Corp. (the “Toro Series A Preferred Shares”).\nOther income/(expenses), net in the three months ended September 30, 2023, amounted to $(7.2) million, which\nmainly includes the unrealized loss of $8.4 million from revaluing our investments in listed equity securities at period\nend market rates. Other expenses in the three months ended September 30, 2023 were partially offset by dividend\nincome on equity securities of $0.8 million and dividend income of $0.4 million from our investment in the Toro\nSeries A Preferred Shares.\nRecent Financial Developments Commentary:\nLiquidity/Financing/Cash flow update\nOur consolidated cash position (including our restricted cash) as of September 30, 2024, increased by $50.6 million\nto $171.5 million, as compared to our cash position on December 31, 2023, which amounted to $120.9 million. The\nincrease was mainly the result of: (i) $31.6 million of net operating cash flows received during the nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024, (ii) $107.9 million inflow of net proceeds from the sales of the M/V Magic Moon, M/V Magic\nNova, M/V Magic Orion, M/V Magic Nebula, M/V Magic Venus, M/V Magic Vela and M/V Magic Horizon, (iii) net\ninflows of $28.0 million associated with the purchase and sale of equity securities and inflows of $1.4 million of\nproceeds from a claim, offset by (iv) $25.5 million associated with the acquisition of the M/V Magic Celeste and $4.7\nmillion advances for the acquisition of the M/V Raphaela and M/V Magic Ariel, (v) $1.9 million of dividends paid on\nthe Series D Preferred Shares, (vi) $85.0 million for scheduled principal repayments, early prepayments in connection\nwith the sale of vessels and voluntary prepayments, on our debt and (vii) $1.1 million for payments related to the\nrepurchase in May 2024 of our outstanding Common Share Purchase Warrants issued on April 7, 2021.\nAs of September 30, 2024, our total debt, gross of unamortized deferred loan fees, was $1.6 million, all of which is\nrepayable within one year, as compared to $86.6 million of gross total debt as of December 31, 2023, a decline\nmainly due to prepayments in connection with vessel dispositions and voluntary prepayments of our long term debt.\nLoan prepayments\nOn August 7, 2024, we prepaid in full the amount of $14.6 million remaining outstanding under the $22.5 million\nsenior secured term loan facility with Chailease International Financial Services (Singapore) Pte., Ltd., secured against\ntwo containership vessels (the M/V Ariana A and M/V Gabriela A).\nOn September 3, 2024, we prepaid in full the amount of $10.6 million remaining outstanding under the $55.0 million\nsenior secured term loan facility with Deutsche Bank AG, secured against four dry bulk vessels (the M/V Magic\nStarlight, M/V Magic Mars, M/V Magic Pluto and M/V Magic Perseus).\nOn September 17, 2024, we prepaid in full the amount of $13.8 million remaining outstanding under the $40.75\nmillion senior secured term loan facility with Hamburg Commercial Bank AG, secured against two dry bulk vessels\n(the M/V Magic Thunder and M/V Magic Eclipse).\n4\nRecent Business Developments Commentary:\nVessel Acquisitions\nOn July 16, 2024, we entered into an agreement with an unaffiliated third party to acquire a secondhand 2015-built\nUltramax dry bulk carrier for a purchase price of $25.5 million.

The Daily Time Charter Equivalent Rate (“Daily TCE Rate”) is a measure\nof the average daily revenue performance of a vessel. The Daily TCE Rate is not a measure of financial\nperformance under U.S. GAAP (non-GAAP measure) and should not be considered as an alternative to any\nmeasure of financial performance presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. We calculate Daily TCE Rate\nby dividing total revenues (time charter and/or voyage charter revenues, and/or pool revenues, net of\ncharterers’ commissions), less voyage expenses, by the number of Available Days during that period.\nUnder a time charter, the charterer pays substantially all the vessel voyage related expenses. However,\nwe may incur voyage related expenses when positioning or repositioning vessels before or after the period\nof a time or other charter, during periods of commercial waiting time or while off-hire during dry-docking.\nUnder voyage charters, the majority of voyage expenses are generally borne by us whereas for vessels in\na pool, such expenses are borne by the pool operator. The Daily TCE Rate is a standard shipping industry\nperformance measure used primarily to compare period-to-period changes in a company’s performance\nand management believes that the Daily TCE Rate provides meaningful information to our investors since\nit compares daily net earnings generated by our vessels irrespective of the mix of charter types (i.e., time\ncharter, voyage charter, or other) under which our vessels are employed between the periods while it\nfurther assists our management in making decisions regarding the deployment and use of our vessels and\nin evaluating our financial performance. Our calculation of the Daily TCE Rates may be different from and\nmay not be comparable to that reported by other companies.\nThe following table reconciles the calculation of the Daily TCE Rate for our dry bulk and containership fleet\n(continuing operations) to Total vessel revenues (from continuing operations) for the periods presented\n(amounts in U.S. dollars, except for Available Days):\n13\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, September 30,\n(In U.S. dollars, except for Available Days) 2024 2023 2024 2023\nTotal vessel revenues $ 13,410,037 $ 21,404,903 $ 50,079,813 $ 71,151,984\nVoyage expenses - including\ncommissions to related party (991,717) (1,271,893) (3,004,491) (3,970,433)\nTCE revenues $ 12,418,320 $ 20,133,010 $ 47,075,322 $ 67,181,551\nAvailable Days $ 929 $ 1,859 $ 3,446 $ 5,743\nDaily TCE Rate $ 13,367 $ 10,830 $ 13,661 $ 11,698\nEBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are not measures of financial performance\nunder U.S. GAAP, do not represent and should not be considered as an alternative to net income,\noperating income, cash flow from operating activities or any other measure of financial performance\npresented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. We define EBITDA as earnings before interest and finance costs\n(if any), net of interest income, taxes (when incurred), depreciation and amortization of deferred dry-\ndocking costs. Adjusted EBITDA represents EBITDA adjusted to exclude unrealized gain/loss on equity\nsecurities, which the Company believes are not indicative of the ongoing performance of its core\noperations. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are used as supplemental financial measure by management\nand external users of financial statements to assess our operating performance. We believe that EBITDA\nand Adjusted EBITDA assists our management by providing useful information that increases the\ncomparability of our operating performance from period to period and against the operating performance\nof other companies in our industry that provide EBITDA information. This increased comparability is\nachieved by excluding the potentially disparate effects between periods or companies of interest, other\nfinancial items, depreciation and amortization and taxes for EBITDA, and further excluding unrealized\ngains/loss on securities for Adjusted EBITDA, which items are affected by various and possibly changing\nfinancing methods, capital structure and historical cost basis and which items may significantly affect net\nincome between periods. We believe that including EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA as measures of\noperating performance benefits investors in (a) selecting between investing in us and other investment\nalternatives and (b) monitoring our ongoing financial and operational strength. Our basis of computing\nEBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA as presented below may be different from and may not be comparable to\nsimilarly titled measures of other companies.\nThe following table reconciles EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA to Net income / (loss) from continuing\noperations, the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP financial measure, for the periods presented:\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, September 30,\n(In U.S. dollars) 2024 2023 2024 2023\nNet Income / (loss) from continuing\noperations, net of taxes $ 2,836,455 $ (5,387,321) $ 48,021,812 $ (3,710,568)\nDepreciation and amortization 3,660,974 5,923,845 11,048,829 17,225,392\nInterest and finance costs, net (1) (1,500,652) 1,940,963 (822,812) 6,618,695\nUS source income taxes 5,078 33,727 99,687 98,906\nEBITDA $ 5,001,855 $ 2,511,214 $ 58,347,516 $ 20,232,425\nUnrealized loss / (gain) on equity securities 1,809,827 8,362,915 (9,427,850) 13,470,342\nAdjusted EBITDA $ 6,811,682 $ 10,874,129 $ 48,919,666 $ 33,702,767\n14\n(1) Includes interest and finance costs and interest income, if any.\nCautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\nMatters discussed in this press release may constitute forward-looking statements.
