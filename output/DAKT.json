Amends and Extends Shareholder Rights Agreement\n\n<< [Back](javascript:void\\(0\\))\n\nNov 20, 2024\n\n[PDF Version](/node/20396/pdf)\n\nBROOKINGS, S.D., Nov. 20, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Daktronics, Inc. (“Daktronics” or the “Company”) (NASDAQ-DAKT), the leading U.S.-based designer and manufacturer of best-in-class dynamic video communication displays and control systems for customers worldwide, today announced that its Board of Directors (the “Board”) has approved an amendment (the “Second Amendment”) to the Company’s existing Shareholder Rights Agreement (the “Rights Agreement”), pursuant to which the expiration date of the Rights Agreement was extended to November 19, 2025, the exercise price was changed to $40.00, and the beneficial ownership threshold at which the rights become exercisable was changed to 15% (or 20% in the case of a passive, “13G Investor,” as defined in the Rights Agreement).\n\nAs noted in the Company’s press release dated November 8, 2024, the Board has determined that it is in the best interests of the Company and its common shareholders to exercise the Company’s right to convert an initial $7 million in face value of the $25 million senior second lien secured promissory note (the “Convertible Note”) held by Alta Fox Capital Management, LLC (together with its affiliates, “Alta Fox”) into approximately 1.1 million shares of the Company’s common stock. Giving effect to the conversion, Alta Fox would beneficially own approximately 6% of the Company’s outstanding shares, based on its most recent disclosure to the Company.\n\nThe Company has engaged in good faith with Alta Fox regarding Alta Fox’s desire to accelerate the repayment of the Convertible Note as an alternative to the forced conversion of the Convertible Note. In its most recent proposal, Alta Fox demanded that Daktronics pay Alta Fox $79 million – more than three times the face value of the Convertible Note and approximately one-and-a-half times its Black-Scholes value – to retire the Convertible Note. The Board rejected Alta Fox’s proposal as not in the best interests of the Company and its common shareholders and notified Alta Fox of its intention to exercise the Company’s right to force the conversion of the Convertible Note to minimize the dilution and cost to the Company’s shareholders. Alta Fox has now threatened to nominate candidates for the Board. Because Daktronics’ Articles of Incorporation and South Dakota law mandate cumulative voting in the election of directors, a shareholder who also owns debt, like Alta Fox – whose interests may not be aligned with other Daktronics shareholders – may be able to make Board composition changes even without broad shareholder support.\n\nIn extending the expiration date of the Rights Agreement, the Board considered the risk that Alta Fox, by virtue of its significant ownership position, may seek to take actions to advance its interests as a large debtholder, including influencing the composition of the Board, at the expense of common shareholders. The extension of the Rights Agreement reflects the Board’s continued commitment to protecting the interests of the Company’s shareholders. The Rights Agreement has not been adopted in response to any specific takeover bid or any similar proposal.\n\nThe Rights Agreement applies equally to all current and future shareholders and is not intended to deter offers or preclude the Board from considering offers that are fair and otherwise in the best interest of the Company’s shareholders.\n\nUnder the Rights Agreement, the “Rights” (as defined in the Rights Agreement) will become exercisable if a person or group acquires beneficial ownership of 15% (or 20% in the case of a “13G Investor”) or more of Daktronics outstanding common stock without the prior approval of the Board. Any existing shareholders with beneficial ownership of Daktronics stock above the applicable triggering ownership threshold as of the date of the Second Amendment are grandfathered at their current ownership levels so the Rights are not triggered by their current ownership of shares but they are not permitted to increase their ownership without triggering the Rights Agreement. The Board intends to submit the Rights Agreement to shareholders for ratification at the Company’s upcoming annual meeting of shareholders.\n\nAt this time, Daktronics shareholders are not required to take any action.\n\nA copy of the Second Amendment and a summary of the Second Amendment will be contained in a Current Report on Form 8-K filed by the Company with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) (the “Form 8-K”). The Second Amendment should be read together with the Rights Agreement and the Form 8-K.\n\n**About Daktronics**\n\nDaktronics has strong leadership positions in, and is the world's largest supplier of, large-screen video displays, electronic scoreboards, LED text and graphics displays, and related control systems.

(“Daktronics” or the “Company”) (NASDAQ-DAKT), the leading U.S.-based designer and manufacturer of best-in-class dynamic video communication displays and control systems for customers worldwide, today announced that, after careful deliberation, the Board of Directors (the “Board”) has determined that it is in the best interests of the Company and its common shareholders to exercise the Company’s right to convert an initial $7.0 million in face value of the $25 million senior second lien secured promissory note (the “Convertible Note”) held by Alta Fox Capital Management, LLC (together with its affiliates, “Alta Fox”) into approximately 1.1 million shares of the Company’s common stock.\n\nThe Board intends to deliver to Alta Fox notice of the conversion on November 11, 2024, with a conversion date of December 3, 2024. The Company intends to convert the remainder of the Convertible Note over the next several months, in tranches of up to $7 million in face value every 30 days, as provided for in the Convertible Note.\n\nDaktronics has delivered outstanding financial results over the last twelve months, with record revenue, gross profit and operating income in fiscal year 2024, and strong returns for shareholders, with the Company’s stock price increasing more than 300% over the last two years and over 175% since the issuance of the Convertible Note on May 11, 2023.1 This performance is the result of several initiatives implemented by the management team and Board, including strengthening the Company’s financial position, reducing order backlog, and improving margins through operational enhancements and strategic cost reductions.\n\nThe Board’s decision to force the conversion of the Convertible Note is consistent with the Company’s ongoing focus on balance sheet optimization and cost efficiency and will save the Company approximately $5.4 million in interest expense over the remaining term of the Convertible Note. To help offset the share dilution that will result from the conversion of the Convertible Note into common stock, the Company intends to execute on its existing share repurchase authorization as soon as practicable.\n\nThe Company engaged in good faith with Alta Fox regarding an accelerated repayment of the Convertible Note as an alternative to the forced conversion of the Convertible Note or keeping the Convertible Note outstanding. Alta Fox and the Company have been unable to agree on terms that the Board believes are in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders. The Company remains amenable to considering reasonable proposals for a negotiated retirement of the Convertible Note.\n\n**Summary of Convertible Note Terms with Alta Fox Capital Management**\n\nOn May 11, 2023, Alta Fox purchased from Daktronics $25,000,000 in Convertible Notes, due on May 11, 2027. The Notes bear interest at a rate of 9% per annum. \n\nUnder the terms of the Convertible Note, Daktronics has the right to convert the Convertible Note into common stock at a conversion price equal to $6.31 after 18 months following the issuance date of the Notes if the closing sale price of the Company’s common stock has been equal to at least 150% of the conversion price in 19 of the last 20 consecutive trading days. Under these terms, Alta Fox may set a limit on the amount of common stock it wishes to be issued in connection with a conversion of the Convertible Note (a “Maximum Percentage”). If the shares to be delivered as a result of a conversion of the Convertible Note would cause Alta Fox to exceed the Maximum Percentage, the so-called “Excess Shares” are treated as if they had never been issued and would be delivered to Alta Fox only when Alta Fox certifies that the delivery of the Excess Shares will not cause its ownership to exceed the Maximum Percentage. Because the Maximum Percentage currently in effect is 3% and Alta Fox currently owns, according to Alta Fox’s disclosures to the Company, 3% or more of our common stock, the forced conversion of the Convertible Note will not result in the issuance of common shares to Alta Fox at this time. Instead, delivery will be made after Alta Fox certifies it owns less than the Maximum Percentage.\n\nDaktronics encourages shareholders to read the full terms of the Convertible Note, which are available as Exhibit 10.4 to the Current Report on Form 8-K filed by the Company on May 12, 2023.\n\n**About Daktronics**\n\nDaktronics has strong leadership positions in, and is the world's largest supplier of, large-screen video displays, electronic scoreboards, LED text and graphics displays, and related control systems. The Company excels in the control of display systems, including those that require integration of multiple complex displays showing real-time information, graphics, animation, and video.
