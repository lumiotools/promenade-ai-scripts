(Nasdaq: ALOT), a global leader in data visualization technologies, today announced financial results for its fiscal 2025 second quarter ended August 3, 2024. \n\nCEO Commentary\n\n“We demonstrated the resilience of our Product Identification (PI) and Test & Measurement (T&M) segments during a second quarter in which we began shipping a previously delayed order and benefited from the resolution of supply chain shortages,” said Greg Woods, AstroNova’s President and Chief Executive Officer. “In PI, total revenue increased more than 5% year-over-year and more than 17% sequentially, driven primarily by organic growth. T&M revenue grew 37% sequentially and year-over-year, reflecting continued momentum from our Aerospace product line. \n\n“During the quarter we began the process of integrating our May acquisition of MTEX NS. Because MTEX was an entrepreneurial, private company, the integration got off to a slow start in the quarter, generating revenue of only $0.8 million and an operating loss of $1.4 million. We expect it to take through the remainder of fiscal 2025 to transition MTEX’s systems, processes and business tools to those of the AstroNova Operating System,” Woods said. “We remain excited about MTEX’s core strengths, including its engineering and manufacturing capabilities and especially its game-changing ink and printhead technologies. In the coming months we will be devoting additional resources to integrating that technology into more of our Product Identification products. Buoyed by several large tradeshows since the acquisition, MTEX has built a strong product backlog that we expect to begin shipping in the third and fourth quarters, which will enable the business to meet our target revenue contribution of $8 million to $10 million for full-year fiscal 2025.” \n\nBusiness Outlook\n\n“Looking ahead, we are optimistic about our growth prospects,” Woods continued. “We are well-positioned to continue driving organic growth, supported by our commitment to delivering innovative, high-margin products while maintaining strong cost controls. We anticipate achieving our fiscal year targets for revenue growth. As a result of the MTEX integration, we have reduced our consolidated FY 2025 Adjusted EBITDA margin estimate to a range of 9% to 10% and expect to be within the range of 13% to 14% in fiscal 2026.” \n\nQ2 FY 2025 Financial Results\n\n**GAAP** |  **Non-GAAP**  \n---|---  \n($ in thousands except per share data)  |  **Q2 FY25** |  **Q2 FY24** |  **YoY** |  **Q2 FY25** |  **Q2 FY24** |  **YoY**  \nRevenue  |  $40,539  |  $35,524  |  14.1%   \nGross Profit  |  $14,326  |  $9,710  |  47.5%  |  $14,446  |  $12,659  |  14.1%   \nGross Margin  |  _35.3%_ |  _27.3%_ |  800 pts  |  _35.6%_ |  _35.6%_ |  -   \nOperating Margin  |  _2.6%_ |  _(3.4%)_ |  600 pts  |  _5.5%_ |  _6.5%_ |  (100 pts)   \nNet (Loss) Income  |  $(311)  |  $(1,617)  |  -  |  $572  |  $1,089  |  (47.5%)   \nNet (Loss) Income Per Common Share  |  $(0.04)  |  $(0.22)  |  -  |  $0.08  |  $0.15  |  (46.7%)   \n_See reconciliation tables GAAP to Non-GAAP reconciliations._  \n  \nAdjusted EBITDA was $3.9 million for the second quarter of fiscal 2025, compared with $3.7 million in the comparable period of fiscal 2024. Adjusted EBITDA for the fiscal 2025 period excludes the impact of $1.7 million in costs related to stock-based compensation, CFO transition and MTEX acquisition-related expenses. Adjusted EBITDA for the fiscal 2024 period excludes the impact of stock-based compensation, retrofit and restructuring costs of $3.9 million. \n\nBookings for the second quarter of fiscal 2025 were $35.8 million compared with $30.1 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2024. Bookings were primarily higher in the Test and Measurement segment. \n\nBacklog as of August 3, 2024, was $29.9 million, compared with $31.6 million at the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2025, as some shipments delayed in the first quarter were shipped in the second quarter. \n\nQ2 FY 2025 Operating Segment Results\n\n**Product Identification**\n\nPI segment revenue was $27.2 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2025, compared with $25.8 million in the second quarter of 2024, reflecting organic growth and the addition of MTEX NS. Segment operating profit was $2.3 million, or 8.6% of revenue, compared with a segment operating loss of $461,000, or (1.8%) of revenue, in the same period last year. Excluding the results of MTEX in fiscal 2025 and certain expenses in both periods (see reconciliation tables below for GAAP reconciliation), non-GAAP operating profit was $3.6 million, or 13.7% of revenue in the fiscal 2025 period, compared with non-GAAP operating profit of $3.0 million, or 11.5% of revenue, in the same period of fiscal 2024. \n\n**Test & Measurement**\n\nTest & Measurement (T&M) segment revenue was $13.4 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2025, compared with $9.7 million in the same period of fiscal 2024, representing a 37.2% increase. Segment operating profit was $3.8 million, or 28.7% of revenue, in the second quarter of fiscal 2025 compared with $1.9 million, or 19.7% of revenue, in the second quarter of fiscal 2024. This improvement reflected higher revenue and $1.3 million in revenue and $1.0 million in operating profit related to non-recurring items. \n\nEarnings Conference Call Information\n\nAstroNova will discuss its fiscal 2025 second quarter financial results in an investor conference call at 9:30 a.m. ET today. To access the conference call, please dial (833) 470-1428 (U.S. and Canada) or (404) 975-4839 (International) approximately 10 minutes prior to the start time and enter access code 381674. A real-time and an archived audio webcast of the call will be available through the “Investors” section of the AstroNova website, [https://investors.astronovainc.com](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Finvestors.astronovainc.com&esheet=54122163&newsitemid=20240916638067&lan=en-US&anchor=https%3A%2F%2Finvestors.astronovainc.com&index=1&md5=cce45795588dca7aa0de49c500d50c54) . \n\n**Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures**\n\nIn addition to financial measures prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), this news release contains the non-GAAP financial measures non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP gross margin, non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP net income (loss) per common share and Adjusted EBITDA. AstroNova believes that the inclusion of these non-GAAP financial measures helps investors gain a meaningful understanding of changes in the Company’s core operating results and can help investors who wish to make comparisons between AstroNova and other companies on both a GAAP and a non-GAAP basis. AstroNova’s management uses these non-GAAP financial measures, in addition to GAAP financial measures, as the basis for measuring its core operating performance and comparing such performance to that of prior periods and to the performance of its competitors. These measures are also used by the Company’s management to assist with their financial and operating decision-making. Please refer to the financial reconciliation table included in this news release for a reconciliation of the non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures for the three months ended August 3, 2024, and July 29, 2023. \n\nAstroNova has not reconciled the forward-looking Adjusted EBITDA growth percentage included in its 2025 financial targets and outlook to the most directly comparable forward-looking GAAP measure because this cannot be done without unreasonable effort due to the lack of predictability regarding cost of sales, operating expenses, depreciation and amortization, and stock-based compensation. The impact of any of these items, individually or in the aggregate, may be significant. \n\n**About AstroNova**\n\nAstroNova (Nasdaq: ALOT), a global leader in data visualization technologies since 1969, designs, manufactures, distributes, and services a broad range of products that acquire, store, analyze, and present data in multiple formats. \n\nThe Product Identification segment provides a wide array of digital, end-to-end product marking and identification solutions, including hardware, software, and supplies for OEMs, commercial printers, and brand owners.

CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Unaudited)\nNote 1 – Business and Basis of Presentation\nOverview\nHeadquartered in West Warwick, Rhode Island, AstroNova, Inc. leverages its expertise in data visualization technologies to\ndesign, develop, manufacture and distribute a broad range of specialty printers and data acquisition and analysis systems. Our products\nare employed around the world in a wide range of applications in the aerospace, apparel, automotive, avionics, chemical, computer\nperipherals, communications, distribution, food and beverage, general manufacturing, packaging and transportation industries.\nOur business consists of two segments, Product Identification (“PI”) and Test & Measurement (“T&M”). The PI segment\nincludes specialty printing systems and related supplies sold under the QuickLabel®, TrojanLabel® and GetLabels™ brand names. The\nT&M segment consists of our line of aerospace products, including flight deck printers, networking hardware, and related accessories\nas well as T&M data acquisition systems sold under the AstroNova® brand name.\nOn May 4, 2024, we entered into an agreement to acquire MTEX New Solution, S.A., (“MTEX”), a Portugal-based\nmanufacturer of digital printing equipment that addresses a wide variety of markets and applications including textiles, packaging,\nlabeling, apparel, footwear and more. We reported MTEX as a part of our PI segment as of May 6, 2024, the closing date of this\nacquisition. Refer to Note 3, “Acquisition” for further details.\nPI products sold under the QuickLabel, TrojanLabel and GetLabels brands are used in brand owner and commercial applications\nto provide product packaging, marketing, tracking, branding, and labeling solutions to a wide array of industries. The PI segment\noffers a variety of digital color label tabletop printers and light commercial label printers, direct-to-package printers, high-volume\npresses, and specialty original equipment manufacturer (“OEM”) printing systems, as well as a wide range of label, tag and other\nsupplies, including ink and toner, allowing customers to mark, track, protect and enhance the appearance of their products. PI products\nsold under the Astro Machine brand also include a variety of label printers, envelope and packaging printing, and related processing\nand handling equipment.\nIn the T&M segment, we have a long history of using our technologies to provide networking systems and high-resolution flight\ndeck and cabin printers for the aerospace market. In addition, the T&M segment includes data acquisition recorders, sold under the\nAstroNova brand, to enable our customers to acquire and record visual and electronic signal data from local and networked data\nstreams and sensors. The recorded data is processed, analyzed, stored and presented in various visual output formats.\nOur PI products are sold by direct field salespersons, OEMs and independent dealers and representatives, while our T&M\nproducts are sold predominantly through direct sales and independent representatives. In the United States, we have factory-trained\ndirect field salespeople located throughout the country specializing in PI products. We also have direct field sales or service centers in\nCanada, China, Denmark, France, Germany, Malaysia, Mexico, Portugal, Singapore, and the United Kingdom staffed by our own\nemployees and dedicated third party contractors. Additionally, we utilize over 100 independent dealers and representatives selling and\nmarketing our products in over 60 countries.\nUnless otherwise indicated, references to “AstroNova,” the “Company,” “we,” “our,” and “us” in this Quarterly Report on Form\n10-Q refer to AstroNova, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries.\nBasis of Presentation\nThe accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S.\ngenerally accepted accounting principles and reflect all adjustments consisting of normal recurring adjustments which, in the opinion\nof management, are necessary for a fair presentation of the results of the interim periods included herein. These financial statements\ndo not include all disclosures associated with annual financial statements and, accordingly, should be read in conjunction with our\nAnnual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2024.\nThe presentation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to\nmake estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported and disclosed in the condensed consolidated financial statements and\naccompanying notes, including those that require consideration of forecasted financial information using information that is\nreasonably available to us at this time. Some of the more significant estimates relate to revenue recognition, allowances for doubtful\naccounts, inventory valuation, income taxes, valuation of long-lived assets, intangible assets and goodwill, share-based compensation,\ncontingent consideration liability and warranty reserves. Management’s estimates are based on the facts and circumstances available at\nthe time estimates are made, historical experience, risk of loss, general economic conditions and trends, and management’s\nassessments of the probable future outcome of these matters. Consequently, actual results could differ from those estimates.\n6\nResults of operations for the interim periods presented herein are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected\nfor the full year.\nCertain amounts in the prior year’s financial statements have been reclassified to conform to the current year’s presentation.\nPrinciples of Consolidation\nThe accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of AstroNova, Inc. and its wholly-owned\nsubsidiaries. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions are eliminated in consolidation.\nNote 2 – Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Update\nThe accounting policies used in preparing the condensed consolidated financial statements in this Form 10-Q are the same as\nthose used in preparing our consolidated financial statements included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended\nJanuary 31, 2024.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted\nOn March 6, 2024, the SEC adopted the final rule under SEC Release No. 33-11275, The Enhancement and Standardization of\nClimate-Related Disclosures for Investors. This rule will require registrants to disclose certain climate-related information in\nregistration statements and annual reports on Form 10-K including, among other things, material climate-related risks and their\nimpact; activities to mitigate or adapt to material climate-related risks; governance and oversight of climate-related risks; material\nclimate-related targets or goals and their financial impact; and qualitative and quantitative disclosures regarding greenhouse gas\nemissions. The final rules follow a phase-in timeline and would begin to apply prospectively to our fiscal year beginning February 1,\n2027. In April 2024, the SEC voluntarily stayed the effectiveness of the rules pending completion of judicial review of the\nconsolidated challenges to the final rules. We are currently monitoring the legal challenges and evaluating the potential impact of these\nrules on our consolidated financial statements and disclosures.\nIn December 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2023-09,\n“Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures” (“ASU 2023-09”) to enhance the transparency and decision\nusefulness of income tax disclosures primarily related to the rate reconciliation and income taxes paid information. ASU 2023-09\nmodifies the requirement for income tax disclosures to include (1) specific categories in the rate reconciliation, (2) the income or loss\nfrom continuing operations before income tax expense or benefit (separated between domestic and foreign) and (3) income tax\nexpense or benefit from continuing operations (separated by federal, state and foreign). ASU 2023-09 also requires entities to disclose\ntheir income tax payments to international, federal, state and local jurisdictions. The guidance is effective for annual periods beginning\nafter December 15, 2024. Early adoption is permitted for annual financial statements that have not yet been issued or made available\nfor issuance. ASU 2023-09 should be applied on a prospective basis, but retrospective application is permitted. We will adopt this\nstandard beginning with our fiscal year ending January 31, 2026. We are currently evaluating the potential impact of adopting this new\nguidance on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.\nIn November 2023, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic 280):\nImprovements to Reportable Segment Disclosures (“ASU 2023-07”), which requires disclosures, on an annual and interim basis, of\nsignificant segment expenses that are regularly provided to the chief operating decision maker (CODM), as well as the aggregate\namount of other segment items included in the reported measure of segment profit or loss. ASU 2023-07 also requires that a public\nentity disclose the title and position of the CODM and an explanation of how the CODM uses the reported measure(s) of segment\nprofit or loss. Public entities will be required to provide all annual disclosures currently required by ASU 2023-07 in interim periods.\nASU 2023-07 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, with early adoption permitted. We will adopt this\nstandard beginning with our fiscal year ending January 31, 2025, and for interim periods beginning with our first quarter of fiscal\n2026. We are currently evaluating the new disclosure requirements of ASU 2023-07 and do not expect the adoption of this guidance to\nhave a material impact on our consolidated financial statements or disclosures.\nNo other new accounting pronouncements, issued or effective during the first six months of the current year, have had or are\nexpected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nNote 3 – Acquisition\nWe account for our business combinations using the acquisition method as prescribed by Accounting Standard Codification 805,\n“Business Combinations” (\"ASC 805\"). ASC 805 requires the purchase price of the acquisition to be allocated to the tangible and\nintangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their fair value as of the acquisition date as determined by widely accepted\nvaluation techniques in accordance with ASC 820, “Fair Value Measurement.” Any excess of the purchase price over the fair value of\nthe net identified assets acquired and liabilities assumed will be recorded as goodwill. ASC 805 establishes a measurement period to\nprovide companies with a reasonable amount of time to obtain the information necessary to identify and measure various items in a\n7\nbusiness combination and cannot extend beyond one year from the acquisition date. If the initial accounting for the business\ncombination has not been completed by the end of the reporting period in which the business combination occurs, provisional amounts\nare reported to present information about facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date. During the measurement\nperiod, which may be up to one year from the acquisition date, we may record adjustments to the fair value of the tangible and\nintangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed with the corresponding offset to goodwill, to the extent such information was not\navailable to us at the acquisition date to determine such amounts. Upon the conclusion of the measurement period or final\ndetermination of the fair value of assets acquired or liabilities assumed, whichever comes first, any subsequent adjustments are\nrecorded to our consolidated statements of income (loss). We expect to complete the final fair value determination of the assets\nacquired and liabilities assumed as soon as practicable within the measurement period and in any event not later than one year from\nthe acquisition closing date.\nAccounting for business combinations requires us to make significant estimates and assumptions at the acquisition date.\nSignificant assumptions relevant to the determination of the fair value of the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities\nassumed include, but are not limited to, expected future cash flows, discount rates, royalty rates, and other assumptions. Such\nestimates are inherently uncertain and may be subject to refinement.\nAll acquisition-related costs, other than the costs to issue debt or equity securities, are accounted for as expenses in the period in\nwhich they are incurred. Changes in the fair value of contingent consideration arrangements that are not measurement period\nadjustments are recognized in earnings. The results of operations of the acquired entity, including revenues and earnings, are included\nin our financial statements from the closing date of the acquisition.\n(cid:0)0 (cid:0)7 (cid:0)( (cid:0);\nBackground\nOn May 4, 2024, AstroNova, along with its wholly-owned Portugal Subsidiary, AstroNova Portugal, Unipessoal, Lda (the\n“Purchaser”) entered into a Share Purchase Agreement (the “Purchase Agreement”) with Effort Premier Solutions Lda., a private\nlimited company incorporated under the laws of Portugal (the “Seller”) and Elói Serafim Alves Ferreira, as the “Second Guarantor”.\nIn accordance with the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Purchase Agreement, the Purchaser acquired from the\nSeller, 100% of the issued and outstanding share capital of MTEX. The closing date for the acquisition was May 6, 2024. This\ntransaction is a business combination and accounted for using the acquisition method as prescribed by ASC 805.\nThe purchase price for this acquisition consists of EUR 17,268,345 (approximately $18.7 million) paid by the Purchaser to the\nSeller on the closing date, and up to an additional EUR 731,655 (approximately $0.8 million) retained by the Purchaser to secure\ncertain indemnification obligations of the Seller to be released by the Purchaser subject to resolution of such obligations. The Seller\nmay be entitled to additional contingent consideration if specified revenue targets are achieved by MTEX as set forth in the Purchase\nAgreement for the three calendar year periods ending after the closing date. The contingent consideration consists of potential earn-\nout payments to the seller of EUR 1.0 million (approximately $1.1 million) if the specified revenue target is achieved in the full fiscal\nyear of 2025, an additional EUR 1.5 million (approximately $1.6 million) if the specified revenue target is achieved in full fiscal year\n2026, and an additional EUR 1.5 million (approximately $1.6 million) if the specified earnings targets are achieved in full fiscal year\n2027, with a maximum of EUR 4.0 million (approximately $4.4 million) if all of the specified earnings targets are achieved over the\nthree-year period.\nAlso on May 4, 2024, the Purchaser, the Seller, the Second Guarantor and MTEX entered into a Transitional Management\nAgreement (the “Transitional Management Agreement”) pursuant to which the Second Guarantor will serve as the MTEX’s Chief\nExecutive Officer for a term of three years following the closing date. Under the terms of the Transitional Management Agreement,\nthe Second Guarantor will receive a salary and grant of restricted stock units and will be entitled to participate in our incentive\ncompensation programs on the same terms as our executive officers. The Transitional Management Agreement includes customary\nnon-competition and confidentiality provisions.\nUpon the closing of the transaction, MTEX became a wholly owned indirect subsidiary of AstroNova, Inc.\n8\nPurchase Price Allocation\nA summary of the fair value of the consideration transferred as of the acquisition closing date is presented in the table below:\n(In thousands)\nCash Paid at Closing $ 18,732\nHoldback Amount (a) 742\nFair Value of the Earnout 1,619\nTotal Purchase Price $ 21,093\na) The holdback amount is expected to be paid out in full over the next two years.\nThe approach to valuing the initial contingent consideration relating to the earn-out requires the use of unobservable factors such\nas projected revenues over the term of the earn-out periods, discounted for the period over which the initial contingent consideration is\nmeasured, and relevant volatility rates. Based upon these assumptions, the initial earn-out contingent consideration is then valued\nusing an option pricing model.\nThe following table sets forth the preliminary purchase price allocation of the MTEX acquisition for the estimated fair value of\nthe net assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of May 6, 2024:\n(In thousands)\nCash $ 364\nAccounts Receivable 3,989\nInventory 3,807\nPrepaid Expenses and Other Current Assets 301\nProperty, Plant and Equipment 4,802\nOther Long-Term Assets 5,154\nIdentifiable Intangible Assets 9,556\nGoodwill 10,629\nAccounts Payable and Other Current Liabilities (4,225)\nDebt Assumed (7,918)\nOther Long-Term Liabilities (5,366)\nTotal Purchase Price $ 21,093\nThe amounts above are provisional and are based on information that is currently available. Management believes the\ninformation provides a reasonable basis for estimating the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed but is waiting for\nadditional information necessary to finalize those fair values. Therefore, the provisional measurements of fair value reflected are\nsubject to change and such changes could be significant. Management anticipates changes to the value of inventory, property, plant\nand equipment, deferred taxes and identifiable intangible assets as additional information is collected and analyzed and pending the\ncompletion of certain appraisals and a valuation report. We expect to complete the final fair value determination of the assets acquired\nand liabilities assumed, resolutions of working capital, and any other purchase price adjustments identified as soon as practicable\nwithin the measurement period and, in any event, not later than one year from the acquisition closing date.\nThe following table reflects the preliminary fair value of the acquired identifiable intangible asset and related estimated useful\nlives:\nFair Useful Life\n(In thousands) Value (years)\nCustomer Relations $ 8,786 10\nTrademarks/Tradenames 488 3\nInternally Developed Software 282 6\nTotal $ 9,556\nThe Customer Relations intangible asset represents the relationships that will be maintained with certain historical customers of\nMTEX. The trademark/tradename intangible assets reflect the industry reputation of the MTEX name and the registered trademarks\nheld by MTEX for the use of several marks and logos. The internally developed software intangible assets represent software used to\nmonitor customer ink use and troubleshoot issues with customers.\nThe fair value of the customer relations intangible asset acquired was estimated by applying the income approach using the\nMulti-Period Excess Earning Method. This fair value measurement is based on significant inputs that are not observable in the market\nand therefore represents a Level 3 measurement as defined in ASC 820, “Fair Value Measurement”. The fair value determined under\nthis approach is a function of (i) future revenues expected to be generated by these assets and the profitability of the assets, (ii)\n9\nidentification of the contribution of other tangible and intangible assets to the cash flows generated by these asset to apply an\nappropriate capital charge against the cash flow, and (iii) a discount rate of 14.0% used to calculate the present value of the stream of\nanticipated cash flows. The fair value of the trademark intangible asset acquired was estimated by applying the income approach using\nthe “relief-from-royalty” method. The value under the relief-from-royalty method is a function of (i) the concluded royalty rate of\n0.75%, (ii) projected revenues generated by product sales under the asset being valued, and (iii) a discount rate of 12.76%. The fair\nvalue of the internally developed software intangible asset acquired was estimated by applying the cost approach which takes into\nconsideration the internal development costs and a hypothetical developer’s profit margin to build the software.\nGoodwill of $10.6 million, which is not deductible for tax purposes, represents the excess of the purchase price over the\nestimated fair value assigned to the tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed from MTEX. The\ngoodwill recognized under ASC 805 is attributable to the expected earnings potential of the business, synergies which are expected to\nenhance and expand our overall product portfolio, opportunities in new and existing markets, and MTEX's assembled workforce. The\ncarrying amount of the goodwill was allocated to the PI segment.\nTotal acquisition-related costs of $0.6 million were included in general and administrative expenses in our condensed\nconsolidated statements of income (loss) for the three and six months ended August 3, 2024.\nThe amounts of revenue and earnings before taxes attributable to MTEX and included in our consolidated statements of income\n(loss) for the three and six months ended August 3, 2024 were as follows:\nThree Months Six Months\nEnded Ended\nAugust 3, August 3,\n(In thousands) 2024 2024\nRevenue $ 768 $ 768\nEarnings (Loss) before Taxes $ (1,754) $ (1,754)\nMTEX results are reported as part of the PI segment. Pro forma results as if the acquisition was closed on February 1, 2024 are\nnot provided, as disclosure of such amounts was impractical to determine\nNote 4 – Revenue Recognition\nWe derive revenue from the sale of (i) hardware, including digital color label printers and specialty OEM printing systems,\nportable data acquisition systems, and airborne printers and networking hardware used in the flight deck and cabin of military,\ncommercial and business aircraft, (ii) related supplies required in the operation of the hardware, (iii) repairs and maintenance of\nhardware and (iv) service agreements.\n(cid:0)5 (cid:0)H (cid:0)Y (cid:0)H (cid:0)Q (cid:0)X (cid:0)H (cid:0)V (cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)G (cid:0)L(cid:0)V (cid:0)D (cid:0)J (cid:0)J (cid:0)U (cid:0)H (cid:0)J (cid:0)D (cid:0)W(cid:0)H (cid:0)G (cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)E (cid:0)\\ (cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)S (cid:0)U (cid:0)L(cid:0)P (cid:0)D (cid:0)U (cid:0)\\ (cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)J (cid:0)H (cid:0)R (cid:0)J (cid:0)U (cid:0)D (cid:0)S (cid:0)K (cid:0)L(cid:0)F (cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)P (cid:0)D (cid:0)U (cid:0)N (cid:0)H (cid:0)W(cid:0)V (cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)D (cid:0)Q (cid:0)G (cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)P (cid:0)D (cid:0)M(cid:0)R (cid:0)U (cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)S (cid:0)U (cid:0)R (cid:0)G (cid:0)X (cid:0)F (cid:0)W(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)W(cid:0)\\ (cid:0)S (cid:0)H (cid:0)V (cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)D (cid:0)U (cid:0)H (cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)D (cid:0)V (cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)I(cid:0)R (cid:0)O(cid:0)O(cid:0)R (cid:0)Z (cid:0)V (cid:0)(cid:29)\nPrimary geographical markets\nThree Months Ended Six Months Ended\n(In thousands) August 3, 2024 July 29, 2023* August 3, 2024 July 29, 2023*\nUnited States $ 23,777 $ 20,124 $ 43,341 $ 40,820\nEurope 10,222 9,933 19,192 19,796\nCanada 2,741 2,289 4,500 4,169\nCentral and South America 1,336 1,024 2,534 2,224\nAsia 2,080 1,779 3,265 3,250\nOther 383 375 668 684\nTotal Revenue $ 40,539 $ 35,524 $ 73,500 $ 70,943\n*Certain amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current year's presentation.\nMajor product types\nThree Months Ended Six Months Ended\n(In thousands) August 3, 2024 July 29, 2023 August 3, 2024 July 29, 2023\nHardware $ 12,359 $ 11,268 $ 21,234 $ 22,934\nSupplies 22,344 19,700 40,977 38,772\nService and Other 5,836 4,556 11,289 9,237\nTotal Revenue $ 40,539 $ 35,524 $ 73,500 $ 70,943\n10\nIn December 2022, we entered into an amended contract with one of our T&M customers that provided for a total payment of\n$3.25 million to us as a result of our claims allowable under French law relating to additional component costs we have incurred and\nwill continue to incur in order to supply aerospace printers under the contract for the period beginning in April 2022 and continuing\nthrough fiscal 2025. Revenue from this arrangement will be recognized in proportion to the total estimated shipments through the end\nof the contract period. As of January 31, 2024, we recognized $2.4 million in revenue and the $0.8 million balance was recorded as\ndeferred revenue. During the six months ended August 3, 2024, we recognized an additional $0.5 million which is included in revenue\nin the condensed consolidated statement of income (loss) for the respective period presented, and there is a balance of $0.3 million in\ndeferred revenue at August 3, 2024. The remaining revenue to be recognized will be based on our shipments of the printers during the\nremainder of fiscal year 2025.\n(cid:0)& (cid:0)R (cid:0)Q (cid:0)W(cid:0)U (cid:0)D (cid:0)F (cid:0)W(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)$ (cid:0)V (cid:0)V (cid:0)H (cid:0)W(cid:0)V (cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)D (cid:0)Q (cid:0)G (cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)/ (cid:0)L(cid:0)D (cid:0)E (cid:0)L(cid:0)O(cid:0)L(cid:0)W(cid:0)L(cid:0)H (cid:0)V (cid:0)(cid:3)\nWe normally do not have contract assets, which are primarily unbilled accounts receivable that are conditional on something\nother than the passage of time.\nOur contract liabilities, which represent billings in excess of revenue recognized, are related to advanced billings for purchased\nservice agreements and extended warranties. Contract liabilities were $457,000 and $530,000 at August 3, 2024 and January 31, 2024,\nrespectively, and are recorded as deferred revenue in the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheet. The decrease in the\ndeferred revenue balance during the six months ended August 3, 2024 is due to revenue recognized during the current period, partially\noffset by cash payments received in advance of satisfying performance obligations, including $460,000 of revenue recognized that was\nincluded in the deferred revenue balance at January 31, 2024.\n(cid:0)& (cid:0)R (cid:0)Q (cid:0)W(cid:0)U (cid:0)D (cid:0)F (cid:0)W(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)& (cid:0)R (cid:0)V (cid:0)W(cid:0)V (cid:0)(cid:3)\nWe recognize an asset for the incremental costs of obtaining a contract with a customer if we expect the benefit of those costs to\nbe longer than one year. We have determined that certain costs related to obtaining sales contracts for our aerospace printer products\nmeet the requirement to be capitalized. These costs are deferred and amortized over the remaining useful life of these contracts, which\nwe currently estimate to be approximately 17 years as of August 3, 2024. The balance of these contract assets at January 31, 2024 was\n$1.3 million. We also recognize an asset for the costs to fulfill a contract with a customer if the costs are specifically identifiable,\ngenerate or enhance resources used to satisfy future performance obligations, and are expected to be recovered. In fiscal 2025, we\nincurred $0.3 million of costs to fulfill a contract which will be amortized over approximately 17 years. During the three and six\nmonths ended August 3, 2024, we amortized contract costs of $23,000 and $42,000, respectively. The balance of deferred incremental\ndirect costs net of accumulated amortization at August 3, 2024 was $1.6 million, of which $0.1 million is reported in other current\nassets, and $1.5 million is reported in other assets in the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheet.\nNote 5 – Net Income (Loss) Per Common Share\nBasic net income (loss) per share is calculated by dividing net income (loss) by the weighted average number of shares\noutstanding during the period. Diluted net income (loss) per share is calculated by dividing net income (loss) by the weighted average\nnumber of shares and, if dilutive, common equivalent shares, determined using the treasury stock method for stock options, restricted\nstock awards and restricted stock units outstanding during the period. A reconciliation of the shares used in calculating basic and\ndiluted net income (loss) per share is as follows:\nThree Months Ended Six Months Ended\nAugust 3, 2024 July 29, 2023 August 3, 2024 July 29, 2023\nWeighted Average Common Shares Outstanding – Basic 7,515,706 7,420,135 7,489,223 7,396,200\nEffect of Dilutive Options, Restricted Stock Awards and\nRestricted Stock Units — (1) — (2) 128,183 — (2)\nWeighted Average Common Shares Outstanding –\nDiluted 7,515,706 7,420,135 7,617,406 7,396,200\n(1)For the three months ended August 3, 2024, we had weighted average common stock equivalent shares outstanding of 86,197 that could\npotentially dilute earnings per share in future periods. These shares were excluded from the computation of diluted earnings per share because their\neffect would have been anti-dilutive given the net loss during the periods.\n(2)For the three and six months ended July 29, 2023, we had weighted average common stock equivalent shares outstanding of 74,178 and\n77,150, respectively, that could potentially dilute earnings per share in future periods. These shares were excluded from the computation of diluted\nearnings per share because their effect would have been anti-dilutive given the net loss during the periods.\nFor the three and six months ended August 3, 2024, the diluted per share amounts do not reflect weighted average common\nequivalent shares outstanding of 218,210 and 223,011, respectively. For the three and six months ended July 29, 2023, the diluted per\nshare amounts do not reflect weighted average common equivalent shares outstanding of 226,457 and 376,468(cid:0)(cid:15) respectively. These\noutstanding common equivalent shares were not included due to their anti-dilutive effect.\n11\nNote 6 – Intangible Assets\nIntangible assets are as follows:\nAugust 3, 2024 January 31, 2024\nGross Currency Net Gross Currency Net\nCarrying Accumulated Translation Carrying Carrying Accumulated Translation Carrying\n(In thousands) Amount Amortization Adjustment Amount Amount Amortization Adjustment Amount\nRITEC:\nCustomer Contract\nRelationships $ 2,830 $ (1,722) $ — $ 1,108 $ 2,830 $ (1,689) $ — $ 1,141\nTrojanLabel:\nDistributor\nRelations 937 (728) 26 235 937 (686) 30 281\nHoneywell:\nCustomer Contract\nRelationships 27,773 (13,228) — 14,545 27,773 (12,795) — 14,978\nAstro Machine:\nCustomer Contract\nRelationships 3,060 (1,224) — 1,836 3,060 (918) — 2,142\nTrademarks 420 (168) — 252 420 (126) — 294\nMTEX:\nCustomer Contract\nRelationships 8,786 (219) 49 8,616 — — — —\nInternally\nDeveloped Software 282 (12) 2 272\nTrademarks 488 (40) 2 450 — — — —\nIntangible Assets,\nnet $ 44,576 $ (17,341) $ 79 $ 27,314 $ 35,020 $ (16,214) $ 30 $ 18,836\nThere were no impairments to intangible assets during the six months ended August 3, 2024 and July 29, 2023.\nWith respect to the acquired intangible assets included in the table above, amortization expense of $0.7 million and $0.6 million\nhas been included in the condensed consolidated statements of income (loss) for the three months ended August 3, 2024, and July 29,\n2023, respectively.

The Amendment amended the Amended and\nRestated Credit Agreement dated as of July 30, 2020, as amended by the First Amendment to Amended and Restated Credit\nAgreement, dated as of March 24, 2021, the LIBOR Transition Amendment, dated as of December 14, 2021, and the Second\nAmendment to Amended and Restated Credit Agreement dated as of August 4, 2022, and the Joinder Agreement relating to our\nsubsidiary Astro Machine Corporation (“Astro Machine”) dated as of August 26, 2022 (the “Existing Credit Agreement”; the Existing\nCredit Agreement as amended by the Amendment, the “Amended Credit Agreement”), between AstroNova, Inc. as the borrower, Astro\nMachine as a guarantor, and the Lender.\nThe Amended Credit Agreement provides for (i) a new term loan to AstroNova, Inc. in the principal amount of EUR 14.0\nmillion (the “Term A-2 Loan”), which term loan is in addition to the existing term loan (the “Existing Term Loan”) outstanding under\nthe Existing Credit Agreement in the principal amount of approximately $12.3 million as of the effective date of the Amendment, and\n(ii) an increase in the aggregate principal amount of the revolving credit facility available to AstroNova, Inc. from $25.0 million to\n$30.0 million until January 31, 2025, upon and after which the aggregate principal amount of the revolving credit facility will reduce\nto $25.0 million. At the closing of the Amendment, we borrowed the entire EUR 14.0 million Term A-2 Loan, and EUR 3.0 million\nand a US dollar amount which was converted to Euros to satisfy the entire purchase price payable on the closing date pursuant to the\nPurchase Agreement. The revolving credit facility may otherwise be used for general corporate purposes.\nThe Amended Credit Agreement requires that the Term A-2 Loan be paid in quarterly installments on the last day of each of our\nfiscal quarters through April 30, 2027 in the principal amount of EUR 583,333 each, and the entire then-remaining principal balance of\nthe Term A-2 Loan is required to be paid on August 4, 2027. The Amended Credit Agreement requires that the remaining balance of\nthe Existing Term Loan be paid in quarterly installments on the last day of each of our fiscal quarters through April 30, 2027 in the\nprincipal amount of $675,000 each, and the entire then remaining principal balance of the term loan is required to be paid on August 4,\n2027. We may voluntarily prepay the Term A-2 Term Loan or the Existing Term Loan, in whole or in part, from time to time without\npremium or penalty (other than customary breakage costs, if applicable). We may repay borrowings under the revolving credit facility\nat any time without premium or penalty (other than customary breakage costs, if applicable), but in any event no later than August 4,\n2027, and any outstanding revolving loans thereunder will be due and payable in full, and the revolving credit facility will terminate,\non such date. We may reduce or terminate the revolving line of credit at any time, subject to certain thresholds and conditions, without\npremium or penalty.\nThe Term A-2 Loan bears interest at a rate per annum equal to the EURIBOR rate as defined in the Amended Credit Agreement,\nplus a margin that varies within a range of 1.60% to 2.50% based on our consolidated leverage ratio. The Existing Term Loan and\nrevolving credit loans bear interest at a rate per annum equal to, at our option, either (a) the Term SOFR rate as defined in the\nAmended Credit Agreement (or, in the case of revolving credit loans denominated in Euros or another currency other than U.S.\nDollars, the applicable quoted rate), plus a margin that varies within a range of 1.60% to 2.50% based on our consolidated leverage\nratio, or (b) a fluctuating reference rate equal to the highest of (i) the federal fund rate plus 0.50%, (ii) Bank of America’s publicly\nannounced prime rate, (iii) the Term SOFR Rate plus 1.00%, or (iv) 0.50%, plus a margin that varies within a range of 0.60% to 1.50%\nbased on our consolidated leverage ratio. In addition to certain other fees and expenses that we are required to pay to the Lender, we\nare required to pay a commitment fee on the undrawn portion of the revolving credit facility that varies within a range of 0.15% and\n0.35% based on our consolidated leverage ratio.\n13\nThe loans under the Amended Credit Agreement are subject to certain mandatory prepayments, subject to various exceptions,\nfrom (a) net cash proceeds from certain dispositions of property, (b) net cash proceeds from certain issuances of equity, (c) net cash\nproceeds from certain issuances of additional debt and (d) net cash proceeds from certain extraordinary receipts.\nAmounts repaid under the revolving credit facility may be reborrowed, subject to our continued compliance with the Amended\nCredit Agreement. No amount of the Term A-2 Loan or the Existing Term Loan that is repaid may be reborrowed.\nWe must comply with various customary financial and non-financial covenants under the Amended Credit Agreement. The\nfinancial covenants under the Amended Credit Agreement consist of a maximum consolidated leverage ratio and a minimum\nconsolidated fixed charge coverage ratio, certain of the provisions of which were modified by the Amendment; the minimum\nconsolidated asset coverage ratio under the Existing Credit Agreement was eliminated by the Amendment. The primary non-financial\ncovenants limit our and our subsidiaries’ ability to incur future indebtedness, to place liens on assets, to pay dividends or distributions\non our or our subsidiaries’ capital stock, to repurchase or acquire our or our subsidiaries’ capital stock, to conduct mergers or\nacquisitions, to sell assets, to alter our or our subsidiaries’ capital structure, to make investments and loans, to change the nature of our\nor our subsidiaries’ business, and to prepay subordinated indebtedness, in each case subject to certain exceptions and thresholds as set\nforth in the Amended Credit Agreement, certain of which provisions were modified by the Amendment. As of August 3, 2024, we\nbelieve we are in compliance with all of the covenants in the Amended Credit Agreement.\nThe Lender is entitled to accelerate repayment of the loans and to terminate its revolving credit commitment under the Amended\nCredit Agreement upon the occurrence of any of various customary events of default, which include, among other events, the\nfollowing (which are subject, in some cases, to certain grace periods): failure to pay when due any principal, interest or other amounts\nin respect of the loans, breach of any of our covenants or representations under the loan documents, default under any other of our or\nour subsidiaries’ significant indebtedness agreements, a bankruptcy, insolvency or similar event with respect to us or any of our\nsubsidiaries, a significant unsatisfied judgment against us or any of our subsidiaries, or a change of control.\nOur obligations under the Amended Credit Agreement continue to be secured by substantially all of our personal property assets\n(including a pledge of the equity interests we hold in ANI Scandinavia ApS, AstroNova GmbH, AstroNova SAS and the Purchaser),\nsubject to certain exceptions, and by a mortgage on our owned real property in West Warwick, Rhode Island, and are guaranteed by,\nand secured by substantially all of the personal property assets of Astro Machine.\nEquipment Financing\nIn January 2024, we entered into a secured equipment loan facility agreement with Banc of America Leasing & Capital, LLC\nand borrowed a principal amount of $0.8 million thereunder for the purpose of financing our purchase of production equipment. This\nloan matures on January 23, 2029, and bears interest at a fixed rate of 7.06%. Under this loan agreement, equal monthly payments\nincluding principal and interest of $16,296 commenced on February 23, 2024, and will continue through the maturity of the equipment\nloan facility on January 23, 2029.\nAssumed Financing Obligations of MTEX\nIn connection with our acquisition of MTEX, on the May 6, 2024 closing date of this acquisition we assumed certain existing\nfinancing obligations of MTEX that remain outstanding as of August 3, 2024. The long-term debt obligations of MTEX that remain\noutstanding include a term loan ( the “MTEX Term Loan”) pursuant to the agreement dated December 22, 2023, (the “MTEX Term\nLoan Agreement”) between MTEX and Caixa Central de Crédito Agricola Mutuo. The MTEX Term Loan provides for a term loan in\nthe principal amount of EUR 1.5 million ($1.6 million) and requires monthly principal and interest payments totaling EUR 17,402\n($18,795) commencing in October 2024 continuing through maturity on December 21, 2033, and bears interest at a fixed rate of\n6.022% per annum.\nMTEX has also received government assistance in the form of interest-free loans from government agencies located in Portugal\n(the “MTEX Government Grant Term Loans”). The MTEX Government Grant Term Loans are to be repaid to the applicable\ngovernment agencies and are classified as long-term debt. The current balance of the MTEX Government Grants Term Loans as of\nAugust 3, 2024 is EUR 1.3 million ($1.5 million). The MTEX Government Grant Term Loans provide interest-free financing to the\nextent monthly principal payments are made. In the event that MTEX and the applicable government agency renegotiate the payment\ndates, interest will be calculated according to a rate determined by the government agency as of the date of renegotiation and added to\nthe outstanding principal payments. The MTEX Government Grant Term Loans mature between December 2024 and January 2027.\nAdditionally, we assumed short-term financing obligations of MTEX that remain outstanding as of August 3, 2024, including\nletters of credit, maturing term loans, and financing arrangements for working capital classified as debt.\n14\n(cid:0)6 (cid:0)X (cid:0)P (cid:0)P (cid:0)D (cid:0)U (cid:0)\\ (cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)R (cid:0)I(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)2 (cid:0)X (cid:0)W(cid:0)V (cid:0)W(cid:0)D (cid:0)Q (cid:0)G (cid:0)L(cid:0)Q (cid:0)J (cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)’ (cid:0)H (cid:0)E (cid:0)W(cid:0)(cid:3)\nRevolving Credit Facility\nAt August 3, 2024, we had an outstanding balance of $13.0 million on our revolving credit facility. The balance outstanding\nunder the revolving credit facility bore interest at a weighted average annual rate of 8.52% and 8.54% and we incurred $254,000 and\n$386,000 for interest on this obligation, during the three and six months ended August 3, 2024, respectively. Additionally, during the\nthree and six months ended August 3, 2024, we incurred $13,000 and $25,000, respectively, of commitment fees on the undrawn\nportion of our revolving credit facility. The balance outstanding under the revolving line of credit bore interest at a weighted average\nrate of 7.95% and 7.56%, respectively, for the three and six months ended July 29, 2023, and we incurred $333,000 and $625,000,\nrespectively, for interest on this obligation during the three and six months ended July 29, 2023. Additionally, during the three and six\nmonths ended July 29, 2023, we incurred $6,000 and $14,000, respectively, of commitment fees on the undrawn portion of our\nrevolving credit facility. Both the interest expense and commitment fees are included as interest expense in the accompanying\ncondensed consolidated statements of income for all periods presented. At August 3, 2024, there was $17.0 million remaining\navailable for borrowing under our revolving credit facility. Additionally, MTEX has a EUR 0.5 million ($0.5 million) available line of\ncredit with Caixa Central de Crédito Agricola Mutuo. This credit line was established in December 2023 and is renewable every six\nmonths. There was EUR 0.3 million ($0.4 million) outstanding on this line of credit as of August 3, 2024.\nLong-Term Debt\nLong-term debt in the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheets is as follows:\nAugust 3, January 31,\n(In thousands) 2024 2024\nUSD Term Loan (7.73% as of August 3, 2024 and 7.56% as\nof January 31, 2024); maturity date of August 4, 2027 $ 10,800 $ 12,150\nEuro Term Loan (6.94% as of August 3, 2024;\nmaturity date of August 4, 2027) 14,638 —\nMTEX Euro Term Loan (6.022% Fixed Rate as of August 3, 2024;\nmaturity date of December 21, 2033) 1,637 —\nMTEX Euro Government Grant Term Loan (0% as of August 3, 2024;\nmaturity dates December 2024 - January 2027) 1,463 —\nEquipment Loan (7.06% Fixed Rate); maturity date of January 23,\n2029 752 822\nTotal Debt 29,290 12,972\nLess: Debt Issuance Costs, net of accumulated amortization 102 80\nCurrent Portion of Debt 6,513 2,842\nLong-Term Debt $ 22,675 $ 10,050\nDuring the three and six months ended August 3, 2024, we recognized interest expense on debt of $560,000 and $793,000,\nrespectively, and during the three and six months ended July 29, 2023, we recognized interest expense on debt of $266,000 and\n$514,000, respectively, which is recognized in the accompanying condensed consolidated statements of income (loss) for all periods\npresented.\nThe schedule of required principal payments remaining during the next five years on long-term debt outstanding as of August 3,\n2024 is as follows:\n(In thousands)\nFiscal 2025, remainder $ 3,316\nFiscal 2026 6,263\nFiscal 2027 5,722\nFiscal 2028 12,657\nFiscal 2029 1,332\n$ 29,290\nNote 10 – Royalty Obligation\nIn fiscal 2018, we entered into an Asset Purchase and License Agreement with Honeywell International, Inc. (“Honeywell”) to\nacquire an exclusive, perpetual, world-wide license to manufacture Honeywell’s narrow-format flight deck printers for two aircraft\nfamilies along with certain inventory used in the manufacturing of the licensed printers. The purchase price included a guaranteed\nminimum royalty payment of $15.0 million, to be paid over ten years, based on gross revenues from the sales of the printers, paper\nand repair services of the licensed products. The royalty rates vary based on the year in which they are paid or earned, and product\nsold or service provided, and range from single-digit to mid double-digit percentages of gross revenue.\n15\nThe guaranteed minimum royalty payment obligation was recorded at the present value of the minimum annual royalty\npayments. As of August 3, 2024, we had paid an aggregate of $11.9 million of the guaranteed minimum royalty obligation. At August\n3, 2024, the current portion of the outstanding guaranteed minimum royalty obligation of $1.4 million is to be paid over the next\ntwelve months and is reported as a current liability and the remainder of $1.2 million is reported as a long-term liability on our\ncondensed consolidated balance sheet. For the three and six months ended August 3, 2024, we incurred $0.7 million and $1.3 million,\nrespectively, in excess royalty expense which is included in cost of revenue in our consolidated statements of income (loss) for all\nperiods presented. A total of $1.4 million in excess royalties was paid in through the second quarter of the current fiscal year, and there\nare $0.8 million in excess royalty payables due as a result of this agreement for the quarter ended August 3, 2024.\nIn fiscal 2023, we entered into an Asset Purchase and License Agreement with Honeywell International Inc. (“New HW\nAgreement”) to acquire an exclusive, perpetual, world-wide license to manufacture Honeywell’s flight deck printers for the Boeing\n787 aircraft. The New HW Agreement provides for royalty payments to Honeywell based on gross revenues from the sales of the\nprinters, paper and repair services of the licensed products in perpetuity. The royalty rates vary based on the year in which they are\npaid or earned and as products are sold or as services are provided and range from single-digit to mid-double-digit percentages of\ngross revenue. The New HW Agreement includes a provision for guaranteed minimum royalty payments to be paid in the event that\nthe royalties earned by Honeywell do not meet the minimum for the preceding calendar year as follows: $100,000 in 2024, $200,000\nin 2025, $233,000 in 2026 and 2027, and $234,000 in 2028.\nAs of January 31, 2024, the total outstanding royalty obligation under the New HW Agreement was $0.6 million, including $0.2\nmillion recorded as a current liability in the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheet.

We account for these government grants by analogy to International Accounting Standards 20, Accounting for\nGovernment Grants and Disclosure of Government Assistance, which follows a grant accounting model. Under this accounting\nframework, government assistance is recognized when it is probable we will receive assistance and comply with the conditions\nattached to the assistance. Operational related assistance is recorded on a systematic basis over the periods in which the related cost or\nexpenditures have occurred and is presented as a reduction in the expense for which it is intended to defray. Capital related assistance\nis recorded as long-term deferred revenue and is recognized in cost of revenue as an offset against depreciation expense over the\napplicable asset's useful life.\nThe grant programs have execution periods ending in May 2025 through November 2026. The government agencies may verify\ncompliance with the conditions established in the contracts during the investment phase and upon completion and are entitled to\npropose adjustments and require reimbursement if the contracts do not meet the specifications. Historically, no significant corrections\nor returns have occurred. As of August 3, 2024, there are no contingencies associated with the government grants.\nThe capital related government contracts between the Portuguese government and MTEX are defined on a grant-by-grant basis,\nwith partial reimbursement of the assets acquired in connection with these grants. We have $1.5 million of deferred revenue for capital\nrelated government grants which is included in other long-term liabilities in the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheet\nas of August 3, 2024, and we have recognized $0.1 million of grant revenue, included in cost of revenue as an offset to depreciation\nexpense in the condensed consolidated statement of income (loss) for the three and six months ended August 3, 2024.\nUnder the operational related assistance grants, MTEX commits to research and development projects that the Portuguese\ngovernment partially reimburses. We have recognized $0.3 million of grant revenue for our operational related assistance grants which\nis offset against the expenditures recognized for those grants and is included in Selling and Marketing expense in the accompanying\ncondensed consolidated statement of income (loss) for the three and six months ended August 3, 2024.\n17\nNote 13 – Share-Based Compensation\nWe have one equity incentive plan from which we are authorized to grant equity awards, the AstroNova, Inc. 2018 Equity\nIncentive Plan (the “2018 Plan”). The 2018 Plan provides for, among other things, the issuance of awards, including incentive stock\noptions, non-qualified stock options, stock appreciation rights, time-based restricted stock units (“RSUs”), or performance-based\nrestricted stock units (“PSUs”) and restricted stock awards (“RSAs”). At the June 6, 2023 annual meeting of shareholders, the 2018\nPlan was amended to increase the number of shares of our common stock available for issuance by 600,000, bringing the total number\nof shares available for issuance under the 2018 Plan from 950,000 to 1,550,000. Under the 2018 Plan, we may also issue an additional\nnumber of shares equal to the number of shares subject to outstanding awards under our prior 2015 Equity Incentive Plan that are\nforfeited, canceled, satisfied without the issuance of stock, otherwise terminated (other than by exercise), or, for shares of stock issued\npursuant to any unvested award, that are reacquired by us at not more than the grantee’s purchase price (other than by exercise).\nUnder the 2018 Plan, all awards to employees generally have a minimum vesting period of one year. Options granted under the 2018\nPlan must be issued at an exercise price of not less than the fair market value of our common stock on the date of grant and expire\nafter ten years. Under the 2018 Plan, there were 123,696 unvested RSUs;125,627 unvested PSUs; and options to purchase an\naggregate of 130,500 shares outstanding as of August 3, 2024.\nIn addition to the 2018 Plan, we previously granted equity awards under our 2015 Equity Incentive Plan (the “2015 Plan”) and\nour 2007 Equity Incentive Plan (the “2007 Plan”). No new awards may be issued under either the 2007 Plan or 2015 Plan, but\noutstanding awards will continue to be governed by those plans. As of August 3, 2024, options to purchase an aggregate of 181,649\nshares were outstanding under the 2007 Plan and options to purchase an aggregate of 112,600 shares were outstanding under the 2015\nPlan.\nWe also have a Non-Employee Director Annual Compensation Program (the “Program”) under which each non-employee\ndirector receives an automatic grant of RSAs on the date of the regular full meeting of the Board of Directors held each fiscal quarter.\nUnder the Program, the number of whole shares to be granted each quarter is equal to 25% of the number calculated by dividing the\ndirector’s annual compensation amount, by the fair market value of our stock on such day. On June 11, 2024, the director’s annual\ncompensation amount was adjusted to be $72,800. All RSA’s granted under this Program vest immediately.\nShare-based compensation expense was recognized as follows:\nThree Months Ended Six Months Ended\nAugust 3, July 29, August 3, July 29,\n(In thousands) 2024 2023 2024 2023\nStock Options $ — $ — $ — $ —\nRestricted Stock Awards and Restricted Stock Units 470 391 789 743\nEmployee Stock Purchase Plan 11 7 17 11\nTotal $ 481 $ 398 $ 806 $ 754\nStock Options\nAggregated information regarding stock option activity for the six months ended August 3, 2024, is summarized below:\nNumber of Weighted Average\nOptions Exercise Price\nOutstanding at January 31, 2024 523,349 $ 15.26\nGranted — —\nExercised (65,900) 13.86\nForfeited (27,700) 14.91\nCanceled (5,000) 13.80\nOutstanding at August 3, 2024 424,749 $ 15.51\nSet forth below is a summary of options outstanding at August 3, 2024:\nOutstanding Exercisable\nWeighted-\nWeighted- Average Weighted- Weighted\nNumber Average Remaining Number Average Average\nRange of of Exercise Contractual of Exercise Remaining\nExercise prices Shares Price Life Shares Price Contractual Life\n$10.01-15.00 218,274 $ 13.71 2.1 218,274 $ 13.71 2.1\n$15.01-20.00 206,475 $ 17.42 3.3 206,475 $ 17.42 3.3\n424,749 $ 15.51 2.7 424,749 $ 15.51 2.7\n18\nThere were no stock options granted in fiscal 2024, or during the first six months of fiscal 2025, and as of August 3, 2024, there\nwas no unrecognized compensation expense related to stock options.\nRestricted Stock Units (RSUs), Performance-Based Stock Units (PSUs) and Restricted Stock Awards (RSAs)\nAggregated information regarding RSU, PSU and RSA activity for the six months ended August 3, 2024, is summarized below:\nWeighted Average\nRSUs, PSUs & RSAs Grant Date Fair Value\nOutstanding at January 31, 2024 300,705 $ 12.90\nGranted 76,988 17.47\nVested (82,389) 13.79\nForfeited (45,981) 12.63\nOutstanding at August 3, 2024 249,323 $ 13.20\nAs of August 3, 2024, there was approximately $1.8 million of unrecognized compensation expense related to RSUs, PSUs and\nRSAs, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 1.1 years.\nEmployee Stock Purchase Plan (ESPP)\nOur ESPP allows eligible employees to purchase shares of common stock at a 15% discount from fair value on the first or last\nday of an offering period, whichever is less.

During the\nsix months ended August 3, 2024, there were 4,942 shares purchased under the ESPP and there are 20,116 shares remaining available\nfor purchase under the ESPP as of August 3, 2024.\nNote 14 – Income Taxes\nOur effective tax rates are as follows:\nThree Months Six Months\nEnded Ended\nFiscal 2025 (522.0)% (24.9)%\nFiscal 2024 19.4% 21.5%\nWe determine our estimated annual effective tax rate at the end of each interim period based on full-year forecasted pre-tax\nincome and facts known at that time. The estimated annual effective tax rate is applied to the year-to-date pre-tax income at the end of\neach interim period with the cumulative effect of any changes in the estimated annual effective tax rate being recorded in the fiscal\nquarter in which the change is determined. The tax effect of significant unusual items is reflected in the period in which they occur.\nDuring the three months ended August 3, 2024, we recognized an income tax expense of $261,000. The effective tax rate in this\nperiod was directly impacted by the return to provision associated with our fiscal 2023 amended federal tax return which resulted in a\n$447,000 increase to tax expense. Additional impacts on the effective tax rate included a $162,000 tax benefit related to foreign return\nto provision differences and a $13,000 tax benefit arising from windfall tax benefits related to our stock. During the three months\nended July 29, 2023, we recognized an income tax benefit of $390,000. The effective tax rate in this period was directly impacted by\nour jurisdictional mix of earnings, a $29,000 tax expense related to foreign return to provision differences and a $20,675 tax arising\nfrom windfall tax benefits related to our stock.\nDuring the six months ended August 3, 2024, we recognized an income tax benefit of $173,000. The effective tax rate in this\nperiod was directly impacted by a $124,000 tax benefit related to a previous unrecorded reduction in our future income tax payable\nbalance that should have been discretely recognized in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2024, netted with the current quarter tax\nexpense related to amending our fiscal year 2023 federal tax return. Additional impacts on the effective tax rate include a $162,000 tax\nbenefit related to foreign return to provision differences and an $88,000 tax benefit arising from windfall tax benefits related to our\nstock. During the six months ended July 29, 2023, we recognized an income tax benefit of $211,000. The effective tax rate in this\nperiod was directly impacted by our jurisdictional mix of earnings, a $77,000 tax benefit related to the expiration of the statute of\nlimitations on a previously uncertain tax position, a $49,000 tax benefit arising from windfall tax benefits related to our stock, and a\n$29,000 tax expense related to foreign return to provision differences.\n19\nNote 15 – Segment Information\nWe report two segments: PI and T&M.

The fair\nvalue of the contingent consideration involves significant inputs not observable in the market and is therefore considered a Level 3\nmeasurement. Refer to Note 3, “Acquisition,” for a discussion of fair value as it relates to our acquisition of MTEX.\n20\nNote 17 - Restructuring\nOn July 26, 2023, we adopted a restructuring plan for our Product Identification segment. As part of the restructuring plan, we\ntransitioned a portion of the printer manufacturing within our Product Identification segment from our facilities in Rhode Island to our\nAstro Machine, Inc. facility located in Illinois. In addition, we ceased selling certain of our older, lower-margin or low-volume\nProduct Identification segment products. As part of the restructuring plan, we consolidated certain of our international Product\nIdentification sales and distribution facilities, streamlined our channel partner network, and also made targeted reductions to our\nworkforce. As of January 31, 2024, we completed this plan.\nAs a result of the adoption and implementation of our Product Identification segment restructuring plan, in the second quarter of\nour fiscal year 2024 we recognized pre-tax restructuring charge of $2.7 million, comprised primarily of non-cash charges related to\ninventory write-offs associated with product curtailment and discontinuation and facility exit related costs, and cash charges related to\nseverance-related costs.

In order to remedy these issues and maintain\nsolid customer relationships, during the second quarter of fiscal 2024, we initiated a program to retrofit all of the printers sold to our\ncustomers that were affected by the faulty ink.\nUpon initiating this program, we identified approximately 150 printers sold to our customers that were affected by the faulty ink.\nWe began to work with our customers to either repair or replace the affected printers and did this on a gradual basis beginning in the\nsecond quarter of fiscal 2024 through March 2024. The initial estimated costs associated with this program at July 29, 2023 was $0.9\nmillion, which included the cost of parts, labor and travel. Those costs were recognized and recorded in the second quarter of fiscal\n2024 and are included in cost of revenue in the accompanying consolidated statement of income (loss) for the three and six months\nended July 29, 2023.\n(in thousands)\nProvision for Product Retrofit Program $ 852\nCost of Repairs and Replacements incurred through July 29, 2023 (149)\nBalance at July 29, 2023 $ 703\nThis program was concluded by the end of fiscal 2024 and there was no balance in the related liability for this program at\nJanuary 31, 2024.\n21\nItem 2. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF\nOPERATIONS\nBusiness Overview\nThis section should be read in conjunction with our condensed consolidated financial statements included elsewhere herein and\nour Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2024.\nWe are a multinational enterprise that leverages our proprietary data visualization technologies to design, develop, manufacture,\ndistribute and service a broad range of products that acquire, store, analyze and present data in multiple formats. We organize our\nstructure around a core set of competencies, including research and development, manufacturing, service, marketing and distribution.\nWe market and sell our products and services through the following two segments:\n• Product Identification (“PI”) – offers color and monochromatic digital label printers, direct-to-package printers and\ncustom OEM printers. PI also provides software to design, manage and print labeling and packaging images locally\nand across networked printing systems, as well as all related printing supplies such as pressure sensitive labels,\ntags, inks, toners and thermal transfer ribbons used by digital printers. PI also provides on-site and remote service,\nspare parts and various service contracts.\n• Test and Measurement (“T&M”) – offers a suite of products and services that acquire data from local and\nnetworked data streams and sensors as well as wired and wireless networks. The T&M segment includes a line of\naerospace printers that are used to print hard copies of data required for the safe and efficient operation of aircraft\nincluding navigation maps, clearances, arrival and departure procedures, flight itineraries, weather maps,\nperformance data, passenger data, and various air traffic control data. Aerospace products also include aircraft\nnetworking systems for high-speed onboard data transfer. T&M also provides repairs, service and spare parts.\nWe market and sell our products and services globally through a diverse distribution structure of direct sales personnel,\nmanufacturers’ representatives and authorized dealers that deliver a full complement of branded products and services to customers in\nour respective markets. Our growth strategy centers on organic growth through product innovation made possible by research and\ndevelopment initiatives, as well as strategic acquisitions that fit into or complement existing core businesses.\nOn May 4, 2024, we entered into an agreement to acquire MTEX New Solution, S.A., (“MTEX”), a Portugal-based\nmanufacturer of digital printing equipment that address a wide variety of markets and application including textiles, packaging,\nlabeling, apparel, footwear and more. We reported MTEX as a part of our PI segment as of the May 6, 2024 closing date. Refer to\nNote 3, “Acquisition” in our condensed consolidated financial statements located elsewhere in this report for further details.\nResults of Operations\nThree Months Ended August 3, 2024 vs. Three Months Ended July 29, 2023\nRevenue by segment and current quarter percentage change over the prior year for the three months ended August 3, 2024 and\nJuly 29, 2023 were:\n% Change\nAs a As a Compared\nAugust 3, % of July 29, % of to\n(Dollars in thousands) 2024 Revenue 2023 Revenue Prior Year\nPI $ 27,165 67.0% $ 25,777 72.6% 5.4%\nT&M 13,374 33.0% 9,747 27.4% 37.2%\nTotal $ 40,539 100.0% $ 35,524 100.0% 14.1%\nRevenue for the second quarter of the current year was $40.5 million, representing a 14.1% increase compared to the previous\nyear's second quarter revenue of $35.5 million. Revenue through domestic channels for the second quarter of the current year was\n$23.8 million, an increase of 18.2% from the prior year’s second quarter domestic revenue of $20.1 million. International revenue for\nthe second quarter of the current year was $16.8 million, representing 41.3% of our second quarter revenue and reflects an 8.8%\nincrease from the previous year's second quarter international revenue. International revenue for the second quarter of the current year\nreflected an unfavorable foreign exchange rate impact of $0.2 million.\nHardware revenue in the second quarter of the current year was $12.4 million, a 9.7% increase compared to the prior year’s\nsecond quarter hardware revenue of $11.3 million. The current quarter increase is attributable to hardware sales in the T&M segment\nwhich increased $2.1 million or 34.3% compared to the same period in the prior year. The increase in current quarter T&M hardware\nsales was primarily due to an increase in aerospace printer sales and to a lesser degree, an increase in the current quarter data recorder\nsales. The overall increase in hardware sales was partially offset by a $1.0 million or 18.3% decrease in hardware sales in our PI\nsegment, primarily due to a delay in hardware sales shipments in the current quarter.\n22\nSupplies revenue in the second quarter of the current year was $22.3 million, a 13.4% increase compared to the prior year’s\nsecond quarter supplies revenue of $19.7 million. The current quarter increase in supplies revenue is primarily attributable to an\nincrease in sales of Trojan Label supplies and, to a lesser degree, an increase in sales of ink jet supplies in our QuickLabel product\nline(cid:0)(cid:15)(cid:0)(cid:3)both in the PI segment. Increased sales of paper supplies in T&M’s aerospace product line also contributed to the overall\nincrease in supplies revenue for the current year.\nService and other revenues of $5.8 million in the current quarter increased 28.1% compared to service and other revenues of\n$4.6 million in the second quarter of the prior year. Current quarter service and other revenue increased in both the PI and T&M\nsegments, but was primarily due to an increase in aerospace printer repairs and parts revenue in the T&M segment.\nThe current year's second quarter gross profit was $14.3 million, a 47.5% increase compared to the prior year’s second quarter\ngross profit of $9.7 million. Current quarter gross profit margin of 35.3% reflects an 8.0 percentage point increase from the prior\nyear’s second quarter gross profit margin of 27.3%. The higher gross profit margin for the current quarter compared to the prior year’s\nsecond quarter is primarily attributable to the impact of $2.0 million of restructuring costs for second quarter of fiscal 2024, as well as\nhigher sales and favorable pricing and product mix in the current quarter.\nOperating expenses for the current quarter were $13.3 million, a 21.6% increase compared to the prior year’s second quarter\noperating expenses of $10.9 million. Current quarter selling and marketing expenses were $6.7 million, a 0.5% increase compared to\nthe second quarter of the prior year. The increase for the current quarter was primarily due to increases in wages, benefits, travel and\nentertainment, commissions and advertising and trade show expenses, which were partially offset by the absence of prior restructuring\nfees that were incurred in the second quarter of the prior year. Current quarter general and administrative (“G&A”) expenses were\n$5.1 million, a 93.0% increase compared to the second quarter of the prior year, primarily due to an increase in outside services, which\nincludes MTEX acquisition costs and the CFO transition costs. Also contributing to the increase in G&A expenses was an increase in\nemployee wages, benefits and professional fees. Research and development (“R&D”) expenses were $1.4 million in the current\nquarter, a 9.3% decrease compared to the second quarter of the prior year, primarily due to decreases in employee wages. The\ndecrease in R&D expense for the current quarter was partially offset by increases in supplies and repairs and outside services. R&D\nspending as a percentage of revenue for the current quarter was 3.5% as compared to 4.4% for the same period in the prior year.\nOther expenses in the second quarter of the current year were $1.1 million, an increase of 37.3% compared to the same period in\nthe prior year. Current quarter other expense includes interest expense on our term debt and revolving line of credit of $0.9 million,\nand $0.2 million of net foreign exchange loss. Other expense in the second quarter of the prior year of $0.8 million includes interest\nexpense on our term debt and revolving line of credit of $0.7 million, and a net foreign exchange loss of $0.2 million, offset by other\nincome of $0.1 million.\nWe recognized a federal, state and foreign income tax provision for the second quarter of the current year of $0.3 million\nresulting in an effective tax rate of (522.0)%. The effective tax rate in this period was directly impacted by the return to provision\nassociated with our fiscal year 2023 amended federal tax return which resulted in a $447,000 increase to tax expense. Additional\nimpacts on the effective tax rate included a $162,000 tax benefit related to foreign return to provision differences and a $13,000 tax\nbenefit arising from windfall tax benefits related to our stock. During the three months ended July 29, 2023, we recognized a federal,\nstate and foreign income tax benefit of $0.4 million resulting in an effective tax rate of 19.4%. The effective tax rate in this period was\ndirectly impacted by our jurisdictional mix of earnings, a $29,000 tax expense related to foreign return to provision differences and a\n$20,675 tax arising from windfall tax benefits related to our stock.\nWe reported net loss of $0.3 million or $0.04 per diluted share for the second quarter of the current year. Net income and net\nincome per diluted share for the quarter ended August 3, 2024 were impacted by inventory step-up cost of $0.1 million ($0.1 million\nnet of tax or $ 0.01 per diluted share) and transaction costs of $0.6 million ($0.5 million net of tax or $0.06 per diluted share), both\nrelated to the MTEX acquisition, and CFO transition charges of $0.4 million ($0.3 million net of tax or $0.05 million per diluted\nshare). On a comparable basis, net loss for the prior year’s second quarter was $1.6 million or $0.22 per diluted share. The results for\nthis period were impacted by an expense of $2.7 million ($2.0 million net of tax or $0.28 per diluted share) related to the restructuring plan\nand expense of $0.9 million ($0.7 million net of tax or $0.09 per diluted share) related to the product retrofit program.\n23\nSix Months Ended August 4, 2024 vs. Six Months Ended July 29, 2023\nRevenue by segment and current period percentage change over the prior year for the six months ended August 3, 2024 and July\n29, 2023 were:\n% Change\nAs a As a Compared\nAugust 3, % of July 29, % of to\n(Dollars in thousands) 2023 Revenue 2023 Revenue Prior Year\nProduct Identification $ 50,350 68.5% $ 50,872 71.7% (1.0)%\nT&M 23,150 31.5% 20,071 28.3% 15.3%\nTotal $ 73,500 100.0% $ 70,943 100.0% 3.6%\nRevenue for the first six months of the current year was $73.5 million, representing a 3.6% increase compared to the previous\nyear’s first six months revenue. Revenue through domestic channels for the first half of the current year was $43.3 million, an increase\nof 6.2% from prior year’s domestic revenue of $40.8 million. International revenue for the first six months of the current year was\n$30.2 million, a 0.1% increase from the previous year’s international revenue of $30.1 million. International revenue for the first six\nmonths of the current year reflected an unfavorable foreign exchange rate impact of $0.2 million.\nHardware revenue in the first six months of the current year was $21.2 million, a 7.4% decrease compared to the prior year’s\nfirst six months hardware revenue of $22.9 million. The current year's decrease is primarily attributable to the decline in hardware\nsales in the PI segment, as current year hardware sales in the PI segment were $8.1 million, a decrease of 22.1% or $2.3 million\ncompared to the previous year's PI hardware sales of $10.4 million. This decrease was the primarily the result of a delay in shipments\nof in the current year. T&M hardware sales for the current year were $13.1 million, a 4.8% increase from the prior year’s T&M\nhardware sales of $12.5 million, due to an increase in sales in both our aerospace printer and data recorder product lines.\nSupplies revenue in the first half of the current year was $41.0 million, representing a 5.7% increase over the prior year’s six\nmonths supplies revenue of $38.8 million, as supplies revenue increased in both the PI and T&M segments in the current year. The\nincrease was primarily due to an increase in supplies sales of our Trojan Label products. Also contributing to the increase in the\ncurrent year’s supplies revenue was an increase in paper revenue for the aerospace printers product line in the T&M segment. The\noverall increase in supplies revenue for the current quarter was partially offset to a large degree due to a decline in QuickLabel\nsupplies sales in the PI segment.\nService and other revenues were $11.3 million in the first six months of the current year, a 22.2% increase compared to the prior\nyear’s first six months service and other revenues of $9.2 million. The increase is due primarily to a $1.8 million or 33.8% increase in\nparts and repairs revenue in the aerospace printer product line in the T&M segment.\nGross profit for the first six months of the current year was $26.3 million, a 19.0% increase compared to the prior year’s gross\nprofit of $22.1 million. Our gross profit margin of 35.8% in the current year reflects a 4.7 percentage point increase from the prior\nyear’s first six months gross profit margin of 31.1%. The increase in gross profit and related profit margin for the current year\ncompared to the prior year is primarily attributable to higher sales and $2.1 million of restructuring costs and $0.9 million of product\nretrofit costs recognized in the prior year that did not repeat in the current year.\nOperating expenses for the first six months of the current fiscal year were $23.9 million, a 9.4% increase compared to the prior\nyear’s first six months operating expenses of $21.8 million. Selling and marketing expenses for the current year were $12.4 million, a\ndecrease of 2.5% compared to the previous year’s $12.7 million. The decrease for the current year was primarily due a decline in to\nemployee benefits expenses and the impact of the prior year’s restructuring costs. The decrease in Selling and Marketing was partially\noffset by increases in wages, benefits, travel and entertainment, commissions and advertising and trade show fees. G&A expenses\nincreased 46.9% to $8.5 million in the first six months of the current year compared to $5.8 million in the first six months of the prior\nyear, primarily due to an increase in outside services fees, which includes MTEX acquisition costs and CFO transition costs. Also\ncontributing to the increase in G&A expenses was an increase in wages, employee fees and advertising and trade show fees. R&D\nspending in the first six months of the current year was $3.0 million, a 9.9% decrease compared to the prior year’s first six months\nspend of $3.3 million, as declines in employee wages were partially offset by increases in fees for outside services, testing and\nconsulting. Current year spending on R&D represents 4.1% of revenue compared to the prior year’s first six months level of 4.7%.\nOther expenses during the first six months of the current year were $1.7 million compared to $1.2 million in the first six months\nof the previous year. Current year other expense includes interest expense on our term debt and revolving line of credit of $1.4 million\nand foreign exchange losses of $0.3 million. Other expenses for the first six months of the prior year included interest expense on term\ndebt and revolving line of credit of $1.3million, offset by other income of $0.1 million.\nWe recognized a $0.2 million income tax benefit for the first six months of the current fiscal year, resulting in an effective tax\nrate of (24.9)%. The effective tax rate was directly impacted by a $124,000 tax benefit related to a previously unrecorded reduction in\nour future income tax payable balance that should have been discretely recognized in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2024, netted with\nthe current quarter tax expense related to amending our fiscal year federal tax return. Additional impacts on the effective tax rate\n24\ninclude a $162,000 tax benefit related to foreign return to provision differences and an $88,000 tax benefit arising from windfall tax\nbenefits related to our stock. We recognized $0.2 million of income tax benefit for the first six months of the prior fiscal year,\nresulting in an effective tax rate of 21.5%. The effective tax rate was directly impacted by our jurisdictional mix of earnings, a $77,000\ntax benefit related to the expiration of the statute of limitations on a previously uncertain tax position, a $49,000 tax benefit arising\nfrom windfall tax benefits related to our stock, and a $29,000 tax expense related to foreign return to provision differences.\nWe reported net income of $0.9 million, or $0.11 per diluted share, for the first six months of the current year. Net income and\nnet income per diluted share for the six months ended August 3, 2024 were impacted by inventory step up cost of $0.1 million ($0.1\nmillion net of tax or $ 0.01 per diluted share) and transaction costs of $0.6 million ($0.5 million net of tax or $0.06 per diluted share),\nboth related to the MTEX acquisition and CFO transition charges of $0.4 million ($0.3 million net of tax or $0.05 million per diluted\nshare). On a comparable basis, we reported a net loss of $0.8 million, or $0.10 per diluted share, for the first six months of the prior\nyear. The results for this period were impacted by expense of $2.7 million ($2.0 million net of tax or $0.28 per diluted share) related to\nthe restructuring plan and expense of $0.9 million ($0.7 million net of tax or $0.09 per diluted share) related to the product retrofit\nprogram.\nSegment Analysis\nWe report two segments: PI and T&M and evaluate segment performance based on the segment profit before corporate and\nfinancial administration expenses. Summarized below are the Revenue and Segment Operating Profit for each reporting segment:\nThree Months Ended Six Months Ended\nSegment Operating Profit Segment Operating Profit\nRevenue (Loss) Revenue (Loss)\nAugust 3, July 29, August 3, July 29, August 3, July 29, August 3, July 29,\n(In thousands) 2024 2023 2024 2023 2024 2023 2024 2023\nPI $ 27,165 $ 25,777 $ 2,348 $ (461) $ 50,350 $ 50,872 $ 5,340 $ 2,055\nT&M 13,374 9,747 3,834 1,917 23,150 20,071 5,555 3,989\nTotal $ 40,539 $ 35,524 6,182 1,456 $ 73,500 $ 70,943 10,895 6,044\nCorporate Expenses 5,121 2,654 8,488 5,780\nOperating Income\n(Expense) 1,061 (1,198) 2,407 264\nOther Income (Expense),\nnet (1,111) (809) (1,711) (1,244)\nIncome (Loss) Before\nIncome Taxes (50) (2,007) 696 (980)\nIncome Tax Provision\n(Benefit) 261 (390) (173) (211)\nNet Income (Loss) $ (311) $ (1,617) $ 869 $ (769)\nProduct Identification-PI\nRevenue from the PI segment increased $1.4 million or 5.4%, in the second quarter of the current year, with revenue of $27.2\nmillion compared to $25.8 million in the same period of the prior year. The current quarter increase is primarily attributable to an\nincrease in supplies sales in the Trojan Label and QuickLabel product lines and the contribution of sales from our newly acquired\nMTEX subsidiary. This increase was partially offset by declines in hardware sales due to a delay in shipments in the current quarter.\nWe expect revenue growth will become positive going forward as the delayed shipments of hardware products will be made in the\nthird quarter of the current year, along with the continuing contribution from the MTEX acquisition. The PI segment recognized a\ncurrent quarter segment operating income of $2.3 million, reflecting a profit margin of 8.6%. This compares to the prior year’s second\nquarter segment loss of $0.5 million and related loss margin of 1.8%. The increase in the current year second quarter PI segment\noperating profit and margin is primarily due to higher sales, lower manufacturing expenses as a result of the fiscal 2024 restructuring\nand product retrofit program costs and a favorable product mix.\nRevenue from the PI segment decreased by $0.5 million or 1.0% to $50.4 million in the first six months of the current year from\n$50.9 million in the same period of the prior year. The current year’s decrease is primarily due to the decline of hardware sales as a\nresult of delayed shipments. The current year’s decrease in PI revenue was offset by an increase in revenue from Trojan Label\nsupplies. The current year's first six months of PI segment operating profit was $5.3 million with a profit margin of 10.6%, compared\nto the first six months of the prior year’s segment operating profit of $2.1 million and related profit margin of 4.0% . The increase in\ncurrent year's PI segment operating profit and margin is primarily due to the lower manufacturing expenses as a result of the fiscal\n2024 restructuring plan and product retrofit program costs and a favorable product mix.\n25\nTest & Measurement—T&M\nRevenue from the T&M segment was $13.4 million for the second quarter of the current fiscal year, representing a $3.6 million\nor 37.2% increase compared to revenue of $9.7 million for the same period in the prior year. The increase in revenue for the current\nquarter is primarily attributable to an increase in sales of certain of our new, more advanced Tough Writer-branded printers in the\naerospace printer product line, as well as increases in supplies, parts and repairs revenue also in our aerospace product lines. T&M’s\nsecond quarter segment operating profit was $3.8 million, reflecting a profit margin of 28.7%, compared to the prior year second\nquarter segment operating profit of $1.9 million and related operating margin of 19.7%. The increase in T&M’s current year second\nquarter segment operating profit margin is due to $1.0 million in revenue and $1.3 million in operating profit related to non-recurring\nitems.\nRevenue from the T&M segment was $23.2 million for the first six months of the current fiscal year, a $3.1 million or 15.3%\nincrease compared to sales of $20.1 million for the same period in the prior year. The increase in revenue for the current year was\nprimarily attributable to strong hardware sales in our aerospace product lines as a result of increased aerospace printer product unit\nvolume and to a lesser extent increased sales of our data recorder hardware. Demand for printers, especially for narrow-body aircraft,\nhas increased due to the post-pandemic recovery in air travel demand, which has driven new orders of airplanes and a corresponding\nincrease in production rates. Also contributing to the current year increase in T&M revenue was an increase in supplies, parts and\nrepairs revenue in our aerospace product lines. T&M ’s first six months segment operating profit of $5.6 million resulted in a 24.0%\noperating margin compared to the prior year’s segment operating profit of $4.0 million and related operating margin of 19.9%. The\nincrease in T&M’s current year segment operating margin is due to$1.0 million in revenue and $1.3 million in operating profit related\nto non-recurring items.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOverview\nHistorically, our primary sources of liquidity have been cash generated from operating activities and borrowings under our\nrevolving credit facility. These sources have also usually funded the majority of our capital expenditures and contractual contingent\nconsideration obligations. We have funded acquisitions by borrowing under bank term loan facilities.\nWe believe cash flow generation from operations and available unused credit capacity under our credit facility will support our\nanticipated needs. Additionally, as discussed below, we entered into a revised credit agreement with our lender to finance our\nacquisition of MTEX. In fiscal 2025 (after required debt amortization and payment of minimum guaranteed royalty payments to\nHoneywell), we plan to focus on inventory reduction and reduction of debt outstanding under our credit agreement, to the degree\npracticable and as constrained by supply chain management challenges.\nIn connection with our acquisition of MTEX, on May 6, 2024, we entered a Third Amendment to Amended and Restated\nCredit Agreement (the “Amendment”) with Bank of America, N.A., as lender (the “Lender”). The Amendment amended the Amended\nand Restated Credit Agreement dated as of July 30, 2020, as amended by the First Amendment to Amended and Restated Credit\nAgreement, dated as of March 24, 2021, the LIBOR Transition Amendment, dated as of December 14, 2021, the Second Amendment\nto Amended and Restated Credit Agreement dated as of August 4, 2022, and the Joinder Agreement relating to Astro Machine dated as\nof August 26, 2022 (the “Existing Credit Agreement”; the Existing Credit Agreement as amended by the Amendment, the “Amended\nCredit Agreement”), between AstroNova, Inc. as the borrower, Astro Machine as a guarantor, and the Lender.\nThe Amended Credit Agreement provides for (i) a new term loan to AstroNova, Inc.in the principal amount of EUR 14.0 million\n(the “Term A-2 Loan”), which term loan is in addition to the existing term loan (the “Existing Term Loan”) outstanding under the\nExisting Credit Agreement in the principal amount of approximately $12.3 million as of the effective date of the Amendment, and (ii)\nan increase in the aggregate principal amount of the revolving credit facility available to AstroNova, Inc. from $25.0 million to $30.0\nmillion until January 31, 2025, upon and after which the aggregate principal amount of the revolving credit facility will reduce to\n$25.0 million. At the closing of the Amendment, we borrowed the entire EUR 14.0 million Term A-2 Loan and EUR 3.0 million and a\nUS dollar amount which was converted to Euros to satisfy the entire purchase price for MTEX payable on the closing date. The\nrevolving credit facility may otherwise be used for general corporate purposes. The revolving credit loans may continue to be\nborrowed, at our option, in U.S. Dollars or, subject to certain conditions, Euros, British Pounds, Canadian Dollars or Danish Kroner.\nAt August 3, 2024 our cash and cash equivalents were $4.8 million. We have borrowed $13.0 million on our revolving line of\ncredit and have $17.0 million available for borrowing under that facility as of August 3, 2024. Additionally, our recent MTEX\nacquisition has a EUR 0.5 million ($0.5 million) available line of credit with Caixa Central de Crédito Agricola Mutuo. This credit line\nwas established in December 2023 and is renewable every six months. There was EUR 0.3 million ($0.4 million) outstanding on this\nline of credit as of August 3, 2024.\n26\nIndebtedness\nTerm Loan\nThe Amended Credit Agreement requires that the Term A-2 Loan be paid in quarterly installments on the last day of each of our\nfiscal quarters through April 30, 2027 in the principal amount of EUR 583,333 each, and the entire then-remaining principal balance of\nthe Term A-2 Loan is required to be paid on August 4, 2027. The Amended Credit Agreement requires that the remaining balance of\nthe Existing Term Loan be paid in quarterly installments on the last day of each of our fiscal quarters through April 30, 2027 in the\nprincipal amount of $675,000 each, and the entire then remaining principal balance of the term loan is required to be paid on August 4,\n2027. We may voluntarily prepay the Term A-2 Term Loan or the Existing Term Loan, in whole or in part, from time to time without\npremium or penalty (other than customary breakage costs, if applicable). We may repay borrowings under the revolving credit facility\nat any time without premium or penalty (other than customary breakage costs, if applicable), but in any event no later than August 4,\n2027, and any outstanding revolving loans thereunder will be due and payable in full, and the revolving credit facility will terminate,\non such date. We may reduce or terminate the revolving line of credit at any time, subject to certain thresholds and conditions, without\npremium or penalty.\nThe loans under the Amended Credit Agreement are subject to certain mandatory prepayments, subject to various exceptions,\nfrom (a) net cash proceeds from certain dispositions of property, (b) net cash proceeds from certain issuances of equity, (c) net cash\nproceeds from certain issuances of additional debt and (d) net cash proceeds from certain extraordinary receipts.\nAmounts repaid under the revolving credit facility may be reborrowed, subject to our continued compliance with the Amended\nCredit Agreement. No amount of the Term A-2 Loan or the Existing Term Loan that is repaid may be reborrowed.\nThe Term A-2 Loan bears interest at a rate per annum equal to the EURIBOR rate as defined in the Amended Credit Agreement,\nplus a margin that varies within a range of 1.60% to 2.50% based on our consolidated leverage ratio. The Existing Term Loan and\nrevolving credit loans bear interest at a rate per annum equal to, at our option, either (a) the Term SOFR rate as defined in the\nAmended Credit Agreement (or, in the case of revolving credit loans denominated in Euros or another currency other than U.S.\nDollars, the applicable quoted rate), plus a margin that varies within a range of 1.60% to 2.50% based on our consolidated leverage\nratio, or (b) a fluctuating reference rate equal to the highest of (i) the federal fund rate plus 0.50%, (ii) Bank of America’s publicly\nannounced prime rate, (iii) the Term SOFR Rate plus 1.00%, or (iv) 0.50%, plus a margin that varies within a range of 0.60% to 1.50%\nbased on our consolidated leverage ratio. In addition to certain other fees and expenses that we are required to pay to the Lender, we\nare required to pay a commitment fee on the undrawn portion of the revolving credit facility that varies within a range of 0.15% and\n0.35% based on our consolidated leverage ratio.\nWe must comply with various customary financial and non-financial covenants under the Amended Credit Agreement. The\nfinancial covenants under the Amended Credit Agreement consist of a maximum consolidated leverage ratio and a minimum\nconsolidated fixed charge coverage ratio, certain of the provisions of which were modified by the Amendment; the minimum\nconsolidated asset coverage ratio under the Existing Credit Agreement was eliminated by the Amendment. The primary non-financial\ncovenants limit our and our subsidiaries’ ability to incur future indebtedness, to place liens on assets, to pay dividends or distributions\non our or our subsidiaries’ capital stock, to repurchase or acquire our or our subsidiaries’ capital stock, to conduct mergers or\nacquisitions, to sell assets, to alter our or our subsidiaries’ capital structure, to make investments and loans, to change the nature of our\nor our subsidiaries’ business, and to prepay subordinated indebtedness, in each case subject to certain exceptions and thresholds as set\nforth in the Amended Credit Agreement, certain of which provisions were modified by the Amendment. As of August 3, 2024, we\nbelieve we are in compliance with all of the covenants in the Credit Agreement.\nThe Lender is entitled to accelerate repayment of the loans and to terminate its revolving credit commitment under the Amended\nCredit Agreement upon the occurrence of any of various customary events of default, which include, among other events, the\nfollowing (which are subject, in some cases, to certain grace periods): failure to pay when due any principal, interest or other amounts\nin respect of the loans, breach of any of our covenants or representations under the loan documents, default under any other of our or\nour subsidiaries’ significant indebtedness agreements, a bankruptcy, insolvency or similar event with respect to us or any of our\nsubsidiaries, a significant unsatisfied judgment against us or any of our subsidiaries, or a change of control.\nOur obligations under the Amended Credit Agreement continue to be secured by substantially all of our personal property assets\n(including a pledge of the equity interests we hold in ANI Scandinavia ApS, AstroNova GmbH, AstroNova SAS and the Purchaser),\nsubject to certain exceptions, and by a mortgage on our owned real property in West Warwick, Rhode Island, and are guaranteed by,\nand secured by substantially all of the personal property assets of Astro Machine.\nEquipment Loan\nIn January 2024, we entered into a secured equipment loan facility agreement with Banc of America Leasing & Capital, LLC\nand borrowed the principal amount of $0.8 million thereunder for the financing of our purchase of production equipment. The loan\nmatures on January 23, 2029, and bears interest at a fixed rate of 7.06%.\n27\nAssumed Financing Obligations of MTEX\nIn connection with the purchase of MTEX, on the May 6, 2024 closing date of this acquisition we assumed certain existing\nfinancing obligations of MTEX that remain outstanding as of August 3, 2024. The long-term debt obligations of MTEX that remain\noutstanding include a term loan ( the “MTEX Term Loan”) pursuant to the agreement dated December 22, 2023, (the “MTEX Term\nLoan Agreement”) between MTEX and Caixa Central de Crédito Agricola Mutuo. The MTEX Term Loan provides for a term loan in\nthe principal amount of EUR 1.5 million ($1.6 million) and requires monthly principal and interest payments totaling EUR 17,402\n($18,795) commencing in October 2024 continuing through maturity on December 21, 2033, and bears interest at a fixed rate of\n6.022% per annum.\nMTEX has also received government assistance in the form of interest-free loans from government agencies located in Portugal\n(the “MTEX Government Grant Term Loans”). The MTEX Government Grant Term Loans are to be repaid to the applicable\ngovernment agencies and are classified as long-term debt. The current balance of the MTEX Government Grants Term Loans as of\nAugust 3, 2024 is EUR 1.3 million ($1.5 million). The MTEX Government Grant Term Loans provide interest free financing to the\nextent monthly principal payments are made. In the event that MTEX and the applicable government agency renegotiate the payment\ndates, interest will be calculated according to a rate determined by the government agency as of the date of renegotiation and added to\nthe outstanding principal payments. The MTEX Government Grants Term Loans mature between December 2024 and January 2027.\nAdditionally, we assumed short-term financing obligations of MTEX that remain outstanding as of August 3, 2024, including\nletters of credit, maturing term loans, and financing arrangements for working capital classified as debt.\nCash Flow\nOur statements of cash flows for the six months ended August 3, 2024 and July 29, 2023 are included in Part I, Item 1 of this\nQuarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Net cash provided by operating activities was $7.1 million for the first six months of fiscal 2025\ncompared to $4.7 million for the same period of the previous year. The increase in net cash provided by operations for the first six\nmonths of the current year is primarily due to an increase in cash provided by working capital. The combination of changes in\naccounts receivable, inventory, income taxes payable, accounts payable and accrued expenses increased cash by $4.9 million for the\nfirst six months of fiscal 2025, compared to an increase of $0.2 million for the same period in fiscal 2024. Cash provided by operating\nactivities for the first six months of fiscal 2024 was impacted by $2.0 million of non-cash restructuring costs.\nOur accounts receivable balance increased to $23.5 million at the end of the second quarter of fiscal 2025 compared to $23.1\nmillion at year end. Excluding the impact of the MTEX acquisition, accounts receivable decreased $3.6 million from year end. Days\nsales outstanding for the second quarter of the current year remained at 49 days, consistent with prior year end. Our inventory balance\nwas $50.6 million at the end of the second quarter of fiscal 2025, an increase compared to $46.4 million at year end. Excluding the\nimpact of the MTEX acquisition, inventories increased $0.4 million from year end. Inventory days on hand increased to 174 days at\nthe end of the current quarter from 168 days at the prior year end.\nOur cash position at August 3, 2024, was $4.8 million compared to $4.5 million at year end. The increase in cash during the\ncurrent quarter was primarily a result of cash inflows during the current year including proceeds from our long-term debt of $15.1\nmillion, borrowings on our revolving line of credit of $3.9 million and cash from operations as discussed above. These inflows were\noffset by cash paid for our acquisition of $20.7 million, principal payments on our long-term debt of $3.3 million, payment of our\nguaranteed royalty obligation of $0.8 million, and cash used for capital expenditures of $0.8 million.\nContractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies\nThere have been no material changes to our contractual obligations as disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the\nfiscal year ended January 31, 2024, other than those occurring in the ordinary course of business.\nCritical Accounting Policies, Estimates and Certain Other Matters\nThe preparation of our condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make\nestimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, and disclosure of commitments and contingencies at\nthe date of the condensed consolidated financial statements and reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period.\nWe base these estimates and judgments on factors we believe to be relevant, the results of which form the basis for making judgments\nabout the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.\nThe process of determining significant estimates is fact-specific and takes into account factors such as historical experience,\ncurrent and expected economic conditions, product mix, and in some cases, actuarial and appraisal techniques. We constantly re-\nevaluate these significant factors and make adjustments where facts and circumstances dictate.\nWhile we believe that the factors considered provide a meaningful basis for the accounting policies applied in the preparation of\nthe condensed consolidated financial statements, we cannot guarantee that our estimates and assumptions will be accurate. As the\ndetermination of these estimates requires the exercise of judgment, actual results may differ from those estimates, and such differences\n28\nmay be material to our condensed consolidated financial statements. There have been no material changes to the application of critical\naccounting policies as disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2024.\nCautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\nThis Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q may contain “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the Private Securities\nLitigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements are not statements of historical fact, but rather reflect our current\nexpectations concerning future events and results. We generally use the words “believes,” “expects,” “intends,” “plans,” “anticipates,”\n“likely,” “continues,” “may,” “will,” and similar expressions to identify forward-looking statements. Such forward-looking statements,\nincluding those concerning our expectations, involve risks, uncertainties and other factors, some of which are beyond our control,\nwhich may cause our actual results, performance or achievements to be materially different from those expressed or implied by such\nforward-looking statements. Factors which could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated include, but are not\nlimited to (a) general economic, financial, industry and business conditions; (b) the lingering impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on\nus, our customers, our suppliers and the global economy; (c) declining demand in the test and measurement markets, especially\ndefense and aerospace; (d) our ability to develop and introduce new products and achieve market acceptance of these products; (e) our\ndependance on contract manufacturers and/or single or limited source suppliers; (f) competition in the specialty printer or data\nacquisition industries; (g) our ability to obtain adequate pricing for our products and control our cost structure; (h) our ability to\nadequately enforce and protect our intellectual property, defend against assertions of infringement or loss of certain licenses; (i) the\nrisk of incurring liabilities as a result of installed product failures due to design or manufacturing defects; (j) the risk of a material\nsecurity breach of our information technology system or cybersecurity attack impacting our business and our relationship with\ncustomers; (k) our ability to attract, develop and retain key employees and manage human capital resources; (l) economic, political\nand other risks associated with international sales and operations and the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on the\nresults of operations; (m) changes in tax rates or exposure to additional income tax liabilities; (n) our ability to comply with our\ncurrent credit agreement or secure alternative financing and to otherwise manage our indebtedness; (o) our ability to successfully\nintegrate and realize the expected benefits from MTEX, Astro Machine and other acquisitions and realize benefits from divestitures;\n(p) our ability to maintain adequate self-insurance accruals or insurance coverage for employee health care benefits; (q) our\ncompliance with customer or regulators certifications and our compliance with certain governmental laws and regulations; (r) our\nability to achieve and maintain effective internal controls and procedures over financial reporting; (s) the risk that we may not\nsuccessfully execute or achieve the expected benefits of our restructuring plan for our Product Identification segment; (t) the risk that\nwe may not be able to ship delayed hardware items on the timeline we expect or at all; and (u) all other risks included under “Item 1A-\nRisk Factors” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2024. We assume no obligation to update or\nrevise any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as required by law.\nItem 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\nDuring the six months ended August 3, 2024, there were no material changes to our market risk disclosures as set forth in Part\nII, Item 7A “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended\nJanuary 31, 2024.\nItem 4.

Our disclosure controls and procedures are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information\nrequired to be disclosed by us in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act, is recorded, processed, summarized and\nreported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated\nto our senior leadership team, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, to allow timely decisions regarding\nrequired disclosures. Management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can\nprovide only reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives and management necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the\ncost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures.\nOur management, under the supervision of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has evaluated the\neffectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this quarterly report. Based on that\nevaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were\nnot effective as of August 3, 2024 as a result of the material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting described below.\n29\n(cid:0)0 (cid:0)D (cid:0)W(cid:0)H (cid:0)U (cid:0)L(cid:0)D (cid:0)O(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0): (cid:0)H (cid:0)D (cid:0)N (cid:0)Q (cid:0)H (cid:0)V (cid:0)V (cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)L(cid:0)Q (cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0), (cid:0)Q (cid:0)W(cid:0)H (cid:0)U (cid:0)Q (cid:0)D (cid:0)O(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)& (cid:0)R (cid:0)Q (cid:0)W(cid:0)U (cid:0)R (cid:0)O(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)2 (cid:0)Y (cid:0)H (cid:0)U (cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)) (cid:0)L(cid:0)Q (cid:0)D (cid:0)Q (cid:0)F (cid:0)L(cid:0)D (cid:0)O(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)5 (cid:0)H (cid:0)S (cid:0)R (cid:0)U (cid:0)W(cid:0)L(cid:0)Q (cid:0)J (cid:0)(cid:3)\nA material weakness is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting such that there is\na reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on\na timely basis. As reported in Item 9A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended January 31, 2024, our management\nconcluded that our internal control over financial reporting was ineffective because of the following material weakness:\nAs of January 31, 2024, we did not design or maintain an effective control environment to ensure the accurate and timely\nreporting of transactions related to our Astro Machine subsidiary, which was acquired August 4, 2022.\n(cid:0)3 (cid:0)O(cid:0)D (cid:0)Q (cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)I(cid:0)R (cid:0)U (cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)5 (cid:0)H (cid:0)P (cid:0)H (cid:0)G (cid:0)L(cid:0)D (cid:0)W(cid:0)L(cid:0)R (cid:0)Q (cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)R (cid:0)I(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)0 (cid:0)D (cid:0)W(cid:0)H (cid:0)U (cid:0)L(cid:0)D (cid:0)O(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0): (cid:0)H (cid:0)D (cid:0)N (cid:0)Q (cid:0)H (cid:0)V (cid:0)V (cid:0)(cid:3)\nOur management has discussed the identified material weakness with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors.\nSubsequent to January 31, 2024, we began to implement measures designed to improve internal control over financial reporting and to\nremediate our material weakness, and we are currently in the process of implementing our NetSuite ERP system at our Astro Machine\nsubsidiary and we have gone live with this implementation at the beginning of September 2024.\nOur management believes that when completed, the measures described above will be sufficient to remediate the identified\nmaterial weakness and strengthen our overall internal control over financial reporting. As our management continues to evaluate and\nwork to enhance our internal control over financial reporting, we may take additional measures to address control deficiencies, or we\nmay modify some of the remediation measures described above. The identified material weakness will not be considered remediated\nuntil the applicable remediated controls operate for a sufficient period of time and management has concluded, through testing, that\nthese controls are operating effectively.\n(cid:0)& (cid:0)K (cid:0)D (cid:0)Q (cid:0)J (cid:0)H (cid:0)V (cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)L(cid:0)Q (cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0), (cid:0)Q (cid:0)W(cid:0)H (cid:0)U (cid:0)Q (cid:0)D (cid:0)O(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)& (cid:0)R (cid:0)Q (cid:0)W(cid:0)U (cid:0)R (cid:0)O(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)R (cid:0)Y (cid:0)H (cid:0)U (cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)) (cid:0)L(cid:0)Q (cid:0)D (cid:0)Q (cid:0)F (cid:0)L(cid:0)D (cid:0)O(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)5 (cid:0)H (cid:0)S (cid:0)R (cid:0)U (cid:0)W(cid:0)L(cid:0)Q (cid:0)J (cid:0)(cid:3)\nExcept for the measures taken to remediate our identified material weakness noted above, there were no changes in our internal\ncontrol over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation required by Rules 13a-15(d) and 15d-15(d) of the\nExchange Act that occurred during the fiscal quarter ended August 3, 2024, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to\nmaterially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.\nPART II. OTHER INFORMATION\nItem 1.(cid:0)(cid:3)Legal Proceedings\nThere are no pending or threatened legal proceedings against us that we believe to be material to our financial position or results\nof operations.\nItem 1A. Risk Factors\nIn addition to the other information set forth in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, one should carefully consider the factors\ndiscussed in Part I, Item 1A “Risk Factors” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2024, which\ncould materially affect our business, financial condition or future operating results.
