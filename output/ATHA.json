This novel, oral, next-generation HGF-modulating drug candidate has improved blood-brain-barrier penetration and pharmacokinetic properties. Specifically, preclinically ATH-1105 has shown a consistent ability in various ALS models to reduce plasma neurofilament light chain (NfL) levels, a key marker of ALS disease progression, and to improve motor and nerve function, enhance neuronal survival, and improve biomarkers of inflammation and neurodegeneration,“ said Mark Litton, Ph.D., President and Chief Executive Officer of Athira. “We continue to progress ATH-1105 in the ongoing Phase 1 study in healthy volunteers, which is targeted to complete by year end, and look forward to dosing ALS patients in 2025.”\n\n**Clinical Development & Pipeline Programs**\n\nAthira’s drug development pipeline includes potential first-in-class and next-generation novel small molecule drug candidates designed to promote the neurotrophic hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) system, which activates neuroprotective, neurotrophic and anti-inflammatory pathways in the central nervous system. Athira’s drug candidates have distinct properties which the Company believes may be applicable to a broad range of neurodegenerative diseases.\n\n**ATH-1105** – A next-generation, novel, orally administered, small molecule drug candidate in development for the potential treatment of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and other neurodegenerative diseases.\n\n  * Athira is conducting a first-in-human Phase 1 ([NCT 06432647](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=RVfbXdUSrHJtzsOxqWMdNoVY5jyHk-Ipt-V6NGtlp66ZzgxLZKxDgO9ejoIkVBNubp_XdGwKhNpRRILjuS1rwpPDv9EE7R_8ysa7wUj3ckF6yzS3wCiEdGDMp54wcQhCui8H1lP4gBVncUppbcqABcb9G8jKoeP0EFqIn6rM5PipFtn0bPAD97MzzgZPxBVLW1BlrzJl4QQjjPkAbgmItbAvDthd0d9W7X0p4SkqW4vRlOjZZo8v2fWy8weMJP293dXn-eHX-u8LAOla-QnN9_H7zWCGDp2kI907_zqjsjAy1F6_iznhGNwn70vYGBiF)) double-blind, placebo-controlled trial that is enrolling up to 80 healthy volunteers to evaluate single and multiple oral ascending doses of ATH-1105. The study is evaluating the safety and tolerability of ATH-1105 and includes measurements of pharmacokinetic outcomes. \n  * In June 2024, Athira completed the first cohort of healthy volunteers in its ongoing, dose escalation Phase 1 trial.\n  * Athira expects to complete the Phase 1 study by year-end 2024 and plans to begin dosing ALS patients in 2025.\n  * ATH-1105’s potential is supported by a growing body of preclinical evidence demonstrating improvements in nerve and motor function, biomarkers of inflammation and neurodegeneration, and survival in various models of ALS.\n  * These data have been presented at a variety of key scientific and medical meetings including the American Association of Neurology (AAN), the Alzheimer’s Association International Congress (AAIC), the Northeast Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis Consortium® (NEALS), and the Motor Neurone Disease Association (MNDA).\n\n\n\n**Fosgonimeton (ATH-1017) –** A once daily, subcutaneously administered drug candidate initially targeted for the potential treatment of Alzheimer’s disease\n\n  * In September 2024, Athira announced topline results from the LIFT-AD Phase 2/3 clinical trial of fosgonimeton in mild-to-moderate Alzheimer’s disease. The study did not meet its primary or key secondary endpoints, but biomarker and subgroup data were directionally consistent with the broad neuroprotective mechanism of action.\n\n\n\n**Plans to Explore Strategic Alternatives**\n\n  * Following Athira’s receipt of the topline results of LIFT-AD, the company made the determination to explore strategic alternatives focused on maximizing stockholder value. As part of that effort, Athira has paused further development of fosgonimeton while continuing our ongoing development of ATH-1105 and are exploring partnering options. Athira has engaged Cantor Fitzgerald & Co. to act as an advisor in the process to explore strategic alternatives.\n\n\n\n**Financial Results**\n\n  * **Cash Position.** Cash, cash equivalents and investments were $68.9 million as of September 30, 2024, compared to $147.4 million as of December 31, 2023. Net cash used in operations was $71.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to $74.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023.\n  * **Research and Development (R &D) Expenses.** R&D expenses were $17.9 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, compared to $27.2 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2023.\n  * **General and Administrative (G &A) Expenses.** G&A expenses were $7.6 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, compared to $7.8 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2023.\n  * **Legal Expense.** Legal expense of $4.1 million was accrued during the quarter ended September 30, 2024, in connection with the United States Department of Justice investigative demand.\n  * **Net Loss.** Net loss was $28.7 million, or $0.75 per share, for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, compared to a net loss of $33.0 million, or $0.87 per share, for the quarter ended September 30, 2023.\n\n\n\n**About Athira Pharma, Inc.** Athira Pharma, Inc., headquartered in the Seattle, Washington area, is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on developing small molecules to restore neuronal health and slow neurodegeneration. Athira aims to alter the course of neurological diseases by advancing its pipeline of drug candidates that modulate the neurotrophic HGF system.

Porsteinsson, M.D., Director of the University of Rochester Alzheimer’s Disease Care, Research, and Education Program (AD-CARE) and a LIFT-AD investigator\n\nAs previously reported, topline results from the LIFT-AD trial did not achieve statistical significance for the primary endpoint of the Global Statistical Test (GST) nor its key secondary endpoints compared with placebo at 26 weeks. However, both components of GST, cognition (ADAS-Cog11) and function (ADCS-ADL23), directionally favored fosgonimeton treatment, and in pre-specified subgroups characterized by more rapid disease progression (moderate AD and APOE4 carriers), cognition and function improved or stabilized in the fosgonimeton treated group. In addition, data across biomarkers of protein pathology (Aβ42/40, p-Tau181, and p-Tau217), inflammation (GFAP) and neurodegeneration (NfL) showed directional changes in favor of fosgonimeton treatment that are consistent with the broad neuroprotective mechanism of HGF modulation.\n\n“We believe the totality of the data supports the potential of HGF modulation for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases,” said Javier San Martin, M.D., Chief Medical Officer of Athira. \n\nAthira is focused on advancing the clinical development program for ATH-1105, a novel, oral, next-generation small molecule positive modulator of the neurotrophic hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) system, as a potential treatment for neurodegenerative diseases, including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and Alzheimer’s disease (AD).

ATH-1105 is the Company’s oral, next-generation small molecule positive modulator of the neurotrophic hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) system currently in development for the treatment of ALS.\n\nIn alignment with Athira’s focus on continued development of ATH-1105, the Company is implementing cost containment measures including a reduction in workforce of approximately 70%. Athira expects one-time costs of approximately $2.8 million and cost savings of approximately $13.4 million on an annualized basis related to the reduction in the workforce. As a result of these cost containment measures and based on its current operating plan, Athira now expects to extend its cash runway into the first quarter of 2026. Moving forward, the Company will review and consider various options including partnering and financing with the intent of extending its cash runway to achieve initial proof-of-concept and enable further development for ATH-1105 in neurodegenerative diseases.\n\n“We are encouraged about the potential for ATH-1105, as this oral, next-generation HGF-modulating drug candidate has enhanced blood-brain-barrier penetration and improved pharmacokinetic properties. Our robust preclinical data to date have demonstrated ATH-1105's neuroprotective effects including a consistent reduction in plasma neurofilament light chain (NfL) levels,” said Mark Litton, Ph.D., President and Chief Executive Officer of Athira.\n\n“The NfL biomarker data from the LIFT-AD study suggests that HGF modulation may reduce levels of plasma NfL with the potential effect of preventing neurodegeneration. In ALS, plasma NfL is an established marker of disease progression and neurodegeneration and reduction in NfL is associated with improvement in clinical outcomes,” said Javier San Martin, M.D., Chief Medical Officer of Athira. “We look forward to the continued development of this promising therapeutic candidate for the potential treatment of neurodegenerative diseases including ALS.”\n\nDr. Litton added, “I want to thank our colleagues who will be departing from Athira as part of the restructuring and acknowledge their many contributions to the development of therapeutics that modulate the neurotrophic HGF system, and to the evolution of our Company. We are sorry to see them go and wish them the very best in the future.”\n\nThe Company is conducting a first-in-human Phase 1 ([NCT 06432647](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=RVfbXdUSrHJtzsOxqWMdNoVY5jyHk-Ipt-V6NGtlp66ZzgxLZKxDgO9ejoIkVBNubp_XdGwKhNpRRILjuS1rwpPDv9EE7R_8ysa7wUj3ckF6yzS3wCiEdGDMp54wcQhCui8H1lP4gBVncUppbcqABcb9G8jKoeP0EFqIn6rM5PipFtn0bPAD97MzzgZPxBVLW1BlrzJl4QQjjPkAbgmItbAvDthd0d9W7X0p4SkqW4vRlOjZZo8v2fWy8weMJP293dXn-eHX-u8LAOla-QnN9_H7zWCGDp2kI907_zqjsjAy1F6_iznhGNwn70vYGBiF)) double-blind, placebo-controlled trial that is enrolling up to 80 healthy volunteers to evaluate single and multiple oral ascending doses of ATH-1105. The study is evaluating the safety and tolerability of ATH-1105 and includes measurements of pharmacokinetic outcomes. Athira completed the first cohort of healthy volunteers in June 2024 and expects to complete the full study by year-end 2024, with a goal to begin dosing ALS patients in 2025.\n\n**About ATH-1105** ATH-1105 is a next-generation, orally administered, small molecule drug candidate in development for the potential treatment of ALS. In preclinical models of ALS, ATH-1105 has been shown to significantly increase survival, enhance motor and nerve function, reduce peripheral nerve demyelination and axon degeneration, and improve neurodegeneration and inflammation.\n\n**About Athira Pharma, Inc.** Athira Pharma, Inc., headquartered in the Seattle, Washington area, is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on developing small molecules to restore neuronal health and slow neurodegeneration. Athira aims to alter the course of neurological diseases by advancing its pipeline of drug candidates that modulate the neurotrophic HGF system.
