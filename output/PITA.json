You should be aware that KiepeElectric’s presentation of these measures may not be comparable to similarly-\ntitled measures used by other companies. KiepeElectric believes these non-IFRS measures of financial results provide useful information to management and investors regardingcertain financial\nand business trends relating to its financial condition and results of operations. KiepeElectric believes that these non-IFRS financial measures provide an additional tool for investors to use in\nevaluating ongoing operating results and trends in and in comparing its financial measures with other similar companies, manyofwhich present similar non-IFRS financial measures to investors.\nThese non-IFRS financial measures are subjectto inherent limitations as they reflect the exercise of judgments by management about which expense and income are excluded or included in\ndetermining these non-IFRS financial measures.\nIndustry and Market Data\nThis Presentation has been prepared by Heramba and PERAC and includes market data and other statistical information from third-party sources, including independent industry publications,\ngovernmental publications and other published independent sources.

Conflicts of Interest\nA conflict of interest occurs when the private interests of a Covered Party interfere, or\nappear to interfere, with the interests of the Company as a whole.\nFor example, a conflict of interest can arise when a Covered Party takes actions or has\npersonal interests that make it difficult to perform his or her Company duties objectively and\neffectively. A conflict of interest may also arise when a Covered Party, or a member of his or her\nimmediate family,1 receives improper personal benefits as a result of his or her position at the\nCompany.\nConflicts of interest can also occur indirectly. For example, a conflict of interest may arise\nwhen a Covered Party is also an executive officer, a major shareholder or has a material interest\nin a company or organization doing business with the Company.\nEach Covered Party has an obligation to conduct the Company’s business in an honest and\nethical manner, including the ethical handling of actual or apparent conflicts of interest between\n1 Item 404(a) of SEC Regulation S-K defines “immediate family member” as a person’s child, stepchild, parent,\nstepparent, spouse, sibling, mother-in-law, father-in-law, son-in-law, daughter-in-law, brother-in-law or sister-in-\nlaw, or any person (other than a tenant or employee) sharing the person’s household.\n1\npersonal and professional relationships. Any situation that involves, or may reasonably be\nexpected to involve, a conflict of interest with the Company, should be disclosed promptly to the\nAudit and Risk Committee of the Board (the “Audit Committee”). In addition, in accordance with\nSection 231 of the Irish Companies Act, as amended, it is the duty of a director who is in any way,\nwhether directly or indirectly, interested in a contract, or a proposed contract, with the Company\nto declare the nature of his or her interest at a meeting of the directors of the Company where such\ninterest can reasonably be regarded as likely to give rise to a conflict of interest. Please see Section\nD of the Company’s Related Party Transactions Policy for additional information.\nII. Disclosures\nThe information in the Company’s public communications, including all reports and\ndocuments filed with or submitted to the SEC, must be full, fair, accurate, timely and\nunderstandable.\nTo ensure the Company meets this standard, all Covered Parties (to the extent they are\ninvolved in the Company’s disclosure process) are required to maintain familiarity with the\ndisclosure requirements, processes and procedures applicable to the Company commensurate with\ntheir duties. Covered Parties are prohibited from knowingly misrepresenting, omitting or causing\nothers to misrepresent or omit, material facts about the Company to others, including the\nCompany’s independent auditors, governmental regulators and self-regulatory organizations.\nIII. Compliance with Laws, Rules and Regulations\nThe Company is obligated to comply with all applicable laws, rules and regulations. It is\nthe personal responsibility of each Covered Party to adhere to the standards and restrictions\nimposed by these laws, rules and regulations in the performance of his or her duties for the\nCompany.\nThe Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer and Chief Accounting Officer or\nController (or persons performing similar functions) of the Company are also required to promote\ncompliance by all employees with the Code and to abide by Company standards, policies and\nprocedures.\nIV. Reporting, Accountability and Enforcement\nThe Company promotes ethical behavior at all times and encourages Covered Parties to\ntalk to supervisors, managers and other appropriate personnel, including officers, the General\nCounsel, outside counsel for the Company and the Board or the relevant committee thereof, when\nin doubt about the best course of action in a particular situation.\nCovered Parties should promptly report suspected violations of laws, rules, regulations or\nthe Code to appropriate personnel, including officers, the General Counsel, outside counsel for the\nCompany and the Board or the relevant committee thereof. Reports may be made anonymously.\nIf requested, confidentiality will be maintained, subject to applicable law, regulations and legal\nproceedings.\n2\nThe Audit Committee of the Board shall investigate and determine, or shall designate\nappropriate persons to investigate and determine, the legitimacy of such reports. The Audit\nCommittee will then determine the appropriate disciplinary action. Such disciplinary action\nincludes, but is not limited to, reprimand, termination with cause, and possible civil and criminal\nprosecution.\nTo encourage employees to report any and all violations, the Company will not tolerate\nretaliation for reports made in good faith. Retaliation or retribution against any Covered Party for\na report made in good faith of any suspected violation of laws, rules, regulations or this Code is\ncause for appropriate disciplinary action.\nV. Waivers\nBefore an employee, or an immediate family member of any such employee, engages in\nany activity that would be otherwise prohibited by the Code, he or she is strongly encouraged to\nobtain a written waiver from the Audit Committee or, if the Audit Committee defers decision on\nsuch waiver to the Board, from the Board.\nBefore a director or executive officer, or an immediate family member of a director or\nexecutive officer, engages in any activity that would be otherwise prohibited by the Code, he or\nshe must obtain a written waiver from the Audit Committee. Such waiver must then be disclosed\nto the Company’s shareholders, along with the reasons for granting the waiver, within four\nbusiness days.\nVI. No Rights Created\nThis Code is a statement of certain fundamental principles, policies and procedures that\ngovern the Company’s Covered Parties in the conduct of the Company’s business. It is not\nintended to and does not create any rights in any employee, customer, client, visitor, supplier,\ncompetitor, shareholder or any other person or entity. It is the Company’s belief that the policy is\nrobust and covers most conceivable situations.\n3"

KIEPE, a global provider of electrical systems for trains and buses, has developed the right solution and received a framework order from Vossloh Rolling Stock. Eleven class DE 18 diesel-electric shunting locomotives have already been equipped with a SmartHybrid battery drive instead of an additional diesel tank. Their low-emission and low-noise operation brings operators various benefits such as higher availability, decarbonization and energy efficiency. At InnoTrans in Berlin (September 24-27, 2024), KIEPE will present the SmartHybrid solution at Booth 430, Hall 9.**\n\nUlrich Lauel, Director Global Sales Rail Systems at KIEPE: “Rail vehicles are designed for very long lifecycles. It is therefore important to keep an eye on the latest technologies. KIEPE wants to work with its customers to exploit all possibilities to implement the low-emission and efficient vehicles required today. We are fortunate that we have been able to add a successful chapter to our long-standing business partnership with Vossloh Rolling Stock with this locomotive project.”\n\n**KIEPE’s system integration is convincing**\n\nKIEPE has already equipped over 130 DE 18 locomotives from Vossloh Rolling Stock, mainly used in heavy shunting and mainline service, with traction converters (TU 900). Eleven locomotives of this type have already been equipped with a SmartHybrid battery drive and control system.\n\nThe power converter with integrated battery is mounted under the locomotive in place of the additional fuel tank and is connected to the locomotive’s fire protection system. KIEPE equips the SmartHybrid battery drive with the batteries in an assembly facility specially set-up for this purpose in Düsseldorf. Two battery packs are placed in the housing of the UGC 301 (underfloor equipment container 301) and integrated into the locomotive’s drive system and its controls. The batteries can be charged via the diesel engine or via an external power supply (3AC 400V). KIEPE contributes with system integration know-how to optimize the interaction between the battery and the traction container. \n\n**Economical operation despite frequent start and stop operation**\n\nThe class DE 18 SmartHybrid locomotive can be used more flexibly in operation because it meets new environmental guidelines or local emission limits with regard to pollutants and noise emissions. The vehicles can drive in “zero-emission” areas, such as tunnels, inside factory buildings or train stations. In addition, depending on the load profile, a locomotive can carry out up to one hour of shunting operations without emitting emissions, even at night thanks to the low noise levels. The frequent starting and stopping of the locomotives is more economical because the extended start-stop function of the diesel engine reduces pollutant emissions. This can reduce fuel costs by as much as 25% and also reduce maintenance costs. Battery operation scores points for its increased efficiency, especially when power requirements are low (less than 400 kW). Auxiliary units can be supplied with energy for up to three hours when the diesel engine is switched off.\n\n**Caption** : The SmartHybrid battery drive from KIEPE makes the DE 18 locomotive more flexible and sustainable in its use. | © Vossloh Rolling Stock\n\nKIEPE,headquartered in Düsseldorf with subsidiaries in Austria, Canada, Italy, Switzerland and the USA, is known worldwide for its efficient and ecologically sustainable electrical equipment.

This is the name of the short, very light and powerful new railbus. The very light passenger train will be built by French railway operator SNCF and the transport system manufacturer LOHR together with other partners. KIEPE is contributing to the project by providing the highly efficient, energy-saving traction package with the Kiepe Traction Inverter (KTI) and the electric motors.**\n\nUlrich Lauel, Global Head Rail Systems at KIEPE: “The DRAISY project fits in with KIEPE’s mission, because we want to create an emission-free future with innovative, reliable and environmentally friendly mobility solutions. I welcome the diversity in regional public transit, as embodied by the DRAISY light train. Especially in rural areas, it is not just about faster, stronger, further – what is needed are economical and reliable solutions for sustainable passenger transport. Our team is enthusiastically working on this in this very innovative light train project.” \n\n**Economical rail transport in rural areas**\n\nThe DRAISY project consists of a very light, 14-meter-long passenger train. This rail vehicle is intended to give new impulse to shorter railway lines in rural areas. In France, it is estimated that there are almost 9,000 kilometers of such local routes in rural communities. Given this potential, it is hardly surprising that the project won in the “Digitization and decarbonization of rail transport” category as part of the fourth edition of the French government’s Future Investment Program. In addition to SNCF and LOHR, the winning project team includes partners GCK Battery, Stations-e and IRT Railenium. \n\n**100% battery-powered electric light train**\n\nThe DRAISY railbus is a battery-powered electric passenger train with a range of 150 kilometers that can be quickly charged in stations along the route without affecting passenger service. The train, with a top speed of 100 km/h, has space for up to 80 passengers. The vehicle weight of 20 tons is only about two thirds of a conventional regional railcar. The DRAISY concept assumes significantly lower operating and maintenance costs compared to current regional trains. The vehicle includes a large number of components and systems that are already available on the market, such as the KIEPE traction package with traction inverter. DRAISY is expected to be in operation in Alsace from 2026. \n\n**Kiepe Traction Inverter (KTI) from KIEPE**\n\nThe compact Kiepe Traction Inverter (KTI) achieves a high-power density through efficient semiconductor technology and can be used universally. The intelligent control system benefits from the new Kiepe Traction Control (KTC), a motor control system to increase the performance of the drive train. The KTI, like the entire new generation of Kiepe Electric traction devices for electrically powered vehicles, can be integrated into Kiepe Fleet Management (KFM). The KFM digital solution supports the planning of predictive services and repairs with collected and evaluated vehicle data. \n\n**Caption:** The compact Kiepe Traction Inverter (KTI) is designed for rail vehicles and reliably drives the electric motors of the DRAISY train. | © LOHR-HAIKU DESIGN \n\nKIEPE, with headquarter in Düsseldorf and subsidiaries in Austria, Canada, Italy, Switzerland and the USA, is known worldwide for its efficient and ecologically sustainable electrical equipment.

The KIEPE system transmits operating data wirelessly to Smart Fleet Management (SFM), which enables efficient energy management with the help of AI. With the new KIEPE Service Pad, functions on the vehicle for commissioning checks can be triggered remotely. This means that routine checks can be carried out by just one person where previously two were required.\n\nRail Solutions is showing a **SmartHybrid battery system** as hardware exhibits, consisting of an integrated battery, charger, and battery control unit. This solution for emission-free freight shunting traffic – which can also be retrofitted – enables temporary noise- and CO2-free operation and replaces the conventional fuel tank of the locomotive. The vehicles can travel in “zero-emission” mode for shunting operations of up to one hour. \n\n**“Supporting your E-Mobility Solution”**\n\nKIEPE supports its customers following the motto “Supporting your E-Mobility Solution”. In addition to emission-free, electrified drive solutions for In Motion Charging and battery-powered electric buses, the range also includes KIEPE charging concepts for e-vehicles.\n\nKIEPE’s portfolio contributes to the “zero-emission” mission and at the same time meets customer requirements for safety and cybersecurity. This applies to the innovative **KIEPE Traction Inverter (KTI)** on display. The compact KTI has proven itself in use in electric buses thanks to its low energy consumption and high performance and is now making its debut in rail vehicles. The KTI achieves a high-power density through efficient semiconductor technology, is suitable for all common drives and can therefore be used universally. The KIC (KIEPE Insulating Converter) is a galvanically insulating DC/DC converter for use with high variance of input and output voltages. Primarily designed for IMC® buses (In Motion Charging) and powered by the overhead line, the KIC functions as a battery charger and turns an electric bus into an IMC® bus.\n\n**Charging solutions for sustainable transport concepts**\n\nKIEPE is a specialist in onboard and offboard charging systems and offers both components and complete solutions. The scalable **k.Charger** charging solutions are revolutionizing charging strategies for e-buses. The modular technology enables charging infrastructure systems that are individually adapted to the existing depot infrastructure as well as opportunity chargers along the route. The power supply can be provided by the public power grid as well as the locally available railway power supply (AC and DC). This optimizes space requirements, resources, and costs!\n\n**KIEPE Switzerland shows bi-directional converter at Swissrail**\n\nAt the Swissrail joint booth, KIEPE Switzerland is showing the bi-directional 50 kVA converter for power supply from the overhead line or catenary. Railway operators and their service providers, e.g. the construction industry, can use the railway power along the line for maintenance work and to charge equipment and vehicles.
