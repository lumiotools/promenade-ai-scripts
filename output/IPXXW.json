II (Nasdaq: IPXX) (“IPXX”), a special purpose acquisition company, today announced that they have entered into a definitive business combination agreement (the “Business Combination Agreement” and the transactions contemplated by that agreement, the “Proposed Business Combination”), which will result in USARE becoming a publicly traded company.\n\nUSARE is developing a vertically integrated US REE magnet supply chain, with an early-mover advantage to become a significant ex-China producer. Founded in 2019, the Company has permanent magnet production equipment on site at its Stillwater, Oklahoma location. Phase 1 of the magnet facility is expected to be operational at the end of 2025 and will have a production capacity of up to 1,200 tpa, initially supplied by third party feedstock.\n\nThe Company has plans to expand production capacity by an additional three phases for total production capacity of approximately 4,800 tpa by 2028. USARE intends to supply and scale the future of the Company’s magnet production from its control of the mining rights to the Round Top Mountain deposit in West Texas (“Round Top”) through its subsidiary.\n\nRound Top is an above-ground mineral deposit containing at least 15 of the 17 rare earth elements, plus lithium and other industrial minerals. The Company has successfully piloted proprietary rare earth separation technology, and, once mining at Round Top begins, plans to deploy that technology as part of a closed-loop process for the separation of rare earth minerals.\n\nWith an early mover advantage and diversified mix of target customers, USARE has a unique opportunity to become a leading domestic supplier of REE magnets and heavy REEs required for electric vehicles, green energy, and defense industries, as well as a strategic national asset for critical US industries to advance domestic growth and supply sustainability.\n\n**Tready Smith, USARE’s Board Chair, commented** : “Today’s business combination agreement represents a significant step in the growth of USARE. It enables us to capitalize on our unique opportunity to become the leading domestic supplier of rare earth materials for critical US industries. Our team has a proven track record in both mining and magnet manufacturing, which we believe positions us exceptionally well to further build the team, bring our magnet production facility online and begin extraction from the Round Top deposit. This will allow us to take advantage of the significant domestic demand for high performance, rare earth magnets that currently exists.\n\nThe combination with IPXX provides us with a partner that shares our vision for the future and secures our ability to continue executing our business plan. We are enthusiastic about the prefunding of our PIPE investment and believe this investment allows us to drive the development of our permanent magnet facility toward production. We are excited to collaborate with the IPXX team and believe we are well-positioned to unlock new opportunities and significant value for our shareholders.”\n\n**Michael Blitzer, CEO of IPXX, added** : “We are pleased to announce our business combination with USA Rare Earth. USARE’s strategic vision, experienced team and integrated supply chain are approaching scale at an inflection point for the critically important domestic industry. We believe that by becoming the first large scale integrated magnet producer in North America, the Company is poised to be a strategic national asset that mines rare earth material for integrated magnet production serving the technological, industrial, and defense end markets.”\n\n**Proposed Business Combination Overview**\n\nThe Proposed Business Combination implies a pro forma combined enterprise value of $870 million, excluding additional earnout consideration. This assumes an $800 million pre-money valuation of USARE, 100% rollover of USARE equity and excludes any amounts in the IPXX trust account.\n\nExisting USARE investors and investors affiliated with IPXX have agreed to a prefunded PIPE investment of ~$25 million upon the signing of the Business Combination Agreement, and we are seeking to upsize this PIPE with additional funding in connection to closing, with $9 million already committed.\n\nUSARE expects to use the net proceeds from the Proposed Business Combination for general corporate purposes, including progressing the development of its Stillwater magnet facility.\n\nUnder the terms of the Business Combination Agreement, USARE’s existing equityholders will convert 100% of their equity ownership stakes into the combined company and are expected to own approximately 84% (excluding the affiliates of IPXX) of the post-combination company upon consummation of the Proposed Business Combination, excluding any IPXX investors who do not choose to redeem their shares.\n\nThe Proposed Business Combination is expected to be completed in early 2025, subject to customary closing conditions, including regulatory and stock approvals. The combined public company is expected to be named “USA Rare Earth, Inc.” and to list its common stock and warrants to purchase common stock on Nasdaq, subject to satisfaction of Nasdaq’s listing requirements. The Proposed Business Combination has been unanimously approved by the managers of USARE and the board of directors of IPXX.\n\nAdditional information about the Proposed Business Combination, including a copy of the Business Combination Agreement, will be provided in a Current Report on Form 8-K to be filed by IPXX with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) and available at [www.sec.gov](http://www.sec.gov).\n\n**Advisors** Cohen & Company Capital Markets, a division of J.V.B.

These forward-looking statements are provided for illustrative purposes only and are not intended to serve as, and must not be relied on by any investor as, a guarantee, an assurance, a prediction, or a definitive statement of fact or probability. Actual events and circumstances are difficult or impossible to predict and will differ from assumptions. Many actual events and circumstances are beyond the control of IPXX and USARE.
