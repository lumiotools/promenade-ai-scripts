The first business unit is MARKET.live focused on interactive video-based social commerce. Our MARKET.live platform is a multi-vendor, livestream social shopping destination leveraging the convergence of ecommerce and entertainment. Brands, retailers and creators that join MARKET.live have the ability to broadcast livestream shopping events simultaneously on numerous social media channels, including TikTok, YouTube, LinkedIn, Facebook, Instagram, Twitch, as well as on MARKET.live, reaching exponentially larger audiences. The Company’s recent technological integrations with META, created a seamless, native, friction-free checkout process for Facebook and Instagram users to purchase MARKET.live vendors’ products within each of those popular apps. This integration allows Facebook and Instagram users to browse products featured in MARKET.live shoppable videos, place products in a native shopping cart and checkout – all without leaving Facebook or Instagram. We recently announced a technology integration with Pinterest, and we will continue to expand the universe of social platforms our clients can access through our platform.\n\nLast year we completed development work on a new MARKET.live capability that facilitated a deeper integration into the TikTok Shop social media platform, designed to expose MARKET.live shoppable programming to tens of millions of potential viewers/purchasers. This capability allows shoppers watching a MARKET.live stream on TikTok to stay on that site and check out through that site, eliminating the friction or reluctance of TikTok users to leave their TikTok feed in order to complete their purchase on MARKET.live. Our technology integration allows the purchase data to flow back through MARKET.live and to the individual vendors and stores on MARKET.live seamlessly for fulfillment of the orders.\n\nEarlier this year, we announced an expanded strategic relationship with TikTok evidenced by a formal partnership with TikTok Shop pursuant to which MARKET.live became a service provider for TikTok Shop and officially designated as a TikTok Shop Partner (TSP) . Under the terms of the partnership, TikTok Shop refers consumer brands, retailers, influencers and affiliates leads to MARKET.live for a menu of MARKET.live contract-based recurring fee revenue services that include, among other things, assistance in onboarding to TikTok Shop and establishing a TikTok store, hosting training sessions and webinars for prospective TikTok Shop sellers, full creative services including content creation and full remote and in-studio production services, host/influencer casting and management, TikTok Shop maintenance and enhancements for existing TikTok clients’ stores. The same services are currently provided to consumer brands that contact us directly or through several brand agencies with which we maintain affiliate relationships.\n\nThe second business unit is GO FUND YOURSELF!, a revolutionary interactive social crowd funding platform for public and private companies seeking broad-based exposure across numerous social media channels for their crowd-funded Regulation CF and Regulation A offerings. The platform combines a ground-breaking interactive TV show with MARKET.live’s back-end capabilities allowing viewers to tap on their screen to facilitate an investment, in real time, as they watch companies presenting before the show’s panel of “Titans”. Presenting companies that sell consumer products are able to offer their products directly to viewers during the show in real time through shoppable onscreen icons. The Go Fund Yourself business unit generates revenue from cash fees we charge to issuers to appear on the show and for marketing, ad, and content creation and distribution services. For those issuers that sell products during each airing of the show through our platform, we charge a fee up to 25% of the gross sales revenue for all products sold.\n\nHistorically, and continuing up through June 13, 2023, we were a Software-as-a-Service (“SaaS”) applications platform developer that offered a SaaS platform for the direct sales industry comprised of a suite of interactive video-based sales enablement business software products marketed on a subscription basis, (the “SaaS Assets”).\n\nOn June 13, 2023, the Company disposed of all of its operating SaaS Assets pursuant to an asset purchase agreement in consideration of the sum of $6.5 million, $4.75 million of which was paid in cash by the buyer at the closing of the transaction (the “Sale of the SaaS Assets”). Additional payments of $1.75 million will be paid by the buyer if certain profitability and revenue targets are met within the two-year period following the closing as set forth more particularly in the asset purchase agreement. The sale of the SaaS Assets was undertaken to allow us to focus our resources on MARKET.live, and the business verticals that platform could support. We expect our burgeoning MARKET.live business unit will, over time, create greater shareholder value than we could have been created through the continued operation of our SaaS Assets.\n\nAs of September 30, 2024, the Company had cash of $10.5 million and short-term investments of $5.1 million.\n\n_Series C Preferred Shares Redeemed in Exchange for Common Shares_\n\nOn December 29, 2023, the Company issued 3,000 Series C Preferred Shares to an institutional investor pursuant to a securities purchase agreement and certificate of designation previously filed. The Series C Preferred Shares carried a 10% annual dividend.\n\nSubsequent to September 30, 2024, the Company redeemed 895 Series C Preferred Shares in exchange for 196,856 common shares to fully redeem the Series C Preferred Shares that were outstanding. On October 14, 2024, the Company redeemed 187 Series C Preferred Shares in exchange for 32,913 common shares to fully repay the amount accrued for preferred dividends. The transaction was done at the Nasdaq at-the-market price. No broker was involved in the transaction and no fees or commissions were paid or incurred by the Company.\n\n****VERB TECHNOLOGY COMPANY, INC.****CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS****(in thousands, except share and per share data)****  \n---  \n**September 30, 2024** | **December 31, 2023**  \n**(unaudited)**  \n**ASSETS**  \n**Current assets**  \nCash | $ | 10,515 | $ | 4,353  \nShort-term investments | 5,077 | -  \nPrepaid expenses and other current assets | 233 | 331  \nTotal current assets | 15,825 | 4,684  \nCapitalized software development costs, net | 3,242 | 3,990  \nERC receivable | 2,263 | 1,528  \nProperty and equipment, net | 192 | 43  \nOperating lease right-of-use assets | 172 | 218  \nIntangible assets, net | 184 | 117  \nOther assets | 259 | 259  \n**Total assets** | **$** | **22,137** | **$** | **10,839**  \n**LIABILITIES AND STOCKHOLDERS’ EQUITY**  \n**Current liabilities**  \nAccounts payable | $ | 956 | $ | 1,408  \nAccrued expenses | 2,252 | 2,324  \nAccrued payroll | 360 | 420  \nAccrued officers’ compensation | - | 648  \nNotes payable, current | 20 | 1,787  \nAccrued interest | - | 533  \nOperating lease liabilities, current | 75 | 67  \nPreferred dividend payable | 240 | -  \nDerivative liability | - | 1  \nTotal current liabilities | 3,903 | 7,188  \n**Long-term liabilities**  \nNotes payable, non-current | 103 | 362  \nOperating lease liabilities, non-current | 102 | 164  \nTotal liabilities | 4,108 | 7,714  \nCommitments and contingencies (Note 13)  \n**Stockholders’ equity**  \nSeries C Preferred Stock, $0.0001 par value, 5,000 shares authorized, 895 and 3,000 shares issued and outstanding as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 | 895 | 2,980  \nCommon stock, $0.0001 par value, 400,000,000 shares authorized, 763,230 and 106,157 shares issued and outstanding as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 | 1 | 1  \nAdditional paid-in capital | 200,788 | 175,766  \nAccumulated deficit | (183,655 | ) | (175,622 | )  \n**Total stockholders’ equity** | **18,029** | **3,125**  \n**Total liabilities and stockholders’ equity** | **$** | **22,137** | **$** | **10,839**  \n  \nSee accompanying notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements\n\n**About VERB Technology Company** Verb Technology Company, Inc.

(Nasdaq: VERB)**(\"VERB\" or the \"Company\"), the company behind [**MARKET.live**](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=pFKCPrciG3vSrE10QFC18tzwOuVzK6ruPYNDSk5ZHfoPPuHVcjE4sc9mBNSO3UYJ6ioYfX5QqtcIBsBOFVjPWw== \"Opens in a new window\"), a leading livestream social shopping platform, and [**GO FUND YOURSELF!**](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=Q1d6yvQfeWJtQEZmm07EbhwxuVX6rYxjtjjF-QDDhjYeV534LybJ5Ev489x5tVsot4Y5-PrABpks1477u0jTs4EmuStCOY6Y1K13378DNmI= \"Opens in a new window\"), a TV show and innovative new platform disrupting the crowd funding industry, today announced that on October 23, 2024, the Company received a letter from the Nasdaq Stock Market stating that the Company had regained compliance with the minimum bid price requirement of $1.00 per share for continued listing on the Nasdaq Stock Market, as set forth in Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(a)(2).\n\nSeparately, the Company today announces that it has begun an investigation of apparent price manipulation in the trading of its shares following the Company’s announcement of a stockholder approved reverse stock split.\n\nOn October 4, 2024, the Company announced that its stockholders had voted to authorize its Board to implement a 1-for-200 reverse stock split in order to retain the Company’s Nasdaq listing and that the shares would begin trading on a split-adjusted basis on October 9, 2024.\n\nPrior to the foregoing announcement, the Company estimates that there were approximately 40,000 beneficial owners of the Company’s stock. Assuming every single shareholder was entitled to a round-up share, which is highly unlikely, that would mean the Company would issue 40,000 shares to address any stockholders left with a fractional share following the reverse split. However, post-split, certain recently identified brokerage firms and clearing houses have requested roundup shares totaling more than 260,000 shares of the Company's common stock - notwithstanding the fact that the Company’s total public float immediately post-split was less than 800,000.\n\nNot coincidentally, the Company became aware of a significant increase in short positions in its stock at or around the same time – and around the same number of round-up shares as those requested by these brokerages and clearing houses.\n\nAnd VERB is not the only company who has been subject to this same apparent manipulation. The Company knows of at least two other companies who are experiencing the same thing. The Company’s management is in communication with leadership at other affected companies and is seeking to coordinate efforts while actively pursuing the engagement of securities fraud counsel to investigate the facts, determine if there has been illicit activity affecting the Company, and if so, moving aggressively to hold those responsible accountable through swift private legal action as well as through the intervention of securities regulators.\n\n“Do not underestimate our resolve to protect our company and our stockholders,” stated Rory J. Cutaia, VERB Chairman & CEO. “For those of you waiting to receive your 260,000 round-up shares, here’s some advice, don’t hold your breath.”\n\n**About VERB Technology Company** Verb Technology Company, Inc.

These forward-looking statements are intended to qualify for the safe harbor from liability established by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements include all statements that are not statements of historical facts and can be identified by words such as “anticipates,” “believes,” “could,” “estimates,” “expects,” “intends,” “may,” “plans,” “potential,” “predicts,” “projects,” “seeks,” “should,” “will,” “would” or similar expressions and the negatives of those expressions. Forward-looking statements also include the assumptions underlying or relating to such statements.\n\nOur forward-looking statements are based on our management’s current beliefs, assumptions and expectations about future events and trends, which affect or may affect our business, strategy, operations, financial performance or liquidity. Although we believe these forward-looking statements are based upon reasonable assumptions, they are subject to numerous known and unknown risks and uncertainties and are made in light of information currently available to us. Some of the risks and uncertainties that may impact our forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, the following factors:\n\n● our incursion of significant net losses and uncertainty whether we will achieve or maintain profitable operations;\n\n● our ability to grow and compete in the future, and to execute our business strategy;\n\n● our ability to maintain and expand our customer base and to convince our customers to increase the use of our services and/or platform;\n\n● the competitive market in which we operate;\n\n● our ability to increase the number of our strategic relationships or grow the revenues received from our current strategic relationships;\n\n● our ability to develop enhancements and new features to our existing service or acceptable new services that keep pace with technological developments;\n\n● our ability to successfully launch new product platforms, including MARKET.live, the rate of adoption of these platforms and the revenue generated from these platforms;\n\n● our ability to deliver our services, as we depend on third party Internet providers;\n\n● our ability to attract and retain qualified management personnel;\n\n● our susceptibility to security breaches and other disruptions;\n\n● our ability to maintain compliance with the listing requirements of the Nasdaq Capital Market; and\n\n● the impact of, and our ability to operate our business and effectively manage our growth under evolving and uncertain global economic, political, and social trends, including legislation banning or otherwise hampering our strategic relationships such as TikTok, inflation, rising interest rates, and recessionary concerns.\n\nThe foregoing list may not include all of the factors that impact the forward-looking statements made in this Quarterly Report. Our actual financial condition and results could differ materially from those expressed or implied by our forward-looking statements as a result of various additional factors, including those discussed in the sections entitled “ _Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations_ ” and “ _Risk Factors_ ” in this Quarterly Report and in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 (our “Annual Report”), as well as in the other reports we file with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”). You should read this Quarterly Report, and the other documents we file with the SEC, with the understanding that our actual future results may be materially different from the results expressed or implied by our forward-looking statements.\n\nWe operate in an evolving environment. New risks and uncertainties emerge from time to time and it is not possible for our management to predict all risks and uncertainties, nor can we assess the impact of all factors on our business or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual future results to be materially different from those expressed or implied by any forward-looking statements.\n\nForward-looking statements speak only as of the date they were made, and, except to the extent required by law or the rules of the Nasdaq Capital Market, we undertake no obligation to update or review any forward-looking statement because of new information, future events or other factors.\n\nWe qualify all of our forward-looking statements by these cautionary statements.\n\n3  \n---  \n  \n**PART I — FINANCIAL INFORMATION**\n\n**ITEM 1 – FINANCIAL STATEMENTS**\n\n[Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets as of September 30, 2024 (unaudited) and December 31, 2023](#sw_004) | 5  \n---|---  \n[Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 (unaudited)](#sw_005) | 6  \n[Condensed Consolidated Statements of Stockholders’ Equity for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 (unaudited)](#sw_006) | 7  \n[Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 (unaudited)](#sw_007) | 8  \n[Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (unaudited)](#sw_008) | 9-25  \n  \n4  \n---  \n  \n**VERB TECHNOLOGY COMPANY, INC.**\n\n**CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS**\n\n**(in thousands, except share and per share data)**\n\nSeptember 30, 2024 | December 31, 2023  \n---|---  \n(unaudited)  \nASSETS  \nCurrent assets  \nCash | $| 10,515 | $| 4,353  \nShort-term investments | 5,077 | -

DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS**\n\n**_Our Business_**\n\nReferences in this document to the “Company,” “Verb,” “we,” “us,” or “our” are intended to mean Verb Technology Company, Inc., individually, or as the context requires, collectively with its subsidiaries on a consolidated basis.\n\nOur business is currently comprised of three distinct, yet complimentary business units, all three of which are currently operating and generating revenue, and one of which is currently operating in “stealth mode” as we continue to refine the user experience for that business unit as we continue to ramp sales. The first business unit is MARKET.live focused on interactive video-based social commerce. Our MARKET.live platform is a multi-vendor, livestream social shopping destination leveraging the convergence of ecommerce and entertainment. Brands, retailers and creators that join MARKET.live have the ability to broadcast livestream shopping events simultaneously on numerous social media channels, including TikTok, YouTube, LinkedIn, Facebook, Instagram, Twitch, as well as on MARKET.live, reaching exponentially larger audiences. The Company’s recent technological integrations with META, created a seamless, native, friction-free checkout process for Facebook and Instagram users to purchase MARKET.live vendors’ products within each of those popular apps. This integration allows Facebook and Instagram users to browse products featured in MARKET.live shoppable videos, place products in a native shopping cart and checkout – all without leaving Facebook or Instagram. We recently announced a technology integration with Pinterest and we will continue to expand the universe of social platforms our clients can access through our platform.\n\nLast year we completed development work on a new MARKET.live capability that facilitated a deeper integration into the TikTok Shop social media platform, designed to expose MARKET.live shoppable programming to tens of millions of potential viewers/purchasers. This capability allows shoppers watching a MARKET.live stream on TikTok to stay on that site and check out through that site, eliminating the friction or reluctance of TikTok users to leave their TikTok feed in order to complete their purchase on MARKET.live. Our technology integration allows the purchase data to flow back through MARKET.live and to the individual vendors and stores on MARKET.live seamlessly for fulfillment of the orders.\n\nEarlier this year, we announced an expanded strategic relationship with TikTok evidenced by a formal partnership with TikTok Shop pursuant to which MARKET.live became a service provider for TikTok Shop and officially designated as a TikTok Shop Partner (TSP). Under the terms of the partnership, TikTok Shop refers consumer brands, retailers, influencers and affiliates leads to MARKET.live for a menu of MARKET.live contract-based recurring fee revenue services that include, among other things, assistance in onboarding to TikTok Shop and establishing a TikTok store, hosting training sessions and webinars for prospective TikTok Shop sellers, full creative services including content creation and full remote and in-studio production services, host/influencer casting and management, TikTok Shop maintenance and enhancements for existing TikTok clients’ stores. The same services are currently provided to consumer brands that contact us directly or through several brand agencies with which we maintain affiliate relationships.\n\nThe second business unit is GO FUND YOURSELF!, a revolutionary interactive social crowd funding platform for public and private companies seeking broad-based exposure across numerous social media channels for their crowd-funded Regulation CF and Regulation A offerings. The platform combines a ground-breaking interactive TV show with MARKET.live’s back-end capabilities allowing viewers to tap on their screen to facilitate an investment, in real time, as they watch companies presenting before the show’s panel of “Titans”. Presenting companies that sell consumer products are able to offer their products directly to viewers during the show in real time through shoppable onscreen icons. The Go Fund Yourself business unit generates revenue from cash fees we charge to issuers to appear on the show and for marketing, ad, and content creation and distribution services. For those issuers that sell products during each airing of the show through our platform, we charge a fee up to 25% of the gross sales revenue for all products sold.\n\nHistorically, and continuing up through June 13, 2023, the Company was a Software-as-a-Service (“SaaS”) applications platform developer that offered a SaaS platform for the direct sales industry comprised of a suite of interactive video-based sales enablement business software products marketed on a subscription basis, (the “SaaS Assets”).\n\nOn June 13, 2023, the Company disposed of all of its operating SaaS Assets pursuant to an asset purchase agreement in consideration of the sum of $6,500, $4,750 of which was paid in cash by the buyer at the closing of the transaction (the “Sale of the SaaS Assets”). Additional payments of $1,750 will be paid to us by the buyer if certain profitability and revenue targets are met within the two-year period following the closing as set forth more particularly in the asset purchase agreement. The sale of the SaaS Assets was undertaken to allow us to focus our resources on MARKET.live, and the business verticals that platform could support. We expect our burgeoning MARKET.live business unit will, over time, create greater shareholder value than we could have been created through the continued operation of our SaaS Assets.\n\nAs of September 30, 2024, the Company had cash of $10,515 and short-term investments of $5,077.\n\n9  \n---  \n  \n**_Economic Disruption_**\n\nOur business is dependent in part on general economic conditions. Many jurisdictions in which our customers are located and our products are sold have experienced and could continue to experience unfavorable general economic conditions, such as inflation, increased interest rates and recessionary concerns, which could negatively affect demand for our products. Under difficult economic conditions, customers may seek to cease spending on our current products or fail to adopt our new products, which could negatively affect our financial performance. We cannot predict the timing or magnitude of an economic slowdown or the timing or strength of any economic recovery. These and other economic factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\n\n**2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND SUPPLEMENTAL DISCLOSURES**\n\n**_Basis of Presentation_**\n\nThe accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements are unaudited. These unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”) and applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) regarding interim financial reporting. Certain information and note disclosures normally included in the financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP have been condensed or omitted pursuant to such rules and regulations. Accordingly, these interim condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto contained in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 filed with the SEC on April 1, 2024 (the “2023 Annual Report”). The consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2023 included herein was derived from the audited consolidated financial statements as of that date.\n\nOn October 8, 2024, we implemented a 1-for-200 reverse stock split (the “Reverse Stock Split”) of our common stock, $0.0001 par value per share (the “Common Stock”). Our Common Stock commenced trading on a post Reverse Stock Split basis on October 9, 2024. As a result of the Reverse Stock Split, every two hundred (200) shares of our pre-Reverse Stock Split Common Stock were combined and reclassified into one share of our Common Stock. The number of shares of Common Stock subject to outstanding options, warrants, and convertible securities were also reduced by a factor of two hundred and the exercise price of such securities increased by a factor of two hundred, as of October 8, 2024. All historical share and per-share amounts reflected throughout our condensed consolidated financial statements and other financial information in this Quarterly Report have been adjusted to reflect the Reverse Stock Split. The par value per share of our Common Stock was not affected by the Reverse Stock Split.\n\nAs discussed above, among the terms of the Sale of the SaaS Assets was that additional payments of $1,750 will be paid to us by the buyer if certain profitability and revenue targets are met within the two-year period following the closing. The contingent payments were not recorded at the closing date of the sale and will be recognized as the cash is received and the contingency resolved pursuant to ASC 450-30.\n\nAccordingly, the Company’s consolidated financial statements are being presented pursuant to ASC 360-10-45-9 which requires that a disposal group be classified as held for sale in the period in which all of the held for sale criteria are met. In addition to held for sale accounting, the Company had also met the criterion pursuant to ASC 205-20, _Discontinued Operations_ , as a strategic shift from operating and managing a SaaS business to operating and managing a live streaming shopping platform has occurred because of the sale. The Company’s consolidated results of operations and statements of cash flows have been reclassified to reflect the presentation of discontinued operations. See Note 6 for details of the assets and liabilities related to the SaaS sale and discontinued operations.\n\nIn the opinion of management, the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements contain all adjustments necessary to fairly present the Company’s financial position and results of operations for the interim periods reflected. Except as noted, all adjustments contained herein are of a normal recurring nature. Results of operations for the fiscal periods presented herein are not necessarily indicative of fiscal year-end results.\n\n**_Principles of Consolidation_**\n\nThe consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with GAAP and include the accounts of Verb, Verb Acquisition Co., LLC , and verbMarketplace, LLC. All intercompany accounts have been eliminated in the consolidation.\n\n10  \n---  \n  \n**_Use of Estimates_**\n\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reported periods. Significant estimates include assumptions made in analysis of assumptions made in purchase price allocations, impairment testing of long-term assets, realization of deferred tax assets, determining fair value of derivative liabilities, and valuation of equity instruments issued for services. Some of those assumptions can be subjective and complex, and therefore, actual results could differ materially from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions.\n\n**_Investments_**\n\nIn accordance with ASC 320, _Investments – Debt Securities_ , the Company accounts for its investments as trading securities consisting of U.S. Treasury securities and corporate bonds that are reported at fair value on the Company’s condensed consolidated balance sheet at September 30, 2024. Unrealized gains and losses on these investments are included in other income (expense), net within the Company’s condensed consolidated statements of operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024.\n\nThe Company’s investments in trading securities are classified as current based on the intent of management, the nature of the investments and their availability for use in current operations. See Note 3 – Investments and Fair Value Measurements for further details of the Company’s investments at September 30, 2024.\n\n**_Segment Information_**\n\nEffective July 1, 2024, the Company operates as two reportable segments, MARKET.live and Go Fund Yourself. We identify our segments in accordance with ASC 280, _Segment Reporting,_ and in the manner in which our Chief Executive Officer, as our chief operating decision maker (“CODM”), allocates resources and assesses financial performance. See Note 14 for disclosures of Segment Information.\n\n**_Revenue Recognition_**\n\nThe Company recognizes revenue in accordance with Financial Accounting Standard Board’s (“FASB”) ASC 606, _Revenue from Contracts with Customers_ (“ASC 606”). Revenue through June 13, 2023 was derived primarily from providing application services through the SaaS application, digital marketing and sales support services. During that period, the Company also derived revenue from the sale of customized print products and training materials, branded apparel, and digital tools, as demanded by its customers. As a result of the sale of the SaaS business, revenue that was recorded historically from the SaaS business has been reclassified as part of discontinued operations. See Note 6 for revenue disclosures related to the SaaS business.\n\nMARKET.live revenue is derived from contract-based recurring fee revenue services that include, among other things, assistance in onboarding clients to TikTok Shop and establishing a TikTok store, hosting training sessions and webinars for prospective TikTok Shop sellers, full creative services including content creation and full remote and in-studio production services, host/influencer casting and management, TikTok Shop maintenance and enhancements for existing TikTok clients’ stores. Clients are referred to us through our existing partnership with TikTok Shop as well as from several brand agencies with which we maintain affiliate relationships.\n\nGO FUND YOURSELF! derives revenue from cash fees we charge to issuers to appear on the show and for marketing, ad, and content creation and distribution services. For those issuers that sell products during each airing of the show through our platform, we charge a fee up to 25% of the gross sales revenue for all products sold.\n\nA performance obligation is a promise in a contract to transfer a distinct product. Performance obligations promised in a contract are identified based on the goods that will be transferred that are both capable of being distinct and are distinct in the context of the contract, whereby the transfer of the goods is separately identifiable from other promises in the contract. Performance obligations include establishing and maintaining customer online stores, providing access to the Company’s e-commerce platform and customer service support.\n\nCustomers do not have the contractual right to take possession of the Company’s software. Revenue is recognized in an amount that reflects the contractual consideration that the Company receives in exchange for its services.\n\nRevenue is recognized on a net basis from maintaining e-commerce platforms and online orders, as the Company is engaged primarily in an agency relationship with its customers and earns defined amounts based on the individual contractual terms for the customer and the Company does not take possession of the customers’ inventory or any credit risks relating to the products sold.\n\nSales taxes collected from customers and remitted to governmental authorities are accounted for on a net basis and, therefore, are excluded from net sales in the consolidated statements of operations. Revenues during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, were substantially all generated from clients and customers located within the United States of America.\n\n11  \n---  \n  \n**_Cost of Revenue_**\n\nCost of revenue primarily consists of processing fees and independent contractors associated with the MARKET.live platform and independent contractors for shows related to Go Fund Yourself.\n\n**_Capitalized Software Development Costs_**\n\nThe Company capitalizes internal and external costs directly associated with developing internal-use software, and hosting arrangements that include an internal-use software license, during the application development stage of its projects. The Company’s internal-use software is reported at cost less accumulated amortization. Amortization begins once the project has been completed and is ready for its intended use.\n\nDue to changes in management’s assessment of its capitalized software development asset, the Company revised the asset’s remaining useful life effective January 1, 2024 and will amortize the asset on a straight-line basis over a period of four years. Software maintenance activities or minor upgrades are recorded as expense in the period performed.\n\nAmortization expense related to capitalized software development costs is recorded in depreciation and amortization in the condensed consolidated statements of operations.\n\n**_Preferred Stock_**\n\nThe Company applies the accounting standards for distinguishing liabilities from equity when determining the classification and measurement of its preferred stock. Preferred shares subject to mandatory redemption are classified as liability instruments and are measured at fair value. Conditionally redeemable preferred shares (including preferred shares that feature redemption rights that are either within the control of the holder or subject to redemption upon the occurrence of uncertain events not solely within the Company’s control) are classified as temporary equity. At all other times, preferred shares are classified as part of stockholders’ equity. Accordingly, the Series C Preferred Stock offering on December 29, 2023 is classified as part of stockholders’ equity as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023.\n\n**_Fair Value of Financial Instruments_**\n\nThe Company follows the guidance of FASB ASC 820 and ASC 825 for disclosure and measurement of the fair value of its financial instruments. FASB ASC 820 establishes a framework for measuring fair value under GAAP and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. To increase consistency and comparability in fair value measurements and related disclosures, ASC 820 establishes a fair value hierarchy which prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three (3) broad levels. The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs.\n\nThe three (3) levels of fair value hierarchy defined by ASC 820 are described below:\n\nLevel 1: | Quoted market prices available in active markets for identical assets or liabilities as of the reporting date.  \n---|---  \nLevel 2: | Pricing inputs other than quoted prices in active markets included in Level 1, which are either directly or indirectly observable as of the reporting date.  \nLevel 3: | Pricing inputs that are generally observable inputs and not corroborated by market data.  \n  \nThe carrying amount of the Company’s financial assets and liabilities, such as cash, prepaid expenses, and accounts payable and accrued expenses approximate their fair value due to their short-term nature. The carrying amount of notes payable approximates the fair value due to the fact that the interest rates on these obligations are based on prevailing market interest rates. The Company uses Level 2 inputs for its valuation methodology for the derivative liabilities, see Note 3 for Investments and Fair Value Measurements and Note 8 for Derivative Liability.\n\n12  \n---  \n  \n**_Derivative Financial Instruments_**\n\nThe Company evaluates its financial instruments to determine if such instruments are derivatives or contain features that qualify as embedded derivatives. For derivative financial instruments that are accounted for as liabilities, the derivative instrument is initially recorded at its fair value and is then re-valued at each reporting date, with changes in the fair value reported in the consolidated statements of operations. The classification of derivative instruments, including whether such instruments should be recorded as liabilities or as equity, is evaluated at the end of each reporting period. Derivative instrument liabilities are classified in the balance sheet as current or non-current based on whether or not net-cash settlement of the derivative instrument could be required within 12 months of the balance sheet date.\n\nThe Company uses Level 2 inputs for its valuation methodology for the derivative liabilities as their fair values were determined by using a Binomial pricing model. The Company’s derivative liabilities are adjusted to reflect fair value at each period end, with any increase or decrease in the fair value being recorded in results of operations as adjusted to fair value of derivatives.\n\n**_Share-Based Compensation_**\n\nThe Company issues stock options and warrants, shares of common stock and restricted stock units as share-based compensation to employees and non-employees. The Company accounts for its share-based compensation in accordance with FASB ASC 718, _Compensation – Stock Compensation_. Share-based compensation cost is measured at the grant date, based on the estimated fair value of the award, and is recognized as expense over the requisite service period. The fair value of restricted stock units is determined based on the number of shares granted and the quoted price of our common stock and is recognized as expense over the service period. Forfeitures are accounted for as they occur. Recognition of compensation expense for non-employees is in the same period and manner as if the Company had paid cash for services.\n\n**_Net Loss Per Share_**\n\nBasic net loss per share is computed by using the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted net loss per share is computed giving effect to all dilutive potential shares of common stock that were outstanding during the period. Dilutive potential shares of common stock consist of incremental shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of stock options. No dilutive potential shares of common stock were included in the computation of diluted net loss per share because their impact was anti-dilutive.\n\nAs of September 30, 2024, and 2023, the Company had total outstanding options of 9,038 and 10,284, respectively, and warrants of 3,545 and 4,598, respectively, and outstanding restricted stock awards of 556 and 778, respectively, and convertible notes issued to a related party that were convertible into 0 and 106 shares at $8,240.00 per share, respectively, which were excluded from the computation of net loss per share because they are anti-dilutive.\n\nAt the close of business on April 5, 2024, the Company’s unexercised publicly traded warrants under the symbol VERBW expired pursuant to their original terms and as such Nasdaq suspended trading the 879 remaining warrants and the trading symbol VERBW was delisted from Nasdaq.\n\n**_Concentration of Credit and Other Risks_**\n\nFinancial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist of cash and accounts receivable. Cash is deposited with a limited number of financial institutions. The balances held at any one financial institution at times may be in excess of Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”) insurance limits of up to $250.\n\n13  \n---  \n  \nThe Company’s concentration of credit risk includes its concentrations from key customers and vendors. The details of these significant customers and vendors are presented in the following table for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023:\n\nSCHEDULE OF CONCENTRATION RISK\n\nNine Months Ended September 30,  \n---  \n2024 | 2023  \nThe Company’s largest customers are presented below as a percentage of the aggregate  \nRevenues | Two customers accounted for 41% of revenues | No customers individually over 10%  \nThe Company’s largest vendors are presented below as a percentage of the aggregate  \nPurchases | One vendor accounted for 18% of its purchases individually and in the aggregate | One vendor accounted for 28% of its purchases individually and in the aggregate  \n  \n**_Supplemental Cash Flow Information_**\n\nSCHEDULE OF SUPPLEMENTAL CASH FLOW INFORMATION\n\n2024 | 2023  \n---|---  \nNine Months Ended September 30,  \n2024 | 2023  \nSupplemental disclosures of cash flow information:  \nCash paid for interest | $| 4 | $| 242  \nCash paid for income taxes | $| 1 | $| 2  \nSupplemental disclosure of non-cash investing and financing activities attributable to continuing operations:  \nFair value of common shares issued as payment on notes payable | $| 2,777 | $| 4,092  \nFair value of common shares issued to redeem Series C preferred shares | 2,737 | -  \nFair value of common shares issued to settle accrued expenses | - | 346  \nDerecognition of operating lease right-of-use assets | - | 1,186  \nDerecognition of operating lease liabilities | - | 1,870  \nDerecognition of other assets and liabilities related to lease termination | - | 421  \nRecognition of operating lease right-of-use asset and related lease liability | - | 245  \nSupplemental disclosure of non-cash investing and financing activities attributable to discontinued operations:  \nDiscount recognized from advances on future receipts | $| - | $| 558  \n  \n**_Recent Accounting Pronouncements_**\n\nRecently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements\n\nIn June 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13, _Credit Losses - Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments (“ASC 326”)._ The standard significantly changes how entities will measure credit losses for most financial assets, including accounts and notes receivables. The standard will replace today’s “incurred loss” approach with an “expected loss” model, under which companies will recognize allowances based on expected rather than incurred losses. Entities will apply the standard’s provisions as a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of the first reporting period in which the guidance is effective. The adoption of this standard did not have any material impact on the Company’s financial statements.\n\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\n\nIn November 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued ASU No. 2023-07, _Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures (ASU 2023-07),_ which requires an enhanced disclosure of significant segment expenses on an annual and interim basis. This guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024. Early adoption is permitted. Upon adoption, the guidance should be applied retrospectively to all prior periods presented in the financial statements. We do not expect the adoption of this guidance to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.\n\nOther recent accounting pronouncements issued by the FASB, including its Emerging Issues Task Force, the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, and the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) did not or are not believed by management to have a material impact on the Company’s present or future consolidated financial statements.\n\n14  \n---  \n  \n**3. INVESTMENTS AND FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS**\n\nThe Company invests its surplus funds in excess of operational and capital requirements in a diversified portfolio of marketable securities, with the objectives of delivering competitive returns while maintaining a high degree of liquidity.\n\nA summary of our short-term investments as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, are as follows (in thousands):\n\nSCHEDULE OF SHORT TERM INVESTMENT\n\nSeptember 30, 2024 | December 31, 2023  \n---|---  \nU.S. treasury securities | $| 3,873 | $| -  \nMarketable debt securities | 1,204 | -  \nShort-term investments | $| 5,077 | $| -  \n  \n**_Marketable securities_**\n\nMarketable securities as of September 30, 2024 consisted of the following:\n\nSCHEDULE OF MARKETABLE SECURITIES\n\n(in thousands) | Cost of Amortized Cost | Unrealized Gains | Unrealized Losses | Fair Value  \n---|---|---|---|---  \nMarketable debt securities  \nU.S. treasury securities | $| 3,789 | $| 84 | $| - | $| 3,873  \nCorporate bonds | 1,179 | 25 | - | 1,204  \nTotal marketable debt securities | $| 4,968 | $| 109 | $| - | $| 5,077  \n  \n**_Fair Value Measurements_**\n\nOur financial instruments include cash, prepaid expenses, accounts payable, and accrued liabilities. The fair value of cash, prepaid expenses, accounts payable and accrued liabilities approximate their carrying values due to their short-term nature, which are all considered Level 1. The fair value of long-term debt approximates its carrying value.\n\nOur financial instruments measured at fair value on a recurring basis consisted of U.S. treasury securities, corporate bonds and derivatives (see Note 8). U.S. treasury securities are classified within Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy as they are valued based on quoted market price in an active market. Corporate bonds are valued based on quoted prices in markets that are less active and are generally classified within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. We did not hold Level 1 or Level 2 financial instruments as of December 31, 2023.\n\nFinancial instruments valued based on unobservable inputs which reflect the reporting entity’s own assumptions or data that market participants would use in valuing an instrument are generally classified within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy.

The risk-free interest rate was based on rates established by the Federal Reserve Bank.\n\nDuring the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company recorded income of $1 and $210, respectively, to account for the changes in the fair value of these derivative liabilities during the period.

COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES**\n\n**_Litigation_**\n\nThe Company is currently in a dispute with a former employee of its predecessor bBooth, Inc. who has interposed a breach of contract claim in which he alleges that in 2015 he was entitled to approximately $300 in unpaid bonus compensation. This former employee filed his complaint in the Superior Court of California for the County of Los Angeles on November 20, 2019, styled Meyerson v. Verb Technology Company, Inc., et al. (Case No. 19STCV41816). The Company disputed the former employee’s claims and interposed several affirmative defenses, including that the claims are contradicted by documentary evidence, barred by the applicable statute of limitations, and barred by a written, executed release. On February 9, 2021, the former employee’s counsel filed a motion for summary judgment, or in the alternative, summary adjudication against the Company. On October 13, 2021, the California court issued an order (i) denying the former employee’s motion for summary judgment on his claims against the Company, but (ii) granting the former employee’s motion to dismiss the Company’s affirmative defenses, which ruling the Company contends was in error. Under the rules, the Company is precluded from appealing the dismissal of its affirmative defenses until after a trial. On August 29, 2023, after a bench trial at which the Company was precluded from introducing evidence of its affirmative defenses, the court found in favor of Plaintiff Meyerson; and judgment was entered in Meyerson’s favor in the amount of $584 which included interest. Meyerson’s counsel thereafter submitted an untimely request for attorney’s fees and costs which the Company has opposed. After due consideration, the Court awarded Meyerson’s counsel only approximately $8 in counsel fees. After the trial, the Company filed a timely appeal from the judgment (Meyerson v. Verb Technology Company, Inc. (2023 2nd Appellate District) Case No.: B334777, seeking among other things, that the trial court’s finding be vacated and that the Company’s affirmative defenses be reinstated. As of this date, the appeal has yet to be heard. In the interim, the Company bonded the judgement preventing any enforcement or collection of the judgement while the appeal is pending. The Company has accrued the liability at September 30, 2024 and believes the accrual is adequate pending the outcome of the appeal process.\n\nThe Company knows of no material proceedings in which any of its directors, officers, or affiliates, or any registered or beneficial stockholder is a party adverse to the Company or any of its subsidiaries or has a material interest adverse to the Company or any of its subsidiaries.\n\nThe Company believes it has adequately reserved for all litigation within its financial statements.\n\n**_Board of Directors_**\n\nThe Company has committed an aggregate of $598 in board fees to its three independent board members over the term of their appointment for services to be rendered. This amount includes a one-time performance-based bonus payment to a board member that is non-recurring. The Company’s CEO does not receive compensation for serving on the Board of Directors.\n\nBoard fees are accrued and paid monthly. The members will serve on the board until the annual meeting for the year in which their term expires or until their successors have been elected and qualified.\n\nTotal board fees expensed during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was $501.\n\n**14. SEGMENT REPORTING**\n\nThe Company currently operates two reportable segments, MARKET.live and Go Fund Yourself. The Company also operates a third business unit, currently operating in stealth mode, which for the period ending September 30, 2024, the Company does not deem to be a reportable segment.\n\nThe following tables summarize the Company’s reportable segment information and unallocated corporate expenses (in thousands):\n\nSCHEDULE OF SEGMENT REPORTING\n\n(in thousands) | MARKET.live | Go Fund Yourself | Corporate | Consolidated | MARKET.live | Go Fund Yourself | Corporate | Consolidated  \n---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \nThree months ended September 30, 2024 | Three months ended September 30, 2023  \nReportable Segments | Reportable Segments  \n(in thousands) | MARKET.live | Go Fund Yourself | Corporate | Consolidated | MARKET.live | Go Fund Yourself | Corporate | Consolidated  \nRevenues | $| 103 | $| 25 | $| - | $| 128 | $| 29 | $|  - | $| - | $| 29  \nCosts and expenses:  \nCost of revenue, exclusive of depreciation and amortization shown separately below | 35 | 19 | - | 54 | 5 | - | - | 5  \nDepreciation and amortization | 250 | 3 | 20 | 273 | 539 | - | 25 | 564  \nGeneral and administrative | 847 | 204 | 1,062 | 2,113 | 636 | - | 2,214 | 2,850  \nTotal costs and expenses | 1,132 | 226 | 1,082 | 2,440 | 1,180 | - | 2,239 | 3,419  \nOperating loss | $| (1,029| ) | $| (201| ) | $| (1,082| ) | $| (2,312| ) | $| (1,151| ) | **$**|  - | $| (2,239| ) | $| (3,390| )  \n(in thousands) | MARKET.live | Go Fund Yourself | Corporate | Consolidated | MARKET.live | Go Fund Yourself | Corporate | Consolidated  \n---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \nNine months ended September 30, 2024 | Nine months ended September 30, 2023  \nReportable Segments | Reportable Segments  \n(in thousands) | MARKET.live | Go Fund Yourself | Corporate | Consolidated | MARKET.live | Go Fund Yourself | Corporate | Consolidated  \nRevenues | $| 147 | $| 25 | $| - | $| 172 | $| 34 | $|  - | $| - | $| 34  \nCosts and expenses:  \nCost of revenue, exclusive of depreciation and amortization shown separately below | 71 | 19 | - | 90 | 7 | - | - | 7  \nDepreciation and amortization | 749 | 3 | 46 | 798 | 1,616 | - | 114 | 1,730  \nGeneral and administrative | 2,865 | 222 | 4,131 | 7,218 | 1,963 | - | 7,117 | 9,080  \nTotal costs and expenses | 3,685 | 244 | 4,177 | 8,106 | 3,586 | - | 7,231 | 10,817  \nOperating loss | $| (3,538| ) | $| (219| ) | $| (4,177| ) | $| (7,934| ) | $| (3,552| ) | $| - | $| (7,231| ) | $| (10,783| )  \n  \n23  \n---  \n  \n**15. SUBSEQUENT EVENTS**\n\nThe Company has evaluated subsequent events through November 5, 2024, the date these financial statements are available to be issued. The Company believes there were no material events or transactions discovered during this evaluation that requires recognition or disclosure in the financial statements other than the items discussed below.\n\n**_Series C Preferred Shares Redeemed in Exchange for Common Shares_**\n\nOn December 29, 2023, the Company issued 3,000 Series C Preferred Shares to an institutional investor pursuant to a securities purchase agreement and certificate of designation previously filed. The Series C Preferred Shares carried a 10% annual dividend.\n\nSubsequent to September 30, 2024, the Company redeemed 895 Series C Preferred Shares in exchange for 196,856 common shares to fully redeem the Series C Preferred Shares that were outstanding. On October 14, 2024, the Company redeemed 187 Series C Preferred Shares in exchange for 32,913 common shares to fully repay the amount accrued for preferred dividends. The transaction was done at the Nasdaq at-the-market price. No broker was involved in the transaction and no fees or commissions were paid or incurred by the Company.\n\n**_Nasdaq Compliance and Reverse Stock Split_**\n\nOn August 2, 2024, the Company filed a preliminary proxy statement on Schedule 14A in connection with the Company’s annual meeting of stockholders scheduled for September 26, 2024 (the “September 26, 2024 annual meeting”). On August 6, 2024, the Company filed an amended proxy statement on Schedule PRER14A indicating that in the event the Company does not regain compliance with the Bid Price Rule on or before September 26, 2024, then at the annual meeting, the Company intends to seek the approval of its stockholders to implement a reverse stock split in the range within a range of one-for-five (1-for-5) to a maximum of a one-for-two hundred (1-for-200).\n\nOn August 6, 2024, the Company received notice from the Staff indicating that the bid price for the Company’s common stock had closed below $0.10 per share for the 10-consecutive trading day period ended August 5, 2024 and, accordingly, the Company is subject to the provisions contemplated under Nasdaq Listing Rule 5810(c)(3)(A)(iii) (the “Low Priced Stock Rule”) and its securities were subject to delisting from Nasdaq unless the Company timely requested a hearing before the Nasdaq Hearings Panel (the “Panel”).\n\nOn August 12, 2024, the Company timely requested a hearing before the Panel, which request automatically stayed any further action by Nasdaq until the hearing was held and the expiration of any extension period that may have been granted by the Panel. The Company’s common stock continued to trade on Nasdaq under the symbol “VERB” pending completion of the hearing process.\n\nOn August 28, 2024, the Panel determined to grant the Company a temporary exception until October 21, 2024, to effect a reverse stock split of its common stock and thereafter regain compliance with The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC’s Listing Rule 5550(a)(2). On October 2, 2024, the Panel amended the exception granted to the Company to provide that the Company has until October 22, 2024, to effect a reverse stock split to regain compliance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(a)(2).\n\nAt the September 26, 2024 annual meeting, the Company’s stockholders voted to approve a reverse stock split within a range of one-for-five (1-for-5) to a maximum of a one-for-two hundred (1-for-200). Given the then price of the Company’s shares and the limited time frames established by the Panel, on October 8, 2024 the Board implemented a 1 for 200 reverse stock split (the “Reverse Stock Split”) and on October 9, 2034 the Company’s shares began trading on post-split basis.\n\nOn October 23, 2024, after the elapse of ten trading days, the Company received a letter from the Nasdaq Stock Market stating that the Company had regained compliance with the minimum bid price requirement of $1.00 per share for continued listing on the Nasdaq Stock Market, as set forth in Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(a)(2). As is customary, the Company will be subject to a mandatory panel monitor for a period of one year from October 23, 2024. If, within that one-year monitoring period, the Nasdaq Listing Qualifications staff (the “Staff”) finds the Company is again out of compliance with the minimum bid price requirement, notwithstanding Nasdaq Listing Rule 5810(c)(2), then the Staff will issue a delist determination letter and the Company will have an opportunity to request a new hearing with the initial Nasdaq Panel or a newly convened hearing panel if the initial Panel is unavailable.\n\n24  \n---  \n  \n**_Corporate Action, Change of Control, and Extraordinary Performance Agreements_**\n\nAs of the date of this Form 10-Q, the Company’s shares have traded and are continuing to trade at a price that results in a market cap that is significantly less than the Company’s current net cash position. Accordingly, the Company’s Board of Directors has determined that the Company is vulnerable to hostile takeover action and that any such action at this time is not in the best interests of its stockholders. The Company does not currently have any poison pill type provisions and due to previous reverse stock splits and other capital markets activities, the Company’s management and board members currently own an insignificant number of shares and as such would be ineffective in voting such shares to thwart any hostile takeover actions. Until such time as the Board determines whether it is necessary or advisable to adopt a poison pill provision or other anti-takeover measure, on October 31, 2024 the Board determined to approve the entry into Corporate Action, Change of Control, and Extraordinary Performance Agreements (the “Agreement”) with Rory J. Cutaia, Founder, Chairman and CEO of the Company, and James Geiskopf, Lead Director, (the “Awardees”) pursuant to which the Company will issue fully vested restricted stock units (“RSU”) subject to certain triggering events (the “Triggering Events”), as described below. Each RSU represents the right to be issued one share of common stock (the shares upon vesting, are subject to the restrictions as set forth in the Agreement, under the Company’s 2019 Omnibus Incentive Plan, or the RSU award agreement).\n\nThe Triggering Events include, among other things, the following:\n\n1. | Acceleration Upon a Corporate Transaction or Change of Control  \n---|---  \na. | “Corporate Transaction” means any person or Group (as defined in the Agreement) acquires an ownership of Shares (or other voting securities of the Company then outstanding) of the Company possessing thirteen percent (13%) or more of the total voting power of the Shares (or other voting securities then outstanding) of the Company where such person or Group is required to file a Schedule 13D (Beneficial Ownership Report (for >5% ownership with intent to influence)) with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission within 10 days of such acquisition. In the event of either a Corporate Transaction or a Change of Control, on or prior to December 31, 2025, the Awardee shall be entitled to fully vested 80,000 Restricted Stock Units for each Measurement Date (as defined in the Agreement) that cannot be reached due to the Change of Control. For example, for clarity, if the Corporate Transaction or Change of Control closes on July 15, 2025, then the Awardee shall be entitled to 160,000 Restricted Stock Units (2 Measurement Dates x 80,000). Such accelerated Restricted Stock Units shall be fully vested to the Awardee and the Company shall grant and deliver the accelerated Restricted Stock Units Awards to Awardee on or prior to such closing of the Corporate Transaction or Change of Control.  \n---|---  \nb. | “Change of Control” means and includes each of the following:  \ni. | any one person, or group of owners of another corporation who, acting together through a merger, consolidation, purchase, acquisition of stock or the like (a “Group”), acquires ownership of Shares of the Company that, together with the Shares held by such person or Group, constitutes more than fifty percent (50%) of the total fair market value or total voting power of the Shares of the Company (or other voting securities of the Company then outstanding). However, if such person or Group is considered to own more than fifty percent (50%) of the total fair market value or total voting power of the Shares (or other voting securities of the Company then outstanding) before this transfer of the Company’s Shares (or other voting securities of the Company then outstanding), the acquisition of additional Shares (or other voting securities of the Company then outstanding) by the same person or Group shall not be considered to cause a Change of Control of the Company; or  \n---|---  \nii. | any one person or Group acquires (or has acquired during the twelve (12)-month period ending on the date of the most recent acquisition by such person or persons) ownership of Shares (or other voting securities of the Company then outstanding) of the Company possessing thirty percent (30%) or more of the total voting power of the Shares (or other voting securities then outstanding) of the Company where such person or Group is not merely acquiring additional control of the Company; or  \niii. | a majority of members of the Company’s Board is replaced during any twelve (12)-month period by directors whose appointment or election is not endorsed by a majority of the members of the Company’s Board prior to the date of the appointment or election (the “Incumbent Board”), but excluding, for purposes of determining whether a majority of the Incumbent Board has endorsed any candidate for election to the Board, any individual whose initial assumption of office occurs as a result of an actual or threatened election contest with respect to the election or removal of directors or other actual or threatened solicitation of proxies or consents by or on behalf of a person or Group other than the Company’s Board; or  \niv. | any one person or Group acquires (or has acquired during the twelve (12)-month period ending on the date of the most recent acquisition by such person or Group) all or substantially all of the assets from the Company that have a total gross fair market value equal to or more than forty percent (40%) of the total fair market value of all assets of the Company immediately prior to such acquisition or acquisitions. For this purpose, “gross fair market value” means the value of the assets of the Company, or the value of the assets being disposed of, determined without regard to any liabilities associated with such assets.   \n  \nThe Triggering Events also include partial issuances of RSU’s to the Awardees through the achievement of extraordinary performance-based quarterly revenue milestones as determined by the Board (the “Revenue Milestones”), and as measured on specific dates, each a “Measurement Date” defined as December 31, 2024, March 31, 2025, June 30, 2025, September 30, 2025, and December 31, 2025, and the Awardees providing continuous services through the achievement of such milestones. Pursuant to the Agreement, each Awardee may be entitled to receive between 40,000 and 80,000 RSU’s upon achieving the following Revenue Milestones (i) between $500,000 and $900,000 as of December 31, 2024, (ii) between $1.1M and $1.5M as of March 31, 2025, (iii) between $1.7M and $2.1M as of June 30, 2025, (iv) between $2.3M and $2.7M as of September 30, 2025, and (v) $2.9M and $3.3M as of December 31, 2025. The achievement of each of the applicable quarterly Revenue Milestones on each Measurement Date will be reasonably determined by the Company’s Board of Directors.\n\nThe foregoing description of the above Agreement is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Agreement, copies of which are attached hereto as Exhibit 10.1 and Exhibit 10.2 and incorporated herein by reference.\n\n25  \n---  \n  \n**ITEM 2 – MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS**\n\n**Forward-Looking Statements**\n\n_The following discussion and analysis of the results of operations and financial condition of our company for the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and related notes and the other financial information that are included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. This discussion includes forward-looking statements based upon current expectations that involve risks and uncertainties, such as our plans, objectives, expectations, and intentions. Forward-looking statements are statements not based on historical fact and which relate to future operations, strategies, financial results, or other developments. Forward-looking statements are based upon estimates, forecasts, and assumptions that are inherently subject to significant business, economic, and competitive uncertainties and contingencies, many of which are beyond our control and many of which, with respect to business decisions, are subject to change. These uncertainties and contingencies can cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in any forward-looking statements made by us, or on our behalf. We disclaim any obligation to update forward-looking statements. Actual results and the timing of events could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of a number of factors. We use words such as “anticipate,” “estimate,” “plan,” “project,” “continuing,” “ongoing,” “expect,” “believe,” “intend,” “may,” “will,” “should,” “could,” and similar expressions to identify forward-looking statements._\n\n_References in this document to the “Company,” “Verb,” “we,” “us,” or “our” are intended to mean Verb Technology Company, Inc., individually, or as the context requires, collectively with its subsidiaries on a consolidated basis, unless otherwise specified._\n\n**_Overview_**\n\nOur business is currently comprised of three distinct, yet complimentary business units, all three of which are currently operating and generating revenue, and one of which is currently operating in “stealth mode” as we continue to refine the user experience for that business unit as we continue to ramp sales. The first business unit is MARKET.live focused on interactive video-based social commerce. Our MARKET.live platform is a multi-vendor, livestream social shopping destination leveraging the convergence of ecommerce and entertainment. Brands, retailers and creators that join MARKET.live have the ability to broadcast livestream shopping events simultaneously on numerous social media channels, including TikTok, YouTube, LinkedIn, Facebook, Instagram, Twitch, as well as on MARKET.live, reaching exponentially larger audiences. The Company’s recent technological integrations with META, created a seamless, native, friction-free checkout process for Facebook and Instagram users to purchase MARKET.live vendors’ products within each of those popular apps. This integration allows Facebook and Instagram users to browse products featured in MARKET.live shoppable videos, place products in a native shopping cart and checkout – all without leaving Facebook or Instagram. We recently announced a technology integration with Pinterest and we will continue to expand the universe of social platforms our clients can access through our platform.\n\nLast year we completed development work on a new MARKET.live capability that facilitated a deeper integration into the TikTok Shop social media platform, designed to expose MARKET.live shoppable programming to tens of millions of potential viewers/purchasers. This capability allows shoppers watching a MARKET.live stream on TikTok to stay on that site and check out through that site, eliminating the friction or reluctance of TikTok users to leave their TikTok feed in order to complete their purchase on MARKET.live. Our technology integration allows the purchase data to flow back through MARKET.live and to the individual vendors and stores on MARKET.live seamlessly for fulfillment of the orders.\n\n26  \n---  \n  \nEarlier this year, we announced an expanded strategic relationship with TikTok evidenced by a formal partnership with TikTok Shop pursuant to which MARKET.live became a service provider for TikTok Shop and officially designated as a TikTok Shop Partner (TSP) . Under the terms of the partnership, TikTok Shop refers consumer brands, retailers, influencers and affiliates leads to MARKET.live for a menu of MARKET.live contract-based recurring fee revenue services that include, among other things, assistance in onboarding to TikTok Shop and establishing a TikTok store, hosting training sessions and webinars for prospective TikTok Shop sellers, full creative services including content creation and full remote and in-studio production services, host/influencer casting and management, TikTok Shop maintenance and enhancements for existing TikTok clients’ stores. The same services are currently provided to consumer brands that contact us directly or through several brand agencies with which we maintain affiliate relationships.\n\nThe second business unit is GO FUND YOURSELF!, a revolutionary interactive social crowd funding platform for public and private companies seeking broad-based exposure across numerous social media channels for their crowd-funded Regulation CF and Regulation A offerings. The platform combines a ground-breaking interactive TV show with MARKET.live’s back-end capabilities allowing viewers to tap on their screen to facilitate an investment, in real time, as they watch companies presenting before the show’s panel of “Titans”. Presenting companies that sell consumer products are able to offer their products directly to viewers during the show in real time through shoppable onscreen icons. The Go Fund Yourself business unit generates revenue from cash fees we charge to issuers to appear on the show and for marketing, ad, and content creation and distribution services. For those issuers that sell products during each airing of the show through our platform, we charge a fee up to 25% of the gross sales revenue for all products sold.\n\nHistorically, and continuing up through June 13, 2023, we were a Software-as-a-Service (“SaaS”) applications platform developer that offered a SaaS platform for the direct sales industry comprised of a suite of interactive video-based sales enablement business software products marketed on a subscription basis, (the “SaaS Assets”).\n\nOn June 13, 2023, the Company disposed of all of its operating SaaS Assets pursuant to an asset purchase agreement in consideration of the sum of $6,500, $4,750 of which was paid in cash by the buyer at the closing of the transaction (the “Sale of the SaaS Assets”). Additional payments of $1,750 will be paid by the buyer if certain profitability and revenue targets are met within the two-year period following the closing as set forth more particularly in the asset purchase agreement. The sale of the SaaS Assets was undertaken to allow us to focus our resources on MARKET.live, and the business verticals that platform could support. We expect our burgeoning MARKET.live business unit will, over time, create greater shareholder value than we could have been created through the continued operation of our SaaS Assets.\n\nAs of September 30, 2024, the Company had cash of $10,515 and short-term investments of $5,077.\n\nCustomers do not have the contractual right to take possession of the Company’s software. Revenue is recognized in an amount that reflects the contractual consideration that the Company receives in exchange for its services. The Company does not take possession of the customers’ inventory or any credit risks relating to the products sold.\n\nSales taxes collected from customers and remitted to governmental authorities are accounted for on a net basis and, therefore, are excluded from net sales in the consolidated statements of operations. Revenues during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, were substantially all generated from clients and customers located within the United States of America.\n\n27  \n---  \n  \n**Results of Operations**\n\n**_For the Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 as Compared to the Three Months Ended September 30, 2023_**\n\nThe following is a comparison of our results of operations for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 (in thousands):\n\n**Three Months Ended September 30,**  \n---  \n**2024** | **2023** | **Change**  \n**Revenue** | $ | 128 | $ | 29 | $ | 99  \n**Costs and expenses**  \nCost of revenue, exclusive of depreciation and amortization shown separately below | 54 | 5 | 49  \nDepreciation and amortization | 273 | 564 | (291 | )  \nGeneral and administrative | 2,113 | 2,850 | (737 | )  \nTotal costs and expenses | 2,440 | 3,419 | (979 | )  \nOperating loss from continuing operations | (2,312 | ) | (3,390 | ) | 1,078  \n**Other income (expense), net**  \nInterest income | 193 | - | 193  \nUnrealized gain on short-term investments | 109 | - | 109  \nInterest expense | (1 | ) | (219 | ) | 218  \nFinancing costs | - | - | -  \nOther income, net | 46 | 64 | (18 | )  \nChange in fair value of derivative liability | - | 4 | (4 | )  \nTotal other income (expense), net | 347 | (151 | ) | 498  \n**Net loss from continuing operations** | **$** | **(1,965** | **)** | **$** | **(3,541** | **)** | **$** | **1,576**  \n  \n28  \n---  \n  \n**_Revenue_**\n\nRevenue was $128 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to $29 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The revenue of $99, representing an increase of 341% over the same period last year is primarily attributable to revenue received through the Company’s partnership with TikTok and the TikTok related and other services packages within the Company’s MARKET.live business unit, and from the Company’s Go Fund Yourself business unit.\n\n**_Operating Expenses_**\n\nDepreciation and amortization expenses were $273 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to $564 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease is due to a revision in the amortization of software development costs resulting from extending the life of the asset on January 1, 2024.\n\nGeneral and administrative expenses including stock compensation expense were $2,113 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to $2,850 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease of $737 or 26%, in general and administrative expenses including stock compensation expense is primarily due to a decrease in stock compensation expense and legal fees.\n\n**_Other Income, net_**\n\nOther income, net, for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was $347, which was primarily attributable to interest income.\n\n**_For the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 as Compared to the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023_**\n\nThe following is a comparison of our results of operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 (in thousands):\n\nNine Months Ended September 30,  \n---  \n2024 | 2023 | Change  \nRevenue | $| 172 | $| 34 | $| 138  \nCosts and expenses  \nCost of revenue, exclusive of depreciation and amortization shown separately below | 90 | 7 | 83  \nDepreciation and amortization | 798 | 1,730 | (932| )  \nGeneral and administrative | 7,218 | 9,080 | (1,862| )  \nTotal costs and expenses | 8,106 | 10,817 | (2,711| )  \nOperating loss from continuing operations | (7,934| ) | (10,783| ) | 2,849  \nOther income (expense), net  \nInterest income | 361 | - | 361  \nUnrealized gain on short-term investments | 109 | - | 109  \nInterest expense | (236| ) | (989| ) | 753  \nFinancing costs | (90| ) | (1,239| ) | 1,149  \nOther income, net | 648 | 844 | (196| )  \nChange in fair value of derivative liability | 1 | 210 | (209| )  \nTotal other income (expense), net | 793 | (1,174| ) | 1,967  \nNet loss from continuing operations | $| (7,141| ) | $| (11,957| ) | $| 4,816  \n  \n29  \n---  \n  \n**_Revenue_**\n\nRevenue was $172 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to $34 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The revenue of $138, representing an increase of 406%, is primarily attributable to revenue received through the Company’s partnership with TikTok and the TikTok related and other services packages within the Company’s MARKET.live business unit, and from the Company’s Go Fund Yourself business unit.\n\n**_Operating Expenses_**\n\nDepreciation and amortization expenses were $798 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to $1,730 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease is due to a revision in the amortization of software development costs resulting from extending the life of the asset on January 1, 2024.\n\nGeneral and administrative expenses including stock compensation expense were $7,218 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to $9,080 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease of $1,862 or 21% in general and administrative expenses including stock compensation expense is primarily due to a decrease in stock compensation expense and a decrease in legal fees.\n\n**_Other Income, net_**\n\nOther income, net, for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was $793, which was primarily attributable to other income, net of $648 and interest income, net of $234, both offset by financing costs of $90.\n\n**_Use of Non-GAAP Measures – Modified EBITDA_**\n\nIn addition to our results under generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”), we present Modified EBITDA as a supplemental measure of our performance. However, Modified EBITDA is not a recognized measurement under GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to net income, income from operations or any other performance measure derived in accordance with GAAP or as an alternative to cash flow from operating activities as a measure of liquidity. We define Modified EBITDA as net income (loss), plus depreciation and amortization, share-based compensation, interest (income) expense, unrealized gain on short-term investments, financing costs, change in fair value of derivative liability, other (income) expense, loss from discontinued operations, net of tax, and other non-recurring charges.\n\nManagement considers our core operating performance to be that which our managers can affect in any particular period through their management of the resources that affect our underlying revenue and profit generating operations that period. Non-GAAP adjustments to our results prepared in accordance with GAAP are itemized below. You are encouraged to evaluate these adjustments and the reasons we consider them appropriate for supplemental analysis. In evaluating Modified EBITDA, you should be aware that in the future we may incur expenses that are the same as or similar to some of the adjustments in this presentation. Our presentation of Modified EBITDA should not be construed as an inference that our future results will be unaffected by unusual or non-recurring items.\n\nThree Months Ended September 30, | Nine Months Ended September 30,  \n---|---  \n(in thousands) | 2024 | 2023 | 2024 | 2023  \nNet loss | $| (1,965| ) | $| (3,709| ) | $| (7,141| ) | $| (19,079| )  \nAdjustments:  \nDepreciation and amortization | 273 | 564 | 798 | 1,730  \nShare-based compensation | 220 | 583 | 958 | 1,985  \nOther income, net | (46| ) | (64| ) | (648| ) | (844| )  \nFinancing costs | - | - | 90 | 1,239  \nInterest income | (193| ) | - | (361| ) | -  \nUnrealized gain on short-term investments | (109| ) | - | (109| ) | -  \nInterest expense | 1 | 219 | 236 | 989  \nChange in fair value of derivative liability | - | (4| ) | (1| ) | (210| )  \nLoss from discontinued operations, net of tax | - | 168 | - | 7,122  \nOther non-recurring costs (a) | - | 400 | 97 | 585  \nTotal EBITDA adjustments | 146 | 1,866 | 1,060 | 12,596  \nModified EBITDA | $| (1,819| ) | $| (1,843| ) | $| (6,081| ) | $| (6,483| )  \n  \n30  \n---  \n  \n(a) Represents litigation and severance costs.\n\nWe present Modified EBITDA because we believe it assists investors and analysts in comparing our performance across reporting periods on a consistent basis by excluding items that we do not believe are indicative of our core operating performance. In addition, we use Modified EBITDA in developing our internal budgets, forecasts and strategic plan; in analyzing the effectiveness of our business strategies in evaluating potential acquisitions; and in making compensation decisions and in communications with our board of directors concerning our financial performance. Modified EBITDA has limitations as an analytical tool, which includes, among others, the following:\n\n● | Modified EBITDA does not reflect our cash expenditures, or future requirements, for capital expenditures or contractual commitments;  \n---|---  \n● | Modified EBITDA does not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs;  \n● | Modified EBITDA does not reflect future interest expense, or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments, on our debts; and  \n● | Although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized will often have to be replaced in the future, and Modified EBITDA does not reflect any cash requirements for such replacements.  \n  \n**Liquidity and Capital Resources**\n\n**_Overview_**\n\nAs of September 30, 2024, we had cash of $10.5 million and short-term investments of $5.1 million.\n\nThe following is a summary of our cash flows from operating, investing, and financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 (in thousands):\n\nNine Months Ended September 30,  \n---  \n2024 | 2023  \nCash used in operating activities – continuing operations | $| (6,901| ) | $| (6,619| )  \nCash used in operating activities – discontinued operations | - | (1,855| )  \nCash used in investing activities – continuing operations | (5,234| ) | (275| )  \nCash provided by investing activities – discontinued operations | - | 4,750  \nCash provided by financing activities – continuing operations | 18,297 | 4,855  \nCash used in financing activities – discontinued operations | - | (2,367| )  \nIncrease (decrease) in cash | $| 6,162 | $| (1,511| )  \n  \n31  \n---  \n  \n**_Cash Flows – Operating_**\n\nFor the nine months ended September 30, 2024, our cash used in operating activities from continuing operations amounted to $6,901, compared to cash used in operating activities from continuing operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 of $6,619.\n\n**_Cash Flows – Investing_**\n\nFor the nine months ended September 30, 2024, our cash flows used in investing activities amounted to $5,234, primarily due to our purchases of short-term investments.\n\n**_Cash Flows – Financing_**\n\nFor the nine months ended September 30, 2024, our cash flows provided by financing activities amounted to $18,297, which represented $18,596 of net proceeds from the issuance of shares of our common stock, offset primarily by $180 in offering costs paid in January 2024 related to our preferred stock offering in December 2023 and other offering costs paid of $105 related to our common stock offerings.\n\n**Notes Payable**\n\nWe have the following outstanding note payable as of September 30, 2024 (in thousands):\n\nNote | Issuance Date | Maturity Date | Interest Rate | Original Borrowing | Balance at September 30, 2024  \n---|---|---|---|---|---  \nNote payable (A) | May 15, 2020 | May 15, 2050 | 3.75| % | $| 150 | $| 123  \nNon-current | (103| )  \nCurrent | $| 20  \n(A) | On May 15, 2020, we executed an unsecured loan with the U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA) under the Economic Injury Disaster Loan program in the amount of $150. Monthly payments, including principal and interest, began October 26, 2022. As of September 30, 2024, the outstanding balance of the note amounted to $123.  \n---|---  \n  \n32  \n---  \n  \n**Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates**\n\nOur financial statements have been prepared in accordance with GAAP, which require that we make certain assumptions and estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of net revenue and expenses during each reporting period.\n\n**_Use of Estimates_**\n\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported periods. Significant estimates include assumptions made for assumptions made in valuing assets acquired in business combinations, impairment testing of long-lived assets, the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets, assumptions used in valuing derivative liabilities, assumptions used in valuing share-based compensation, and accruals for contingent liabilities. Amounts could materially change in the future.\n\n**_Investments_**\n\nIn accordance with ASC 320, _Investments – Debt Securities_ , the Company accounts for itsinvestments as trading securities consisting of U.S. Treasury securities and corporate bonds that are reported at fair value on the Company’s condensed consolidated balance sheet at September 30, 2024. Unrealized gains and losses on these investments are included in other income (expense), net within the Company’s condensed consolidated statements of operations. \n\nThe Company’s investments in trading securities are classified as current based on the intent of management, the nature of the investments and their availability for use in current operations.\n\n**_Capitalized Software Development Costs_**\n\nThe Company capitalizes internal and external costs directly associated with developing internal-use software, and hosting arrangements that include an internal-use software license, during the application development stage of its projects. The Company’s internal-use software is reported at cost less accumulated amortization. Amortization begins once the project has been completed and is ready for its intended use. \n\nDue to changes in management’s assessment of its capitalized software development asset, the Company revised the asset’s remaining useful life effective January 1, 2024 and will amortize the asset on a straight-line basis over a period of four years. Software maintenance activities or minor upgrades are recorded as expense in the period performed.\n\nAmortization expense related to capitalized software development costs is recorded in depreciation and amortization in the condensed consolidated statements of operations.\n\n**_Segment Information_**\n\nEffective July 1, 2024, the Company operates as two reportable segments, MARKET.live and Go Fund Yourself. We identify our segments in accordance with ASC 280, _Segment Reporting,_ and in the manner in which our Chief Executive Officer, as our chief operating decision maker (“CODM”), allocates resources and assesses financial performance. \n\n**_Revenue Recognition_**\n\nThe Company recognizes revenue in accordance with Financial Accounting Standard Board’s (“FASB”) ASC 606, _Revenue from Contracts with Customers_ (“ASC 606”). ASC 606 creates a five-step model that requires entities to exercise judgment when considering the terms of contract(s), which includes (1) identifying the contract(s) or agreement(s) with a customer, (2) identifying our performance obligations in the contract or agreement, (3) determining the transaction price, (4) allocating the transaction price to the separate performance obligations, and (5) recognizing revenue as each performance obligation is satisfied.\n\nMARKET.live revenue is derived from contract-based recurring fee revenue services that include, among other things, assistance in onboarding clients to TikTok Shop and establishing a TikTok store, hosting training sessions and webinars for prospective TikTok Shop sellers, full creative services including content creation and full remote and in-studio production services, host/influencer casting and management, TikTok Shop maintenance and enhancements for existing TikTok clients’ stores. Clients are referred to us through our existing partnership with TikTok Shop as well as from several brand agencies with which we maintain affiliate relationships.\n\nGO FUND YOURSELF! derives revenue from cash fees we charge to issuers to appear on the show and for marketing, ad, and content creation and distribution services. For those issuers that sell products during each airing of the show through our platform, we charge a fee up to 25% of the gross sales revenue for all products sold.\n\nA performance obligation is a promise in a contract to transfer a distinct product. Performance obligations promised in a contract are identified based on the goods that will be transferred that are both capable of being distinct and are distinct in the context of the contract, whereby the transfer of the goods is separately identifiable from other promises in the contract. Performance obligations include establishing and maintaining customer online stores, providing access to the Company’s e-commerce platform and customer service support.\n\nThe Company’s revenue is generated primarily from services it provides as referenced above in the Revenue Recognition section. Customers do not have the contractual right to take possession of the Company’s software. Revenue is recognized in an amount that reflects the contractual consideration that the Company receives in exchange for its services.\n\nRevenue is recognized on a net basis from maintaining e-commerce platforms and online orders, as the Company is engaged primarily in an agency relationship with its customers and earns defined amounts based on the individual contractual terms for the customer and the Company does not take possession of the customers’ inventory or any credit risks relating to the products sold.\n\nSales taxes collected from customers and remitted to governmental authorities are accounted for on a net basis and, therefore, are excluded from net sales in the consolidated statements of operations.\n\n33  \n---  \n  \n**_Derivative Financial Instruments_**\n\nWe evaluate our financial instruments to determine if such instruments are derivatives or contain features that qualify as embedded derivatives. For derivative financial instruments that are accounted for as liabilities, the derivative instrument is initially recorded at its fair value and is then re-valued at each reporting date, with changes in the fair value reported in the consolidated statements of operations. The classification of derivative instruments, including whether such instruments should be recorded as liabilities or as equity, is evaluated at the end of each reporting period. Derivative instrument liabilities are classified in the balance sheet as current or non-current based on whether or not net-cash settlement of the derivative instrument could be required within 12 months of the balance sheet date.\n\nWe use Level 2 inputs for our valuation methodology for the derivative liabilities as their fair values were determined by using a Binomial pricing model. Our derivative liabilities are adjusted to reflect fair value at each period end, with any increase or decrease in the fair value being recorded in the results of operations as adjustments to fair value of derivatives.\n\n**_Share-Based Compensation_**\n\nThe Company issues stock options and warrants, shares of common stock and restricted stock units as share-based compensation to employees and non-employees. The Company accounts for its share-based compensation in accordance with FASB ASC 718, _Compensation – Stock Compensation_. Share-based compensation cost is measured at the grant date, based on the estimated fair value of the award, and is recognized as expense over the requisite service period. The fair value of restricted stock units is determined based on the number of shares granted and the quoted price of our common stock and is recognized as expense over the service period. Forfeitures are accounted for as they occur. Recognition of compensation expense for non-employees is in the same period and manner as if the Company had paid cash for services.\n\n**_Intangible Assets_**\n\nWe have certain intangible assets that were initially recorded at their fair value at the time of acquisition. The finite-lived intangible assets consist of developed technology and customer contracts. Indefinite-lived intangible assets consist of domain names. Intangible assets with finite useful lives are amortized using the straight-line method over their estimated useful life of five years.\n\nWe review all finite lived intangible assets for impairment when circumstances indicate that their carrying values may not be recoverable. If the carrying value of an asset group is not recoverable, we recognize an impairment loss for the excess carrying value over the fair value in our consolidated statements of operations.\n\n**Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements**\n\nFor a summary of our recent accounting policies, refer to Note 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies _,_ of our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included under Item 1 – Financial Statements in this Form 10-Q.\n\n**ITEM 3 - QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK**\n\nWe are a smaller reporting company as defined by Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act and are not required to provide the information required under this item.\n\n34  \n---  \n  \n**ITEM 4 - CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES**\n\n_Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures_\n\nWe maintain disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act, that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports under the Exchange Act, is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and our principal financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.\n\nWe carried out an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and 15d- 15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of September 30, 2024. Based on this evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of September 30, 2024.\n\n_Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting_\n\nThere were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the three months ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.\n\n_Inherent Limitations on the Effectiveness of Controls_\n\nManagement does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control systems are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, no evaluation of internal control over financial reporting can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been or will be detected.\n\nThese inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of a simple error or mistake. Controls can also be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by management override of the controls. The design of any system of controls is based in part on certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Projections of any evaluation of controls effectiveness to future periods are subject to risks. Over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or deterioration in the degree of compliance with policies or procedures.\n\n35  \n---  \n  \n**PART II - OTHER INFORMATION**\n\n**ITEM 1 - LEGAL PROCEEDINGS**\n\nFor information regarding legal proceedings, refer to Note 12 - Commitments and Contingencies of the Notes to our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, which is incorporated herein by reference.\n\n**ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS**\n\nOur business, results of operations, and financial condition are subject to various risks. These risks are described elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and our other filings with the SEC, including the 2023 Form 10-K filed on April 1, 2024. The risk factors identified in our 2023 Form 10-K have not changed in any material respect.\n\n**ITEM 2 - UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS**\n\nNone.\n\n**ITEM 3 - DEFAULTS UPON SENIOR SECURITIES**\n\nNone.\n\n**ITEM 4 - MINE SAFETY DISCLOSURES**\n\nNot applicable.\n\n**ITEM 5 - OTHER INFORMATION**\n\n**Rule 10b5-1 Trading Arrangement**\n\nDuring the three months ended September 30, 2024, no director or officer of the Company adopted or terminated a “Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement” or “non-Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement,” as each term is defined in Item 408(a) of Regulation S-K.\n\n_Corporate Action, Change of Control, and Extraordinary Performance Agreements_\n\nAs of the date of this Form 10-Q, the Company’s shares have traded and are continuing to trade at a price that results in a market cap that is significantly less than the Company’s current net cash position. Accordingly, the Company’s Board of Directors has determined that the Company is vulnerable to hostile takeover action and that any such action at this time is not in the best interests of its stockholders. The Company does not currently have any poison pill type provisions and due to previous reverse stock splits and other capital markets activities, the Company’s management and board members currently own an insignificant number of shares and as such would be ineffective in voting such shares to thwart any hostile takeover actions. Until such time as the Board determines whether it is necessary or advisable to adopt a poison pill provision or other anti-takeover measure, on October 31, 2024 the Board determined to approve the entry into Corporate Action, Change of Control, and Extraordinary Performance Agreements (the “Agreement”) with Rory J. Cutaia, Founder, Chairman and CEO of the Company, and James Geiskopf, Lead Director, (the “Awardees”) pursuant to which the Company will issue fully vested restricted stock units (“RSU”) subject to certain triggering events (the “Triggering Events”), as described below. Each RSU represents the right to be issued one share of common stock (the shares upon vesting, are subject to the restrictions as set forth in the Agreement, under the Company’s 2019 Omnibus Incentive Plan, or the RSU award agreement).\n\nThe Triggering Events include, among other things, the following:\n\n1. | Acceleration Upon a Corporate Transaction or Change of Control  \n---|---  \n  \na. “Corporate Transaction” means any person or Group (as defined in the Agreement) acquires an ownership of Shares (or other voting securities of the Company then outstanding) of the Company possessing thirteen percent (13%) or more of the total voting power of the Shares (or other voting securities then outstanding) of the Company where such person or Group is required to file a Schedule 13D (Beneficial Ownership Report (for >5% ownership with intent to influence)) with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission within 10 days of such acquisition. In the event of either a Corporate Transaction or a Change of Control, on or prior to December 31, 2025, the Awardee shall be entitled to fully vested 80,000 Restricted Stock Units for each Measurement Date (as defined in the Agreement) that cannot be reached due to the Change of Control. For example, for clarity, if the Corporate Transaction or Change of Control closes on July 15, 2025, then the Awardee shall be entitled to 160,000 Restricted Stock Units (2 Measurement Dates x 80,000). Such accelerated Restricted Stock Units shall be fully vested to the Awardee and the Company shall grant and deliver the accelerated Restricted Stock Units Awards to Awardee on or prior to such closing of the Corporate Transaction or Change of Control.\n\nb. “Change of Control” means and includes each of the following:\n\ni. any one person, or group of owners of another corporation who, acting together through a merger, consolidation, purchase, acquisition of stock or the like (a “Group”), acquires ownership of Shares of the Company that, together with the Shares held by such person or Group, constitutes more than fifty percent (50%) of the total fair market value or total voting power of the Shares of the Company (or other voting securities of the Company then outstanding). However, if such person or Group is considered to own more than fifty percent (50%) of the total fair market value or total voting power of the Shares (or other voting securities of the Company then outstanding) before this transfer of the Company’s Shares (or other voting securities of the Company then outstanding), the acquisition of additional Shares (or other voting securities of the Company then outstanding) by the same person or Group shall not be considered to cause a Change of Control of the Company; or\n\nii. any one person or Group acquires (or has acquired during the twelve (12)-month period ending on the date of the most recent acquisition by such person or persons) ownership of Shares (or other voting securities of the Company then outstanding) of the Company possessing thirty percent (30%) or more of the total voting power of the Shares (or other voting securities then outstanding) of the Company where such person or Group is not merely acquiring additional control of the Company; or\n\niii. a majority of members of the Company’s Board is replaced during any twelve (12)-month period by directors whose appointment or election is not endorsed by a majority of the members of the Company’s Board prior to the date of the appointment or election (the “Incumbent Board”), but excluding, for purposes of determining whether a majority of the Incumbent Board has endorsed any candidate for election to the Board, any individual whose initial assumption of office occurs as a result of an actual or threatened election contest with respect to the election or removal of directors or other actual or threatened solicitation of proxies or consents by or on behalf of a person or Group other than the Company’s Board; or\n\niv. any one person or Group acquires (or has acquired during the twelve (12)-month period ending on the date of the most recent acquisition by such person or Group) all or substantially all of the assets from the Company that have a total gross fair market value equal to or more than forty percent (40%) of the total fair market value of all assets of the Company immediately prior to such acquisition or acquisitions. For this purpose, “gross fair market value” means the value of the assets of the Company, or the value of the assets being disposed of, determined without regard to any liabilities associated with such assets.\n\nThe Triggering Events also include partial issuances of RSU’s to the Awardees through the achievement of extraordinary performance-based quarterly revenue milestones as determined by the Board (the “Revenue Milestones”), and as measured on specific dates, each a “Measurement Date” defined as December 31, 2024, March 31, 2025, June 30, 2025, September 30, 2025, and December 31, 2025, and the Awardees providing continuous services through the achievement of such milestones. Pursuant to the Agreement, each Awardee may be entitled to receive between 40,000 and 80,000 RSU’s upon achieving the following Revenue Milestones (i) between $500,000 and $900,000 as of December 31, 2024, (ii) between $1.1M and $1.5M as of March 31, 2025, (iii) between $1.7M and $2.1M as of June 30, 2025, (iv) between $2.3M and $2.7M as of September 30, 2025, and (v) $2.9M and $3.3M as of December 31, 2025. The achievement of each of the applicable quarterly Revenue Milestones on each Measurement Date will be reasonably determined by the Company’s Board of Directors.\n\nThe foregoing description of the above Agreement is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Agreement, copies of which are attached hereto as Exhibit 10.1 and Exhibit 10.2 and incorporated herein by reference.\n\n**ITEM 6 - EXHIBITS**\n\nReference is made to the exhibits listed on the Index to Exhibits.\n\n36  \n---  \n  \n**INDEX TO EXHIBITS**\n\nExhibit Number | Description  \n---|---  \n3.1 | [Certificate of Amendment to the Articles of Incorporation dated September 27, 2024 (incorporated by reference to Exhibit 3.1 to the Company’s Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on September 27, 2024).](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1566610/000149315224038608/ex3-1.htm)  \n10.1* | [Corporate Action, Change of Control, and Extraordinary Performance Agreement with Rory J.

These forward-looking statements are intended to qualify for the safe harbor from liability\nestablished by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements include all statements that are not statements of historical facts and can be\nidentified by words such as “anticipates,” “believes,” “could,” “estimates,” “expects,” “intends,” “may,” “plans,” “potential,” “predicts,” “projects,” “seeks,” “should,” “will,”\n“would” or similar expressions and the negatives of those expressions. Forward-looking statements also include the assumptions underlying or relating to such statements.\nOur forward-looking statements are based on our management’s current beliefs, assumptions and expectations about future events and trends, which affect or may\naffect our business, strategy, operations, financial performance or liquidity. Although we believe these forward-looking statements are based upon reasonable assumptions, they\nare subject to numerous known and unknown risks and uncertainties and are made in light of information currently available to us. Some of the risks and uncertainties that may\nimpact our forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, the following factors:\n● our incursion of significant net losses and uncertainty whether we will achieve or maintain profitable operations;\n● our ability to grow and compete in the future, and to execute our business strategy;\n● our ability to maintain and expand our customer base and to convince our customers to increase the use of our services and/or platform;\n● the competitive market in which we operate;\n● our ability to increase the number of our strategic relationships or grow the revenues received from our current strategic relationships;\n● our ability to develop enhancements and new features to our existing service or acceptable new services that keep pace with technological developments;\n● our ability to successfully launch new product platforms, including MARKET.live, the rate of adoption of these platforms and the revenue generated from these\nplatforms;\n● our ability to deliver our services, as we depend on third party Internet providers;\n● our ability to attract and retain qualified management personnel;\n● our susceptibility to security breaches and other disruptions;\n● our ability to maintain compliance with the listing requirements of the Nasdaq Capital Market; and\n● the impact of, and our ability to operate our business and effectively manage our growth under evolving and uncertain global economic, political, and social trends,\nincluding legislation banning or otherwise hampering our strategic relationships such as TikTok, inflation, rising interest rates, and recessionary concerns.\nThe foregoing list may not include all of the factors that impact the forward-looking statements made in this Quarterly Report. Our actual financial condition and\nresults could differ materially from those expressed or implied by our forward-looking statements as a result of various additional factors, including those discussed in the\nsections entitled “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and “Risk Factors” in this Quarterly Report and in our Annual\nReport on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 (our “Annual Report”), as well as in the other reports we file with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the\n“SEC”). You should read this Quarterly Report, and the other documents we file with the SEC, with the understanding that our actual future results may be materially different\nfrom the results expressed or implied by our forward-looking statements.\nWe operate in an evolving environment. New risks and uncertainties emerge from time to time and it is not possible for our management to predict all risks and\nuncertainties, nor can we assess the impact of all factors on our business or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual future results to be\nmaterially different from those expressed or implied by any forward-looking statements.\nForward-looking statements speak only as of the date they were made, and, except to the extent required by law or the rules of the Nasdaq Capital Market, we\nundertake no obligation to update or review any forward-looking statement because of new information, future events or other factors.\nWe qualify all of our forward-looking statements by these cautionary statements.\n3\nPART I — FINANCIAL INFORMATION\nITEM 1 – FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nCondensed Consolidated Balance Sheets as of September 30, 2024 (unaudited) and December 31, 2023 5\nCondensed Consolidated Statements of Operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 (unaudited) 6\nCondensed Consolidated Statements of Stockholders’ Equity for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 (unaudited) 7\nCondensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 (unaudited) 8\nNotes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (unaudited) 9-25\n4\nVERB TECHNOLOGY COMPANY, INC.\nCONDENSED CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS\n(in thousands, except share and per share data)\nSeptember 30, 2024 December 31, 2023\n(unaudited)\nASSETS\nCurrent assets\nCash $ 10,515 $ 4,353\nShort-term investments 5,077 -\nPrepaid expenses and other current assets 233 331\nTotal current assets 15,825 4,684\nCapitalized software development costs, net 3,242 3,990\nERC receivable 2,263 1,528\nProperty and equipment, net 192 43\nOperating lease right-of-use assets 172 218\nIntangible assets, net 184 117\nOther assets 259 259\nTotal assets $ 22,137 $ 10,839\nLIABILITIES AND STOCKHOLDERS’ EQUITY\nCurrent liabilities\nAccounts payable $ 956 $ 1,408\nAccrued expenses 2,252 2,324\nAccrued payroll 360 420\nAccrued officers’ compensation -

DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS\nOur Business\nReferences in this document to the “Company,” “Verb,” “we,” “us,” or “our” are intended to mean Verb Technology Company, Inc., individually, or as the context\nrequires, collectively with its subsidiaries on a consolidated basis.\nOur business is currently comprised of three distinct, yet complimentary business units, all three of which are currently operating and generating revenue, and one of\nwhich is currently operating in “stealth mode” as we continue to refine the user experience for that business unit as we continue to ramp sales. The first business unit is\nMARKET.live focused on interactive video-based social commerce. Our MARKET.live platform is a multi-vendor, livestream social shopping destination leveraging the\nconvergence of ecommerce and entertainment. Brands, retailers and creators that join MARKET.live have the ability to broadcast livestream shopping events\nsimultaneously on numerous social media channels, including TikTok, YouTube, LinkedIn, Facebook, Instagram, Twitch, as well as on MARKET.live, reaching\nexponentially larger audiences. The Company’s recent technological integrations with META, created a seamless, native, friction-free checkout process for Facebook and\nInstagram users to purchase MARKET.live vendors’ products within each of those popular apps. This integration allows Facebook and Instagram users to browse products\nfeatured in MARKET.live shoppable videos, place products in a native shopping cart and checkout – all without leaving Facebook or Instagram. We recently announced a\ntechnology integration with Pinterest and we will continue to expand the universe of social platforms our clients can access through our platform.\nLast year we completed development work on a new MARKET.live capability that facilitated a deeper integration into the TikTok Shop social media platform,\ndesigned to expose MARKET.live shoppable programming to tens of millions of potential viewers/purchasers. This capability allows shoppers watching a MARKET.live\nstream on TikTok to stay on that site and check out through that site, eliminating the friction or reluctance of TikTok users to leave their TikTok feed in order to complete\ntheir purchase on MARKET.live. Our technology integration allows the purchase data to flow back through MARKET.live and to the individual vendors and stores on\nMARKET.live seamlessly for fulfillment of the orders.\nEarlier this year, we announced an expanded strategic relationship with TikTok evidenced by a formal partnership with TikTok Shop pursuant to which MARKET.live\nbecame a service provider for TikTok Shop and officially designated as a TikTok Shop Partner (TSP). Under the terms of the partnership, TikTok Shop refers consumer\nbrands, retailers, influencers and affiliates leads to MARKET.live for a menu of MARKET.live contract-based recurring fee revenue services that include, among other\nthings, assistance in onboarding to TikTok Shop and establishing a TikTok store, hosting training sessions and webinars for prospective TikTok Shop sellers, full creative\nservices including content creation and full remote and in-studio production services, host/influencer casting and management, TikTok Shop maintenance and\nenhancements for existing TikTok clients’ stores. The same services are currently provided to consumer brands that contact us directly or through several brand agencies\nwith which we maintain affiliate relationships.\nThe second business unit is GO FUND YOURSELF!, a revolutionary interactive social crowd funding platform for public and private companies seeking broad-based\nexposure across numerous social media channels for their crowd-funded Regulation CF and Regulation A offerings. The platform combines a ground-breaking interactive\nTV show with MARKET.live’s back-end capabilities allowing viewers to tap on their screen to facilitate an investment, in real time, as they watch companies presenting\nbefore the show’s panel of “Titans”. Presenting companies that sell consumer products are able to offer their products directly to viewers during the show in real time\nthrough shoppable onscreen icons. The Go Fund Yourself business unit generates revenue from cash fees we charge to issuers to appear on the show and for marketing, ad,\nand content creation and distribution services. For those issuers that sell products during each airing of the show through our platform, we charge a fee up to 25% of the\ngross sales revenue for all products sold.\nHistorically, and continuing up through June 13, 2023, the Company was a Software-as-a-Service (“SaaS”) applications platform developer that offered a SaaS\nplatform for the direct sales industry comprised of a suite of interactive video-based sales enablement business software products marketed on a subscription basis, (the\n“SaaS Assets”).\nOn June 13, 2023, the Company disposed of all of its operating SaaS Assets pursuant to an asset purchase agreement in consideration of the sum of $6,500, $4,750 of\nwhich was paid in cash by the buyer at the closing of the transaction (the “Sale of the SaaS Assets”). Additional payments of $1,750 will be paid to us by the buyer if\ncertain profitability and revenue targets are met within the two-year period following the closing as set forth more particularly in the asset purchase agreement. The sale of\nthe SaaS Assets was undertaken to allow us to focus our resources on MARKET.live, and the business verticals that platform could support. We expect our burgeoning\nMARKET.live business unit will, over time, create greater shareholder value than we could have been created through the continued operation of our SaaS Assets.\nAs of September 30, 2024, the Company had cash of $10,515 and short-term investments of $5,077.\n9\nEconomic Disruption\nOur business is dependent in part on general economic conditions. Many jurisdictions in which our customers are located and our products are sold have experienced\nand could continue to experience unfavorable general economic conditions, such as inflation, increased interest rates and recessionary concerns, which could negatively\naffect demand for our products. Under difficult economic conditions, customers may seek to cease spending on our current products or fail to adopt our new products,\nwhich could negatively affect our financial performance. We cannot predict the timing or magnitude of an economic slowdown or the timing or strength of any economic\nrecovery. These and other economic factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\n2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND SUPPLEMENTAL DISCLOSURES\nBasis of Presentation\nThe accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements are unaudited. These unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements have been\nprepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”) and applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and\nExchange Commission (“SEC”) regarding interim financial reporting. Certain information and note disclosures normally included in the financial statements prepared in\naccordance with GAAP have been condensed or omitted pursuant to such rules and regulations. Accordingly, these interim condensed consolidated financial statements\nshould be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto contained in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year\nended December 31, 2023 filed with the SEC on April 1, 2024 (the “2023 Annual Report”). The consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2023 included herein was\nderived from the audited consolidated financial statements as of that date.\nOn October 8, 2024, we implemented a 1-for-200 reverse stock split (the “Reverse Stock Split”) of our common stock, $0.0001 par value per share (the “Common\nStock”). Our Common Stock commenced trading on a post Reverse Stock Split basis on October 9, 2024. As a result of the Reverse Stock Split, every two hundred (200)\nshares of our pre-Reverse Stock Split Common Stock were combined and reclassified into one share of our Common Stock. The number of shares of Common Stock\nsubject to outstanding options, warrants, and convertible securities were also reduced by a factor of two hundred and the exercise price of such securities increased by a\nfactor of two hundred, as of October 8, 2024. All historical share and per-share amounts reflected throughout our condensed consolidated financial statements and other\nfinancial information in this Quarterly Report have been adjusted to reflect the Reverse Stock Split. The par value per share of our Common Stock was not affected by the\nReverse Stock Split.\nAs discussed above, among the terms of the Sale of the SaaS Assets was that additional payments of $1,750 will be paid to us by the buyer if certain profitability and\nrevenue targets are met within the two-year period following the closing. The contingent payments were not recorded at the closing date of the sale and will be recognized\nas the cash is received and the contingency resolved pursuant to ASC 450-30.\nAccordingly, the Company’s consolidated financial statements are being presented pursuant to ASC 360-10-45-9 which requires that a disposal group be classified as\nheld for sale in the period in which all of the held for sale criteria are met. In addition to held for sale accounting, the Company had also met the criterion pursuant to ASC\n205-20, Discontinued Operations, as a strategic shift from operating and managing a SaaS business to operating and managing a live streaming shopping platform has\noccurred because of the sale. The Company’s consolidated results of operations and statements of cash flows have been reclassified to reflect the presentation of\ndiscontinued operations. See Note 6 for details of the assets and liabilities related to the SaaS sale and discontinued operations.\nIn the opinion of management, the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements contain all adjustments necessary to fairly present the\nCompany’s financial position and results of operations for the interim periods reflected. Except as noted, all adjustments contained herein are of a normal recurring nature.\nResults of operations for the fiscal periods presented herein are not necessarily indicative of fiscal year-end results.\nPrinciples of Consolidation\nThe consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with GAAP and include the accounts of Verb, Verb Acquisition Co., LLC , and\nverbMarketplace, LLC. All intercompany accounts have been eliminated in the consolidation.\n10\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets\nand liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reported periods. Significant estimates include\nassumptions made in analysis of assumptions made in purchase price allocations, impairment testing of long-term assets, realization of deferred tax assets, determining fair\nvalue of derivative liabilities, and valuation of equity instruments issued for services. Some of those assumptions can be subjective and complex, and therefore, actual\nresults could differ materially from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions.\nInvestments\nIn accordance with ASC 320, Investments – Debt Securities, the Company accounts for its investments as trading securities consisting of U.S. Treasury securities and\ncorporate bonds that are reported at fair value on the Company’s condensed consolidated balance sheet at September 30, 2024. Unrealized gains and losses on these\ninvestments are included in other income (expense), net within the Company’s condensed consolidated statements of operations for the three and nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024.\nThe Company’s investments in trading securities are classified as current based on the intent of management, the nature of the investments and their availability for use\nin current operations. See Note 3 – Investments and Fair Value Measurements for further details of the Company’s investments at September 30, 2024.\nSegment Information\nEffective July 1, 2024, the Company operates as two reportable segments, MARKET.live and Go Fund Yourself. We identify our segments in accordance with ASC\n280, Segment Reporting, and in the manner in which our Chief Executive Officer, as our chief operating decision maker (“CODM”), allocates resources and assesses\nfinancial performance. See Note 14 for disclosures of Segment Information.\nRevenue Recognition\nThe Company recognizes revenue in accordance with Financial Accounting Standard Board’s (“FASB”) ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (“ASC\n606”). Revenue through June 13, 2023 was derived primarily from providing application services through the SaaS application, digital marketing and sales support\nservices. During that period, the Company also derived revenue from the sale of customized print products and training materials, branded apparel, and digital tools, as\ndemanded by its customers. As a result of the sale of the SaaS business, revenue that was recorded historically from the SaaS business has been reclassified as part of\ndiscontinued operations. See Note 6 for revenue disclosures related to the SaaS business.\nMARKET.live revenue is derived from contract-based recurring fee revenue services that include, among other things, assistance in onboarding clients to TikTok Shop\nand establishing a TikTok store, hosting training sessions and webinars for prospective TikTok Shop sellers, full creative services including content creation and full remote\nand in-studio production services, host/influencer casting and management, TikTok Shop maintenance and enhancements for existing TikTok clients’ stores. Clients are\nreferred to us through our existing partnership with TikTok Shop as well as from several brand agencies with which we maintain affiliate relationships.\nGO FUND YOURSELF! derives revenue from cash fees we charge to issuers to appear on the show and for marketing, ad, and content creation and distribution\nservices. For those issuers that sell products during each airing of the show through our platform, we charge a fee up to 25% of the gross sales revenue for all products sold.\nA performance obligation is a promise in a contract to transfer a distinct product. Performance obligations promised in a contract are identified based on the goods that\nwill be transferred that are both capable of being distinct and are distinct in the context of the contract, whereby the transfer of the goods is separately identifiable from\nother promises in the contract. Performance obligations include establishing and maintaining customer online stores, providing access to the Company’s e-commerce\nplatform and customer service support.\nCustomers do not have the contractual right to take possession of the Company’s software. Revenue is recognized in an amount that reflects the contractual\nconsideration that the Company receives in exchange for its services.\nRevenue is recognized on a net basis from maintaining e-commerce platforms and online orders, as the Company is engaged primarily in an agency relationship with\nits customers and earns defined amounts based on the individual contractual terms for the customer and the Company does not take possession of the customers’ inventory\nor any credit risks relating to the products sold.\nSales taxes collected from customers and remitted to governmental authorities are accounted for on a net basis and, therefore, are excluded from net sales in the\nconsolidated statements of operations. Revenues during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, were substantially all generated from clients and\ncustomers located within the United States of America.\n11\nCost of Revenue\nCost of revenue primarily consists of processing fees and independent contractors associated with the MARKET.live platform and independent contractors for shows\nrelated to Go Fund Yourself.\nCapitalized Software Development Costs\nThe Company capitalizes internal and external costs directly associated with developing internal-use software, and hosting arrangements that include an internal-use\nsoftware license, during the application development stage of its projects. The Company’s internal-use software is reported at cost less accumulated amortization.\nAmortization begins once the project has been completed and is ready for its intended use.\nDue to changes in management’s assessment of its capitalized software development asset, the Company revised the asset’s remaining useful life effective January 1,\n2024 and will amortize the asset on a straight-line basis over a period of four years. Software maintenance activities or minor upgrades are recorded as expense in the\nperiod performed.\nAmortization expense related to capitalized software development costs is recorded in depreciation and amortization in the condensed consolidated statements of\noperations.\nPreferred Stock\nThe Company applies the accounting standards for distinguishing liabilities from equity when determining the classification and measurement of its preferred stock.\nPreferred shares subject to mandatory redemption are classified as liability instruments and are measured at fair value. Conditionally redeemable preferred shares\n(including preferred shares that feature redemption rights that are either within the control of the holder or subject to redemption upon the occurrence of uncertain events\nnot solely within the Company’s control) are classified as temporary equity. At all other times, preferred shares are classified as part of stockholders’ equity. Accordingly,\nthe Series C Preferred Stock offering on December 29, 2023 is classified as part of stockholders’ equity as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023.\nFair Value of Financial Instruments\nThe Company follows the guidance of FASB ASC 820 and ASC 825 for disclosure and measurement of the fair value of its financial instruments. FASB ASC 820\nestablishes a framework for measuring fair value under GAAP and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. To increase consistency and comparability in fair\nvalue measurements and related disclosures, ASC 820 establishes a fair value hierarchy which prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into\nthree (3) broad levels. The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities and the lowest\npriority to unobservable inputs.\nThe three (3) levels of fair value hierarchy defined by ASC 820 are described below:\nLevel 1:Quoted market prices available in active markets for identical assets or liabilities as of the reporting date.\nLevel 2:Pricing inputs other than quoted prices in active markets included in Level 1, which are either directly or indirectly observable as of the reporting date.\nLevel 3:Pricing inputs that are generally observable inputs and not corroborated by market data.\nThe carrying amount of the Company’s financial assets and liabilities, such as cash, prepaid expenses, and accounts payable and accrued expenses approximate their\nfair value due to their short-term nature. The carrying amount of notes payable approximates the fair value due to the fact that the interest rates on these obligations are\nbased on prevailing market interest rates. The Company uses Level 2 inputs for its valuation methodology for the derivative liabilities, see Note 3 for Investments and Fair\nValue Measurements and Note 8 for Derivative Liability.\n12\nDerivative Financial Instruments\nThe Company evaluates its financial instruments to determine if such instruments are derivatives or contain features that qualify as embedded derivatives. For\nderivative financial instruments that are accounted for as liabilities, the derivative instrument is initially recorded at its fair value and is then re-valued at each reporting\ndate, with changes in the fair value reported in the consolidated statements of operations. The classification of derivative instruments, including whether such instruments\nshould be recorded as liabilities or as equity, is evaluated at the end of each reporting period. Derivative instrument liabilities are classified in the balance sheet as current\nor non-current based on whether or not net-cash settlement of the derivative instrument could be required within 12 months of the balance sheet date.\nThe Company uses Level 2 inputs for its valuation methodology for the derivative liabilities as their fair values were determined by using a Binomial pricing model.\nThe Company’s derivative liabilities are adjusted to reflect fair value at each period end, with any increase or decrease in the fair value being recorded in results of\noperations as adjusted to fair value of derivatives.\nShare-Based Compensation\nThe Company issues stock options and warrants, shares of common stock and restricted stock units as share-based compensation to employees and non-employees.\nThe Company accounts for its share-based compensation in accordance with FASB ASC 718, Compensation – Stock Compensation. Share-based compensation cost is\nmeasured at the grant date, based on the estimated fair value of the award, and is recognized as expense over the requisite service period. The fair value of restricted stock\nunits is determined based on the number of shares granted and the quoted price of our common stock and is recognized as expense over the service period. Forfeitures are\naccounted for as they occur. Recognition of compensation expense for non-employees is in the same period and manner as if the Company had paid cash for services.\nNet Loss Per Share\nBasic net loss per share is computed by using the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted net loss per share is computed\ngiving effect to all dilutive potential shares of common stock that were outstanding during the period. Dilutive potential shares of common stock consist of incremental\nshares of common stock issuable upon exercise of stock options. No dilutive potential shares of common stock were included in the computation of diluted net loss per\nshare because their impact was anti-dilutive.\nAs of September 30, 2024, and 2023, the Company had total outstanding options of 9,038 and 10,284, respectively, and warrants of 3,545 and 4,598, respectively, and\noutstanding restricted stock awards of 556 and 778, respectively, and convertible notes issued to a related party that were convertible into 0 and 106 shares at $8,240.00 per\nshare, respectively, which were excluded from the computation of net loss per share because they are anti-dilutive.\nAt the close of business on April 5, 2024, the Company’s unexercised publicly traded warrants under the symbol VERBW expired pursuant to their original terms and\nas such Nasdaq suspended trading the 879 remaining warrants and the trading symbol VERBW was delisted from Nasdaq.\nConcentration of Credit and Other Risks\nFinancial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist of cash and accounts receivable. Cash is deposited with a limited\nnumber of financial institutions. The balances held at any one financial institution at times may be in excess of Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”) insurance\nlimits of up to $250.\n13\nThe Company’s concentration of credit risk includes its concentrations from key customers and vendors. The details of these significant customers and vendors are\npresented in the following table for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023:\nNine Months Ended September 30,\n2024 2023\nThe Company’s largest customers are presented\nbelow as a percentage of the aggregate\nRevenues Two customers accounted for 41% of revenues No customers individually over 10%\nThe Company’s largest vendors are presented\nbelow as a percentage of the aggregate\nOne vendor accounted for 18% of its purchases One vendor accounted for 28% of its purchases\nPurchases individually and in the aggregate individually and in the aggregate\nSupplemental Cash Flow Information\nNine Months Ended September 30,\n2024 2023\nSupplemental disclosures of cash flow information:\nCash paid for interest $ 4 $ 242\nCash paid for income taxes $ 1 $ 2\nSupplemental disclosure of non-cash investing and financing activities attributable to\ncontinuing operations:\nFair value of common shares issued as payment on notes payable $ 2,777 $ 4,092\nFair value of common shares issued to redeem Series C preferred shares 2,737 -\nFair value of common shares issued to settle accrued expenses - 346\nDerecognition of operating lease right-of-use assets - 1,186\nDerecognition of operating lease liabilities - 1,870\nDerecognition of other assets and liabilities related to lease termination - 421\nRecognition of operating lease right-of-use asset and related lease liability - 245\nSupplemental disclosure of non-cash investing and financing activities attributable to\ndiscontinued operations:\nDiscount recognized from advances on future receipts $ - $ 558\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nRecently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements\nIn June 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13, Credit Losses - Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments (“ASC 326”). The standard significantly\nchanges how entities will measure credit losses for most financial assets, including accounts and notes receivables. The standard will replace today’s “incurred loss”\napproach with an “expected loss” model, under which companies will recognize allowances based on expected rather than incurred losses. Entities will apply the standard’s\nprovisions as a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of the first reporting period in which the guidance is effective. The adoption of this\nstandard did not have any material impact on the Company’s financial statements.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nIn November 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued ASU No. 2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable\nSegment Disclosures (ASU 2023-07), which requires an enhanced disclosure of significant segment expenses on an annual and interim basis. This guidance is effective for\nfiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024. Early adoption is permitted. Upon adoption,\nthe guidance should be applied retrospectively to all prior periods presented in the financial statements. We do not expect the adoption of this guidance to have a material\nimpact on our consolidated financial statements.\nOther recent accounting pronouncements issued by the FASB, including its Emerging Issues Task Force, the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, and\nthe Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) did not or are not believed by management to have a material impact on the Company’s present or future\nconsolidated financial statements.\n14\n3. INVESTMENTS AND FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS\nThe Company invests its surplus funds in excess of operational and capital requirements in a diversified portfolio of marketable securities, with the objectives of\ndelivering competitive returns while maintaining a high degree of liquidity.\nA summary of our short-term investments as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, are as follows (in thousands):\nSeptember 30, 2024 December 31, 2023\nU.S. treasury securities $ 3,873 $ -\nMarketable debt securities 1,204 -\nShort-term investments $ 5,077 $ -\nMarketable securities\nMarketable securities as of September 30, 2024 consisted of the following:\nCost of Amortized\n(in thousands) Cost Unrealized Gains Unrealized Losses Fair Value\nMarketable debt securities\nU.S. treasury securities $ 3,789 $ 84 $ - $ 3,873\nCorporate bonds 1,179 25 - 1,204\nTotal marketable debt securities $ 4,968 $ 109 $ - $ 5,077\nFair Value Measurements\nOur financial instruments include cash, prepaid expenses, accounts payable, and accrued liabilities. The fair value of cash, prepaid expenses, accounts payable and\naccrued liabilities approximate their carrying values due to their short-term nature, which are all considered Level 1. The fair value of long-term debt approximates its carrying\nvalue.\nOur financial instruments measured at fair value on a recurring basis consisted of U.S. treasury securities, corporate bonds and derivatives (see Note 8). U.S. treasury\nsecurities are classified within Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy as they are valued based on quoted market price in an active market. Corporate bonds are valued based on\nquoted prices in markets that are less active and are generally classified within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. We did not hold Level 1 or Level 2 financial instruments as of\nDecember 31, 2023.\nFinancial instruments valued based on unobservable inputs which reflect the reporting entity’s own assumptions or data that market participants would use in valuing\nan instrument are generally classified within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. We did not hold Level 3 financial instruments as of September 30, 2024, and December 31,\n2023.\nFinancial instruments measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of September 30, 2024 are classified based on the valuation technique in the table below:\nFair Value Measurements Using\nQuoted Prices in\nActive Markets for Significant Other Significant\nIdentical Assets Observable Inputs Unobservable Inputs\n(in thousands) (Level 1) (Level 2) (Level 3) Total\nMarketable debt securities\nU.S. treasury securities $ 3,873 $ - $ - $ 3,873\nCorporate bonds - 1,204 - 1,204\nTotal marketable debt securities $ 3,873 $ 1,204 $ - $ 5,077\n4.

The November Note matures eighteen months following the date of issuance. Commencing six months from the date of issuance, the\nCompany is required to make monthly cash redemption payments in an amount not to exceed $600. The November Note may be repaid in whole or in part prior to the\nmaturity date for a 10% premium. The November Note requires the Company to use up to 20% of the gross proceeds raised from future equity or debt financings, or\nthe sale of any subsidiary or material asset, to prepay the November Note, subject to a $2,000 cap on the aggregate prepayment amount. Until all obligations under the\nNovember Note have been paid in full, the Company is not permitted to grant a security interest in any of its assets, or to issue securities convertible into shares of\ncommon stock, subject in each case to certain exceptions. verbMarketplace, LLC entered into a guaranty, dated November 7, 2022, in connection with the November\nNote Offering, pursuant to which it guaranteed the obligations of the Company under the November Note in exchange for receiving a portion of the loan proceeds.\n17\nIn connection with the November Note Offering, the Company incurred $335 of debt issuance costs.

The Note bears interest at 9.0% per annum compounded daily. The maturity date of the Note is 18 months from the date of its\nissuance.\nDuring the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company issued 38,151 shares of its common stock pursuant to an exchange agreement in exchange for a\nreduction of $1,057 on the outstanding balance of the Note.

The Company paid $0\nand $8 in interest to related parties for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\n8. DERIVATIVE LIABILITY\nUnder authoritative guidance used by the FASB on determining whether an instrument (or embedded feature) is indexed to an entity’s own stock, instruments that do\nnot have fixed settlement provisions are deemed to be derivative instruments. In prior years, the Company granted certain warrants that included a fundamental transaction\nprovision that could give rise to an obligation to pay cash to the warrant holder. As a result, the fundamental transaction clause of these warrants are accounted for as a\nderivative liability in accordance with ASC 815 and are being re-measured every reporting period with the change in value reported in the statement of operations.\nThe derivative liabilities were valued using a Binomial pricing model with the following average assumptions:\nSeptember 30, 2024 December 31, 2023\nStock Price $ 9.60 $ 34.00\nExercise Price $ 1,600.00 $ 1,600.00\nExpected Life 0.39 1.08\nVolatility 106% 202%\nDividend Yield 0% 0%\nRisk-Free Interest Rate 4.65% 4.79%\nTotal Fair Value $ - $ 1\n18\nThe expected life of the warrants was based on the remaining contractual term of the instruments. The Company uses the historical volatility of its common stock to\nestimate the future volatility for its common stock. The expected dividend yield was based on the fact that the Company has not paid dividends in the past and does not\nexpect to pay dividends in the future. The risk-free interest rate was based on rates established by the Federal Reserve Bank.\nDuring the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company recorded income of $1 and $210, respectively, to account for the changes in the fair value\nof these derivative liabilities during the period. At September 30, 2024, the fair value of the derivative liability was $0.\n9.

For the period beginning on the 1 year anniversary of the issuance date of a share of\nSeries C Preferred Stock to the 2 year anniversary of the issuance date of a share of Series C Preferred Stock, the Quarterly Dividend shall be 2.5% per quarter, and for all\nperiods following the 2 year anniversary of the issuance date of a share of Series C Preferred Stock, the Quarterly Dividend shall be 5% per quarter.\nSubject to the terms and conditions set forth in the Certificate of Designation, at any time the Company may elect, in the sole discretion of the Board of Directors, to\nredeem all, but not less than all, of the Series C Preferred Stock then issued and outstanding from all of the Series C Preferred Stock Holders (a “Corporation Optional\nRedemption”) by paying to the applicable Series C Preferred Stock Holders an amount in cash equal to the Series C Preferred Liquidation Amount (as defined in the\nCertificate of Designation) then applicable to such shares of Series C Preferred Stock being redeemed in the Corporation Optional Conversion (the “Redemption Price”).\nThe Series C Preferred Stock confers no voting rights on holders, except with respect to matters that materially and adversely affect the voting powers, rights or\npreferences of the Series C Preferred Stock or as otherwise required by applicable law.\nOn December 29, 2023, the Company entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement with Streeterville, pursuant to which the Company sold and Streeterville\npurchased 3,000 shares of the Company’s newly designated non-convertible Series C Preferred Stock (the “Series C Shares”) for a total purchase price of $3,000. The\nShares have a 10% stated annual dividend, no voting rights and has a face value of $1,300 per share. The sale of the Series C Shares was consummated on December 29,\n2023.\nDuring the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company redeemed 2,105 Series C Preferred Shares in exchange for 145,816 common shares in order to\nreduce the amount of dividend to be accrued. The transaction was done at the Nasdaq at-the-market price. No broker was involved in the transaction and no fees or\ncommissions were paid or incurred by the Company. The Company recorded a deemed dividend of $652 to Series C Preferred Shareholders to account for the difference\nbetween the initial investment of $1,000 per Series C Preferred Share and the Stated Value of $1,300 per Series C Preferred Share, the Redemption Price.\nDuring the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company accrued $240 in preferred stock dividend payable.\nSee Note 15 – Subsequent Events.\n20\n10.

As of September 30, 2024, the total unrecognized share-based compensation expense was $904, which is expected to be recognized as part of operating expense\nthrough September 2027.\nThe fair value of share option award is estimated using the Black-Scholes option pricing method based on the following weighted-average assumptions:\nNine Months Ended September 30,\n2024 2023\nRisk-free interest rate 4.62% 4.29%\nAverage expected term 5 years 5 years\nExpected volatility 139.2% 136.2%\nExpected dividend yield - -\nThe risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of measurement corresponding with the expected term of the share option\naward; the expected term represents the weighted-average period of time that share option awards granted are expected to be outstanding giving consideration to vesting\nschedules and historical participant exercise behavior; the expected volatility is based upon historical volatility of the Company’s common stock; and the expected dividend\nyield is based on the fact that the Company has not paid dividends in the past and does not expect to pay dividends in the future.\n12. STOCK WARRANTS\nThe Company has the following warrants outstanding as of September 30, 2024, all of which are exercisable:\nWeighted-\nWeighted- Average\nAverage Remaining Aggregate\nExercise Contractual Intrinsic\nWarrants Price Life (Years) Value\nOutstanding at January 1, 2024 4,598 $ 6,752.00 3.10 $ -\nGranted - - - -\nForfeited (1,053) 24,098.44 - -\nExercised - - - -\nOutstanding at September 30, 2024, all vested 3,545 $ 1,769.64 3.18 $ -\nAt September 30, 2024 the intrinsic value of the outstanding warrants was $0.\nOn January 24, 2023, the Company entered into an underwriting agreement with Aegis relating to the January 2023 offering, issuance and sale of 4,506 shares of the\nCompany’s common stock at a public offering price of $1,600.00 per share. As a result of this transaction, certain warrants which previously had an exercise price of\n$2,720.00 per share, had the exercise price reduced to $1,600.00 per share, which resulted in the Company recognizing a deemed dividend of $164.\nAt the close of business on April 5, 2024, the Company’s unexercised publicly traded warrants under the symbol VERBW expired pursuant to their original terms and\nas such Nasdaq suspended trading the 879 remaining warrants and the trading symbol VERBW was delisted from Nasdaq.\n22\n13. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES\nLitigation\nThe Company is currently in a dispute with a former employee of its predecessor bBooth, Inc. who has interposed a breach of contract claim in which he alleges that in\n2015 he was entitled to approximately $300 in unpaid bonus compensation. This former employee filed his complaint in the Superior Court of California for the County of\nLos Angeles on November 20, 2019, styled Meyerson v. Verb Technology Company, Inc., et al. (Case No. 19STCV41816). The Company disputed the former employee’s\nclaims and interposed several affirmative defenses, including that the claims are contradicted by documentary evidence, barred by the applicable statute of limitations, and\nbarred by a written, executed release. On February 9, 2021, the former employee’s counsel filed a motion for summary judgment, or in the alternative, summary\nadjudication against the Company. On October 13, 2021, the California court issued an order (i) denying the former employee’s motion for summary judgment on his\nclaims against the Company, but (ii) granting the former employee’s motion to dismiss the Company’s affirmative defenses, which ruling the Company contends was in\nerror. Under the rules, the Company is precluded from appealing the dismissal of its affirmative defenses until after a trial. On August 29, 2023, after a bench trial at which\nthe Company was precluded from introducing evidence of its affirmative defenses, the court found in favor of Plaintiff Meyerson; and judgment was entered in Meyerson’s\nfavor in the amount of $584 which included interest. Meyerson’s counsel thereafter submitted an untimely request for attorney’s fees and costs which the Company has\nopposed. After due consideration, the Court awarded Meyerson’s counsel only approximately $8 in counsel fees. After the trial, the Company filed a timely appeal from the\njudgment (Meyerson v. Verb Technology Company, Inc. (2023 2nd Appellate District) Case No.: B334777, seeking among other things, that the trial court’s finding be\nvacated and that the Company’s affirmative defenses be reinstated. As of this date, the appeal has yet to be heard. In the interim, the Company bonded the judgement\npreventing any enforcement or collection of the judgement while the appeal is pending. The Company has accrued the liability at September 30, 2024 and believes the\naccrual is adequate pending the outcome of the appeal process.\nThe Company knows of no material proceedings in which any of its directors, officers, or affiliates, or any registered or beneficial stockholder is a party adverse to the\nCompany or any of its subsidiaries or has a material interest adverse to the Company or any of its subsidiaries.\nThe Company believes it has adequately reserved for all litigation within its financial statements.\nBoard of Directors\nThe Company has committed an aggregate of $598 in board fees to its three independent board members over the term of their appointment for services to be\nrendered. This amount includes a one-time performance-based bonus payment to a board member that is non-recurring. The Company’s CEO does not receive\ncompensation for serving on the Board of Directors.\nBoard fees are accrued and paid monthly. The members will serve on the board until the annual meeting for the year in which their term expires or until their\nsuccessors have been elected and qualified.\nTotal board fees expensed during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was $501.\n14. SEGMENT REPORTING\nThe Company currently operates two reportable segments, MARKET.live and Go Fund Yourself. The Company also operates a third business unit, currently operating\nin stealth mode, which for the period ending September 30, 2024, the Company does not deem to be a reportable segment.\nThe following tables summarize the Company’s reportable segment information and unallocated corporate expenses (in thousands):\nThree months ended September 30, 2024 Three months ended September 30, 2023\nReportable Segments Reportable Segments\nGo Fund Go Fund\n(in thousands) MARKET.live Yourself Corporate Consolidated MARKET.live Yourself Corporate Consolidated\nRevenues $ 103 $ 25 $ - $ 128 $ 29 $ - $ - $ 29\nCosts and expenses:\nCost of revenue, exclusive of\ndepreciation and amortization shown\nseparately below 35 19 - 54 5 - - 5\nDepreciation and amortization 250 3 20 273 539 - 25 564\nGeneral and administrative 847 204 1,062 2,113 636 - 2,214 2,850\nTotal costs and expenses 1,132 226 1,082 2,440 1,180 - 2,239 3,419\nOperating loss $ (1,029) $ (201) $ (1,082) $ (2,312) $ (1,151) $ - $ (2,239) $ (3,390)\nNine months ended September 30, 2024 Nine months ended September 30, 2023\nReportable Segments Reportable Segments\nGo Fund Go Fund\n(in thousands) MARKET.live Yourself Corporate Consolidated MARKET.live Yourself Corporate Consolidated\nRevenues $ 147 $ 25 $ - $ 172 $ 34 $ - $ - $ 34\nCosts and expenses:\nCost of revenue, exclusive of\ndepreciation and amortization shown\nseparately below 71 19 - 90 7 - - 7\nDepreciation and amortization 749 3 46 798 1,616 - 114 1,730\nGeneral and administrative 2,865 222 4,131 7,218 1,963 - 7,117 9,080\nTotal costs and expenses 3,685 244 4,177 8,106 3,586 - 7,231 10,817\nOperating loss $ (3,538) $ (219) $ (4,177) $ (7,934) $ (3,552) $ - $ (7,231) $ (10,783)\n23\n15. SUBSEQUENT EVENTS\nThe Company has evaluated subsequent events through November 5, 2024, the date these financial statements are available to be issued. The Company believes there\nwere no material events or transactions discovered during this evaluation that requires recognition or disclosure in the financial statements other than the items discussed\nbelow.\nSeries C Preferred Shares Redeemed in Exchange for Common Shares\nOn December 29, 2023, the Company issued 3,000 Series C Preferred Shares to an institutional investor pursuant to a securities purchase agreement and certificate of\ndesignation previously filed. The Series C Preferred Shares carried a 10% annual dividend.\nSubsequent to September 30, 2024, the Company redeemed 895 Series C Preferred Shares in exchange for 196,856 common shares to fully redeem the Series C\nPreferred Shares that were outstanding. On October 14, 2024, the Company redeemed 187 Series C Preferred Shares in exchange for 32,913 common shares to fully repay\nthe amount accrued for preferred dividends. The transaction was done at the Nasdaq at-the-market price. No broker was involved in the transaction and no fees or\ncommissions were paid or incurred by the Company.\nNasdaq Compliance and Reverse Stock Split\nOn August 2, 2024, the Company filed a preliminary proxy statement on Schedule 14A in connection with the Company’s annual meeting of stockholders scheduled\nfor September 26, 2024 (the “September 26, 2024 annual meeting”). On August 6, 2024, the Company filed an amended proxy statement on Schedule PRER14A indicating\nthat in the event the Company does not regain compliance with the Bid Price Rule on or before September 26, 2024, then at the annual meeting, the Company intends to\nseek the approval of its stockholders to implement a reverse stock split in the range within a range of one-for-five (1-for-5) to a maximum of a one-for-two hundred (1-for-\n200).\nOn August 6, 2024, the Company received notice from the Staff indicating that the bid price for the Company’s common stock had closed below $0.10 per share for\nthe 10-consecutive trading day period ended August 5, 2024 and, accordingly, the Company is subject to the provisions contemplated under Nasdaq Listing Rule 5810(c)\n(3)(A)(iii) (the “Low Priced Stock Rule”) and its securities were subject to delisting from Nasdaq unless the Company timely requested a hearing before the Nasdaq\nHearings Panel (the “Panel”).\nOn August 12, 2024, the Company timely requested a hearing before the Panel, which request automatically stayed any further action by Nasdaq until the hearing was\nheld and the expiration of any extension period that may have been granted by the Panel. The Company’s common stock continued to trade on Nasdaq under the symbol\n“VERB” pending completion of the hearing process.\nOn August 28, 2024, the Panel determined to grant the Company a temporary exception until October 21, 2024, to effect a reverse stock split of its common stock and\nthereafter regain compliance with The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC’s Listing Rule 5550(a)(2). On October 2, 2024, the Panel amended the exception granted to the Company\nto provide that the Company has until October 22, 2024, to effect a reverse stock split to regain compliance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(a)(2).\nAt the September 26, 2024 annual meeting, the Company’s stockholders voted to approve a reverse stock split within a range of one-for-five (1-for-5) to a maximum\nof a one-for-two hundred (1-for-200). Given the then price of the Company’s shares and the limited time frames established by the Panel, on October 8, 2024 the Board\nimplemented a 1 for 200 reverse stock split (the “Reverse Stock Split”) and on October 9, 2034 the Company’s shares began trading on post-split basis.\nOn October 23, 2024, after the elapse of ten trading days, the Company received a letter from the Nasdaq Stock Market stating that the Company had regained\ncompliance with the minimum bid price requirement of $1.00 per share for continued listing on the Nasdaq Stock Market, as set forth in Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(a)(2).\nAs is customary, the Company will be subject to a mandatory panel monitor for a period of one year from October 23, 2024. If, within that one-year monitoring period, the\nNasdaq Listing Qualifications staff (the “Staff”) finds the Company is again out of compliance with the minimum bid price requirement, notwithstanding Nasdaq Listing\nRule 5810(c)(2), then the Staff will issue a delist determination letter and the Company will have an opportunity to request a new hearing with the initial Nasdaq Panel or a\nnewly convened hearing panel if the initial Panel is unavailable.\n24\nCorporate Action, Change of Control, and Extraordinary Performance Agreements\nAs of the date of this Form 10-Q, the Company’s shares have traded and are continuing to trade at a price that results in a market cap that is significantly less than the\nCompany’s current net cash position. Accordingly, the Company’s Board of Directors has determined that the Company is vulnerable to hostile takeover action and that\nany such action at this time is not in the best interests of its stockholders. The Company does not currently have any poison pill type provisions and due to previous reverse\nstock splits and other capital markets activities, the Company’s management and board members currently own an insignificant number of shares and as such would be\nineffective in voting such shares to thwart any hostile takeover actions. Until such time as the Board determines whether it is necessary or advisable to adopt a poison pill\nprovision or other anti-takeover measure, on October 31, 2024 the Board determined to approve the entry into Corporate Action, Change of Control, and Extraordinary\nPerformance Agreements (the “Agreement”) with Rory J. Cutaia, Founder, Chairman and CEO of the Company, and James Geiskopf, Lead Director, (the “Awardees”)\npursuant to which the Company will issue fully vested restricted stock units (“RSU”) subject to certain triggering events (the “Triggering Events”), as described below.\nEach RSU represents the right to be issued one share of common stock (the shares upon vesting, are subject to the restrictions as set forth in the Agreement, under the\nCompany’s 2019 Omnibus Incentive Plan, or the RSU award agreement).\nThe Triggering Events include, among other things, the following:\n1. Acceleration Upon a Corporate Transaction or Change of Control\na. “Corporate Transaction” means any person or Group (as defined in the Agreement) acquires an ownership of Shares (or other voting securities of the\nCompany then outstanding) of the Company possessing thirteen percent (13%) or more of the total voting power of the Shares (or other voting securities then\noutstanding) of the Company where such person or Group is required to file a Schedule 13D (Beneficial Ownership Report (for >5% ownership with intent to\ninfluence)) with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission within 10 days of such acquisition. In the event of either a Corporate Transaction or a Change\nof Control, on or prior to December 31, 2025, the Awardee shall be entitled to fully vested 80,000 Restricted Stock Units for each Measurement Date (as\ndefined in the Agreement) that cannot be reached due to the Change of Control. For example, for clarity, if the Corporate Transaction or Change of Control\ncloses on July 15, 2025, then the Awardee shall be entitled to 160,000 Restricted Stock Units (2 Measurement Dates x 80,000). Such accelerated Restricted\nStock Units shall be fully vested to the Awardee and the Company shall grant and deliver the accelerated Restricted Stock Units Awards to Awardee on or\nprior to such closing of the Corporate Transaction or Change of Control.\nb. “Change of Control” means and includes each of the following:\ni. any one person, or group of owners of another corporation who, acting together through a merger, consolidation, purchase, acquisition of stock or the\nlike (a “Group”), acquires ownership of Shares of the Company that, together with the Shares held by such person or Group, constitutes more than\nfifty percent (50%) of the total fair market value or total voting power of the Shares of the Company (or other voting securities of the Company then\noutstanding). However, if such person or Group is considered to own more than fifty percent (50%) of the total fair market value or total voting\npower of the Shares (or other voting securities of the Company then outstanding) before this transfer of the Company’s Shares (or other voting\nsecurities of the Company then outstanding), the acquisition of additional Shares (or other voting securities of the Company then outstanding) by the\nsame person or Group shall not be considered to cause a Change of Control of the Company; or\nii. any one person or Group acquires (or has acquired during the twelve (12)-month period ending on the date of the most recent acquisition by such\nperson or persons) ownership of Shares (or other voting securities of the Company then outstanding) of the Company possessing thirty percent\n(30%) or more of the total voting power of the Shares (or other voting securities then outstanding) of the Company where such person or Group is\nnot merely acquiring additional control of the Company; or\niii. a majority of members of the Company’s Board is replaced during any twelve (12)-month period by directors whose appointment or election is not\nendorsed by a majority of the members of the Company’s Board prior to the date of the appointment or election (the “Incumbent Board”), but\nexcluding, for purposes of determining whether a majority of the Incumbent Board has endorsed any candidate for election to the Board, any\nindividual whose initial assumption of office occurs as a result of an actual or threatened election contest with respect to the election or removal of\ndirectors or other actual or threatened solicitation of proxies or consents by or on behalf of a person or Group other than the Company’s Board; or\niv. any one person or Group acquires (or has acquired during the twelve (12)-month period ending on the date of the most recent acquisition by such\nperson or Group) all or substantially all of the assets from the Company that have a total gross fair market value equal to or more than forty percent\n(40%) of the total fair market value of all assets of the Company immediately prior to such acquisition or acquisitions. For this purpose, “gross fair\nmarket value” means the value of the assets of the Company, or the value of the assets being disposed of, determined without regard to any liabilities\nassociated with such assets.\nThe Triggering Events also include partial issuances of RSU’s to the Awardees through the achievement of extraordinary performance-based quarterly\nrevenue milestones as determined by the Board (the “Revenue Milestones”), and as measured on specific dates, each a “Measurement Date” defined as December 31,\n2024, March 31, 2025, June 30, 2025, September 30, 2025, and December 31, 2025, and the Awardees providing continuous services through the achievement of such\nmilestones. Pursuant to the Agreement, each Awardee may be entitled to receive between 40,000 and 80,000 RSU’s upon achieving the following Revenue Milestones\n(i) between $500,000 and $900,000 as of December 31, 2024, (ii) between $1.1M and $1.5M as of March 31, 2025, (iii) between $1.7M and $2.1M as of June 30,\n2025, (iv) between $2.3M and $2.7M as of September 30, 2025, and (v) $2.9M and $3.3M as of December 31, 2025. The achievement of each of the applicable\nquarterly Revenue Milestones on each Measurement Date will be reasonably determined by the Company’s Board of Directors.\nThe foregoing description of the above Agreement is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Agreement, copies of which are attached hereto as Exhibit\n10.1 and Exhibit 10.2 and incorporated herein by reference.\n25\nITEM 2 – MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nForward-Looking Statements\nThe following discussion and analysis of the results of operations and financial condition of our company for the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30,\n2024 and 2023 should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and related notes and the other financial information that are included elsewhere in this\nQuarterly Report on Form 10-Q. This discussion includes forward-looking statements based upon current expectations that involve risks and uncertainties, such as our\nplans, objectives, expectations, and intentions. Forward-looking statements are statements not based on historical fact and which relate to future operations, strategies,\nfinancial results, or other developments. Forward-looking statements are based upon estimates, forecasts, and assumptions that are inherently subject to significant\nbusiness, economic, and competitive uncertainties and contingencies, many of which are beyond our control and many of which, with respect to business decisions, are\nsubject to change. These uncertainties and contingencies can cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in any forward-looking statements made by us,\nor on our behalf. We disclaim any obligation to update forward-looking statements. Actual results and the timing of events could differ materially from those anticipated in\nthese forward-looking statements as a result of a number of factors. We use words such as “anticipate,” “estimate,” “plan,” “project,” “continuing,” “ongoing,”\n“expect,” “believe,” “intend,” “may,” “will,” “should,” “could,” and similar expressions to identify forward-looking statements.\nReferences in this document to the “Company,” “Verb,” “we,” “us,” or “our” are intended to mean Verb Technology Company, Inc., individually, or as the context\nrequires, collectively with its subsidiaries on a consolidated basis, unless otherwise specified.\nOverview\nOur business is currently comprised of three distinct, yet complimentary business units, all three of which are currently operating and generating revenue, and one of\nwhich is currently operating in “stealth mode” as we continue to refine the user experience for that business unit as we continue to ramp sales. The first business unit is\nMARKET.live focused on interactive video-based social commerce. Our MARKET.live platform is a multi-vendor, livestream social shopping destination leveraging the\nconvergence of ecommerce and entertainment. Brands, retailers and creators that join MARKET.live have the ability to broadcast livestream shopping events\nsimultaneously on numerous social media channels, including TikTok, YouTube, LinkedIn, Facebook, Instagram, Twitch, as well as on MARKET.live, reaching\nexponentially larger audiences. The Company’s recent technological integrations with META, created a seamless, native, friction-free checkout process for Facebook and\nInstagram users to purchase MARKET.live vendors’ products within each of those popular apps. This integration allows Facebook and Instagram users to browse products\nfeatured in MARKET.live shoppable videos, place products in a native shopping cart and checkout – all without leaving Facebook or Instagram. We recently announced a\ntechnology integration with Pinterest and we will continue to expand the universe of social platforms our clients can access through our platform.\nLast year we completed development work on a new MARKET.live capability that facilitated a deeper integration into the TikTok Shop social media platform,\ndesigned to expose MARKET.live shoppable programming to tens of millions of potential viewers/purchasers. This capability allows shoppers watching a MARKET.live\nstream on TikTok to stay on that site and check out through that site, eliminating the friction or reluctance of TikTok users to leave their TikTok feed in order to complete\ntheir purchase on MARKET.live. Our technology integration allows the purchase data to flow back through MARKET.live and to the individual vendors and stores on\nMARKET.live seamlessly for fulfillment of the orders.\n26\nEarlier this year, we announced an expanded strategic relationship with TikTok evidenced by a formal partnership with TikTok Shop pursuant to which MARKET.live\nbecame a service provider for TikTok Shop and officially designated as a TikTok Shop Partner (TSP) . Under the terms of the partnership, TikTok Shop refers consumer\nbrands, retailers, influencers and affiliates leads to MARKET.live for a menu of MARKET.live contract-based recurring fee revenue services that include, among other\nthings, assistance in onboarding to TikTok Shop and establishing a TikTok store, hosting training sessions and webinars for prospective TikTok Shop sellers, full creative\nservices including content creation and full remote and in-studio production services, host/influencer casting and management, TikTok Shop maintenance and\nenhancements for existing TikTok clients’ stores. The same services are currently provided to consumer brands that contact us directly or through several brand agencies\nwith which we maintain affiliate relationships.\nThe second business unit is GO FUND YOURSELF!, a revolutionary interactive social crowd funding platform for public and private companies seeking broad-based\nexposure across numerous social media channels for their crowd-funded Regulation CF and Regulation A offerings. The platform combines a ground-breaking interactive\nTV show with MARKET.live’s back-end capabilities allowing viewers to tap on their screen to facilitate an investment, in real time, as they watch companies presenting\nbefore the show’s panel of “Titans”. Presenting companies that sell consumer products are able to offer their products directly to viewers during the show in real time\nthrough shoppable onscreen icons. The Go Fund Yourself business unit generates revenue from cash fees we charge to issuers to appear on the show and for marketing, ad,\nand content creation and distribution services. For those issuers that sell products during each airing of the show through our platform, we charge a fee up to 25% of the\ngross sales revenue for all products sold.\nHistorically, and continuing up through June 13, 2023, we were a Software-as-a-Service (“SaaS”) applications platform developer that offered a SaaS platform for the\ndirect sales industry comprised of a suite of interactive video-based sales enablement business software products marketed on a subscription basis, (the “SaaS Assets”).\nOn June 13, 2023, the Company disposed of all of its operating SaaS Assets pursuant to an asset purchase agreement in consideration of the sum of $6,500, $4,750 of\nwhich was paid in cash by the buyer at the closing of the transaction (the “Sale of the SaaS Assets”). Additional payments of $1,750 will be paid by the buyer if certain\nprofitability and revenue targets are met within the two-year period following the closing as set forth more particularly in the asset purchase agreement. The sale of the\nSaaS Assets was undertaken to allow us to focus our resources on MARKET.live, and the business verticals that platform could support. We expect our burgeoning\nMARKET.live business unit will, over time, create greater shareholder value than we could have been created through the continued operation of our SaaS Assets.\nAs of September 30, 2024, the Company had cash of $10,515 and short-term investments of $5,077.\nCustomers do not have the contractual right to take possession of the Company’s software. Revenue is recognized in an amount that reflects the contractual\nconsideration that the Company receives in exchange for its services. The Company does not take possession of the customers’ inventory or any credit risks relating to the\nproducts sold.\nSales taxes collected from customers and remitted to governmental authorities are accounted for on a net basis and, therefore, are excluded from net sales in the\nconsolidated statements of operations. Revenues during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, were substantially all generated from clients and\ncustomers located within the United States of America.\n27\nResults of Operations\nFor the Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 as Compared to the Three Months Ended September 30, 2023\nThe following is a comparison of our results of operations for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 (in thousands):\nThree Months Ended September 30,\n2024 2023 Change\nRevenue $ 128 $ 29 $ 99\nCosts and expenses\nCost of revenue, exclusive of depreciation and amortization shown separately\nbelow 54 5 49\nDepreciation and amortization 273 564 (291)\nGeneral and administrative 2,113 2,850 (737)\nTotal costs and expenses 2,440 3,419 (979)\nOperating loss from continuing operations (2,312) (3,390) 1,078\nOther income (expense), net\nInterest income 193 - 193\nUnrealized gain on short-term investments 109 - 109\nInterest expense (1) (219) 218\nFinancing costs - - -\nOther income, net 46 64 (18)\nChange in fair value of derivative liability - 4 (4)\nTotal other income (expense), net 347 (151) 498\nNet loss from continuing operations $ (1,965) $ (3,541) $ 1,576\n28\nRevenue\nRevenue was $128 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to $29 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The revenue of $99,\nrepresenting an increase of 341% over the same period last year is primarily attributable to revenue received through the Company’s partnership with TikTok and the TikTok\nrelated and other services packages within the Company’s MARKET.live business unit, and from the Company’s Go Fund Yourself business unit.\nOperating Expenses\nDepreciation and amortization expenses were $273 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to $564 for the three months ended September 30,\n2023. The decrease is due to a revision in the amortization of software development costs resulting from extending the life of the asset on January 1, 2024.\nGeneral and administrative expenses including stock compensation expense were $2,113 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to $2,850 for\nthe three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease of $737 or 26%, in general and administrative expenses including stock compensation expense is primarily due to a\ndecrease in stock compensation expense and legal fees.\nOther Income, net\nOther income, net, for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was $347, which was primarily attributable to interest income.\nFor the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 as Compared to the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023\nThe following is a comparison of our results of operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 (in thousands):\nNine Months Ended September 30,\n2024 2023 Change\nRevenue $ 172 $ 34 $ 138\nCosts and expenses\nCost of revenue, exclusive of depreciation and amortization shown separately below 90 7 83\nDepreciation and amortization 798 1,730 (932)\nGeneral and administrative 7,218 9,080 (1,862)\nTotal costs and expenses 8,106 10,817 (2,711)\nOperating loss from continuing operations (7,934) (10,783) 2,849\nOther income (expense), net\nInterest income 361 - 361\nUnrealized gain on short-term investments 109 - 109\nInterest expense (236) (989) 753\nFinancing costs (90) (1,239) 1,149\nOther income, net 648 844 (196)\nChange in fair value of derivative liability 1 210 (209)\nTotal other income (expense), net 793 (1,174) 1,967\nNet loss from continuing operations $ (7,141) $ (11,957) $ 4,816\n29\nRevenue\nRevenue was $172 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to $34 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023.

The decrease is due to a revision in the amortization of software development costs resulting from extending the life of the asset on January 1, 2024.\nGeneral and administrative expenses including stock compensation expense were $7,218 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to $9,080 for the\nnine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease of $1,862 or 21% in general and administrative expenses including stock compensation expense is primarily due to a\ndecrease in stock compensation expense and a decrease in legal fees.\nOther Income, net\nOther income, net, for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was $793, which was primarily attributable to other income, net of $648 and interest income, net of\n$234, both offset by financing costs of $90.\nUse of Non-GAAP Measures – Modified EBITDA\nIn addition to our results under generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”), we present Modified EBITDA as a supplemental measure of our performance.\nHowever, Modified EBITDA is not a recognized measurement under GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to net income, income from operations or any other\nperformance measure derived in accordance with GAAP or as an alternative to cash flow from operating activities as a measure of liquidity. We define Modified EBITDA as\nnet income (loss), plus depreciation and amortization, share-based compensation, interest (income) expense, unrealized gain on short-term investments, financing costs, change\nin fair value of derivative liability, other (income) expense, loss from discontinued operations, net of tax, and other non-recurring charges.\nManagement considers our core operating performance to be that which our managers can affect in any particular period through their management of the resources\nthat affect our underlying revenue and profit generating operations that period. Non-GAAP adjustments to our results prepared in accordance with GAAP are itemized below.\nYou are encouraged to evaluate these adjustments and the reasons we consider them appropriate for supplemental analysis. In evaluating Modified EBITDA, you should be\naware that in the future we may incur expenses that are the same as or similar to some of the adjustments in this presentation. Our presentation of Modified EBITDA should not\nbe construed as an inference that our future results will be unaffected by unusual or non-recurring items.\nThree Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30,\n(in thousands) 2024 2023 2024 2023\nNet loss $ (1,965) $ (3,709) $ (7,141) $ (19,079)\nAdjustments:\nDepreciation and amortization 273 564 798 1,730\nShare-based compensation 220 583 958 1,985\nOther income, net (46) (64) (648) (844)\nFinancing costs - - 90 1,239\nInterest income (193) - (361) -\nUnrealized gain on short-term investments (109) - (109) -\nInterest expense 1 219 236 989\nChange in fair value of derivative liability - (4) (1) (210)\nLoss from discontinued operations, net of tax - 168 - 7,122\nOther non-recurring costs (a) - 400 97 585\nTotal EBITDA adjustments 146 1,866 1,060 12,596\nModified EBITDA $ (1,819) $ (1,843) $ (6,081) $ (6,483)\n30\n(a) Represents litigation and severance costs.\nWe present Modified EBITDA because we believe it assists investors and analysts in comparing our performance across reporting periods on a consistent basis by\nexcluding items that we do not believe are indicative of our core operating performance. In addition, we use Modified EBITDA in developing our internal budgets, forecasts\nand strategic plan; in analyzing the effectiveness of our business strategies in evaluating potential acquisitions; and in making compensation decisions and in communications\nwith our board of directors concerning our financial performance. Modified EBITDA has limitations as an analytical tool, which includes, among others, the following:\n● Modified EBITDA does not reflect our cash expenditures, or future requirements, for capital expenditures or contractual commitments;\n● Modified EBITDA does not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs;\n● Modified EBITDA does not reflect future interest expense, or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments, on our debts; and\n● Although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized will often have to be replaced in the future, and Modified\nEBITDA does not reflect any cash requirements for such replacements.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOverview\nAs of September 30, 2024, we had cash of $10.5 million and short-term investments of $5.1 million.\nThe following is a summary of our cash flows from operating, investing, and financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 (in\nthousands):\nNine Months Ended September 30,\n2024 2023\nCash used in operating activities – continuing operations $ (6,901) $ (6,619)\nCash used in operating activities – discontinued operations - (1,855)\nCash used in investing activities – continuing operations (5,234) (275)\nCash provided by investing activities – discontinued operations - 4,750\nCash provided by financing activities – continuing operations 18,297 4,855\nCash used in financing activities – discontinued operations - (2,367)\nIncrease (decrease) in cash $ 6,162 $ (1,511)\n31\nCash Flows – Operating\nFor the nine months ended September 30, 2024, our cash used in operating activities from continuing operations amounted to $6,901, compared to cash used in\noperating activities from continuing operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 of $6,619.\nCash Flows – Investing\nFor the nine months ended September 30, 2024, our cash flows used in investing activities amounted to $5,234, primarily due to our purchases of short-term\ninvestments.\nCash Flows – Financing\nFor the nine months ended September 30, 2024, our cash flows provided by financing activities amounted to $18,297, which represented $18,596 of net proceeds from\nthe issuance of shares of our common stock, offset primarily by $180 in offering costs paid in January 2024 related to our preferred stock offering in December 2023 and other\noffering costs paid of $105 related to our common stock offerings.\nNotes Payable\nWe have the following outstanding note payable as of September 30, 2024 (in thousands):\nBalance at\nInterest Original September 30,\nNote Issuance Date Maturity Date Rate Borrowing 2024\nNote payable (A) May 15, 2020 May 15, 2050 3.75% $ 150 $ 123\nNon-current (103)\nCurrent $ 20\n(A) On May 15, 2020, we executed an unsecured loan with the U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA) under the Economic Injury Disaster Loan program in the\namount of $150. Monthly payments, including principal and interest, began October 26, 2022. As of September 30, 2024, the outstanding balance of the note\namounted to $123.\n32\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nOur financial statements have been prepared in accordance with GAAP, which require that we make certain assumptions and estimates that affect the reported amounts\nof assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of net revenue and expenses during each reporting period.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets\nand liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported periods. Significant estimates include assumptions\nmade for assumptions made in valuing assets acquired in business combinations, impairment testing of long-lived assets, the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets,\nassumptions used in valuing derivative liabilities, assumptions used in valuing share-based compensation, and accruals for contingent liabilities. Amounts could materially\nchange in the future.\nInvestments\nIn accordance with ASC 320, Investments – Debt Securities, the Company accounts for its investments as trading securities consisting of U.S. Treasury securities and\ncorporate bonds that are reported at fair value on the Company’s condensed consolidated balance sheet at September 30, 2024. Unrealized gains and losses on these investments\nare included in other income (expense), net within the Company’s condensed consolidated statements of operations.\nThe Company’s investments in trading securities are classified as current based on the intent of management, the nature of the investments and their availability for use\nin current operations.\nCapitalized Software Development Costs\nThe Company capitalizes internal and external costs directly associated with developing internal-use software, and hosting arrangements that include an internal-use\nsoftware license, during the application development stage of its projects. The Company’s internal-use software is reported at cost less accumulated amortization. Amortization\nbegins once the project has been completed and is ready for its intended use.\nDue to changes in management’s assessment of its capitalized software development asset, the Company revised the asset’s remaining useful life effective January 1,\n2024 and will amortize the asset on a straight-line basis over a period of four years. Software maintenance activities or minor upgrades are recorded as expense in the period\nperformed.\nAmortization expense related to capitalized software development costs is recorded in depreciation and amortization in the condensed consolidated statements of\noperations.\nSegment Information\nEffective July 1, 2024, the Company operates as two reportable segments, MARKET.live and Go Fund Yourself . We identify our segments in accordance with ASC\n280, Segment Reporting, and in the manner in which our Chief Executive Officer, as our chief operating decision maker (“CODM”), allocates resources and assesses financial\nperformance.\nRevenue Recognition\nThe Company recognizes revenue in accordance with Financial Accounting Standard Board’s (“FASB”) ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (“ASC\n606”). ASC 606 creates a five-step model that requires entities to exercise judgment when considering the terms of contract(s), which includes (1) identifying the contract(s) or\nagreement(s) with a customer, (2) identifying our performance obligations in the contract or agreement, (3) determining the transaction price, (4) allocating the transaction price\nto the separate performance obligations, and (5) recognizing revenue as each performance obligation is satisfied.\nMARKET.live revenue is derived from contract-based recurring fee revenue services that include, among other things, assistance in onboarding clients to TikTok\nShop and establishing a TikTok store, hosting training sessions and webinars for prospective TikTok Shop sellers, full creative services including content creation and full\nremote and in-studio production services, host/influencer casting and management, TikTok Shop maintenance and enhancements for existing TikTok clients’ stores. Clients are\nreferred to us through our existing partnership with TikTok Shop as well as from several brand agencies with which we maintain affiliate relationships.\nGO FUND YOURSELF! derives revenue from cash fees we charge to issuers to appear on the show and for marketing, ad, and content creation and distribution\nservices. For those issuers that sell products during each airing of the show through our platform, we charge a fee up to 25% of the gross sales revenue for all products sold.\nA performance obligation is a promise in a contract to transfer a distinct product. Performance obligations promised in a contract are identified based on the goods that\nwill be transferred that are both capable of being distinct and are distinct in the context of the contract, whereby the transfer of the goods is separately identifiable from other\npromises in the contract. Performance obligations include establishing and maintaining customer online stores, providing access to the Company’s e-commerce platform and\ncustomer service support.\nThe Company’s revenue is generated primarily from services it provides as referenced above in the Revenue Recognition section. Customers do not have the\ncontractual right to take possession of the Company’s software. Revenue is recognized in an amount that reflects the contractual consideration that the Company receives in\nexchange for its services.\nRevenue is recognized on a net basis from maintaining e-commerce platforms and online orders, as the Company is engaged primarily in an agency relationship with\nits customers and earns defined amounts based on the individual contractual terms for the customer and the Company does not take possession of the customers’ inventory or\nany credit risks relating to the products sold.\nSales taxes collected from customers and remitted to governmental authorities are accounted for on a net basis and, therefore, are excluded from net sales in the\nconsolidated statements of operations.\n33\nDerivative Financial Instruments\nWe evaluate our financial instruments to determine if such instruments are derivatives or contain features that qualify as embedded derivatives. For derivative financial\ninstruments that are accounted for as liabilities, the derivative instrument is initially recorded at its fair value and is then re-valued at each reporting date, with changes in the\nfair value reported in the consolidated statements of operations. The classification of derivative instruments, including whether such instruments should be recorded as\nliabilities or as equity, is evaluated at the end of each reporting period. Derivative instrument liabilities are classified in the balance sheet as current or non-current based on\nwhether or not net-cash settlement of the derivative instrument could be required within 12 months of the balance sheet date.\nWe use Level 2 inputs for our valuation methodology for the derivative liabilities as their fair values were determined by using a Binomial pricing model. Our\nderivative liabilities are adjusted to reflect fair value at each period end, with any increase or decrease in the fair value being recorded in the results of operations as adjustments\nto fair value of derivatives.\nShare-Based Compensation\nThe Company issues stock options and warrants, shares of common stock and restricted stock units as share-based compensation to employees and non-employees.\nThe Company accounts for its share-based compensation in accordance with FASB ASC 718, Compensation – Stock Compensation. Share-based compensation cost is\nmeasured at the grant date, based on the estimated fair value of the award, and is recognized as expense over the requisite service period. The fair value of restricted stock units\nis determined based on the number of shares granted and the quoted price of our common stock and is recognized as expense over the service period. Forfeitures are accounted\nfor as they occur. Recognition of compensation expense for non-employees is in the same period and manner as if the Company had paid cash for services.\nIntangible Assets\nWe have certain intangible assets that were initially recorded at their fair value at the time of acquisition. The finite-lived intangible assets consist of developed\ntechnology and customer contracts. Indefinite-lived intangible assets consist of domain names. Intangible assets with finite useful lives are amortized using the straight-line\nmethod over their estimated useful life of five years.\nWe review all finite lived intangible assets for impairment when circumstances indicate that their carrying values may not be recoverable. If the carrying value of an\nasset group is not recoverable, we recognize an impairment loss for the excess carrying value over the fair value in our consolidated statements of operations.\nRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements\nFor a summary of our recent accounting policies, refer to Note 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, of our unaudited condensed consolidated financial\nstatements included under Item 1 – Financial Statements in this Form 10-Q.\nITEM 3 - QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nWe are a smaller reporting company as defined by Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act and are not required to provide the information required under this item.\n34\nITEM 4 - CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nWe maintain disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act, that are designed to ensure that information\nrequired to be disclosed in our reports under the Exchange Act, is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms,\nand that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and our principal financial officer, as appropriate, to\nallow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.\nWe carried out an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial\nofficer, of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and 15d- 15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of September 30, 2024. Based on\nthis evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of September 30, 2024.\nChanges in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nThere were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the three months\nended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.\nInherent Limitations on the Effectiveness of Controls\nManagement does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud. A\ncontrol system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control systems are met. Further, the\ndesign of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent\nlimitations in a cost-effective control system, no evaluation of internal control over financial reporting can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud\nwill not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been or will be detected.\nThese inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of a simple error or mistake.\nControls can also be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by management override of the controls. The design of any\nsystem of controls is based in part on certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its\nstated goals under all potential future conditions. Projections of any evaluation of controls effectiveness to future periods are subject to risks. Over time, controls may become\ninadequate because of changes in conditions or deterioration in the degree of compliance with policies or procedures.\n35\nPART II - OTHER INFORMATION\nITEM 1 - LEGAL PROCEEDINGS\nFor information regarding legal proceedings, refer to Note 12 - Commitments and Contingencies of the Notes to our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements,\nwhich is incorporated herein by reference.\nITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nOur business, results of operations, and financial condition are subject to various risks. These risks are described elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and\nour other filings with the SEC, including the 2023 Form 10-K filed on April 1, 2024. The risk factors identified in our 2023 Form 10-K have not changed in any material\nrespect.\nITEM 2 - UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS\nNone.\nITEM 3 - DEFAULTS UPON SENIOR SECURITIES\nNone.\nITEM 4 - MINE SAFETY DISCLOSURES\nNot applicable.\nITEM 5 - OTHER INFORMATION\nRule 10b5-1 Trading Arrangement\nDuring the three months ended September 30, 2024, no director or officer of the Company adopted or terminated a “Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement” or “non-Rule\n10b5-1 trading arrangement,” as each term is defined in Item 408(a) of Regulation S-K.\nCorporate Action, Change of Control, and Extraordinary Performance Agreements\nAs of the date of this Form 10-Q, the Company’s shares have traded and are continuing to trade at a price that results in a market cap that is significantly less than the\nCompany’s current net cash position. Accordingly, the Company’s Board of Directors has determined that the Company is vulnerable to hostile takeover action and that\nany such action at this time is not in the best interests of its stockholders. The Company does not currently have any poison pill type provisions and due to previous reverse\nstock splits and other capital markets activities, the Company’s management and board members currently own an insignificant number of shares and as such would be\nineffective in voting such shares to thwart any hostile takeover actions. Until such time as the Board determines whether it is necessary or advisable to adopt a poison pill\nprovision or other anti-takeover measure, on October 31, 2024 the Board determined to approve the entry into Corporate Action, Change of Control, and Extraordinary\nPerformance Agreements (the “Agreement”) with Rory J. Cutaia, Founder, Chairman and CEO of the Company, and James Geiskopf, Lead Director, (the “Awardees”)\npursuant to which the Company will issue fully vested restricted stock units (“RSU”) subject to certain triggering events (the “Triggering Events”), as described below.\nEach RSU represents the right to be issued one share of common stock (the shares upon vesting, are subject to the restrictions as set forth in the Agreement, under the\nCompany’s 2019 Omnibus Incentive Plan, or the RSU award agreement).\nThe Triggering Events include, among other things, the following:\n1. Acceleration Upon a Corporate Transaction or Change of Control\na. “Corporate Transaction” means any person or Group (as defined in the Agreement) acquires an ownership of Shares (or other voting securities of the Company then\noutstanding) of the Company possessing thirteen percent (13%) or more of the total voting power of the Shares (or other voting securities then outstanding) of the\nCompany where such person or Group is required to file a Schedule 13D (Beneficial Ownership Report (for >5% ownership with intent to influence)) with the U.S.\nSecurities and Exchange Commission within 10 days of such acquisition. In the event of either a Corporate Transaction or a Change of Control, on or prior to December\n31, 2025, the Awardee shall be entitled to fully vested 80,000 Restricted Stock Units for each Measurement Date (as defined in the Agreement) that cannot be reached due\nto the Change of Control. For example, for clarity, if the Corporate Transaction or Change of Control closes on July 15, 2025, then the Awardee shall be entitled to 160,000\nRestricted Stock Units (2 Measurement Dates x 80,000). Such accelerated Restricted Stock Units shall be fully vested to the Awardee and the Company shall grant and\ndeliver the accelerated Restricted Stock Units Awards to Awardee on or prior to such closing of the Corporate Transaction or Change of Control.\nb. “Change of Control” means and includes each of the following:\ni. any one person, or group of owners of another corporation who, acting together through a merger, consolidation, purchase, acquisition of stock or the like (a\n“Group”), acquires ownership of Shares of the Company that, together with the Shares held by such person or Group, constitutes more than fifty percent (50%) of the total\nfair market value or total voting power of the Shares of the Company (or other voting securities of the Company then outstanding). However, if such person or Group is\nconsidered to own more than fifty percent (50%) of the total fair market value or total voting power of the Shares (or other voting securities of the Company then\noutstanding) before this transfer of the Company’s Shares (or other voting securities of the Company then outstanding), the acquisition of additional Shares (or other voting\nsecurities of the Company then outstanding) by the same person or Group shall not be considered to cause a Change of Control of the Company; or\nii. any one person or Group acquires (or has acquired during the twelve (12)-month period ending on the date of the most recent acquisition by such person or persons)\nownership of Shares (or other voting securities of the Company then outstanding) of the Company possessing thirty percent (30%) or more of the total voting power of the\nShares (or other voting securities then outstanding) of the Company where such person or Group is not merely acquiring additional control of the Company; or\niii. a majority of members of the Company’s Board is replaced during any twelve (12)-month period by directors whose appointment or election is not endorsed by a\nmajority of the members of the Company’s Board prior to the date of the appointment or election (the “Incumbent Board”), but excluding, for purposes of determining\nwhether a majority of the Incumbent Board has endorsed any candidate for election to the Board, any individual whose initial assumption of office occurs as a result of an\nactual or threatened election contest with respect to the election or removal of directors or other actual or threatened solicitation of proxies or consents by or on behalf of a\nperson or Group other than the Company’s Board; or\niv. any one person or Group acquires (or has acquired during the twelve (12)-month period ending on the date of the most recent acquisition by such person or Group)\nall or substantially all of the assets from the Company that have a total gross fair market value equal to or more than forty percent (40%) of the total fair market value of all\nassets of the Company immediately prior to such acquisition or acquisitions.

Any shares otherwise available to the\nAwardee that were not granted due to the foregoing Rule 144 restrictions as specifically applied to the Awardee, shall be granted to the Awardee at the next available time in the\nfuture when such Awardee is either not an affiliate under Rule 144 or otherwise not subject to the foregoing restrictions.

For example, for clarity, if the Awardee was terminated without Cause on June 15, 2025, then the Awardee shall be entitled to\n240,000 Restricted Stock Units (3 Measurement Dates x 80,000). Such accelerated Restricted Stock Units shall be fully vested to the Awardee and the Company shall grant and\nissue the accelerated Restricted Stock Units Award to Awardee on or prior to such termination.\n(f) Acceleration Upon a Corporate Transaction or Change of Control.

DISPUTE RESOLUTION\nAny dispute under this Agreement shall be resolved by arbitration, with the arbitrator selection and procedures governed by the rules of the American Arbitration\nAssociation then in effect. Such arbitration shall be conducted in accordance with the Federal Arbitration Act (9 U S.C. 1, et seq.).

The Awardee acknowledges that there may be adverse tax consequences upon the grant or vesting of the Restricted Stock Units or\ndisposition of the underlying Shares and that the Awardee has been advised to consult a tax advisor prior to such grant, vesting, or disposition. It is intended that Restricted\nStock Units are either exempt from the requirements of Section 409A of the Code or will satisfy the requirements of Section 409A of the Code so that compensation payable\nunder this Agreement (and applicable earnings) shall not be included in income under Section 409A of the Code. Notwithstanding anything else in the Agreement, if the\nCompany determines the Awardee to be one of the Company’s “specified employees” under Section 409A of the Code at the time of such separation from service in accordance\nwith the identification date specified in the 409A Guidance and the amount hereunder is “deferred compensation” subject to Section 409A, then any distribution that otherwise\nwould be made to the Awardee with respect to this Agreement as a result of such separation from service shall not be made until the date that is six months after such separation\nfrom service or, if earlier, the date of the death of the Awardee. However, the Company shall not have any obligation to take any action to prevent the assessment of any\nadditional tax or penalty on any person for any equity award under Section 409A of the Code. If this Agreement is subject to Section 409A of the Code and the 409A Guidance,\nthis Agreement will incorporate and satisfy the written documentation requirement of Section 409A of the Code and the 409A Guidance either directly or by reference to other\ndocuments. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company shall not have any liability to the Awardee for taxes or penalties under Section 409A of the Code, and the Company\nshall not have any obligation to indemnify the Awardee for any taxes or penalties under Section 409A of the Code\n16. GOVERNING LAW\nThe validity, interpretation, construction, and performance of this Agreement shall be governed by the laws of the State of Nevada.\n17. COUNTERPARTS\nThis Agreement may be executed in several counterparts, each of which shall be deemed to be an original but all of which together will constitute one and the same\ninstrument.\n18. ENTIRE AGREEMENT\nThis Agreement sets forth the entire agreement between Awardee and the Company concerning the subject matter discussed in this Agreement and supersedes all prior\nagreements, promises, covenants, arrangements, communications, and representations or warranties, whether written or oral, by any officer, employee, or representative of the\nCompany.

GRANT OF RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS AWARDS\nThe Awardee will receive fully vested Restricted Stock Unit Awards, based on the Company’s achievement of specified performance milestones on each Measurement\nDate (each performance milestones, a “Revenue Milestone” or in the aggregate “Revenue Milestones”). Each Restricted Stock Unit represents the right of the Awardee to be\nissued one Share (share upon vesting, subject to the restrictions set forth in this Agreement, under the Incentive Plan, or the Restricted Stock Unit Award Agreement).\n4.

Any shares otherwise available to the\nAwardee that were not granted due to the foregoing Rule 144 restrictions as specifically applied to the Awardee, shall be granted to the Awardee at the next available time in the\nfuture when such Awardee is either not an affiliate under Rule 144 or otherwise not subject to the foregoing restrictions. The Company shall notify the Awardee of any changes\nin the granting schedule in a timely manner.\n(b) Continuous Service. Subject to the terms of this Agreement and the Restricted Stock Unit Award Agreement, provided that the Awardee remains in Continuous\nService (as defined in the Restricted Stock Unit Award Agreement), through the applicable Measurement Dates, the Awardee shall be entitled to receive the vesting of the\nRestricted Stock Units as set forth in the vesting schedule.\n(c) Agreement Termination Date. This Agreement shall continue until the earlier of\n(i) Five (5) years from the Effective Date; or\n(ii) Termination date of Awardee’s Continuous Services with the Company.\n(d) Acceleration Before Measurement Date.\n(i) Termination with Cause. If the Awardee’s Continuous Services is terminated by the Company before a Measurement Date for Cause, the Awardee will\nforfeit all unvested Restricted Stock Units under this Agreement to the extent not previously vested or granted to Awardee.\n(ii) Termination without Cause. If the Company terminates Awardee’s Continuous Service on or prior to December 31, 2025, either without Cause or the\nChief Executive Officer of the Company is terminated or resigns as an employee for any reason on or prior to December 31, 2025, the Awardee shall be entitled to fully vested\n80,000 Restricted Stock Units for each Measurement Date that cannot be reached due to such termination. For example, for clarity, if the Awardee was terminated either without\nCause or the Chief Executive Officer is terminated by the Company, on or prior to June 15, 2025, then the Awardee shall be entitled to 240,000 Restricted Stock Units (3\nMeasurement Dates x 80,000). Such accelerated Restricted Stock Units shall be fully vested to the Awardee and the Company shall grant and issue the accelerated Restricted\nStock Units Award to Awardee on or prior to such termination.\n(iii) Acceleration Upon a Corporate Transaction or Change of Control. In the event of either a Corporate Transaction or a Change of Control, on or prior to\nDecember 31, 2025, the Awardee shall be entitled to fully vested 80,000 Restricted Stock Units for each Measurement Date that cannot be reached due to the Change of\nControl. For example, for clarity, if the Corporate Transaction or Change of Control closes on July 15, 2025, then the Awardee shall be entitled to 160,000 Restricted Stock\nUnits (2 Measurement Dates x 80,000). Such accelerated Restricted Stock Units shall be fully vested to the Awardee and the Company shall grant and deliver the accelerated\nRestricted Stock Units Awards to Awardee on or prior to such closing of the Corporate Transaction or Change of Control.\n(iv) Termination for Death or Disability. If Awardee’s Continuous Services are terminated with the Company on account of death or Disability on or prior to\nDecember 31, 2025, for purposes of this Agreement, the Awardee will receive fully vested 80,000 Restricted Stock Units for each Measurement Date that cannot be reached due\nto such death or Disability. For example, for clarity, if the Awardee’s death or Disability occurred on August 15, 2025, then Awardee shall be entitled to 160,000 Restricted\nStock Units (2 Measurement Dates x 80,000). Such accelerated Restricted Stock Units shall be fully vested to the Awardee (or Awardee’s beneficiaries or heirs) and the\nCompany shall grant and deliver the accelerated Restricted Stock Units Awards to Awardee (or Awardee’s beneficiaries or heirs) within 10 days of Awardee’s death or\nDisability.\n5. CHANGE IN CONTROL EXCISE TAX GROSS UP\nAnything in this Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, if it is determined that any payment under this Agreement to the Awardee (“Payment”) would, if paid, be\nsubject to the excise tax (the “Excise Tax”) imposed by Code Section 4999, and no exemption to such excise tax applies, the Company shall pay the Awardee an additional\npayment (the “Gross Up Payment”) to pay any and all taxes on the Gross Up Payment and any and all taxes on the Payment subject to the Excise Tax on the benefits to which\nthe Awardee is entitled without the Gross Up Payment. The purpose of the Gross Up Payment is to put the Awardee in the same after-tax position that Awardee would have been\nin had there been no Excise Tax.\n6. ADJUSTMENTS\nIf any change is made to the outstanding Shares or the capital structure of the Company, if required, the Restricted Stock Units shall be adjusted or terminated in any\nmanner as contemplated by the Incentive Plan.\n7. RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS SUBJECT TO INCENTIVE PLAN\nThis Restricted Stock Units granted under the terms of this Agreement are subject to the terms of the Incentive Plan. The terms and provisions of the Incentive Plan as\nit may be amended from time to time are hereby incorporated herein by reference. In the event of a conflict between any term or provision contained herein and a term or\nprovision of the Incentive Plan, the applicable terms and provisions of this Agreement will govern and prevail.\n8. INALIENABILITY OF BENEFITS\nNeither Awardee, nor creditors of Awardee, shall have any right to assign, pledge, hypothecate, anticipate or in any way create a lien upon Awardee’s interest created\nunder this Agreement. All Restricted Stock Unit Awards to be made to Awardee shall be made only upon their personal receipt or endorsement, and no interest under this\nAgreement shall be subject to assignment or transfer or otherwise be alienable, either by voluntary or involuntary act or by operation of law or equity, or subject to attachment,\nexecution, garnishment, sequestration, levy or other seizure under any legal, equitable or other process, or be liable in any way for the debts or defaults of Awardee.\n9. BINDING NATURE OF AGREEMENT\nThis Agreement shall be binding upon the heirs, executors, administrators, successors and assigns of any and all interested parties, present and future.\n10. UNFUNDED AGREEMENT AND PLAN\nThis Agreement is intended to create an unfunded arrangement and does not defer the receipt of income to termination of employment or beyond and is therefore not\nsubject to the requirements of ERISA.\n11. DISPUTE RESOLUTION\nAny dispute under this Agreement shall be resolved by arbitration, with the arbitrator selection and procedures governed by the rules of the American Arbitration\nAssociation then in effect. Such arbitration shall be conducted in accordance with the Federal Arbitration Act (9 U S.C. 1, et seq.). The decision of the arbitrator shall be final\nand binding upon the parties, subject to normal judicial review of arbitrator decisions as provided by law.\n12. VALIDITY\nThe invalidity or unenforceability of any provision of this Agreement shall not affect the validity or enforceability of any other provision of this Agreement, which\nshall remain in full force and effect.\n13. NO RIGHT TO CONTINUED SERVICE\nNeither the Incentive Plan nor this Agreement shall confer upon the Awardee any right to be retained in any position, as an employee, consultant, or director of the\nCompany. Further, nothing in the Incentive Plan or this Agreement shall be construed to limit the discretion of the Company to terminate the Awardee’s Continuous Service at\nany time, with or without Cause, subject to the acceleration provisions of this Agreement.\n14. AMENDMENT AND TERMINATION\nAny amendment, modification, change, or termination or this Agreement must be done so in writing and signed by both parties.\n15. CODE SECTION 409A\nIf any payments under this Agreement are subject to the provisions of Code Section 409A, it is intended that the Agreement will comply fully with and meet all the\nrequirements of Code Section 409A. The Awardee acknowledges that there may be adverse tax consequences upon the grant or vesting of the Restricted Stock Units or\ndisposition of the underlying Shares and that the Awardee has been advised to consult a tax advisor prior to such grant, vesting, or disposition. It is intended that Restricted\nStock Units are either exempt from the requirements of Section 409A of the Code or will satisfy the requirements of Section 409A of the Code so that compensation payable\nunder this Agreement (and applicable earnings) shall not be included in income under Section 409A of the Code. Notwithstanding anything else in the Agreement, if the\nCompany determines the Awardee to be one of the Company’s “specified employees” under Section 409A of the Code at the time of such separation from service in accordance\nwith the identification date specified in the 409A Guidance and the amount hereunder is “deferred compensation” subject to Section 409A, then any distribution that otherwise\nwould be made to the Awardee with respect to this Agreement as a result of such separation from service shall not be made until the date that is six months after such separation\nfrom service or, if earlier, the date of the death of the Awardee. However, the Company shall not have any obligation to take any action to prevent the assessment of any\nadditional tax or penalty on any person for any equity award under Section 409A of the Code. If this Agreement is subject to Section 409A of the Code and the 409A Guidance,\nthis Agreement will incorporate and satisfy the written documentation requirement of Section 409A of the Code and the 409A Guidance either directly or by reference to other\ndocuments. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company shall not have any liability to the Awardee for taxes or penalties under Section 409A of the Code, and the Company\nshall not have any obligation to indemnify the Awardee for any taxes or penalties under Section 409A of the Code\n16. GOVERNING LAW\nThe validity, interpretation, construction, and performance of this Agreement shall be governed by the laws of the State of Nevada.\n17. COUNTERPARTS\nThis Agreement may be executed in several counterparts, each of which shall be deemed to be an original but all of which together will constitute one and the same\ninstrument.\n18. ENTIRE AGREEMENT\nThis Agreement sets forth the entire agreement between Awardee and the Company concerning the subject matter discussed in this Agreement and supersedes all prior\nagreements, promises, covenants, arrangements, communications, and representations or warranties, whether written or oral, by any officer, employee, or representative of the\nCompany. Any prior agreements or understandings that are contrary with respect to the subject matter set forth in this Agreement are hereby overridden and the terms of this\nAgreement shall apply.\nIN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties hereto have executed this Agreement as of the date set forth above.\nVERB TECHNOLOGY COMPANY, INC.\nBy:\nIts:\nAWAREDEE\nJames Geiskopf\nExhibit 31.1\nCERTIFICATION PURSUANT TO\nSECTION 302 OF THE SARBANES-OXLEY ACT OF 2002\nI, Rory J.

FORM 10-K SUMMARY 54\nCAUTIONARY NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS\nThis Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 (this “Annual Report”) includes “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of\nSection 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”), and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”),\nwhich statements are subject to considerable risks and uncertainties. These forward-looking statements are intended to qualify for the safe harbor from liability established by\nthe Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements include all statements that are not statements of historical facts and can be identified by words\nsuch as “anticipates,” “believes,” “could,” “estimates,” “expects,” “intends,” “may,” “plans,” “potential,” “predicts,” “projects,” “seeks,” “should,” “will,” “would” or similar\nexpressions and the negatives of those expressions. Forward-looking statements also include the assumptions underlying or relating to such statements.\nOur forward-looking statements are based on our management’s current beliefs, assumptions and expectations about future events and trends, which affect or may\naffect our business, strategy, operations, financial performance or liquidity. Although we believe these forward-looking statements are based upon reasonable assumptions, they\nare subject to numerous known and unknown risks and uncertainties and are made in light of information currently available to us. Some of the risks and uncertainties that may\nimpact our forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, the following factors:\n● our incursion of significant net losses and uncertainty whether we will achieve or maintain profitable operations;\n● our ability to continue as a going concern;\n● our ability to grow and compete in the future, and to execute our business strategy;\n● our ability to maintain and expand our customer base and to convince our customers to increase the use of our services and/or platform;\n● the competitive market in which we operate;\n● our ability to increase the number of our strategic relationships and grow the revenues from our current strategic relationships;\n● our ability to develop enhancements and new features to our existing service or acceptable new services that keep pace with technological developments;\n● our ability to successfully launch new product platforms, including MARKET.live, the rate of adoption of these platforms and the revenue generated from these\nplatforms;\n● our ability to deliver our services, in light of our dependency on third party Internet providers;\n● our ability to raise additional capital or borrow additional funds to fund our operations and execute our business strategy, and the impact of these transactions on our\nbusiness and existing stockholders;\n● our ability to attract and retain qualified management personnel;\n● our ability to pay our debt obligations as they become due;\n● our susceptibility to security breaches and other disruptions;\n● our ability to maintain compliance with the listing requirements of the Nasdaq Capital Market; and\n● the impact of, and our ability to operate our business and effectively manage our growth under evolving and uncertain global economic, political, and social trends,\nincluding inflation, rising interest rates, and recessionary concerns.\nThe forward-looking statements contained in this Annual Report are based on management’s current plans, estimates and expectations in light of information currently\navailable to us, and they are subject to uncertainty and changes in circumstances. There can be no assurance that future developments affecting us will be those we have\nanticipated. Actual results may differ materially from these expectations due to changes in global, regional or local political, economic, business, competitive, market,\nregulatory and other factors, many of which are beyond our control, as well as the other factors described in the section entitled “Risk Factors” within this Annual Report and in\nthe other reports we file with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”). These risks and uncertainties include those described in the section entitled “Risk Factors.”\nYou should not place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements. Our forward-looking statements are based on the information currently available to us and\nspeak only as of the date on which they were made. Additional factors or events that could cause our actual results to differ may also emerge from time to time, and it is not\npossible for us to predict all of them. Over time, our actual results, performance, or achievements may differ from those expressed or implied by our forward-looking\nstatements, and such difference might be significant and materially adverse to our security holders. Comparisons of results for current and any prior periods are not intended to\nexpress any future trends, or indications of future performance, unless expressed as such, and should only be viewed as historical data. Except as required by law, we undertake\nno obligation to update publicly any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise. We have identified some of the important\nfactors that could cause future events to differ from our current expectations and they are described in this Annual Report under the captions “Risk Factors,” and\n“Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,” as well as in other documents that we may file with the SEC, all of which you\nshould review carefully. We qualify all of our forward-looking statements by these disclaimers.\nPART I\nITEM 1. BUSINESS\n2023 Overview\nThrough June 13, 2023, we operated three distinct lines of business through separate wholly owned subsidiaries: Verb Direct, LLC, a sales Software-as-a-Service\n(“SaaS”) platform for the direct sales industry; Verb Acquisition Co., LLC, which was a sales SaaS platform for the Life Sciences industry and sports teams; and\nverbMarketplace, LLC, which is a multi-vendor, multi-presenter, livestream social shopping platform known as MARKET.live that combines ecommerce and entertainment.\nWe determined that by focusing all of our resources solely on the development and operation of MARKET.live, our livestream shopping platform, over time we could\ngenerate greater shareholder value than through the continued operation of our SaaS business platforms. Accordingly, after an extensive seven-month process, managed by a\nprominent M&A advisory firm, to identify a buyer willing to pay the highest price on the most favorable terms for the assets of the SaaS business on June 13, 2023 we disposed\nof all of the operating SaaS assets of Verb Direct, LLC and Verb Acquisition Co., LLC pursuant to an asset purchase agreement for aggregate consideration of $6.5 million,\n$4.75 million of which was paid in cash by the buyer at the closing of the transaction. Additional payments in the aggregate of $1.75 million will be paid by the buyer if certain\nprofitability and revenue targets are met within each of the two-year periods following the closing date as set forth more particularly in the asset purchase agreement. During\nthe seven-month period of the sales process, virtually all of our resources were dedicated to facilitating the sale process and all operating budgets were suspended, including\nsales and marketing budgets for MARKET.live, in order to preserve cash and minimize reliance on the capital markets until the asset sale process was complete.\nOur MARKET.live Business\nThe Company’s MARKET.live platform is a multi-vendor, multi-presenter, livestream social shopping destination the leverages the current convergence of ecommerce\nand entertainment, where hundreds of retailers, brands, creators and influencers can monetize their base of fans and followers across social media channels. Brands, retailers\nand creators that join MARKET.live have the ability to broadcast livestream shopping events simultaneously on numerous social media channels, including TikTok, as well as\non MARKET.live, reaching exponentially larger audiences. The Company’s recent technological integrations with META, created a seamless, native, friction-free checkout\nprocess for Facebook and Instagram users to purchase MARKET.live vendors’ products within each of those popular apps. This integration allows Facebook and Instagram\nusers to browse products featured in MARKET.live shoppable videos, place products in a native shopping cart and checkout – all without leaving Facebook or Instagram.\nOn September 5, 2023, the Company completed development work on a new MARKET.live capability that facilitated a deeper integration into the TikTok social\nmedia platform, which could expose MARKET.live shoppable programming to tens of millions of potential viewers/purchasers. This new capability allows shoppers watching\na MARKET.live stream on TikTok to stay on that site and check out through that site, eliminating the friction or reluctance of TikTok users to leave their TikTok feed in order\nto complete their purchase on MARKET.live. Our technology integration allows the purchase data to flow back through MARKET.live and to the individual vendors and stores\non MARKET.live seamlessly for fulfillment of the orders.\nOn March 27, 2024, the Company announced that it expanded its strategic relationship with TikTok and entered into a formal partnership with TikTok Shop pursuant\nto which MARKET.live became a service provider for TikTok Shop and officially designated as a TikTok Shop Partner (TSP) . Under the terms of the partnership, TikTok Shop\nrefers consumer brands, retailers, influencers and affiliates leads to Market.live for a menu of MARKET.live paid services that include, among other things, assistance in\nonboarding to TikTok and establishing a TikTok store, hosting training sessions and webinars for prospective TikTok Shop sellers, studio space rental in both the West Coast\nand East Coast MARKET.live studios, content creation and production services, and TikTok Shop maintenance and enhancements for existing TikTok clients’ stores. The\npartnership also contemplates TikTok Shop sponsored studio rentals, as well as a paid-for “day pass” for use of MARKET.live studio services by TikTok creators, influencers\nand affiliates. MARKET.live is expected to generate revenue through fees, including monthly recurring fees, paid directly to MARKET.live by the brands, retailers, influencers\nand affiliates referred to MARKET.live by TikTok. In addition, it is contemplated that MARKET.live will receive a percentage of monthly revenue generated through the\nTikTok stores MARKET.live establishes for the brands, retailers, influencers and affiliates that TikTok Shop refers to MARKET.live.\nThe partnership also contemplates the use of MARKET.live studios as TikTok “Sample Centers” where TikTok creators will have access to product samples for use in\ntheir TikTok Shop videos produced at MARKET.live studios. In addition to the compensation referenced above, TikTok will compensate MARKET.live directly for the\nattainment of certain pre-established performance goals and objectives agreed to between the parties.\nThe Company’s recent drop ship and affiliate programs are currently being revised to incorporate the benefits and implications of the recent META integrations as well\nas the new TikTok partnership. The Company is actively engaged in completing development on integrations into additional large social media platforms, as well as developing\npartnerships and strategic alliances that it believes will help foster the growth of the Company’s business.\n1\nOur Market\nRevenue Generation\nA description of our principal revenue generating activities is as follows:\n1. MARKET.live generates revenue through several sources as follows:\na. All sales run through our ecommerce facility on MARKET.live from which we deduct a platform fee that ranges from 10% to 20% of gross sales, with an average\nof approximately 15%, depending upon the pricing package the vendors select as well as the product category and profit margins associated with such categories.\nThe revenue is derived from sales generated during livestream events, from sales realized through views of previously recorded live events available in each\nvendor’s store, as well as from sales of product and merchandise displayed in the vendors’ online stores, all of which are shoppable 24/7.\nb. Produced events. MARKET.live offers fee-based services that range from full production of livestream events, to providing professional hosts and event\nconsulting.\nc. Drop Ship and Creator programs. MARKET.live is expected to generate recurring fee revenue from soon to be launched new drop ship programs for entrepreneurs\nand its Creator program.\nd. The Company’s recently launched TikTok stores and affiliate programs.\ne. The MARKET.live site is designed to incorporate sponsorships and other advertising based on typical industry rates.\nA performance obligation is a promise in a contract to transfer a distinct product. Performance obligations promised in a contract are identified based on the goods that\nwill be transferred that are both capable of being distinct and are distinct in the context of the contract, whereby the transfer of the goods is separately identifiable from other\npromises in the contract. Performance obligations include establishing and maintaining customer online stores, providing access to the Company’s e-commerce platform and\ncustomer service support.\nThe Company’s revenue is mainly commission fees derived from contractually committed gross revenue processed by customers on the Company’s e-commerce\nplatform as well as subscription-based fees and other fees and commissions for services rendered by the Company to clients referred to the Company by TikTok. Customers do\nnot have the contractual right to take possession of the Company’s software. Revenue is recognized in an amount that reflects the consideration that the Company expects to\nultimately receive in exchange for those promised goods, net of expected discounts for sales promotions and customary allowances.\nRevenue is recognized on a net basis from maintaining e-commerce platforms and online orders, as the Company is engaged primarily in an agency relationship with\nits customers and earns defined amounts based on the individual contractual terms for the customer and the Company does not take possession of the customers’ inventory or\nany credit risks relating to the products sold.\nSales taxes collected from customers and remitted to governmental authorities are accounted for on a net basis and, therefore, are excluded from net sales in the\nconsolidated statements of operations.\nIntellectual Property\nOur policy is to protect our technology through, among other things, a combination of patents, trade secrets and copyrights. We primarily rely upon trade secrets and\ncopyrighted proprietary software, code, and know-how to protect our interactive video technology platform and associated applications. We have taken security measures to\nprotect our trade secrets and proprietary know-how, to the extent possible. Our means of protecting our proprietary rights may not prove to be adequate and our competitors\nmay independently develop technology or products that are similar to ours or that compete with ours. Trade secret and copyright laws afford only limited protection for our\ntechnology and products. The laws of many countries do not protect our proprietary rights to as great an extent as do the laws of the United States. Despite our efforts to protect\nour proprietary rights, unauthorized parties may attempt to obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary. Third parties may also design around our proprietary rights,\nwhich may render our protected technology and products less valuable, if the design around is favorably received in the marketplace.\nWe control access to our proprietary technology by entering into confidentiality and invention assignment agreements with our employees and contractors, and\nconfidentiality agreements with third parties. Despite our precautions, we cannot assure you that our technology platform and products do not infringe patents held by others or\nthat they will not in the future. Litigation may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights, to protect our trade secrets, to determine the validity and scope of the\nproprietary rights of others, or to defend against claims of infringement, invalidity, misappropriation, or other claims.\nDependence on Key Customers\nBased on our current business and anticipated future activities as described in this Annual Report, we do not have any customers that represent more than 10% of our\n2023 revenue.\n2\nGovernment Regulation\nOur software and services are subject to certain legal, regulatory and other requirements. These laws are complex and evolving. Various U.S. federal and state laws\ngovern many of our business activities, including, without limitation, the processing of payments and handling of consumer information. Despite our significant efforts to\ncomply with all applicable requirements, there can be no guarantee that our efforts will be sufficient or that existing laws, rules or other requirements will not be interpreted,\nrevised, augmented or rewritten in a way that adversely affects our regulated business activities, which comprise a significant majority of our overall business. For additional\ninformation related to these risk-related issues, refer to the section entitled “Risk Factors” within this Annual Report.\nHuman Capital Management\nAs of March 28, 2024, we had 20 full-time statutory employees, three part-time employees, and three independent contractors. We engage independent contractors on\nan as-needed basis to provide specific expertise in areas of software design, development and coding, content creation, audio and video editing, video production services, and\nother business functions, including marketing and accounting. None of our employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement. We have had no labor-related work\nstoppages and believe our relationship with our employees, both full-time and part-time, consultants, and independent contractors, is satisfactory.\nWe believe our people are at the heart of our success and our customers’ success. We endeavor to not only attract and retain talented employees, but also to provide a\nchallenging and rewarding environment to motivate and develop our valuable human capital. We look to our talented employees to lead and foster various initiatives that\nsupport our company culture including those related to diversity, equity and inclusion. In addition, we rely heavily on our talented team to execute our growth plans and achieve\nour long-term strategic objectives.\nWe provide competitive compensation and benefits for our employees. Our compensation packages may include base salary, commission or annual performance-based\nbonuses, and share-based compensation. We also offer general employee medical, dental, and vision insurance, health savings and flexible spending accounts, mental health\nresources, paid time off, paid family leave, life and disability insurance, and a 401(k) plan. These programs and our overall compensation packages seek to attract and retain\ntalented employees.\nOur Historical Background\nVerb Technology Company, Inc. was incorporated in 2012 in the state of Nevada.\nOn April 12, 2019, we acquired Sound Concepts Inc. pursuant to an agreement and plan of merger. As a result of the merger, Sound Concepts merged with and into our\nwholly owned subsidiary, NF Acquisition Company, LLC. Upon completion of the merger, NF Acquisition Company, LLC changed its name to Verb Direct, LLC (“Verb\nDirect”).\nOn September 4, 2020, Verb Acquisition Co., LLC (“Verb Acquisition”), a subsidiary of Verb Technology, entered into a membership interest purchase agreement with\nAscend Certification, LLC, dba SoloFire.\nOn October 18, 2021, we established verbMarketplace, LLC (“Market LLC”), a Nevada limited liability company. Market LLC is a wholly owned subsidiary\nestablished for our MARKET.live platform.\nOn June 13, 2023, the Company disposed of all of its operating SaaS assets of Verb Direct and Verb Acquisition, (referred to collectively as the “SaaS Assets”)\npursuant to an asset purchase agreement in consideration of the sum of $6.5 million, $4.75 million of which was paid in cash by the buyer at the closing of the transaction.\nAdditional payments in the aggregate of $1.75 million will be paid by the buyer if certain profitability and revenue targets are met within each of the two-year periods following\nthe closing date as set forth more particularly in the asset purchase agreement. The sale of the SaaS Assets was undertaken to allow the Company to focus its resources on its\nburgeoning MARKET.live business unit which it expects over time will create greater shareholder value.\nOur common stock and common stock purchase warrants trade on The Nasdaq Capital Market under the symbols “VERB” and “VERBW,” respectively. Our Internet\nwebsite address is https://www.verb.tech.\n3\nITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nOur short and long-term success is subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, many of which involve factors that are difficult to predict or beyond our control. As a\nresult, investing in the Company’s common stock involves substantial risk. The Company’s stockholders should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below, in\naddition to the other information contained in or incorporated by reference into this Annual Report, as well as the other information we file with the SEC from time to time. The\nrisks described below are not the only ones we face. Additional risks not presently known to us or that we currently believe are immaterial may also impair our business\noperations and financial results. If any of the following risks actually occurs, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be adversely affected. In such\ncase, the trading price of our common stock could decline and you could lose all or part of your investment. Our filings with the SEC also contain forward-looking statements\nthat involve risks or uncertainties. Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated or contemplated by these forward-looking statements as a result of a\nnumber of factors, including the risks we face described below, as well as other variables that could affect our operating results. Past financial performance should not be\nconsidered to be a reliable indicator of future performance, and investors should not use historical trends to anticipate results or trends in future periods.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nWe have incurred significant net losses and cannot assure you that we will achieve or maintain profitable operations.\nWe have incurred recurring losses since our inception in 2012. Our net loss was $22.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, and $37.4 million for the year\nended December 31, 2022. To date, we have funded our operations through cash collected from sales of our products and services, offerings of our equity securities, and debt\nfinancing. We have devoted substantially all of our resources to the design, development and commercialization of our products, the scaling of our technology and\ninfrastructure, and our marketing and sales efforts. We may continue to incur significant losses in the future for a number of reasons, including unforeseen expenses, difficulties,\ncomplications, delays, and other unknown events.\nTo implement our business strategy and achieve consistent profitability, we need to, among other things, continue to reduce operating expenses, increase sales of our\nproducts and the gross profit associated with those sales, continue to reduce research and development expenses, and increase our marketing and sales efforts to drive an\nincrease in the number of customers and clients utilizing our services. These expenditures may make it more difficult to achieve and maintain profitability. In addition, our\nefforts to grow our business may be more expensive than we expect, and we may not be able to generate sufficient revenue to offset operating expenses. If we are forced to\nreduce our expenses beyond our planned cost reduction initiatives, our growth strategy could be compromised. To offset our anticipated operating expenses, we will need to\ngenerate and sustain significant revenue levels in future periods in order to become profitable, and even if we do, we may not be able to maintain or increase our level of\nprofitability.\nAccordingly, we cannot assure you that we will achieve sustainable operating profits as we continue to reduce operating expenses, restructure our balance sheet,\nfurther develop our marketing efforts, and otherwise implement our growth initiatives. Any failure to achieve and maintain profitability would have a materially adverse effect\non our ability to implement our business plan, our results and operations, and our financial condition, and could cause the value of our common stock, to decline, resulting in a\nsignificant or complete loss of your investment.\n4\nOur independent registered public accounting firm’s report may raise substantial doubt as to our ability to continue as a going concern.\nOur independent registered public accounting firm may raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. A “going concern” opinion indicates\nthat the financial statements have been prepared assuming we will continue as a going concern and do not include any adjustments to reflect the possible future effects on the\nrecoverability and classification of assets, or the amounts and classification of liabilities that may result if we do not continue as a going concern. Therefore, you should not rely\non our consolidated balance sheet as an indication of the amount of proceeds that would be available to satisfy claims of creditors, and potentially be available for distribution\nto stockholders, in the event of liquidation. The presence of the going concern note to our financial statements may have an adverse impact on the relationships we are\ndeveloping and plan to develop with third parties as we continue the commercialization of our products and could make it challenging and difficult for us to raise additional\nfinancing, all of which could have a material adverse impact on our business and prospects and result in a significant or complete loss of your investment.\nIf we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow from operations to operate our business and pay our debt obligations as they become due, we may need to seek to\nborrow additional funds, dispose of our assets, or reduce or delay capital expenditures. There can be no assurance that we will ever be profitable or that debt or equity financing\nwill be available to us in the amounts, on terms, and at times deemed acceptable to us, if at all. The issuance of additional equity securities by us would result in a significant\ndilution in the equity interests of our current stockholders. Obtaining commercial loans, assuming those loans would be available, would increase our liabilities and future cash\ncommitments. If we are unable to obtain financing in the amounts and on terms deemed acceptable to us, we may be unable to continue our business, as planned, and as a result\nmay be required to scale back or cease operations for our business, the results of which would be that our stockholders would lose some or all of their investment. Our audited\nconsolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments to reflect the possible future effects on the recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts and\nclassifications of liabilities that may result should we be unable to continue as a going concern. For additional information, please refer to the section entitled “Management’s\nDiscussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Liquidity and Capital Resources – Going Concern and Management’s Plan,” as well as Note 1 to\nour consolidated financial statements included within this Annual Report.\nPublic health threats, natural disasters and other events beyond our control, have had and may continue to have a significant negative impact on our business, sales,\nresults of operations and financial condition.\nPublic health threats and other highly communicable diseases and outbreaks could adversely impact our operations, the operations of our customers, suppliers,\ndistributors and other business partners, as well as the healthcare system in general. Our business operations are subject to interruption by natural disasters, fire, power\nshortages, pandemics and other events beyond our control. Although we maintain crisis management and disaster response plans, such events could make it difficult or\nimpossible for us to deliver our services to our customers and could decrease demand for our services.\nAdditionally, our liquidity could be negatively impacted if these conditions continue for a significant period of time and we may be required to pursue additional\nsources of financing to obtain working capital, maintain appropriate inventory levels, and meet our financial obligations. Capital and credit markets have been disrupted by the\ncrisis and our ability to obtain any required financing is not guaranteed and largely dependent upon evolving market conditions and other factors. Depending on the continued\nimpact of the crisis, further actions may be required to improve our cash position and capital structure.\nThe extent to which public health threats, natural disasters or catastrophic events, ultimately impacts our business, sales, results of operations and financial condition\nwill depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including, but not limited to, the duration and spread of the outbreak, its severity, the\nactions to contain the virus or treat its impact, and how quickly and to what extent normal economic and operating conditions can resume.\n5\nOur ability to grow and compete in the future will be adversely affected if adequate capital is not available to us or not available on terms favorable to us.\nWe have limited capital resources. We have financed our operations entirely through equity investments by founders and other investors and the incurrence of debt,\nand we expect to continue to finance our operations in the same manner in the foreseeable future. Our ability to continue our normal and planned operations, to grow our\nbusiness, and to compete in our industry will depend on the availability of adequate capital. We cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain additional funding from those\nor other sources when or in the amounts needed, on acceptable terms, or at all. If we raise capital through the sale of equity, or securities convertible into equity, it would result\nin dilution to our then-existing stockholders, which could be significant depending on the price at which we may be able to sell our securities. If we raise additional capital\nthrough the incurrence of additional indebtedness, we would likely become subject to further covenants restricting our business activities, and holders of debt instruments may\nhave rights and privileges senior to those of our then-existing stockholders. In addition, servicing the interest and principal repayment obligations under debt facilities could\ndivert funds that would otherwise be available to support development of new programs and marketing to current and potential new clients. If we are unable to raise capital\nwhen needed or on attractive terms, we could be forced to delay, reduce, or eliminate development of new programs or future marketing efforts, or reduce or discontinue our\noperations. Any of these events could significantly harm our business, financial condition, and prospects.\nOur indebtedness, and the agreements governing such indebtedness, subject us to required debt service payments, as well as financial restrictions and operating covenants,\nany of which may reduce our financial flexibility and affect our ability to operate our business.\nFrom time to time, we have financed our liquidity needs in part from borrowings made under various credit agreements. As of December 31, 2023, the aggregate\noutstanding balance of our notes payable was $2.9 million. As of March 28, 2024, the balance of our notes payable is $1.2 million.\nThe agreements underlying these transactions contain certain financial restrictions, operating covenants, and debt service requirements. Our failure to comply with\nobligations under these agreements, or inability to make required debt service payments, could result in an event of default under the agreements. A default, if not cured or\nwaived, could permit a lender to accelerate payment of the loan, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, operations, financial condition, and liquidity.\nFurther, if our debt is accelerated, we cannot be certain that funds will be available to pay the debt or that we will have the ability to refinance the debt on terms satisfactory to\nus or at all. If we are unable to repay or refinance the accelerated debt, we could become insolvent and seek to file for bankruptcy protection, which would have a material\nadverse impact on our financial condition.\nIn addition, the covenants in our credit agreements could limit our ability to engage in transactions that would be in our best interest, or otherwise respond to changing\nbusiness and economic conditions, and may therefore have a material impact on our business. For example, our borrowings will require debt service payments, which could\nrequire us to divert funds identified for other purposes to such debt service payments. Further, if we cannot generate sufficient cash flow from operations to service our debt, we\nmay need to refinance the debt, dispose of its assets, or reduce or delay expenditures. Alternatively, we may be required to issue equity to obtain necessary funds, which would\nbe dilutive to our stockholders. We do not know whether we would be able to take any of these actions on a timely basis or at all.\nOur current or future level of indebtedness could affect our operations in several ways, including the following:\n● the covenants contained in current or future agreements governing outstanding indebtedness may limit our ability to borrow additional funds, refinance debt, dispose\nof assets, and make certain investments;\n● debt covenants may also affect our flexibility in planning for, and reacting to, changes in the economy and in our industry;\n6\n● a high level of debt would increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions;\n● a significant level of debt may place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that are less leveraged and, therefore, may be able to take advantage\nof opportunities that our indebtedness would prevent us from pursuing; and\n● a high level of debt may impair our ability to obtain additional financing in the future for working capital, debt service requirements, acquisitions, or other purposes.\nFor additional information refer to the section entitled “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Liquidity and\nCapital Resources,” as well as Note 1 in the section entitled “Going Concern and Management’s Plan” to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this\nAnnual Report.\nThe success of our business is dependent upon our ability to maintain and expand our customer base and our ability to convince our customers to increase the use of our\nservices and/or platform. If we are unable to expand our customer base and/or the use of our services and/or platform by our customers declines, our business will be\nharmed.\nOur ability to expand and generate revenue depends, in part, on our ability to maintain and expand our relationships with existing customers and convince them to\nincrease their use of our platform. If our customers do not increase their use of our platform, then our revenue may not grow and our results of operations may be harmed. It is\ndifficult to predict customers’ usage levels accurately and the loss of customers or reductions in their usage levels may have a negative impact on our business, results of\noperations, and financial condition. If a significant number of customers cease using, or reduce their usage of, our platform, then we may be required to spend significantly\nmore on sales and marketing than we currently plan to spend in order to maintain or increase revenue. These additional expenditures could adversely affect our business, results\nof operations, and financial condition. Most of our customers do not have long-term contractual financial commitments to us and, therefore, most of our customers could reduce\nor cease their use of our platform at any time without penalty or termination charges.\nThe market in which we operate is intensely competitive and, if we do not compete effectively, our operating results could be harmed.\nThe market for livestream shopping platforms is intensely competitive and rapidly changing, barriers to entry are relatively low, and many of our competitors, have\ngreater name recognition, longer operating histories, and larger marketing budgets, as well as substantially greater financial, technical, and other resources, than we do. In\naddition, many of our potential competitors have established marketing relationships and access to larger customer bases, and have major distribution agreements with\nconsultants, system integrators, and resellers. As a result, our competitors may be able to respond more effectively than we can to new or changing opportunities, technologies,\nstandards, customer requirements, competitive pressures, or challenges within the financial markets. Furthermore, because of these advantages, even if our products and\nservices are more effective than the products and services that our competitors offer, potential customers might accept competitive products and services in lieu of purchasing\nour products and services. If we do not compete effectively against our current and future competitors, our operating results could be harmed.\nWe may not be able to increase the number of our strategic relationships or grow the revenues received from our current strategic relationships.\nWe have entered into certain strategic relationships with other individuals and enterprises and are actively seeking additional strategic relationships. There can be no\nassurance, however, that these strategic relationships will result in material revenues for us or that we will be able to generate any other meaningful strategic relationships. If we\nare not able to increase the number of our strategic relationships or grow the revenues received from our current strategic relationships, our operating results could be harmed.\n7\nWe may not be able to develop enhancements and new features to our existing service or acceptable new services that keep pace with technological developments.\nIf we are unable to develop enhancements to, and new features for, our platform that keep pace with rapid technological developments, our business will be harmed.\nThe success of enhancements, new features, and services depends on several factors, including the timely completion, introduction, and market acceptance of the feature or\nedition. Failure in this regard may significantly impair our revenue growth or harm our reputation. We may not be successful in either developing these modifications and\nenhancements or in timely bringing them to market at a competitive price or at all. Furthermore, uncertainties about the timing and nature of new network platforms or\ntechnologies, or modifications to existing platforms or technologies, could increase our research and development expenses. Any failure of our service to operate effectively\nwith future network platforms and technologies could reduce the demand for our service, result in customer dissatisfaction, and harm our business.\nOur ability to deliver our services is dependent on third party Internet providers.\nThe Internet’s infrastructure is comprised of many different networks and services that, by design, are highly fragmented and distributed. This infrastructure is run by a\nseries of independent, third-party organizations that work together to provide the infrastructure and supporting services of the Internet under the governance of the Internet\nCorporation for Assigned Numbers and Names (“ICANN”) and the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (“IANA”), which is now related to ICANN.\nThe Internet has experienced, and will continue to experience, a variety of outages and other delays due to damages to portions of its infrastructure, denial-of-service\nattacks, or related cyber incidents. These scenarios are not under our control and could reduce the availability of the Internet to us or our customers for delivery of our services.\nAny resulting interruptions in our services or the ability of our customers to access our services could result in a loss of potential or existing customers and harm our business.\nSecurity breaches and other disruptions could compromise our information and expose us to liability, which would cause our business and reputation to suffer.\nIn the ordinary course of our business, we collect and store sensitive data, including intellectual property, our proprietary business information, proprietary business\ninformation of our customers, including, credit card and payment information, and personally identifiable information of our customers and employees. The secure processing,\nmaintenance, and transmission of this information is critical to our operations and business strategy.\nIn addition, we are subject to numerous federal, state, provincial and foreign laws regarding privacy and protection of data. Some jurisdictions have enacted laws\nrequiring companies to notify individuals of data security breaches involving certain types of personal data and our agreements with certain customers require us to notify them\nin the event of a security incident. Evolving regulations regarding personal data and personal information, including the General Data Protection Regulation, the California\nConsumer Privacy Act of 2018 (“CCPA”), and the recently passed California Privacy Rights Act, which amends the CCPA and has many provisions that became effective on\nJanuary 1, 2023, especially relating to classification of IP addresses, machine identification, location data and other information, may limit or inhibit our ability to operate or\nexpand our business. Such laws and regulations require or may require us or our customers to implement privacy and security policies, permit consumers to access, correct or\ndelete personal information stored or maintained by us or our customers, inform individuals of security incidents that affect their personal information, and, in some cases,\nobtain consent to use personal information for specified purposes.\nWe believe that we take reasonable steps to protect the security, integrity and confidentiality of the information we collect, use, store, and disclose, and we take steps to\nstrengthen our security protocols and infrastructure, however, our information technology and infrastructure may be vulnerable to attacks by hackers or breached due to\nemployee error, malfeasance, or other disruptions. We also could be negatively impacted by software bugs or other technical malfunctions, as well as employee error or\nmalfeasance. Advanced cyber-attacks can be multi-staged, unfold over time, and utilize a range of attack vectors with military-grade cyber weapons and proven techniques,\nsuch as spear phishing and social engineering, leaving organizations and users at high risk of being compromised. Any such access, disclosure, or other loss of information\ncould result in legal claims or proceedings, liability under laws that protect the privacy of personal information, regulatory penalties, a disruption of our operations, damage to\nour reputation, a loss of confidence in our business, early termination of our contracts and other business losses, indemnification of our customers, liability for stolen assets or\ninformation, increased cybersecurity protection and insurance costs, financial penalties, litigation, regulatory investigations and other significant liabilities, any of which could\nmaterially harm our business any of which could adversely affect our business, revenues, and competitive position.\n8\nOur success depends, in part, on the capacity, reliability, and security of our information technology hardware and software infrastructure, as well as our ability to adapt\nand expand our infrastructure.\nThe capacity, reliability, and security of our information technology hardware and software infrastructure are important to the operation of our current business, which\nwould suffer in the event of system failures. Likewise, our ability to expand and update our information technology infrastructure in response to our growth and changing needs\nis important to the continued implementation of our new service offering initiatives. Our inability to expand or upgrade our technology infrastructure could have adverse\nconsequences, including the delayed provision of services or implementation of new service offerings, and the diversion of development resources. We rely on third parties for\nvarious aspects of our hardware and software infrastructure. Third parties may experience errors or disruptions that could adversely impact us and over which we may have\nlimited control. Interruption and/or failure of any of these systems could disrupt our operations and damage our reputation, thus adversely impacting our ability to provide our\nproducts and services, retain our current users, and attract new users. In addition, our information technology hardware and software infrastructure may be vulnerable to\nunauthorized access, misuse, computer viruses, or other events that could have a security impact. If one or more of such events occur, our customer and other information\nprocessed and stored in, and transmitted through, our information technology hardware and software infrastructure, or otherwise, could be compromised, which could result in\nsignificant losses or reputational damage. We may be required to expend significant additional resources to modify our protective measures or to investigate and remediate\nvulnerabilities or other exposures, and we may be subject to litigation and financial losses, any of which could substantially harm our business and our results of operations.\nWe are dependent on third parties to, among other things, maintain our servers, provide the bandwidth necessary to transmit content, and utilize the content derived\ntherefrom for the potential generation of revenues.\nWe depend on third-party service providers, suppliers, and licensors to supply some of the services, hardware, software, and operational support necessary to provide\nsome of our products and services. Some of these third parties do not have a long operating history or may not be able to continue to supply the equipment and services we\ndesire in the future. If demand exceeds these vendors’ capacity, or if these vendors experience operating or financial difficulties or are otherwise unable to provide the\nequipment or services we need in a timely manner, at our specifications and at reasonable prices, our ability to provide some products and services might be materially\nadversely affected, or the need to procure or develop alternative sources of the affected materials or services might delay our ability to serve our users. These events could\nmaterially and adversely affect our ability to retain and attract users, and have a material negative impact on our operations, business, financial results, and financial condition.\nWe may not be able to find suitable software developers at an acceptable cost or at all.\nWe currently rely on certain key suppliers and vendors in the coding and maintenance of our software. We will continue to require such expertise in the future. Due to\nthe current demand for skilled software developers, we run the risk of not being able to find or retain suitable and qualified personnel at an acceptable price, or at all. These\nrisks may be greater now than in the past due to current general labor shortages in the United States. Without these developers, we may not be able to further develop and\nmaintain our software, which is the most important aspect of our business development.\nThe success of our business is highly correlated to general economic conditions.\nDemand for our products and services is highly correlated with general economic conditions, as a substantial portion of our revenue is derived from discretionary\nspending by individuals, which typically declines during times of economic instability. Declines in economic conditions in the United States or in other countries in which we\noperate and may operate in the future may adversely impact our financial results. Because such declines in demand are difficult to predict, we or our industry may have\nincreased excess capacity as a result. An increase in excess capacity may result in declines in prices for our products and services. Our ability to grow or maintain our business\nmay be adversely affected by sustained economic weakness and uncertainty, including the effect of wavering consumer confidence, high unemployment, and other factors. The\ninability to grow or maintain our business would adversely affect our business, financial conditions, and results of operations, and thereby an investment in our common stock.\n9\nOur failure to adequately protect our intellectual property rights could diminish the value of our products, weaken our competitive position and reduce our revenue, and\ninfringement claims asserted against us or by us, could have a material adverse effect.\nWe regard the protection of our intellectual property, which includes patents, trade secrets, copyrights, trademarks and domain names, as critical to our success. We\nstrive to protect our intellectual property rights by relying on federal, state and common law rights, as well as contractual restrictions. We enter into confidentiality and\ninvention assignment agreements with our employees and contractors, and confidentiality agreements with parties with whom we conduct business in order to limit access to,\nand disclosure and use of, our proprietary information. However, these contractual arrangements and the other steps we have taken to protect our intellectual property may not\nprevent the misappropriation of our proprietary information or deter independent development of similar technologies by others.\nWe have registered domain names and trademarks in the United States and have pursued additional registrations both in and outside the United States. Effective trade\nsecret, copyright, trademark, domain name and patent protection is expensive to develop and maintain, both in terms of initial and ongoing registration requirements and the\ncosts of defending our rights. Notwithstanding our efforts, third parties may independently develop technology that is not covered by our patents, or that is similar to, or\ncompetes with, our technology. In addition, our intellectual property may be infringed or misappropriated by third parties, particularly in foreign countries where the laws and\ngovernmental authorities may not protect our proprietary rights as effectively as those in the United States. We may be required to protect our intellectual property in an\nincreasing number of jurisdictions, a process that is expensive and may not be successful or which we may not pursue in every location.\nMonitoring unauthorized use of our intellectual property is difficult and costly. Our efforts to protect our proprietary rights may not be adequate to prevent\nmisappropriation of our intellectual property. Further, we may not be able to detect unauthorized use of, or take appropriate steps to enforce, our intellectual property rights. In\naddition, our competitors may independently develop similar technology. The laws in the United States and elsewhere change rapidly, and any future changes could adversely\naffect us and our intellectual property. Our failure to meaningfully protect our intellectual property could result in competitors offering services that incorporate our most\ntechnologically advanced features, which could seriously reduce demand for our products. In addition, we may in the future need to initiate infringement claims or litigation.\nLitigation, whether we are a plaintiff or a defendant, can be expensive, time-consuming and may divert the efforts of our technical staff and managerial personnel, which could\nharm our business, whether or not such litigation results in a determination that is unfavorable to us. In addition, litigation is inherently uncertain, and thus we may not be able\nto stop its competitors from infringing upon our intellectual property rights.\n10\nNatural disasters and other events beyond our control could materially adversely affect us.\nNatural disasters or other catastrophic events may cause damage or disruption to our operations, international commerce and the global economy, and thus could have\na strong negative effect on us. Our business operations are subject to interruption by natural disasters, fire, power shortages, pandemics and other events beyond our control.\nAlthough we maintain crisis management and disaster response plans, such events could make it difficult or impossible for us to deliver our services to our customers and could\ndecrease demand for our services.\nOur future success depends on our key executive officers and our ability to attract, retain, and motivate qualified personnel.\nOur future success largely depends upon the continued services of our executive officers and management team, especially our Chief Executive Officer, Chairman of\nour board of directors, and President, Mr. Rory J. Cutaia. If one or more of our executive officers are unable or unwilling to continue in their present positions, we may not be\nable to replace them readily, if at all. Additionally, we may incur additional expenses to recruit and retain new executive officers. If any of our executive officers joins a\ncompetitor or forms a competing company, we may lose some or all of our customers. Finally, we do not maintain “key person” life insurance on any of our executive officers.\nBecause of these factors, the loss of the services of any of these key persons could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations, and thereby an\ninvestment in our stock.\nOur continuing ability to attract and retain highly qualified personnel will also be critical to our success because we will need to hire and retain additional personnel as\nour business grows. There can be no assurance that we will be able to attract or retain highly qualified personnel. We face significant competition for skilled personnel in our\nindustries. This competition may make it more difficult and expensive to attract, hire, and retain qualified managers and employees. Because of these factors, we may not be\nable to effectively manage or grow our business, which could adversely affect our financial condition or business. As a result, the value of your investment could be\nsignificantly reduced or completely lost.\nRisks Related to an Investment in Our Securities\nIf we are not able to comply with the applicable continued listing requirements or standards of The NASDAQ Capital Market, The NASDAQ Capital Market could\ndelist and adversely affect the market price and liquidity of our common stock.\nOur common stock is currently traded on The NASDAQ Capital Market under the symbol “VERB”. We have in the past been, and may in the future be, unable to\ncomply with certain of the listing standards that we are required to meet to maintain the listing of our common stock on The NASDAQ Capital Market. If we fail to meet any of\nthe continued listing standards of The NASDAQ Capital Market, our common stock will be delisted from The NASDAQ Capital Market.\nThese continued listing standards include specifically enumerated criteria, such as a $1.00 minimum closing bid price and a requirement that we maintain\nstockholders’ equity of at least $2,500,000. On November 2, 2023, we received a letter from The NASDAQ Stock Market advising that the Company did not meet the\nminimum $1.00 per share bid price requirement for continued inclusion on The NASDAQ Capital Market pursuant to NASDAQ Marketplace Listing Rule 5550(a)(2). To\ndemonstrate compliance with this requirement, the closing bid price of our common stock needs to be at least $1.00 per share for a minimum of 10 consecutive business days\nbefore April 30, 2024. In order to satisfy this requirement, the Company intends to continue actively monitoring the bid price for its common stock between now and April 30,\n2024 and will consider available options to resolve the deficiency and regain compliance with the minimum bid price requirement, including, but not limited to, seeking an\nadditional six-month extension from The NASDAQ Capital Market to do so.\nWhile we intend to regain compliance with the minimum bid price rule, there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain continued compliance with this rule\nor the other listing requirements of The NASDAQ Capital Market. If we were unable to meet these requirements, we would receive another delisting notice from the Nasdaq\nCapital Market for failure to comply with one or more of the continued listing requirements. If our common stock were to be delisted from The NASDAQ Capital Market,\ntrading of our common stock most likely will be conducted in the over-the-counter market on an electronic bulletin board established for unlisted securities such as the OTC\nMarkets or in the “pink sheets.” Such a downgrading in our listing market may limit our ability to make a market in our common stock and which may impact purchases or\nsales of our securities.\n11\nRaising additional capital, including through future sales and issuances of our common stock, warrants or the exercise of rights to purchase common stock pursuant to\nour equity incentive plan could result in additional dilution of the percentage ownership of our stockholders, could cause our share price to fall and could restrict our\noperations.\nWe expect we will need significant additional capital in the future to continue our planned operations, including any potential acquisitions, hiring new personnel and\ncontinuing activities as an operating public company. To the extent we seek additional capital through a combination of public and private equity offerings and debt financings,\nour stockholders may experience substantial dilution. To the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, the ownership\ninterest of our existing stockholders may be diluted, and the terms may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect the rights of our stockholders. Debt and\nreceivables financings may be coupled with an equity component, such as warrants to purchase shares of our common stock, which could also result in dilution of our existing\nstockholders’ ownership. The incurrence of indebtedness would result in increased fixed payment obligations and could also result in certain restrictive covenants, such as\nlimitations on our ability to incur additional debt and other operating restrictions that could adversely impact our ability to conduct our business. A failure to obtain adequate\nfunds may cause us to curtail certain operational activities, including sales and marketing, in order to reduce costs and sustain the business, and would have a material adverse\neffect on our business and financial condition.\nIn addition, we have granted options to purchase shares of our common stock pursuant to our equity incentive plans and have registered 16,000,000 shares of common\nstock underlying options and shares granted pursuant to our equity incentive plans. Sales of shares issued upon exercise of options granted under our equity compensation plans\nmay result in material dilution to our existing stockholders, which could cause our price of our common stock to fall.\nOur issuance of additional shares of preferred stock could adversely affect the market value of our common stock, dilute the voting power of common stockholders and\ndelay or prevent a change of control.\nOur board of directors have the authority to cause us to issue, without any further vote or action by the stockholders, shares of preferred stock in one or more series, to\ndesignate the number of shares constituting any series, and to fix the rights, preferences, privileges and restrictions thereof, including dividend rights, voting rights, rights and\nterms of redemption, redemption price or prices and liquidation preferences of such series.\nThe issuance of shares of preferred stock with dividend or conversion rights, liquidation preferences or other economic terms favorable to the holders of preferred\nstock could adversely affect the market price for our common stock by making an investment in the common stock less attractive. For example, investors in the common stock\nmay not wish to purchase common stock at a price above the conversion price of a series of convertible preferred stock because the holders of the preferred stock would\neffectively be entitled to purchase common stock at the lower conversion price causing economic dilution to the holders of common stock.\nFurther, the issuance of shares of preferred stock with voting rights may adversely affect the voting power of the holders of our other classes of voting stock either by\ndiluting the voting power of our other classes of voting stock if they vote together as a single class, or by giving the holders of any such preferred stock the right to block an\naction on which they have a separate class vote even if the action were approved by the holders of our other classes of voting stock. The issuance of shares of preferred stock\nmay also have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a change in control of our company without further action by the stockholders, even where stockholders are\noffered a premium for their shares.\nThe market price of our common stock has been, and may continue to be, subject to substantial volatility.\nThe market price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly in response to numerous factors, many of which are beyond our control, including;\n● volatility in the trading markets generally and in our particular market segment;\n● limited trading of our common stock;\n12\n● actual or anticipated fluctuations in our results of operations;\n● the financial projections we may provide to the public, any changes in those projections, or our failure to meet those projections;\n● announcements regarding our business or the business of our customers or competitors;\n● changes in accounting standards, policies, guidelines, interpretations, or principles;\n● actual or anticipated developments in our business or our competitors’ businesses or the competitive landscape generally;\n● developments or disputes concerning our intellectual property or our offerings, or third-party proprietary rights;\n● announced or completed acquisitions of businesses or technologies by us or our competitors;\n● new laws or regulations or new interpretations of existing laws or regulations applicable to our business;\n● any major change in our board of directors or management;\n● sales of shares of our common stock by us or by our stockholders;\n● lawsuits threatened or filed against us; and\n● other events or factors, including those resulting from war, incidents of terrorism, pandemics (such as the COVID-19 pandemic) or responses to these events.\nStatements of, or changes in, opinions, ratings, or earnings estimates made by brokerage firms or industry analysts relating to the markets in which we operate or\nexpect to operate could have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock. In addition, the stock market as a whole, as well as our particular market segment, has\nfrom time-to-time experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations, which may affect the market price for the securities of many companies, and which often have appeared\nunrelated to the operating performance of such companies. Any of these factors could negatively affect our stockholders’ ability to sell their shares of common stock at the time\nand price they desire.\nA decline in the price of our common stock could affect our ability to raise further working capital, which could adversely impact our ability to continue operations.\nA prolonged decline in the price of our common stock could result in a reduction in the liquidity of our common stock and a reduction in our ability to raise capital. We\nmay attempt to acquire a significant portion of the funds we need in order to conduct our planned operations through the sale of equity securities; thus, a decline in the price of\nour common stock could be detrimental to our liquidity and our operations because the decline may adversely affect investors’ desire to invest in our securities. If we are unable\nto raise the funds we require for all of our planned operations, we may be forced to reallocate funds from other planned uses and may suffer a significant negative effect on our\nbusiness plan and operations, including our ability to develop new products or services and continue our current operations. As a result, our business may suffer, and we may be\nforced to reduce or discontinue operations. We also might not be able to meet our financial obligations if we cannot raise enough funds through the sale of our common stock\nand we may be forced to reduce or discontinue operations.\n13\nBecause we do not intend to pay any cash dividends on our shares of common stock in the near future, our stockholders will not be able to receive a return on their shares\nunless and until they sell them.\nWe intend to retain a significant portion of any future earnings to finance the development, operation and expansion of our business. We do not anticipate paying any\ncash dividends on our common stock in the near future. The declaration, payment, and amount of any future dividends will be made at the discretion of our board of directors,\nand will depend upon, among other things, the results of operations, cash flows, and financial condition, operating and capital requirements, and other factors as our board of\ndirectors considers relevant. There is no assurance that future dividends will be paid, and, if dividends are paid, there is no assurance with respect to the amount of any such\ndividend. Unless our board of directors determines to pay dividends, our stockholders will be required to look to appreciation of our common stock to realize a gain on their\ninvestment. There can be no assurance that this appreciation will occur.\nOur common stock has been categorized as “penny stock,” which may make it more difficult for investors to sell their shares of common stock due to suitability\nrequirements.\nThe SEC has adopted regulations which generally define a “penny stock” to be any equity security that has a market price (as defined) less than $5.00 per share or an\nexercise price of less than $5.00 per share, subject to certain exceptions. Our securities are covered by the penny stock rules, which impose additional sales practice\nrequirements on broker-dealers who sell to persons other than established customers and “accredited investors”. The term “accredited investor” refers generally to institutions\nwith assets in excess of $5,000,000 or individuals with a net worth in excess of $1,000,000 or annual income exceeding $200,000 or $300,000 jointly with their spouse. The\npenny stock rules require a broker-dealer, prior to a transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from the rules, to deliver a standardized risk disclosure document in a\nform prepared by the SEC that provides information about penny stocks and the nature and level of risks in the penny stock market. The broker-dealer also must provide the\ncustomer with current bid and offer quotations for the penny stock, the compensation of the broker-dealer and its salesperson in the transaction and monthly account statements\nshowing the market value of each penny stock held in the customer’s account. The bid and offer quotations, and the broker-dealer and salesperson compensation information,\nmust be given to the customer orally or in writing prior to effecting the transaction and must be given to the customer in writing before or with the customer’s confirmation. In\naddition, the penny stock rules require that prior to a transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from these rules, the broker-dealer must make a special written\ndetermination that the penny stock is a suitable investment for the purchaser and receive the purchaser’s written agreement to the transaction. These disclosure requirements\nmay have the effect of reducing the level of trading activity in the secondary market for the stock that is subject to these penny stock rules. Consequently, these penny stock\nrules may affect the ability of broker-dealers to trade our securities. We believe that the penny stock rules discourage investor interest in and limit the marketability of our\ncommon stock.\nThe Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, Inc. has adopted sales practice requirements that historically may have limited a stockholder’s ability to buy and sell our\ncommon stock, which could depress the price of our common stock.\nIn addition to the “penny stock” rules described above, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (“FINRA”) has adopted rules that require that, in recommending\nan investment to a customer, a broker-dealer must have reasonable grounds for believing that the investment is suitable for that customer. Prior to recommending speculative\nlow-priced securities to their non-institutional customers, broker-dealers must make reasonable efforts to obtain information about the customer’s financial status, tax status,\ninvestment objectives, and other information. Under interpretations of these rules, FINRA believes that there is a high probability that speculative low-priced securities will not\nbe suitable for at least some customers. Thus, the FINRA requirements historically has made it more difficult for broker-dealers to recommend that their customers buy our\ncommon stock, which could limit your ability to buy and sell our common stock, have an adverse effect on the market for our shares, and thereby depress our price per share of\ncommon stock.\nThe elimination of monetary liability against our directors, officers, and employees under Nevada law and the existence of indemnification rights for our obligations to our\ndirectors, officers, and employees may result in substantial expenditures by us and may discourage lawsuits against our directors, officers, and employees.\nOur articles of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions permitting us to eliminate the personal liability of our directors and officers to us and our stockholders for\ndamages for the breach of a fiduciary duty as a director or officer to the extent provided by Nevada law. In addition, we have entered into indemnification agreements with our\ndirectors and officers to provide such indemnification rights. We may also have contractual indemnification obligations under any future employment agreements with our\nofficers. The foregoing indemnification obligations could result in us incurring substantial expenditures to cover the cost of settlement or damage awards against directors and\nofficers, which we may be unable to recoup. These provisions and the resulting costs may also discourage us from bringing a lawsuit against directors and officers for breaches\nof their fiduciary duties and may similarly discourage the filing of derivative litigation by our stockholders against our directors and officers even though such actions, if\nsuccessful, might otherwise benefit us and our stockholders.\n14\nAnti-takeover effects of certain provisions of Nevada state law hinder a potential takeover of us.\nNevada has a business combination law that prohibits certain business combinations between Nevada corporations and “interested stockholders” for three years after\nan “interested stockholder” first becomes an “interested stockholder,” unless the corporation’s board of directors approves the combination in advance. For purposes of Nevada\nlaw, an “interested stockholder” is any person who is (i) the beneficial owner, directly or indirectly, of ten percent or more of the voting power of the outstanding voting shares\nof the corporation or (ii) an affiliate or associate of the corporation and at any time within the three previous years was the beneficial owner, directly or indirectly, of ten percent\nor more of the voting power of the then-outstanding shares of the corporation. The definition of the term “business combination” is sufficiently broad to cover virtually any\nkind of transaction that would allow a potential acquirer to use the corporation’s assets to finance the acquisition or otherwise to benefit its own interests rather than the interests\nof the corporation and its other stockholders.\nThe potential effect of Nevada’s business combination law is to discourage parties interested in taking control of us from doing so if these parties cannot obtain the\napproval of our board of directors. Both of these provisions could limit the price investors would be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock.\nOur bylaws contain an exclusive forum provision, which could limit our stockholders’ ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors,\nofficers, employees or agents.\nOur bylaws provide that, unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the state and federal courts in the State of Nevada shall be the exclusive\nforum for any litigation relating to our internal affairs, including, without limitation: (a) any derivative action brought on behalf of us, (b) any action asserting a claim for breach\nof fiduciary duty to us or our stockholders by any current or former officer, director, employee, or agent of us, or (c) any action against us or any current or former officer,\ndirector, employee, or agent of us arising pursuant to any provision of the Nevada Revised Statutes, the articles of incorporation, or the bylaws.\nFor the avoidance of doubt, the exclusive forum provision described above does not apply to any claims arising under the Securities Act or Exchange Act. Section 27\nof the Exchange Act creates exclusive federal jurisdiction over all suits brought to enforce any duty or liability created by the Exchange Act or the rules and regulations\nthereunder, and Section 22 of the Securities Act creates concurrent jurisdiction for federal and state courts over all suits brought to enforce any duty or liability created by the\nSecurities Act or the rules and regulations thereunder.\nThe choice of forum provision in our bylaws may limit our stockholders’ ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that they find favorable for disputes with us or our\ndirectors, officers, employees or agents, which may discourage such lawsuits against us and our directors, officers, employees and agents even though an action, if successful,\nmight benefit our stockholders. The applicable courts may also reach different judgments or results than would other courts, including courts where a stockholder considering\nan action may be located or would otherwise choose to bring the action, and such judgments or results may be more favorable to us than to our stockholders. With respect to the\nprovision making the state and federal courts in the State of Nevada the sole and exclusive forum for certain types of actions, stockholders who do bring a claim in the state and\nfederal courts in the State of Nevada could face additional litigation costs in pursuing any such claim, particularly if they do not reside in or near Nevada. Finally, if a court\nwere to find this provision of our bylaws inapplicable to, or unenforceable in respect of, one or more of the specified types of actions or proceedings, we may incur additional\ncosts associated with resolving such matters in other jurisdictions, which could have a material adverse effect on us.\nIf we fail to maintain effective internal controls over financial reporting, we may be unable to accurately or timely report our financial condition or results of operations,\nwhich may adversely affect our business.\nAs a public company, we have significant requirements for enhanced financial reporting and internal controls, and must maintain internal controls over financial\nreporting to satisfy the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. The process of designing, implementing and maintaining effective internal controls is a\ncontinuous effort that require us to anticipate and react to changes in our business and the economic and regulatory environments. In this regard, we continue to dedicate\ninternal resources, potentially engage outside consultants, implement a detailed work plan to assess and document the adequacy of internal control over financial reporting,\ncontinue steps to improve control processes as appropriate, validate through testing whether such controls are functioning as documented, and implement a continuous reporting\nand improvement process for internal control over financial reporting. If we are unable to maintain appropriate disclose controls or internal controls and procedures over\nfinancial reporting, it could cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations on a timely basis, result in material misstatements in our consolidated financial statements and\nadversely affect our operating results.\nITEM 1B.

CYBERSECURITY\nRisk Management and Strategy\nWe recognize the critical importance of developing, implementing, and maintaining robust cybersecurity measures to safeguard our information systems and protect\nthe confidentiality, integrity, and availability of our data.\nManaging Material Risks & Integrated Overall Risk Management\nWe have strategically integrated cybersecurity risk management into our broader risk management framework to promote a company-wide culture of cybersecurity\nrisk management. This integration ensures that cybersecurity considerations are an integral part of our decision-making processes at every level. Our management team works\nclosely with our IT department to continuously evaluate and address cybersecurity risks in alignment with our business objectives and operational needs.\nOversee Third-party Risk\nBecause we are aware of the risks associated with third-party service providers, we have implemented stringent processes to oversee and manage these risks. We\nconduct thorough security assessments of all third-party providers before engagement and maintain ongoing monitoring to ensure compliance with our cybersecurity standards.\nThe monitoring includes annual assessments of the SOC reports of our providers and implementing complementary controls. This approach is designed to mitigate risks related\nto data breaches or other security incidents originating from third-parties.\nRisks from Cybersecurity Threats\nWe have not encountered cybersecurity challenges that have materially impaired our operations or financial standing.\nITEM 2. PROPERTIES\nOur corporate headquarters are located at 3024 Sierra Juniper Court, Las Vegas, Nevada 89138.

MARKET FOR REGISTRANT’S COMMON EQUITY, RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS AND ISSUER PURCHASES OF EQUITY\nSECURITIES\nMarket Information\nOur common stock trades on The Nasdaq Capital Market under the symbol “VERB.”\nHolders of Common Stock\nAs of March 28, 2024, there were approximately 81 holders of record of our common stock. These holders of record include depositories that hold shares of stock for\nbrokerage firms which, in turn, hold shares of stock for numerous beneficial owners.\nDividends\nWe have never declared or paid dividends. We do not intend to pay cash dividends on our common stock for the foreseeable future, but currently intend to retain any\nfuture earnings to fund the development and growth of our business. The payment of dividends, if any, on our common stock will rest solely within the discretion of our board\nof directors and will depend, among other things, upon our earnings, capital requirements, financial condition, and other relevant factors. Pursuant to a Securities Purchase\nAgreement we entered into on January 12, 2022 with three institutional investors, which we disclosed on a Form 8-K filed with the SEC on January 13, 2022, we were\nprohibited from declaring or paying a cash dividend or distribution on any of our common stock. On January 26, 2023, the Company repaid in full all of the outstanding\nobligations associated with the securities purchase agreement at which time the prohibition against the declaration or paying of a dividend was extinguished.\nRecent Sales of Unregistered Securities\nDuring our fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, all sales of equity securities that were not registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, were previously\nreported in a Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q or in a Current Report on Form 8-K.\n16\nPurchases of Equity Securities by the Issuer and Affiliated Purchasers\nNone.\nITEM 6. [RESERVED]\nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following discussion and analysis of our results of operations and financial condition for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, should be read in\nconjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes and the other financial information that are included elsewhere in this Annual Report. This\ndiscussion includes forward-looking statements based upon current expectations that involve risks and uncertainties, such as our plans, objectives, expectations, and intentions.\nThe following discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties such as our plans, estimates, and beliefs. Our actual results could differ\nmaterially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements below. Factors that could cause or contribute to those differences in our actual results include, but are not\nlimited to, those discussed below and those discussed elsewhere within this Annual Report, particularly in the section entitled “Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking\nStatements” and the Item entitled “Risk Factors.”\nOverview\nThrough June 13, 2023 of the year ended December 31, 2023, we operated three distinct lines of business through separate wholly owned subsidiaries. Verb Direct,\nLLC, a sales Software-as-a-Service (“SaaS”) platform for the direct sales industry; Verb Acquisition Co., LLC, which was a sales SaaS platform for the Life Sciences industry\nand sports teams; and verbMarketplace, LLC, which is a multi-vendor, multi-presenter, livestream social shopping platform known as MARKET.live that combines ecommerce\nand entertainment.\nWe determined that by focusing all of our resources solely on the development and operation of MARKET.live, our livestream shopping platform, over time we could\ngenerate greater shareholder value than we could through the continued operation of our SaaS business platforms. Accordingly, after an extensive, thorough seven-month\nprocess to identify a buyer willing to pay the highest price on the most favorable terms for the assets of the SaaS business, managed by a prominent M&A advisory firm, on\nJune 13, 2023 we disposed of all of the operating SaaS assets of Verb Direct, LLC and Verb Acquisition Co., LLC pursuant to an asset purchase agreement in consideration of\nthe sum of $6.5 million, $4.75 million of which was paid in cash by the buyer at the closing of the transaction.\nAdditional payments in the aggregate of $1.75 million will be paid by the buyer if certain profitability and revenue targets are met within each of the two-year periods\nfollowing the closing date as set forth more particularly in the asset purchase agreement. During the seven-month period of the sales process, virtually all of our resources were\ndedicated to facilitating the sale process and all operating budgets were suspended, including sales and marketing budgets for MARKET.live, in order to preserve cash and\nminimize reliance on the capital markets until the asset sale process was complete.\n17\nOur MARKET.live Business\nThe Company’s MARKET.live platform is a multi-vendor, multi-presenter, livestream social shopping destination the leverages the current convergence of ecommerce\nand entertainment, where hundreds of retailers, brands, creators and influencers can monetize their base of fans and followers across social media channels. Brands, retailers\nand creators that join MARKET.live have the ability to broadcast livestream shopping events simultaneously on numerous social media channels, including TikTok, as well as\non MARKET.live, reaching exponentially larger audiences. The Company’s recent technological integrations with META, created a seamless, native, friction-free checkout\nprocess for Facebook and Instagram users to purchase MARKET.live vendors’ products within each of those popular apps. This integration allows Facebook and Instagram\nusers to browse products featured in MARKET.live shoppable videos, place products in a native shopping cart and checkout – all without leaving Facebook or Instagram.\nOn September 5, 2023, the Company completed development work on a new MARKET.live capability that facilitated a deeper integration into the TikTok social\nmedia platform, which could expose MARKET.live shoppable programming to tens of millions of potential viewers/purchasers. This new capability allows shoppers watching\na MARKET.live stream on TikTok to stay on that site and check out through that site, eliminating the friction or reluctance of TikTok users to leave their TikTok feed in order\nto complete their purchase on MARKET.live. Our technology integration allows the purchase data to flow back through MARKET.live and to the individual vendors and stores\non MARKET.live seamlessly for fulfillment of the orders.\nOn March 27, 2024, the Company announced that it expanded its strategic relationship with TikTok and entered into a formal partnership with TikTok Shop pursuant\nto which MARKET.live became a service provider for TikTok Shop and officially designated as a TikTok Shop Partner (TSP) . Under the terms of the partnership, TikTok Shop\nrefers consumer brands, retailers, influencers and affiliates leads to Market.live for a menu of MARKET.live paid services that include, among other things, assistance in\nonboarding to TikTok and establishing a TikTok store, hosting training sessions and webinars for prospective TikTok Shop sellers, studio space rental in both the West Coast\nand East Coast MARKET.live studios, content creation and production services, and TikTok Shop maintenance and enhancements for existing TikTok clients’ stores. The\npartnership also contemplates TikTok Shop sponsored studio rentals, as well as a paid-for “day pass” for use of MARKET.live studio services by TikTok creators, influencers\nand affiliates. MARKET.live is expected to generate revenue through fees, including monthly recurring fees, paid directly to MARKET.live by the brands, retailers, influencers\nand affiliates referred to MARKET.live by TikTok. In addition, it is contemplated that MARKET.live will receive a percentage of monthly revenue generated through the\nTikTok stores MARKET.live establishes for the brands, retailers, influencers and affiliates that TikTok Shop refers to MARKET.live.\nThe partnership also contemplates the use of MARKET.live studios as TikTok “Sample Centers” where TikTok creators will have access to product samples for use in\ntheir TikTok Shop videos produced at MARKET.live studios. In addition to the compensation referenced above, TikTok will compensate MARKET.live directly for the\nattainment of certain pre-established performance goals and objectives agreed-to between the parties.\nThe Company’s recent drop ship and affiliate programs are currently being revised to incorporate the benefits and implications of the recent META integrations as well\nas the new TikTok partnership. The Company is actively engaged in completing development on integrations into additional large social media platforms, as well as developing\npartnerships and strategic alliances that it believes will help foster the growth of the Company’s business.\n18\nRevenue Generation\nA description of our principal revenue generating activities is as follows:\nMARKET.live generates revenue through several sources as follows:\na. All sales run through our ecommerce facility on MARKET.live from which we deduct a platform fee that ranges from 10% to 20% of gross sales, with an average\nof approximately 15%, depending upon the pricing package the vendors select as well as the product category and profit margins associated with such categories.\nThe revenue is derived from sales generated during livestream events, from sales realized through views of previously recorded live events available in each\nvendor’s store, as well as from sales of product and merchandise displayed in the vendors’ online stores, all of which are shoppable 24/7.\nb. Produced events. MARKET.live offers fee-based services that range from full production of livestream events, to providing professional hosts and event\nconsulting.\nc. Drop Ship and Creator programs. MARKET.live is expected to generate recurring fee revenue from soon to be launched new drop ship programs for entrepreneurs\nand its Creator program.\nd. The Company’s recently launched TikTok store and affiliate program.\ne. The MARKET.live site is designed to incorporate sponsorships and other advertising based on typical industry rates.\nA performance obligation is a promise in a contract to transfer a distinct product. Performance obligations promised in a contract are identified based on the goods that\nwill be transferred that are both capable of being distinct and are distinct in the context of the contract, whereby the transfer of the goods is separately identifiable from other\npromises in the contract. Performance obligations include establishing and maintaining customer online stores, providing access to the Company’s e-commerce platform and\ncustomer service support.\nThe Company’s revenue is mainly commission fees derived from contractually committed gross revenue processed by customers on the Company’s e-commerce\nplatform as well as subscription-based fees and other fees and commissions for services rendered by the Company to clients referred to the Company by TikTok. Customers do\nnot have the contractual right to take possession of the Company’s software. Revenue is recognized in an amount that reflects the consideration that the Company expects to\nultimately receive in exchange for those promised goods, net of expected discounts for sales promotions and customary allowances.\nRevenue is recognized on a net basis from maintaining e-commerce platforms and online orders, as the Company is engaged primarily in an agency relationship with\nits customers and earns defined amounts based on the individual contractual terms for the customer and the Company does not take possession of the customers’ inventory or\nany credit risks relating to the products sold.\nSales taxes collected from customers and remitted to governmental authorities are accounted for on a net basis and, therefore, are excluded from net sales in the\nconsolidated statements of operations.\nEconomic Disruption\nOur business is dependent in part on general economic conditions. Many jurisdictions in which our customers are located and our products are sold have experienced\nand could continue to experience unfavorable general economic conditions, such as inflation, increased interest rates and recessionary concerns, which could negatively affect\ndemand for our products. Under difficult economic conditions, customers may seek to cease spending on our current products or fail to adopt our new products. We cannot\npredict the timing or impact of an economic slowdown, or the timing or strength of any economic recovery. These and other economic factors could have a material adverse\neffect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nRecent Developments\nNasdaq Deficiency Notices\nAugust 18, 2023 Notice\nOn August 18, 2023, the Company received a notice from The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC (“NASDAQ”) indicating that it did not meet the minimum of $2.5 million in\nstockholders’ equity required by NASDAQ Listing Rule 5550(b)(1) (the “Listing Rule”) for continued listing, or the alternatives of market value of listed securities or net\nincome from continuing operations. The notice was based upon the Company’s Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended June 30, 2023, which reported\nthat the Company’s total stockholders’ equity as of June 30, 2023 was ($1.818 million).On October 9, 2023, the Company submitted a plan to regain compliance with the\nListing Rule and was given an extension until February 14, 2024 to evidence compliance through a public filing.\nOn February 5, 2024, the Company reported in a Current Report on Form 8-K (the “Form 8-K Filing”) that based on its unaudited balance sheet as of December 31,\n2023, it believed it had regained compliance with the stockholders’ equity requirement of NASDAQ Listing Rule 5550(b)(1) for continued listing. On February 5, 2024, the\nCompany was informed that based upon the Form 8-K Filing, the Staff determined that the Company is in compliance with Listing Rule 550(b)(1).\n19\nNovember 2, 2023 Notice\nOn November 2, 2023, we received a letter from The NASDAQ Stock Market advising that the Company did not meet the minimum $1.00 per share bid price\nrequirement for continued inclusion on The NASDAQ Capital Market pursuant to NASDAQ Marketplace Listing Rule 5550(a)(2). To demonstrate compliance with this\nrequirement, the closing bid price of our common stock needs to be at least $1.00 per share for a minimum of 10 consecutive business days before April 30, 2024. In order to\nsatisfy this requirement, the Company intends to continue actively monitoring the bid price for its common stock between now and April 30, 2024, and will consider available\noptions to resolve the deficiency and regain compliance with the minimum bid price requirement, including, but not limited to seeking a six-month extension from The\nNASDAQ Stock Market in which to regain compliance.\nSeries C Preferred Stock Offering\nOn December 29, 2023, the Company entered into a securities purchase agreement with Streeterville Capital, LLC (the “Streeterville Purchase Agreement”), pursuant\nto which the Company sold 3,000 shares of the Company’s newly designated non-convertible Series C Preferred Stock for proceeds of $3.0 million. The Series C Preferred\nStock receives a 10% stated annual dividend, has no voting rights and has a face value of $1,300 per share. The sale of the Series C Preferred Stock was consummated on\nDecember 29, 2023.\nATM Offerings\nOn December 15, 2023, the Company entered into an At-the-Market Issuance Sales Agreement (the “Ascendiant Sales Agreement”) with Ascendiant Capital Markets,\nLLC, as sales agent, to sell, from time to time, shares of its common stock having an aggregate offering price of up to $960 thousand, through an “at the market” offering\npursuant to the Company’s Registration Statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-264038), as supplemented by a prospectus supplement. On March 19, 2024, the Ascendiant Sales\nAgreement was amended to increase the amount available from $960 thousand to approximately $6.3 million. On March 29, 2024, the Ascendiant Sales Agreement was\namended to increase the amount available from approximately $6.3 million to approximately $9.0 million. From December 15, 2023 to March 27, 2024, the Company issued\n19,870,562 shares of its common stock and received $6.1 million of aggregate net proceeds in “at the market” offerings under the Ascendiant Sales Agreement.\nOn December 15, 2023, the Company terminated its At-The Market Issuance Sales Agreement, dated as of November 16, 2021, by and between the Company and\nTruist Securities, Inc. (the “Truist Sales Agreement”). During the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company issued and sold an aggregate of 8,784,214 shares of common\nstock for aggregate net proceeds of $2.6 million under the Truist Sales Agreement.\nPublic Offering of Common Stock – Regulation A\nSubsequent to December 31, 2023, the Company entered into subscription agreements with certain institutional investors, pursuant to which the Company agreed to\nissue and sell to the investors 27,397,258 shares of its Common Stock, par value $0.0001 per share of the Company at a price of $0.24 per share for gross proceeds to the\nCompany of $6.6 million.\nThe Shares to be issued in the offering were offered at-the-market under Nasdaq rules and pursuant to the Company’s Form 1-A, initially filed by the Company with\nthe Securities and Exchange Commission under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, on February 14, 2024 and qualified on March 11, 2024.\nDebt Financing\nOn October 11, 2023, the Company entered into a note purchase agreement with Streeterville Capital, LLC, pursuant to which the Company sold a promissory note in\nthe aggregate principal amount of $1.0 million (the “Note”).

Amortization of software development costs began in July 2022.\nGeneral and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2023 were $11.5 million, as compared to $17.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2022.\nThe decrease of $6.3 million or 35%, in general and administrative expenses is primarily due to decreased personnel expense associated with headcount reduction.\nOther Income (Expense), net\nOther income (expense), net, for the year ended December 31, 2023 was $(1.0) million, which was primarily attributable to interest expense of $(1.2) million and\nfinancing costs of $(1.2) million both offset by other income and the change in fair value of derivative liability totaling $1.4 million.\nUse of Non-GAAP Measures – Modified EBITDA\nIn addition to our results under generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”), we present Modified EBITDA as a supplemental measure of our performance.\nHowever, Modified EBITDA is not a recognized measurement under GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to net income, income from operations or any other\nperformance measure derived in accordance with GAAP or as an alternative to cash flow from operating activities as a measure of liquidity. We define Modified EBITDA as\nnet income (loss), plus depreciation and amortization, share-based compensation, interest expense, financing costs, change in fair value of derivative liability, other (income)\nexpense, MARKET.live startup costs, loss from discontinued operations, net of tax, and other non-recurring charges.\nManagement considers our core operating performance to be that which our managers can affect in any particular period through their management of the resources\nthat impact our underlying revenue and profit generating operations that period. Non-GAAP adjustments to our results prepared in accordance with GAAP are itemized below.\nYou are encouraged to evaluate these adjustments and the reasons we consider them appropriate for supplemental analysis. In evaluating Modified EBITDA, you should be\naware that in the future we may incur expenses that are the same as or similar to some of the adjustments in this presentation. Our presentation of Modified EBITDA should not\nbe construed as an inference that our future results will be unaffected by unusual or non-recurring items.\nYears Ended December 31,\n2023 2022\nNet loss $ (21,994) $ (37,437)\nAdjustments\nDepreciation and amortization 2,331 1,108\nShare-based compensation 2,503 4,455\nInterest expense 1,193 1,410\nFinancing costs 1,239 -\nOther income, net (1,162) (1,393)\nChange in fair value of derivative liability (221) (2,933)\nMARKET.live non-recurring startup costs* - 802\nLoss from discontinued operations, net of tax 7,150 21,479\nOther non-recurring 585 126\nTotal EBITDA adjustments 13,618 25,054\nModified EBITDA $ (8,376) $ (12,383)\n* Includes general and administrative and R&D expenses that are directly related to the launch of our MARKET.live platform and are not expected to be recurring in future\nperiods.\nThe $4.0 million or 32% increase in Modified EBITDA for the year ended December 31, 2023, compared to the same period in 2022, resulted from a decrease in\noperating expenses.\nWe present Modified EBITDA because we believe it assists investors and analysts in comparing our performance across reporting periods on a consistent basis by\nexcluding items that we do not believe are indicative of our core operating performance. In addition, we use Modified EBITDA in developing our internal budgets, forecasts\nand strategic plan; in analyzing the effectiveness of our business strategies in evaluating potential acquisitions; and in making compensation decisions and in communications\nwith our board of directors concerning our financial performance. Modified EBITDA has limitations as an analytical tool, which includes, among others, the following:\n● Modified EBITDA does not reflect our cash expenditures, or future requirements, for capital expenditures or contractual commitments;\n● Modified EBITDA does not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs;\n● Modified EBITDA does not reflect future interest expense, or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments, on our debts; and\n● Although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized will often have to be replaced in the future, and Modified\nEBITDA does not reflect any cash requirements for such replacements.\n22\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nGoing Concern and Management’s Plan\nWe have incurred operating losses and negative cash flows from operations since inception. During the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, we incurred a net loss\nfrom continuing operations of $14.8 million and used cash in operating activities from continuing operations of $8.7 million. As of December 31, 2023, the aforementioned\nfactors raised substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the date these financial statements were issued. Our continuation as a\ngoing concern is dependent on our ability to obtain additional financing until we can generate sufficient cash flows from operations to meet our obligations. We intend to\ncontinue to seek additional debt or equity financing, as well as certain strategic opportunities to continue our operations.\nEquity financing:\nOn January 24, 2023, we entered into an underwriting agreement (the “Underwriting Agreement”) with Aegis Capital Corp. (“Aegis”) as underwriter (the\n“Underwriter”), relating to the offering, issuance and sale of 901,275 shares of our common stock at a public offering price of $8.00 per share. The net proceeds to us were\napproximately $6.6 million, after deducting discounts, commissions and estimated offering expenses. Aegis acted as the sole underwriter for the offering and received 6% of the\ngross proceeds as commission for the offering. They were also reimbursed by us for certain expenses, in an amount of up to $75 thousand, including legal fees. As a result of\nthis transaction, certain warrants which previously had an exercise price of $13.60 per share, had the exercise price reduced to $8.00 per share.\nDuring September 2023, the Company restarted its at-the-market (“ATM”) issuance sales agreements with Truist Securities, Inc. (“Truist”) pursuant to the Company’s\nRegistration Statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-252167). For the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company has issued 8,784,214 shares of the Company’s common stock\nsince the restart of this agreement, resulting in net proceeds of $2.6 million. The agreement with Truist was terminated on December 15, 2023.\nDuring December 2023, the Company entered into an agreement with Ascendiant Capital Markets LLC to sell shares of its common stock pursuant to the Company’s\nRegistration Statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-264038). For the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company has issued 687,304 shares of the Company’s common stock\nunder this agreement, resulting in net proceeds of $0.1 million.\nSubsequent to December 31, 2023, the Company issued 19,183,258 shares of the Company’s common stock under this agreement, resulting in net proceeds of $6.0\nmillion.\nOn December 29, 2023, the Company entered into a securities purchase agreement (the “Securities Purchase Agreement”) with Streeterville Capital, LLC\n(“Streeterville”), pursuant to which the Company sold and Streeterville purchased 3,000 shares of the Company’s newly designated non-convertible Series C Preferred Stock\n(the “Series C Shares”) for a total purchase price of $3.0 million. The Shares have a 10% stated annual dividend, no voting rights and has a face value of $1,300 per share. The\nsale of the Series C Shares was consummated on December 29, 2023.\nSubsequent to December 31, 2023, the Company entered into subscription agreements with certain institutional investors, pursuant to which the Company agreed to\nissue and sell to the investors 27,397,258 shares of its Common Stock, par value $0.0001 per share of the Company at a price of $0.24 per share for gross proceeds to the\nCompany of $6.6 million. No warrants were issued in connection with the transaction and no banker fees or expenses were incurred.\nThe Shares to be issued in the offering were offered at-the-market under Nasdaq rules and pursuant to the Company’s Form 1-A, initially filed by the Company with\nthe Securities and Exchange Commission under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, on February 14, 2024 and qualified on March 11, 2024.\n23\nDebt financing:\nOn November 7, 2022, we entered into a note purchase agreement (the “November Note Purchase Agreement”) and promissory note with Streeterville providing for\nthe sale and issuance of an unsecured, non-convertible promissory in the original principal amount of $5.5 million, which has an original issue discount of $0.5 million,\nresulting in gross proceeds to us of approximately $5.0 million (the “November Note,” and such financing, the “November Note Offering”). The November Note matures\neighteen months following the date of issuance. Commencing six months from the date of issuance, we are required to make monthly cash redemption payments in an amount\nnot to exceed $0.6 million. The November Note may be repaid in whole or in part prior to the maturity date for a 10% premium. The November Note requires us to use 20% of\nthe gross proceeds raised from future equity or debt financings, or the sale of any subsidiary or material asset, to prepay the November Note, subject to a cap on the aggregate\nprepayment amount. Until all obligations under the November Note have been paid in full, we are not permitted to grant a security interest in any of its assets, or to issue\nsecurities convertible into shares of common stock, subject in each case to certain exceptions. Our wholly owned subsidiary verbMarketplace, LLC entered into a guaranty,\ndated November 7, 2022, in connection with the November Note Offering, pursuant to which it guaranteed the obligations on our behalf under the November Note in exchange\nfor receiving a portion of the loan proceeds. At a special meeting of stockholders on April 10, 2023, our shareholders approved for purposes of Nasdaq Listing Rule 5635, the\nissuance of shares of common stock in partial or full satisfaction of the November Note. However, there is no current agreement or understanding with the November Note\nholder with respect to repayment of the November Note through the issuance of shares of common stock. During the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company paid $375\nthousand and issued 7,301,903 shares of its common stock to Streeterville pursuant to an exchange agreement in exchange for a reduction of $5.1 million on the outstanding\nbalance of the November Notes. Subsequent to December 31 2023, the Company issued 11,484,403 shares of its common stock in exchange for a reduction of $1.7 million on\nthe outstanding balance of the November Notes. On March 18, 2024, the November Notes were paid in full.\nOn October 11, 2023, the Company entered into a note purchase agreement with Streeterville pursuant to which Streeterville purchased a promissory note (the “Note”)\nin the aggregate principal amount of $1.0 million (the “Note Offering”). The Note bears interest at 9.0% per annum compounded daily. The maturity date of the Note is 18\nmonths from the date of its issuance. In connection with the Note Offering, verbMarketplace, LLC, entered into a Guaranty, dated October 11, 2023, pursuant to which it\nguaranteed the obligations of the Company under the Note in exchange for receiving a portion of the proceeds. On October 12, 2023, the Company repaid all of the outstanding\nprincipal and accrued interest of a related party note payable amounting to $879 thousand.\nAs of March 28, 2024, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of approximately $14.2 million and notes payable of approximately $1.2 million. We believe that\nour enhanced cash position coupled with our substantially reduced current operating costs means our operations are fully funded for at least the next 14 months, and possibly\nlonger subject to revenue generation during that period. As a result, we have alleviated substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern.\n24\nFor additional information, refer to Note 1, “Description of Business,” and Note 2, “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Supplemental Disclosures,” to the\nconsolidated financial statements, and the section titled “Risk Factors,” within this Annual Report.\nOverview\nAs of December 31, 2023, we had cash of $4.4 million.\nThe following is a summary of our cash flows from operating, investing, and financing activities for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 (in thousands):\nYears Ended December 31,\n2023 2022\nCash used in operating activities – continuing operations $ (8,742) $ (13,683)\nCash used in operating activities – discontinued operations (1,855) (5,723)\nCash used in investing activities – continuing operations (306) (4,747)\nCash provided by (used in) investing activities – discontinued operations 4,750 (1)\nCash provided by financing activities – continuing operations 10,692 29,723\nCash used in financing activities – discontinued operations (2,615) (4,077)\nIncrease in cash $ 1,924 $ 1,492\nCash Flows – Operating\nFor the year ended December 31, 2023, our cash used in operating activities from continuing operations amounted to $8.7 million, compared to cash used in operating\nactivities from continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2022 of $13.7 million. We generated $5.0 million of additional cash from operations primarily due to\ncost savings in personnel expenses and reduced general and administrative expenses.\nCash Flows – Investing\nFor the year ended December 31, 2023, our cash provided by investing activities amounted to $4.4 million, primarily due to $4.8 million of proceeds received from the\nsale of SaaS assets slightly offset by our investment in capitalized software development costs related to MARKET.Live.\nCash Flows – Financing\nFor the year ended December 31, 2023, our cash provided by financing activities for continuing operations amounted to $10.7 million, primarily due to $9.2 million of\nnet proceeds from the issuance of shares of our common stock, $3.0 million of net proceeds from the issuance of shares of our Series C Preferred Stock and $1.0 million of net\nproceeds from a promissory note, all offset by the repayment of convertible notes of $(1.3) million, repayment of related party notes payable of $(0.8) million and repayment of\nour November Notes of $(0.4) million.\n25\nNotes Payable\nWe have the following outstanding notes payable as of December 31, 2023 (in thousands):\nBalance at December\nNote Issuance Date Maturity Date Interest Rate Original Borrowing 31, 2023\nNote payable (A) May 15, 2020 May 15, 2050 3.75% 150 $ 137\nPromissory note payable (B) November 7, 2022 May 7, 2024 9.0% 5,470 1,179\nPromissory note payable (C) October 11, 2023 April 11, 2025 9.0% 1,005 1,005\nDebt discount (99)\nDebt issuance costs (73)\nTotal notes payable 2,149\nNon-current (362)\nCurrent $ 1,787\n(A) On May 15, 2020, we executed an unsecured loan with the SBA under the Economic Injury Disaster Loan program in the amount of $0.15 million. Installment\npayments, including principal and interest, began on October 26, 2022. As of December 31, 2023, the outstanding balance of the note amounted to $0.14 million.\n(B) On November 7, 2022, we entered into the November Note Offering, which provided for the sale and issuance of an aggregate original principal amount of $5.5\nmillion in November Notes.\nWe received $5.0 million in gross proceeds from the sale of the November Notes. The November Notes bear interest of 9.0% per annum, have an original issue\ndiscount of 8.6%, and mature 18 months from the closing date.\nIn connection with the November Note Offering, we incurred $0.3 million of debt issuance costs. The debt issuance costs and the debt discount of $0.5 million are\nbeing amortized over the term of the November Notes using the effective interest rate method. As of December 31, 2023, the amount of unamortized debt discount and\ndebt issuance costs was $0.1 million and $0.1 million, respectively.\nAs of December 31, 2023, the outstanding balance of the Notes amounted to $1.7 million. Subsequent to December 31 2023, the Company issued 11,484,403 shares of\nits common stock in exchange for a reduction of $1.7 million on the outstanding balance of the November Notes. On March 18, 2024, the November Notes were paid\nin full.\n26\n(C) On October 11, 2023, we entered into a note purchase agreement with Streeterville pursuant to which they purchased a Note in the aggregate principal amount of $1.0\nmillion.\nWe received $1.0 million in gross proceeds from the sale of the Note. The Note bears interest at 9.0% per annum compounded daily. The maturity date of the note is 18\nmonths from the date of its issuance.\nAs of December 31, 2023, the outstanding balance of the Note amount to $1.0 million.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nOur financial statements have been prepared in accordance with GAAP, which require that we make certain assumptions and estimates that affect the reported amounts\nof assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of net revenue and expenses during each reporting period.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets\nand liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported periods. Management bases these estimates and\nassumptions upon historical experience, existing and known circumstances, and other factors that management believes to be reasonable. In addition, the Company has\nconsidered the potential impact of the pandemic, as well as certain macroeconomic factors, including inflation, rising interest rates, and recessionary concerns, on its business\nand operations.\nSignificant estimates include assumptions made for assumptions made in valuing assets acquired in business combinations, impairment testing of goodwill and other\nlong-lived assets, the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets, assumptions used in valuing derivative liabilities, assumptions used in valuing share-based compensation, and\naccruals for contingent liabilities. Some of those assumptions can be subjective and complex, and therefore, actual results could differ materially from those estimates under\ndifferent assumptions or conditions.\nRevenue Recognition\nThe Company recognizes revenue in accordance with Financial Accounting Standard Board’s (“FASB”) ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (“ASC\n606”). ASC 606 creates a five-step model that requires entities to exercise judgment when considering the terms of contract(s), which includes (1) identifying the contract(s) or\nagreement(s) with a customer, (2) identifying our performance obligations in the contract or agreement, (3) determining the transaction price, (4) allocating the transaction price\nto the separate performance obligations, and (5) recognizing revenue as each performance obligation is satisfied.\nA description of our principal revenue generating activities is as follows:\nMARKET.live generates revenue through several sources as follows:\na. All sales run through our ecommerce facility on MARKET.live from which we deduct a platform fee that ranges from 10% to 20% of gross sales, with an average\nof approximately 15%, depending upon the pricing package the vendors select as well as the product category and profit margins associated with such categories.\nThe revenue is derived from sales generated during livestream events, from sales realized through views of previously recorded live events available in each\nvendor’s store, as well as from sales of product and merchandise displayed in the vendors’ online stores, all of which are shoppable 24/7.\nb. Produced events. MARKET.live offers fee-based services that range from full production of livestream events, to providing professional hosts and event\nconsulting.\nc. Drop Ship and Creator programs. MARKET.live is expected to generate recurring fee revenue from soon to be launched new drop ship programs for entrepreneurs\nand its Creator program.\nd. The Company’s recently launched TikTok stores and affiliate programs.\ne. The MARKET.live site is designed to incorporate sponsorships and other advertising based on typical industry rates.\nA performance obligation is a promise in a contract to transfer a distinct product. Performance obligations promised in a contract are identified based on the goods that\nwill be transferred that are both capable of being distinct and are distinct in the context of the contract, whereby the transfer of the goods is separately identifiable from other\npromises in the contract. Performance obligations include establishing and maintaining customer online stores, providing access to the Company’s e-commerce platform and\ncustomer service support.\nThe Company’s revenue is mainly commission fees derived from contractually committed gross revenue processed by customers on the Company’s e-commerce\nplatform. Customers do not have the contractual right to take possession of the Company’s software. Revenue is recognized in an amount that reflects the consideration that the\nCompany expects to ultimately receive in exchange for those promised goods, net of expected discounts for sales promotions and customary allowances.\nRevenue is recognized on a net basis from maintaining e-commerce platforms and online orders, as the Company is engaged primarily in an agency relationship with\nits customers and earns defined amounts based on the individual contractual terms for the customer and the Company does not take possession of the customers’ inventory or\nany credit risks relating to the products sold.\nSales taxes collected from customers and remitted to governmental authorities are accounted for on a net basis and, therefore, are excluded from net sales in the\nconsolidated statements of operations.\nDerivative Financial Instruments\nWe evaluate our financial instruments to determine if such instruments are derivatives or contain features that qualify as embedded derivatives. For derivative financial\ninstruments that are accounted for as liabilities, the derivative instrument is initially recorded at its fair value and is then re-valued at each reporting date, with changes in the\nfair value reported in the consolidated statements of operations. The classification of derivative instruments, including whether such instruments should be recorded as\nliabilities or as equity, is evaluated at the end of each reporting period. Derivative instrument liabilities are classified in the consolidated balance sheets as current or non-current\nbased on whether or not net-cash settlement of the derivative instrument could be required within 12 months of the balance sheet date.\nWe use Level 2 inputs for our valuation methodology for the derivative liabilities as their fair values were determined by using a Binomial pricing model. Our\nderivative liabilities are adjusted to reflect fair value at each period end, with any increase or decrease in the fair value being recorded in results of operations as adjustments to\nfair value of derivatives.\n27\nShare-Based Compensation\nThe Company issues stock options and warrants, shares of common stock and restricted stock units as share-based compensation to employees and non-employees.\nThe Company accounts for its share-based compensation in accordance with FASB ASC 718, Compensation – Stock Compensation. Share-based compensation cost is\nmeasured at the grant date, based on the estimated fair value of the award, and is recognized as expense over the requisite service period. The fair value of restricted stock units\nis determined based on the number of shares granted and the quoted price of our common stock and is recognized as expense over the service period. Forfeitures are accounted\nfor as they occur. Recognition of compensation expense for non-employees is in the same period and manner as if the Company had paid cash for services.\nGoodwill\nIn accordance with FASB ASC 350, Intangibles-Goodwill and Other, we review goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment at least annually or\nwhenever events or circumstances indicate a potential impairment. Our impairment testing is performed annually at December 31 (our fiscal year end). Impairment of goodwill\nand indefinite lived intangible assets is determined by comparing the fair value of our reporting units to the carrying value of the underlying net assets in the reporting units. If\nthe fair value of a reporting unit is determined to be less than the carrying value of its net assets, goodwill is deemed impaired and an impairment loss is recognized to the\nextent that the carrying value of goodwill exceeds the difference between the fair value of the reporting unit and the fair value of its other assets and liabilities.\nOur annual impairment analysis includes a qualitative assessment to determine if it is necessary to perform the quantitative impairment test. In performing a qualitative\nassessment, we reviewed events and circumstances that could affect the significant inputs used to determine if the fair value is less than the carrying value of goodwill. As a\nresult of this qualitative assessment, we determined that a triggering event had occurred to necessitate performing the quantitative impairment test. After performing the\nquantitative impairment test in accordance with ASC 350-20-35-3C, we determined that goodwill was impaired by $10.2 million and was recognized as impairment loss during\nthe year ended December 31, 2022.\nOn June 13, 2023, the Company entered into a definitive agreement to sell all of the operating assets and liabilities of the SaaS business to SW Sales for $6.5 million,\nincluding $4.75 million of cash paid upon closing. The operations of the SaaS business have been presented within discontinued operations. Upon completion of the sale of\nassets to SW Sales, in which the buyer assumed all liabilities related to the SaaS business, the Company recorded an impairment of $5.4 million within loss from discontinued\noperations as the carrying amount of the net assets exceeded the sale price, less selling costs.\nIntangible Assets\nWe have certain intangible assets that were initially recorded at their fair value at the time of acquisition. The finite-lived intangible assets consist of developed\ntechnology and customer contracts. Indefinite-lived intangible assets consist of domain names. Intangible assets with finite useful lives are amortized using the straight-line\nmethod over their estimated useful life of five years.\nWe review all finite lived intangible assets for impairment when circumstances indicate that their carrying values may not be recoverable. If the carrying value of an\nasset group is not recoverable, we recognize an impairment loss for the excess carrying value over the fair value in our consolidated statements of operations. In addition to the\ngoodwill impairment loss that was recognized during the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company recognized an additional impairment loss of $1.8 million on its\nintangible assets that is primarily attributable to the Sound Concepts acquisition in 2019.\nRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements\nFor a summary of our recent accounting policies, please refer to Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Supplemental Disclosures, of the Notes to\nFinancial Statements.\nITEM 7A.

CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nWe maintain disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act, that are designed to ensure that information\nrequired to be disclosed in our reports under the Exchange Act, is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms,\nand that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and our principal financial officer, as appropriate, to\nallow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.\nWe carried out an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial\nofficer, of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and 15d- 15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of December 31, 2023. Based on\nthis evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of December 31, 2023.\nManagement’s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over our financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the\nExchange Act). Internal control over financial reporting is a process, including policies and procedures, designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of\nfinancial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external reporting purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Our\nmanagement assessed our internal control over financial reporting using the criteria in Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013), issued by the Committee of\nSponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (“COSO”). Our system of internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance\nregarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.\nBased on the results of our evaluation, our management has concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2023 to\nprovide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external reporting purposes in accordance with\ngenerally accepted accounting principles.\nChanges in Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nThere was no change in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the three months\nended December 31, 2023 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.\nInherent Limitations on the Effectiveness of Controls\nManagement does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud. A\ncontrol system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control systems are met. Further, the\ndesign of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent\nlimitations in a cost-effective control system, no evaluation of internal control over financial reporting can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud\nwill not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been or will be detected.\nThese inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of a simple error or mistake.\nControls can also be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by management override of the controls. The design of any\nsystem of controls is based in part on certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its\nstated goals under all potential future conditions. Projections of any evaluation of controls effectiveness to future periods are subject to risks. Over time, controls may become\ninadequate because of changes in conditions or deterioration in the degree of compliance with policies or procedures.\n29\nITEM 9B. OTHER INFORMATION\nRule 10b5-1 Trading Arrangement\nDuring the three months ended December 31, 2023, no director or officer of the Company adopted or terminated a “Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement” or “non-Rule\n10b5-1 trading arrangement,” as each term is defined in Item 408(a) of Regulation S-K.\nITEM 9C.

In these roles he acquired substantial business management,\nstrategic, operational, human resource, financial, disclosure, compliance, and corporate governance skills.\nKenneth S.

Our Board has determined that it is in\nthe best position to evaluate our requirements, as well as the qualifications of each candidate when it considers a nominee for a position on our Board. Accordingly, we do not\ncurrently have any specific or minimum criteria for the election of nominees to our Board and we do not have any specific process or procedure for evaluating such nominees.\nOur Board assesses all candidates, whether submitted by management or stockholders, and makes recommendations for election or appointment.\nIn recommending director nominees for appointment to our board of directors, our nominating and corporate governance committee also actively considers diversity\ncharacteristics, including diversity of professional experience, race, ethnicity, gender, age, education, cultural background and personal background. However, we have not\nadopted a formal policy regarding the consideration of specific diversity characteristic, and instead prefer to rely on the judgment of our highly qualified committee in\nrecommending candidates with the most appropriate mix of experiences, skills and expertise.\nDirector Independence\nOur Board is currently composed of four members. We have determined that the following three directors qualify as independent: James P. Geiskopf, Kenneth S.\nCragun, and Edmund C Moy. We determined that Mr. Cutaia, our Chairman of the Board, President, Chief Executive Officer and Secretary, is not independent. We evaluated\nindependence in accordance with the rules of Nasdaq and the SEC. Messrs.

The Board evaluates the independence of each nominee for election as a director of our Company in accordance with the Nasdaq Listing\nRules.\nStockholder Communications with the Board\nStockholders and other parties interested in communicating directly with our Board, a committee thereof, or any individual director, may do so by sending a written\ncommunication to the attention of the intended recipient(s) in care of the Corporate Secretary, Verb Technology Company, Inc., 3024 Sierra Juniper Court, Las Vegas, Nevada\n89138. The Corporate Secretary will forward all appropriate communications to the Chairman of our Audit Committee.\nInvestment in Human Capital\nWe believe our people are at the heart of our success and our customers’ success. We endeavor to not only attract and retain talented employees, but also to provide a\nchallenging and rewarding environment to motivate and develop our valuable human capital. We look to our talented employees to lead and foster various initiatives that\nsupport our company culture including those related to diversity, equity and inclusion. In addition, we rely heavily on our talented team to execute our growth plans and achieve\nour long-term strategic objectives.\nOrientation and Continuing Education\nWe have an informal process to orient and educate new directors to the Board regarding their role on the Board, our committees and our directors, as well as the nature\nand operations of our business. This process provides for an orientation with key members of the management staff, and further provides access to materials necessary to\ninform them of the information required to carry out their responsibilities as a Board member. This information includes the most recent board approved budget, the most recent\nannual report, copies of the audited financial statements and copies of the interim quarterly financial statements.\nThe Board does not provide continuing education for our directors. Each director is responsible to maintain the skills and knowledge necessary to meet his or her\nobligations as a director.\n34\nAssessments\nThe board intends that individual director assessments be conducted by other directors, taking into account each director’s contributions at board meetings, service on\ncommittees, experience base, and their general ability to contribute to one or more of our major needs. We conducted our first director assessment in December 2021.\nIn December 2022, the Board implemented individual director assessments. The director assessments involve each director performing a self-assessment, as well as\neach director individually assessing other members of the Board, taking into account each director’s contributions at Board meetings, service on committees, experience level,\nand their general ability to contribute to one or more of our major growth areas.\nCompensation Committee Interlocks and Insider Participation\nAs of the date of this Annual Report, no member of the Compensation Committee is serving, and during the past year no member of the Compensation Committee has\nserved, as an officer or employee of the Company or any of its subsidiaries.

The code of ethics addresses such individuals’ conduct with respect\nto, among other things, conflicts of interests; compliance with applicable laws, rules, and regulations; full, fair, accurate, timely, and understandable disclosure by us;\ncompetition and fair dealing; corporate opportunities; confidentiality; protection and proper use of our assets; and reporting suspected illegal or unethical behavior. The code of\nethics is available on our website at https://www.verb.tech in the “Governance” section under the “Investor Relations” tab.\nBoard Leadership Structure and Role in Risk Oversight\nBoard Leadership Structure\nWe currently combine the positions of Chairman and Chief Executive Officer into one position. We believe that this structure is appropriate at this time and is a\nleadership model that has served our stockholders well since our inception. We believe that this combined model has certain advantages over other leadership structures. This\ncombined role allows Mr. Cutaia to drive execution of our strategic plans and facilitates effective communication between management and our Board to bring key issues to its\nattention, and to see that our Board’s guidance and decisions are implemented effectively by management. Further, our Board has designated Mr. Geiskopf as its Lead Director.\nOur Board believes that Mr. Geiskopf’s strong leadership and qualifications, including his prior experience as a chief executive officer and chief financial officer and his tenure\non our Board, among other factors, contribute to his ability to fulfill the role of Lead Director effectively.\nRole of the Board in Risk Oversight\nOur Board is responsible for the oversight of our operational risk management process. Our Board has delegated authority for addressing certain risks, and accessing\nthe steps management has taken to monitor, control, and report such risks to our Audit Committee. Such risks include risks relating to execution of our growth strategy, the\neffects of the economy and general financial condition and outlook, our ability to expand our client base, communication with investors, certain actions of our competitors, the\nprotection of our intellectual property, sufficiency of our capital, security of information systems and data, integration of new information systems, credit risk, product liability,\nand costs of reliance on external advisors. Our Audit Committee then reports such risks as appropriate to our Board, which then initiates discussions with appropriate members\nof our senior management if, after discussion of such risks, our Board determines that such risks raise questions or concerns about the status of operational risks then facing us.\nOur Board relies on our Compensation Committee to address significant risk exposures that we may face with respect to compensation, including risks relating to\nretention of key employees, protection of partner relationships, management succession, and benefit costs, and, when appropriate, reports these risks to the full Board.\n35\nChange-of-Control Arrangements\nWe do not know of any arrangements, which may, at a subsequent date, result in a change-of-control.\nOther Board Committees\nOther than our Audit Committee, Compensation Committee, Governance and Nominating Committee, and Risk and Disclosure Committee, we have no committees of\nour board of directors. We do not have any defined policy or procedure requirements for our stockholders to submit recommendations or nominations for directors.\nBoard Diversity Matrix\nIn accordance with the rules of the Nasdaq Stock Market, the following table reflects our Board diversity matrix as of March 28, 2024:\nTotal Number of Directors 4\nNon- Did Not Disclose\nFemale Male Binary Gender\nPart I: Gender Identity\nDirectors - 4 - -\nPart II: Demographic Background\nAfrican American or Black - - - -\nAlaskan Native or Native American - - - -\nAsian - 1 - -\nHispanic or Latinx - - - -\nNative Hawaiian or Pacific Islander - - - -\nWhite - 3 - -\nTwo or More Races or Ethnicities - - - -\nLGBTQ+ - - - -\nDid Not Disclose Demographic Background - - - -\nInvolvement in Certain Legal Proceedings\nExcept as set forth below, during the last ten years, none of our directors and executive officers have been involved in any of the following events:\n1. any bankruptcy petition filed by or against such person or any business of which such person was a general partner or executive officer either at the time of the\nbankruptcy or within two years prior to that time;\n2. any conviction in a criminal proceeding or being subject to a pending criminal proceeding (excluding traffic violations and other minor offenses);\n3. being subject to any order, judgment, or decree, not subsequently reversed, suspended or vacated, of any court of competent jurisdiction, permanently or\ntemporarily enjoining him from or otherwise limiting his involvement in any type of business, securities or banking activities or to be associated with any person\npracticing in banking or securities activities;\n4. being found by a court of competent jurisdiction in a civil action, the SEC or the Commodity Futures Trading Commission to have violated a Federal or state\nsecurities or commodities law, and the judgment has not been reversed, suspended, or vacated;\n36\n5. being subject of, or a party to, any Federal or state judicial or administrative order, judgment decree, or finding, not subsequently reversed, suspended or vacated,\nrelating to an alleged violation of any Federal or state securities or commodities law or regulation, any law or regulation respecting financial institutions or\ninsurance companies, or any law or regulation prohibiting mail or wire fraud or fraud in connection with any business entity; or\n6. being subject of or party to any sanction or order, not subsequently reversed, suspended, or vacated, of any self-regulatory organization, any registered entity or\nany equivalent exchange, association, entity or organization that has disciplinary authority over its members or persons associated with a member.\nOn June 23, 2015, Local Corporation, a Delaware corporation, filed a voluntary petition for reorganization under Chapter 11 of the US Bankruptcy Code.

The Incentive Plan is also intended to assist us in recruiting new employees and to motivate, retain,\nand encourage such employees and directors to act in our stockholders’ interest and share in our success.\n39\nTerm\nThe Incentive Plan became effective upon approval by our stockholders on December 20, 2019 and will continue in effect from that date until it is terminated in\naccordance with its terms.\nAdministration\nThe Incentive Plan may be administered by our board of directors, a committee designated by it, and/or their respective delegates. Currently, our Compensation\nCommittee administers the Incentive Plan. The administrator has the power to determine the directors, employees, and consultants who may participate in the Incentive Plan\nand the amounts and other terms and conditions of awards to be granted under the Incentive Plan. All questions of interpretation and administration with respect to the Incentive\nPlan will be determined by the administrator. The administrator also will have the complete authority to adopt, amend, rescind, and enforce rules and regulations pertaining to\nthe administration of the Incentive Plan; to correct administrative errors; to make all other determinations deemed necessary or advisable for administering the Incentive Plan\nand any award granted under the Incentive Plan; and to authorize any person to execute, on behalf of us, all agreements and documents previously approved by the\nadministrator, among other items.\nEligibility\nAny of our directors, employees, or consultants, or any directors, employees, or consultants of any of our affiliates (except that with respect to incentive stock options,\nonly employees of us or any of our subsidiaries are eligible), are eligible to participate in the Incentive Plan.\nAvailable Shares\nOn February 17, 2023, our board of directors approved an additional 15,000,000 shares of common stock to be authorized under the Incentive Plan, and on April 10,\n2023, our stockholders approved the additional 15,000,000 shares of our common stock to be authorized for awards granted under the Incentive Plan. Shares subject to awards\nthat have been canceled, expired, settled in cash, or not issued or forfeited for any reason (in whole or in part), will not reduce the aggregate number of shares that may be\nsubject to or delivered under awards granted under the Incentive Plan and will be available for future awards granted under the Incentive Plan. As of March 28, 2024, subject to\nthe adjustment provisions included in the Incentive Plan, a total of 12,802,279 shares of our common stock are available for future issuances under the Incentive Plan.\nTypes of Awards\nWe may grant the following types of awards under the Incentive Plan: stock awards; options; stock appreciation rights; stock units; or other stock-based awards.\nStock Awards. The Incentive Plan authorizes the grant of stock awards to eligible participants. The administrator determines (i) the number of shares subject to the\nstock award or a formula for determining such number, (ii) the purchase price of the shares, if any, (iii) the means of payment for the shares, (iv) the performance criteria, if\nany, and the level of achievement versus these criteria, (v) the grant, issuance, vesting, and/or forfeiture of the shares, (vi) restrictions on transferability, and such other terms\nand conditions determined by the administrator.\nOptions. The Incentive Plan authorizes the grant of non-qualified and/or incentive options to eligible participants, which options give the participant the right, after\nsatisfaction of any vesting conditions and prior to the expiration or termination of the option, to purchase shares of our common stock at a fixed price. The administrator\ndetermines the exercise price for each share subject to an option granted under the Incentive Plan, which exercise price cannot be less than the fair market value (as defined in\nthe Incentive Plan) of our common stock on the grant date. The administrator also determines the number of shares subject to each option, the time or times when each option\nbecomes exercisable, and the term of each option (which cannot exceed ten (10) years from the grant date).\n40\nStock Appreciation Rights. The Incentive Plan authorizes the grant of stock appreciation rights to eligible participants, which stock appreciation rights give the\nparticipant the right, after satisfaction of any vesting conditions and prior to the expiration or termination of the stock appreciation right, to receive in cash or shares of our\ncommon stock the excess of the fair market value (as defined in the Incentive Plan) of our common stock on the date of exercise over the exercise price of the stock\nappreciation right. All stock appreciation rights under the Incentive Plan shall be granted subject to the same terms and conditions applicable to options granted under the\nIncentive Plan. Stock appreciation rights may be granted to awardees either alone or in addition to or in tandem with other awards granted under the Incentive Plan and may,\nbut need not, relate to a specific option granted under the Incentive Plan.\nStock Unit Awards and Other Stock-Based Awards. In addition to the award types described above, the administrator may grant any other type of award payable by\ndelivery of our common stock in such amounts and subject to such terms and conditions as the administrator determines in its sole discretion, subject to the terms of the\nIncentive Plan. Such awards may be made in addition to or in conjunction with other awards under the Incentive Plan. Such awards may include unrestricted shares of our\ncommon stock, which may be awarded, without limitation (except as provided in the Incentive Plan), as a bonus, in payment of director fees, in lieu of cash compensation, in\nexchange for cancellation of a compensation right, or upon the attainment of performance goals or otherwise, or rights to acquire shares of our common stock from us.\nAward Limits\nSubject to the terms of the Incentive Plan, the aggregate number of shares that may be subject to all incentive stock options granted under the Incentive Plan cannot\nexceed the total aggregate number of shares that may be subject to or delivered under awards under the Incentive Plan. Notwithstanding any other provisions of the Incentive\nPlan to the contrary, the aggregate amount of all awards granted to any non-employee director during any single calendar year shall not exceed 200,000 shares.\nNew Plan Benefits\nThe amount of future grants under the Incentive Plan is not determinable, as awards under the Incentive Plan will be granted at the sole discretion of the administrator.\nWe cannot determine at this time either the persons who will receive awards under the Incentive Plan or the amount or types of any such awards.\nTransferability\nUnless determined otherwise by the administrator, an award may not be sold, pledged, assigned, hypothecated, transferred, or disposed of in any manner other than by\nbeneficiary designation, will, or by the laws of descent or distribution, including but not limited to any attempted assignment or transfer in connection with the settlement of\nmarital property or other rights incident to a divorce or dissolution, and any such attempted sale, assignment, or transfer shall be of no effect prior to the date an award is vested\nand settled.\nTermination of Employment or Board Membership\nAt the grant date, the administrator is authorized to determine the effect a termination from membership on the board of directors by a non-employee director for any\nreason or a termination of employment (as defined in the Incentive Plan) due to disability (as defined in the Incentive Plan), retirement (as defined in the Incentive Plan), death,\nor otherwise (including termination for cause (as defined in the Incentive Plan)) will have on any award. Unless otherwise provided in the award agreement:\n● Upon termination from membership on our board of directors by a non-employee director for any reason other than disability or death, any option or stock\nappreciation right held by such director that (i) has not vested and is not exercisable as of the termination effective date will be subject to immediate cancellation\nand forfeiture or (ii) is vested and exercisable as of the termination effective date shall remain exercisable for one year thereafter, or the remaining term of the\noption or stock appreciation right, if less. Any unvested stock award, stock unit award, or other stock-based award held by a non-employee director at the time of\ntermination from membership on our board of directors for a reason other than disability or death will immediately be cancelled and forfeited.\n41\n● Upon termination from membership on our board of directors by a non-employee director due to disability or death will result in full vesting of any outstanding\noption or stock appreciation rights and vesting of a prorated portion of any stock award, stock unit award, or other stock-based award based upon the full months\nof the applicable performance period, vesting period, or other period of restriction elapsed as of the end of the month in which the termination from membership\non our board of directors by a non-employee director due to disability or death occurs over the total number of months in such period. Any option or stock\nappreciation right that vests upon disability or death will remain exercisable for one year thereafter, or the remaining term of the option or stock appreciation right,\nif less. In the case of any stock award, stock unit award, or other stock-based award that vests on the basis of attainment of performance criteria (as defined in the\nIncentive Plan), the pro rata vested amount will be based upon the target award.\n● Upon termination of employment due to disability or death, any option or stock appreciation right held by an employee will, if not already fully vested, become\nfully vested and exercisable as of the effective date of such termination of employment due to disability or death, or, in either case, the remaining term of the\noption or stock appreciation right, if less. Termination of employment due to disability or death shall result in vesting of a prorated portion of any stock award,\nstock unit award, or other stock-based award based upon the full months of the applicable performance period, vesting period, or other period of restriction\nelapsed as of the end of the month in which the termination of employment due to disability or death occurs over the total number of months in such period. In the\ncase of any stock award, stock unit award, or other stock-based award that vests on the basis of attainment of performance criteria, the pro-rata vested amount will\nbe based upon the target award.\n● Any option or stock appreciation right held by an awardee at retirement that occurs at least one year after the grant date of the option or stock appreciation right\nwill remain outstanding for the remaining term of the option or stock appreciation right and continue to vest; any stock award, stock unit award, or other stock\nbased award held by an awardee at retirement that occurs at least one year after the grant date of the award shall also continue to vest and remain outstanding for\nthe remainder of the term of the award.\n● Any other termination of employment shall result in immediate cancellation and forfeiture of all outstanding awards that have not vested as of the effective date of\nsuch termination of employment, and any vested and exercisable options and stock appreciation rights held at the time of such termination of such termination of\nemployment shall remain exercisable for 90 days thereafter or the remaining term of the option or stock appreciation right, if less. Notwithstanding the foregoing,\nall outstanding and unexercised options and stock appreciation rights will be immediately cancelled in the event of a termination of employment for cause.\nChange of Control\nIn the event of a change of control (as defined in the Incentive Plan), unless other determined by the administrator as of the grant date of a particular award, the\nfollowing acceleration, exercisability, and valuation provisions apply:\n● On the date that a change of control occurs, all options and stock appreciation rights awarded under the Incentive Plan not previously exercisable and vested will,\nif not assumed, or substituted with a new award, by the successor to us, become fully exercisable and vested, and if the successor to us assumes such options or\nstock appreciation rights or substitutes other awards for such awards, such awards (or their substitutes) shall become fully exercisable and vested if the\nparticipant’s employment is terminated (other than a termination for cause) within two years following the change of control.\n42\n● Except as may be provided in an individual severance or employment agreement (or severance plan) to which an awardee is a party, in the event of an awardee’s\ntermination of employment within two years after a change of control for any reason other than because of the awardee’s death, retirement, disability, or\ntermination for cause, each option and stock appreciation right held by the awardee (or a transferee) that is vested following such termination of employment will\nremain exercisable until the earlier of the third anniversary of such termination of employment (or any later date until which it would have remained exercisable\nunder such circumstances by its terms) or the expiration of its original term. In the event of an awardee’s termination of employment more than two years after a\nchange of control, or within two years after a change of control because of the awardee’s death, retirement, disability, or termination for cause, the regular\nprovisions of the Incentive Plan regarding employment termination (described above) will govern (as applicable).\n● On the date that a change of control occurs, the restrictions and conditions applicable to any or all stock awards, stock unit awards, and other stock-based awards\nthat are not assumed, or substituted with a new award, by the successor to us will lapse and such awards will become fully vested. Unless otherwise provided in an\naward agreement at the grant date, upon the occurrence of a change of control without assumption or substitution of the awards by the successor, any\nperformance-based award will be deemed fully earned at the target amount as of the date on which the change of control occurs. All stock awards, stock unit\nawards, and other stock-based awards shall be settled or paid within 30 days of vesting. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the change of control would not qualify\nas a permissible date of distribution under Section 409A(a)(2)(A) of the Internal Revenue Code, and the regulations thereunder, the awardee shall be entitled to\nreceive the award from us on the date that would have applied, absent this provision. If the successor to us does assume (or substitute with a new award) any stock\nawards, stock unit awards, and other stock-based awards, all such awards shall become fully vested if the participant’s employment is terminated (other than a\ntermination for cause) within two years following the change of control, and any performance based award will be deemed fully earned at the target amount\neffective as of the termination of employment.\n● The administrator, in its discretion, may determine that, upon the occurrence of a change of control of us, each option and stock appreciation right outstanding will\nterminate within a specified number of days after notice to the participant, and/or that each participant receives, with respect to each share subject to such option\nor stock appreciation right, an amount equal to the excess of the fair market value of such share immediately prior to the occurrence of such change of control over\nthe exercise price per share of such option and/or stock appreciation right; such amount to be payable in cash, in one or more kinds of stock or property (including\nthe stock or property, if any, payable in the transaction), or in a combination thereof, as the administrator, in its discretion, determines and, if there is no excess\nvalue, the administrator may, in its discretion, cancel such awards.\n● An option, stock appreciation right, stock award, stock unit award, or other stock-based award will be considered assumed or substituted for if, following the\nchange of control, the award confers the right to purchase or receive, for each share subject to the option, stock appreciation right, stock award, stock unit award,\nor other stock-based award immediately prior to the change of control, the consideration (whether stock, cash, or other securities or property) received in the\ntransaction constituting a change of control by holders of shares for each share held on the effective date of such transaction (and if holders were offered a choice\nof consideration, the type of consideration chosen by the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares); provided, however, that, if such consideration received\nin the transaction constituting a change of control is not solely shares of common stock of the successor company, the administrator may, with the consent of the\nsuccessor company, provide that the consideration to be received upon the exercise or vesting of an option, stock appreciation right, stock award, stock unit award,\nor other stock-based award, for each share subject thereto, will be solely shares of common stock of the successor company with a fair market value substantially\nequal to the per-share consideration received by holders of shares in the transaction constituting a change of control. The determination of whether fair market\nvalue is substantially equal shall be made by the administrator in its sole discretion and its determination will be conclusive and binding.\n43\nTax and Accounting Considerations\nAmong the factors it considers when making executive compensation decisions, the Compensation Committee considers the anticipated tax and accounting impact to\nus (and to our executive officers) of various payments, equity awards and other benefits.\nThe Compensation Committee considers the impact of the provisions of Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code, or the Code, as amended by the Tax Cuts and\nJobs Act, or the TCJA. That section generally limits the deductibility of compensation paid by a publicly held company to “covered employees” for a taxable year to $1.0\nmillion. Effective for taxable years beginning on and after January 1, 2018, “covered employees” generally include our Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer and\nother highly compensated executive officers. Effective for taxable years beginning prior to January 1, 2018, an exception to this deduction limit applied to “performance-based\ncompensation,” such as cash incentive and stock option awards, that satisfied certain criteria. This exception to the Section 162(m) deduction limit for “performance-based\ncompensation” was repealed by the TCJA. Thus, except for certain “performance-based compensation” payable pursuant to written contracts that were in effect on November 2,\n2017 and that are not modified in any material respect on or after that date, effective for taxable years beginning on and after January 1, 2018 our tax deduction with regard to\ncompensation of “covered employees” is limited to $1.0 million per taxable year with respect to each executive officer. With respect to cash and equity awards that were in\neffect on November 2, 2017, and that are not modified in any material respect on or after that date, the Committee is mindful of the benefit to us and our stockholders of the full\ndeductibility of compensation and have taken steps so that both the cash incentive and stock option awards that we granted may qualify for deductibility under Section 162(m)\nof the Code. However, awards that we granted that were intended to qualify as “performance-based compensation” may not necessarily qualify for such status under Section\n162(m) of the Code. With respect to cash incentive and equity awards that we may grant in the future, we do not anticipate that the $1.0 million deduction limitation set forth in\nSection 162(m) of the Code will have a material impact on our results of operations.\nThe Compensation Committee also considers the impact of Section 409A of the Code, and in general, our executive plans and programs are designed to comply with\nthe requirements of that section so as to avoid possible adverse tax consequences that may result from noncompliance.\nWe account for equity awards in accordance with the requirements of Financial Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standards Codification, or FASB ASC, Topic\n718, Stock Compensation.\nOur change-of-control and severance Agreements do not allow for excise tax gross up payments.\nAmendment and Termination\nThe administrator may amend, alter, or discontinue the Incentive Plan or any award agreement, but any such amendment is subject to the approval of our stockholders\nin the manner and to the extent required by applicable law. In addition, without limiting the foregoing, unless approved by our stockholders and subject to the terms of the\nIncentive Plan, no such amendment shall be made that would (i) increase the maximum aggregate number of shares that may be subject to awards granted under the Incentive\nPlan, (ii) reduce the minimum exercise price for options or stock appreciation rights granted under the Incentive Plan, or (iii) reduce the exercise price of outstanding options or\nstock appreciation rights, as prohibited by the terms of the Incentive Plan without stockholder approval.\nNo amendment, suspension, or termination of the Incentive Plan will impair the rights of any participant with respect to an outstanding award, unless otherwise\nmutually agreed between the participant and the administrator, which agreement must be in writing and signed by the participant and us, except that no such agreement will be\nrequired if the administrator determines in its sole discretion that such amendment either (i) is required or advisable in order for us, the Incentive Plan, or the award to satisfy\nany applicable law or to meet the requirements of any accounting standard or (ii) is not reasonably likely to diminish the benefits provided under such award significantly, or\nthat any such diminution has been adequately compensated, except that this exception shall not apply following a change of control. Termination of the Incentive Plan will not\naffect the administrator’s ability to exercise the powers granted to it hereunder with respect to awards granted under the Incentive Plan prior to the date of such termination.\n44\nOutstanding Equity Awards at Fiscal Year-End\nThe following table sets forth, for each named executive officer, certain information concerning outstanding restricted stock awards as of December 31, 2023.

Cutaia\nPursuant to Mr. Cutaia’s employment agreement dated December 20, 2019, Mr. Cutaia is entitled to the following severance package in the event he is “terminated\nwithout cause,” “terminated for good reason,” or “terminated upon permanent disability”: (i) monthly payments of $35,833 or such sum equal to his monthly base\ncompensation at the time of the termination, whichever is higher, for a period of 36 months from the date of such termination and (ii) reimbursement for COBRA health\ninsurance costs for 18 months from the date of such termination and, thereafter, reimbursement for health insurance costs for Mr. Cutaia and his family during the immediately\nsubsequent 18-month period.

(the “Company”) as of December 31, 2022, the related consolidated\nstatement of operations, changes in stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for the year then ended, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial\nstatements”). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2022, and\nthe results of its operations and its cash flows for the year then ended, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\nGoing Concern\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 1 to the\nconsolidated financial statements, the Company has incurred recurring operating losses and used cash in operations since inception. These matters raise substantial doubt about\nthe Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. Management’s plans in regard to these matters are also described in Note 1 to the financial statements. The consolidated\nfinancial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s consolidated\nfinancial statements based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (“PCAOB”) and are\nrequired to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and\nExchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about\nwhether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to\nperform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audit we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but\nnot for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.\nOur audit included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing\nprocedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our\naudits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial\nstatements. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matter\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be\ncommunicated to the audit committee and that (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved especially\nchallenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements,\ntaken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to\nwhich it relates.\nF-1\nGoodwill Impairment Assessment\nAs described in Notes 2 and 5 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company conducts its goodwill impairment testing on an annual basis as of December 31 or\nwhenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of a reporting unit may exceed its fair value. Impairment of goodwill is determined by comparing the fair\nvalue of the Company’s reporting unit to the carrying value of the underlying net assets in the reporting unit. If the fair value of the reporting unit is determined to be less than\nthe carrying value of its net assets, goodwill is deemed impaired and an impairment loss is recognized to the extent that the carrying value of goodwill exceeds the difference\nbetween the fair value of the reporting unit and the fair value of its other assets and liabilities. In accordance with the “Segment Reporting” Topic of the Accounting Standards\nCodification, the Company’s chief operating decision maker (the Company’s Chief Executive Officer) determined that there is only one reporting unit.\nThe Company’s annual impairment analysis includes a qualitative assessment to determine if it is necessary to perform the quantitative impairment test. In performing a\nqualitative assessment, the Company reviewed events and circumstances that could affect the significant inputs used to determine if the fair value is less than the carrying value\nof goodwill. As a result of this qualitative assessment, the Company determined that a triggering event had occurred to necessitate performing the quantitative impairment test.\nAfter performing the quantitative impairment test, the Company determined that goodwill was impaired by $10,183. As a result of the impairment losses recognized, the\ncarrying amount of the Company’s goodwill was reduced to $9,581 as of December 31, 2022.\nWe identified the evaluation of goodwill impairment assessment as a critical audit matter because of the significant judgment by management when determining the fair value\nof the reporting unit. This required a high degree of auditor judgment and increased auditor effort in auditing such assumptions.\nThe primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter included:\n● We compared forecasts prepared by management used in its impairment analysis to historical revenues and costs for reasonableness.\n● We performed procedures to verify the mathematical accuracy of the calculations used by management.\n● We recalculated the impairment recorded for goodwill of $10,183 based on the excess of the carrying value of goodwill over its estimated fair value as of December\n31, 2022.\n● We assessed the appropriateness of the disclosures in the financial statements.\nWe served as the Company’s auditor from 2017 to 2023.\n/s/ Weinberg & Company, P.A.\nLos Angeles, California\nApril 17, 2023\nF-2\nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\nTo the Stockholders and the Board of Directors\nVerb Technology Company, Inc.\nOpinions on the Financial Statements\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of Verb Technology Company, Inc. (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2023, the related consolidated\nstatement of operations, changes in stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for the year then ended, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial\nstatements”). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2023, and\nthe results of its operations and its cash flows for the year then ended, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s financial statements\nbased on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be\nindependent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange\nCommission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about\nwhether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an\naudit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audit, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, but not for the\npurpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.\nOur audit included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that\nrespond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audit also included\nevaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe\nthat our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matters\nThe critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be\ncommunicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging,\nsubjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are\nnot, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.\nValuation of Capitalized Software Development Costs\nCritical Audit Matter Description\nAs of December 31, 2023, the Company’s capitalized software development costs, net aggregated $4.0M.\nThe principal consideration for our determination that this was a critical audit matter is that capitalized software development costs, net are material to the financial statements\nand auditing the valuation of this asset involved a high degree of subjective and complex auditor judgment.\nHow the Critical Audit Matter was addressed in the Audit.\nOur audit procedures related to the evaluation of the capitalized software development costs included the following, among others:\na) We obtained an understanding of controls over the Company’s accounting and disclosures for capitalized software development cost.\nb) We also obtained an understanding of the company’s history and development of the capitalized software through inquiries with management and review of\nrelevant agreements and other source documentation.\nc) With respect to the Company’s valuation of capitalized software development costs:\ni. We evaluated the methodology used by management to identify and assess potential impairment indicators against the criteria outlined in ASC 360-10-\n35-21.\nii. We assessed the qualifications and expertise of management in evaluating the impairment indicators and the prospects of the business utilizing the\ncapitalized software.\niii. We obtained and evaluated the reasonableness of management’s undiscounted cash flow forecast related to supporting its valuation assertion with respect\nto the capitalized software development cost. Specifically, we tested the mathematical accuracy of the forecast and evaluated the reasonableness of key\nassumptions in the cash flow forecast.\niv. We evaluated the reasonableness of management’s assertion by reviewing evidence of the software’s continued use and functionality, activity, and related\nagreements with suppliers and partners of the Company. Additionally, we reviewed both internal and external data related to user engagement in the\ncontext of the software’s continued use.\nd) We assessed the sufficiency of disclosures with respect to capitalized software development costs.\nGrassi & Co., CPAs, P.C.\nWe have served as the Company’s auditor since 2023.\nJericho, NY\nApril 1, 2024\nF-3\nVERB TECHNOLOGY COMPANY, INC.\nCONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS\n(in thousands, except share and per share data)\nAs of December 31,\n2023 2022\nASSETS\nCurrent assets\nCash $ 4,353 $ 2,429\nAssets held for sale -

DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS\nOur Business\nReferences in this document to the “Company,” “Verb,” “we,” “us,” or “our” are intended to mean Verb Technology Company, Inc., individually, or as the context\nrequires, collectively with its subsidiaries on a consolidated basis. Verb conducts its operations through various subsidiaries and was incorporated in 2012 in the state of\nNevada.\nThrough June 13, 2023, the Company was a Software-as-a-Service (“SaaS”) applications platform developer that offers three platforms, each designed for a specific\ntarget customer. Its SaaS platform for the direct sales industry is comprised of a suite of interactive video-based sales enablement business software products marketed on a\nsubscription basis. Available in both mobile and desktop versions, its base SaaS product is verbCRM, a Customer Relationship Management (“CRM”) application, to\nwhich the Company’s clients can add a choice of enhanced, fully integrated application modules that include verbLEARN, our gamified Learning Management System\napplication; verbLIVE, a Live Stream interactive eCommerce application; and verbPULSE, a business/augmented intelligence notification and sales coach application.\nverbTEAMS is a standalone, self-onboarding, video-based CRM and content management application for life sciences companies, professional sports teams, small\nbusinesses, and solopreneurs, with seamless one-button synchronization with Salesforce, that also comes bundled with verbLIVE. MARKET.live is the Company’s multi-\nvendor, multi-presenter, livestream social shopping platform, that combines ecommerce and entertainment.\nThe Company also provides certain non-digital services to some of its enterprise clients such as printing and fulfillment services.\nOn April 12, 2019, the Company acquired Sound Concepts Inc. (“Sound Concepts”). The acquisition was intended to augment and diversify the Company’s internet\nand Software-as-a-Service (“SaaS”) business. Sound Concepts is now known as Verb Direct, LLC.\nOn September 4, 2020, Verb Acquisition Co., LLC (“Verb Acquisition”), a subsidiary of the Company, acquired Ascend Certification, LLC, dba SoloFire (“SoloFire”).\nThe acquisition was intended to augment and diversify the Company’s internet and SaaS business.\nOn October 18, 2021, the Company established verbMarketplace, LLC (“Market LLC”), a Nevada limited liability company. Market LLC is a wholly owned\nsubsidiary of the Company established for the MARKET.live platform.\nOn June 13, 2023, the Company disposed of all of its operating SaaS assets of Verb Direct and Verb Acquisition, (referred to collectively as the “SaaS Assets”)\npursuant to an asset purchase agreement in consideration of the sum of $6,500, $4,750 of which was paid in cash by the buyer at the closing of the transaction. Additional\npayments of $1,750 will be paid by the buyer if certain profitability and revenue targets are met within the next two years as set forth more particularly in the asset\npurchase agreement. The sale of the SaaS Assets was undertaken to allow the Company to focus its resources on its burgeoning MARKET.live business unit which it\nexpects over time will create greater shareholder value.\nGoing Concern and Management’s Plan\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and the settlement of\nliabilities and commitments in the normal course of business. As reflected in the accompanying consolidated financial statements, during the year ended December 31,\n2023, the Company incurred a net loss from continuing operations of $14,844 and used cash in continuing operations of $8,742. As of December 31, 2023, the Company\nhad cash of $4,353 yet the aforementioned factors raised substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the date these\nfinancial statements were issued.\nEquity financing during the year ended December 31, 2023:\nOn January 24, 2023, the Company issued 901,275 shares of the Company’s common stock which resulted in proceeds of $6,578, net of offering costs of $622.\nDuring September 2023, the Company restarted its’ at-the-market (“ATM”) issuance sales agreements with Truist Securities, Inc. (“Truist”) pursuant to the Company’s\nRegistration Statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-252167). For the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company has issued 8,784,214 shares of the Company’s common\nstock since the restart of this agreement, resulting in net proceeds of $2,523, net of offering costs of $43. The agreement with Truist was terminated on December 15, 2023.\nDuring December 2023, the Company entered into an agreement with Ascendiant Capital Markets LLC (“Ascendiant Sales Agreement”) to sell shares of its common\nstock pursuant to the Company’s Registration Statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-264038). For the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company has issued 687,304\nshares of the Company’s common stock under the Ascendiant Sales Agreement, resulting in net proceeds of $114. See Note 17 – Subsequent Events.\nOn December 29, 2023, the Company entered into a securities purchase agreement (the “Securities Purchase Agreement”) with Streeterville Capital, LLC\n(“Streeterville”), pursuant to which the Company sold and Streeterville purchased 3,000 shares of the Company’s newly designated non-convertible Series C Preferred\nStock (the “Series C Shares”) for a total purchase price of $3,000. The Shares have a 10% stated annual dividend, no voting rights and has a face value of $1,300 per share.\nThe sale of the Series C Shares was consummated on December 29, 2023.\nF-8\nDebt financing during the year ended December 31, 2023:\nOn January 12, 2022, the Company entered into a securities purchase agreement (the “January Note Purchase Agreement”) with three institutional investors\n(collectively, the “January Note Holders”) providing for the sale and issuance of an aggregate original principal amount of $6,300 in convertible notes due January 2023\n(each, a “Note,” and, collectively, the “Notes,” and such financing, the “January Note Offering”). The Company and the January Note Holders also entered into a security\nagreement, dated January 12, 2022, in connection with the January Note Offering, pursuant to which the Company granted a security interest to the January Note Holders\nin substantially all of its assets. During the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company repaid $4,950 in principal payments and $357 of accrued interest to January Note\nHolders pursuant to the terms of the Notes. On January 26, 2023, the Company repaid the remaining principal balance of $1,350 and $208 of accrued interest under the\nJanuary Note Offering dated January 12, 2022.\nOn November 7, 2022, the Company entered into a note purchase agreement (the “November Note Purchase Agreement”) and promissory note with an institutional\ninvestor (the “November Note Holder”) providing for the sale and issuance of an unsecured, non-convertible promissory note in the original principal amount of $5,470,\nwhich has an original issue discount of $470, resulting in gross proceeds to the Company of approximately $5,000 (the “November Note,” and such financing, the\n“November Note Offering”). The November Note matures eighteen months following the date of issuance. Commencing Nine months from the date of issuance, the\nCompany is required to make monthly cash redemption payments in an amount not to exceed $600. The November Note may be repaid in whole or in part prior to the\nmaturity date for a 10% premium. The November Note requires the Company to use up to 20% of the gross proceeds raised from future equity or debt financings, or the\nsale of any subsidiary or material asset, to prepay the November Note, subject to a $2,000 cap on the aggregate prepayment amount. Until all obligations under the\nNovember Note have been paid in full, the Company is not permitted to grant a security interest in any of its assets, or to issue securities convertible into shares of common\nstock, subject in each case to certain exceptions. verbMarketplace, LLC entered into a guaranty, dated November 7, 2022, in connection with the November Note Offering,\npursuant to which it guaranteed the obligations of the Company under the November Note in exchange for receiving a portion of the loan proceeds.\nOn May 16, 2023, the Company received a redemption notice under the terms of the November Note Purchase Agreement for $300. The Company missed two\npayments resulting in a Payment Failure Balance Increase of 10% on the outstanding principal balance per occurrence pursuant to the terms of the agreement totaling\n$1,205. These costs have been recorded as finance costs in the Company’s consolidated statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2023.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company paid $375 in cash and $5,097 in shares of its common stock. As of December 31, 2023 and December 31,\n2022, the outstanding balance of the November Notes amounted to $1,692 and $5,544, respectively. Subsequent to December 31, 2023, the Company issued 11,484,403\nshares of its common stock pursuant to an exchange agreement in exchange for a reduction of $1,720 on the outstanding balance of the November Notes. On March 18,\n2024, the Company paid the November Notes in full.\nOn October 11, 2023, the Company entered into a note purchase agreement with Streeterville pursuant to which Streeterville purchased a promissory note (the “Note”)\nin the aggregate principal amount of $1,005 (the “Note Offering”). The Note bears interest at 9.0% per annum compounded daily. The maturity date of the Note is 18\nmonths from the date of its issuance.\nOn October 12, 2023, the Company repaid all of the outstanding principal and accrued interest of related party notes payable amounting to $879.\nEquity financing subsequent to December 31, 2023:\nThe Company issued 19,183,258 shares of its common stock pursuant to the Ascendiant Sales Agreement and received $5,956 of net proceeds resulting from ATM\nissuances.\nPurusuant to a Regulation A offering, the Company entered into subscription agreements with certain institutional investors, pursuant to which the Company agreed to\nissue and sell to the investors 27,397,258 shares of its Common Stock, par value $0.0001 per share of the Company at a price of $0.24 per share for gross proceeds to the\nCompany of $6,575.\nThe shares that were issued in the offering were offered at-the-market under Nasdaq rules and pursuant to the Company’s Form 1-A, initially filed by the Company\nwith the Securities and Exchange Commission under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, on February 14, 2024 and qualified on March 11, 2024.\nAs of March 28, 2024, the Company had cash of approximately $14,200 and approximately $1,200 of outstanding notes payable principal balance and accrued interest\nwith minimum monthly payments of $120 beginning in April 2024 related to the Note which has a maturity date of April 11, 2025. As a result of the aforementioned equity\nfinancing that occurred subsequent to December 31, 2023, management has alleviated substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern.\nF-9\nEconomic Disruption\nOur business is dependent in part on general economic conditions. Many jurisdictions in which our customers are located and our products are sold have experienced\nand could continue to experience unfavorable general economic conditions, such as inflation, increased interest rates and recessionary concerns, which could negatively\naffect demand for our products. Under difficult economic conditions, customers may seek to cease spending on our current products or fail to adopt our new products,\nwhich could negatively affect our financial performance. We cannot predict the timing or magnitude of an economic slowdown or the timing or strength of any economic\nrecovery. These and other economic factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\n2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND SUPPLEMENTAL DISCLOSURES\nBasis of Presentation\nOn April 18, 2023, we implemented a 1-for-40 reverse stock split (the “Reverse Stock Split”) of our common stock, $0.0001 par value per share (the “Common\nStock”). Our Common Stock commenced trading on a post Reverse Stock Split basis on April 19, 2023. As a result of the Reverse Stock Split, every forty (40) shares of\nour pre-Reverse Stock Split Common Stock were combined and reclassified into one share of our Common Stock. The number of shares of Common Stock subject to\noutstanding options, warrants, and convertible securities were also reduced by a factor of forty and the exercise price of such securities increased by a factor of forty, as of\nApril 18, 2023. All historical share and per-share amounts reflected throughout our consolidated financial statements and other financial information in this Annual Report\nhave been adjusted to reflect the Reverse Stock Split. The par value per share of our Common Stock was not affected by the Reverse Stock Split.\nOn June 10, 2023, the board of directors approved the sale of the SaaS Assets to an unrelated third party, SW Direct Sales LLC (“SW Sales” or the “buyer”), for\n$6,500 with $4,750 cash proceeds paid by buyer upon closing of the transaction. Additional payments of $1,750 will be paid by the buyer if certain profitability and\nrevenue targets are met within the next two years. The contingent payments were not recorded at the closing date of the sale, rather will be recognized as the cash is\nreceived and the contingency resolved pursuant to ASC 450-30.\nAccordingly, the Company’s consolidated financial statements are being presented pursuant to ASC 360-10-45-9 which requires that a disposal group be classified as\nheld for sale in the period in which all of the held for sale criteria are met. Accordingly, the Company’s consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2022 has been\nreclassified to reflect held for sale accounting. In addition to held for sale accounting, the Company has also met the criterion pursuant to ASC 205-20, Discontinued\nOperations, as a strategic shift from operating and managing a SaaS business to operating and managing a live streaming shopping platform has occurred because of the\nsale. The Company’s consolidated results of operations and statements of cash flows have been reclassified to reflect the presentation of discontinued operations. See Note\n5 for details of the assets and liabilities related to the SaaS sale and discontinued operations.\nPrinciples of Consolidation\nThe consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”) and\ninclude the accounts of Verb, Verb Direct, LLC, Verb Acquisition Co., LLC, and verbMarketplace, LLC. All intercompany accounts have been eliminated in the\nconsolidation. Certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation within the consolidated balance sheets and consolidated\nstatements of cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets\nand liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reported periods. Management bases these estimates and\nassumptions upon historical experience, existing and known circumstances, and other factors that management believes to be reasonable. In addition, the Company has\nconsidered the potential impact of the pandemic, as well as certain macroeconomic factors, including inflation, rising interest rates, and recessionary concerns, on its\nbusiness and operations.\nSignificant estimates include assumptions made in analysis of assumptions made in purchase price allocations, impairment testing of long-term assets, realization of\ndeferred tax assets, determining fair value of derivative liabilities, and valuation of equity instruments issued for services. Some of those assumptions can be subjective and\ncomplex, and therefore, actual results could differ materially from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions.\nRevenue Recognition\nThe Company recognizes revenue in accordance with Financial Accounting Standard Board’s (“FASB”) ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (“ASC\n606”). Revenue through June 13, 2023 of the year ended December 31, 2023 were derived primarily from providing application services through the SaaS application,\ndigital marketing and sales support services. During that period, the Company also derived revenue from the sale of customized print products and training materials,\nbranded apparel, and digital tools, as demanded by its customers. As a result of the sale of the SaaS business, revenue that was recorded historically from the SaaS business\nhas been reclassified as part of discontinued operations. See Note 5 for revenue disclosures related to the SaaS business.\nA description of our principal revenue generating activities is as follows:\nMARKET.live generates revenue through several sources as follows:\na. All sales run through our ecommerce facility on MARKET.live from which we deduct a platform fee that ranges from 10% to 20% of gross sales, with an average\nof approximately 15%, depending upon the pricing package the vendors select as well as the product category and profit margins associated with such categories.\nThe revenue is derived from sales generated during livestream events, from sales realized through views of previously recorded live events available in each\nvendor’s store, as well as from sales of product and merchandise displayed in the vendors’ online stores, all of which are shoppable 24/7.\nb. Produced events. MARKET.live offers fee-based services that range from full production of livestream events, to providing professional hosts and event\nconsulting.\nc. Drop Ship and Creator programs. MARKET.live is expected to generate recurring fee revenue from soon to be launched new drop ship programs for entrepreneurs\nand its Creator program.\nd. The Company’s recently launched TikTok store and affiliate program.\ne. The MARKET.live site is designed to incorporate sponsorships and other advertising based on typical industry rates.\nA performance obligation is a promise in a contract to transfer a distinct product. Performance obligations promised in a contract are identified based on the goods that\nwill be transferred that are both capable of being distinct and are distinct in the context of the contract, whereby the transfer of the goods is separately identifiable from\nother promises in the contract. Performance obligations include establishing and maintaining customer online stores, providing access to the Company’s e-commerce\nplatform and customer service support.\nThe Company’s revenue is mainly commission fees derived from contractually committed gross revenue processed by customers on the Company’s e-commerce\nplatform. Customers do not have the contractual right to take possession of the Company’s software. Revenue is recognized in an amount that reflects the consideration that\nthe Company expects to ultimately receive in exchange for those promised goods, net of expected discounts for sales promotions and customary allowances.\nF-10\nRevenue is recognized on a net basis from maintaining e-commerce platforms and online orders, as the Company is engaged primarily in an agency relationship with\nits customers and earns defined amounts based on the individual contractual terms for the customer and the Company does not take possession of the customers’ inventory\nor any credit risks relating to the products sold.\nSales taxes collected from customers and remitted to governmental authorities are accounted for on a net basis and, therefore, are excluded from net sales in the\nconsolidated statements of operations. Revenues during the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, were substantially all generated from clients and customers located\nwithin the United States of America.\nCost of Revenue\nCost of revenue primarily consists of the purchase price of consumer products, packaging supplies, and customer shipping and handling expenses.\nCapitalized Software Development Costs\nThe Company capitalizes internal and external costs directly associated with developing internal-use software, and hosting arrangements that include an internal-use\nsoftware license, during the application development stage of its projects. The Company’s internal-use software is reported at cost less accumulated amortization.\nAmortization begins once the project has been completed and is ready for its intended use. The Company will amortize the asset on a straight-line basis over a period of\nthree years, which is the estimated useful life. Software maintenance activities or minor upgrades are expensed in the period performed.\nAmortization expense related to capitalized software development costs are recorded in depreciation and amortization in the consolidated statements of operations.\nProperty and Equipment\nProperty and equipment are recorded at historical cost and depreciated on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives of approximately five years once the\nindividual assets are placed in service. Leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of the useful life or the remaining period of the applicable lease term.\nBusiness Combinations\nPursuant to FASB ASC 805, Business Combinations (“ASC 805”), the Company allocates the fair value of purchase consideration to the tangible assets acquired,\nliabilities assumed, and separately identified intangible assets acquired based on their estimated fair values. The excess of the fair value of purchase consideration over the\nfair values of these identifiable assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill. Such valuations require management to make significant estimates and assumptions, especially\nwith respect to intangible assets. Significant estimates in valuing certain intangible assets include, but are not limited to, future expected cash flows from, acquired\ntechnology, trademarks and trade names, useful lives, and discount rates. Management’s estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable, but\nwhich are inherently uncertain and unpredictable and, as a result, actual results may differ from estimates. During the measurement period, which is the period needed to\ngather all information necessary to make the purchase price allocation, not to exceed one year from the acquisition date, we may record adjustments to the assets acquired\nand liabilities assumed, with the corresponding offset to goodwill. Upon the conclusion of the measurement period, any subsequent adjustments are recorded to earnings.\nIntangible Assets\nThe Company has certain intangible assets that were initially recorded at their fair value at the time of acquisition. The finite-lived intangible assets consist of\ndeveloped technology and customer contracts. Indefinite-lived intangible assets consist of domain names. Intangible assets with finite useful lives are amortized using the\nstraight-line method over their estimated useful life of five years.\nThe Company reviews all finite-lived intangible assets for impairment when circumstances indicate that their carrying values may not be recoverable. If the carrying\nvalue of an asset group is not recoverable, the Company recognizes an impairment loss for the excess carrying value over the fair value in our consolidated statements of\noperations.\nIn December 2022, the Company recorded an impairment loss of $440 on its indefinite-lived intangible assets that had been recognized as part of the Sound Concepts\nacquisition in 2019. The Company also recorded an impairment loss of $2 that had been recognized as part of the Solofire acquisition in 2020. As a result of the\nimpairment losses recognized, the carrying amount of the Company’s indefinite-lived intangible assets were reduced to $0 as of December 31, 2022.\nThe Company did not record any impairment charges related to indefinite lived intangible assets for the year ended December 31, 2023.\nGoodwill\nIn accordance with FASB ASC 350, Intangibles-Goodwill and Other, the Company reviews goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment at least\nannually or whenever events or circumstances indicate a potential impairment. The Company’s impairment testing is performed annually at December 31 (its fiscal year\nend). Impairment of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets is determined by comparing the fair value of the Company’s reporting unit to the carrying value of the\nunderlying net assets in the reporting unit. If the fair value of the reporting unit is determined to be less than the carrying value of its net assets, goodwill is deemed\nimpaired and an impairment loss is recognized to the extent that the carrying value of goodwill exceeds the difference between the fair value of the reporting unit and the\nfair value of its other assets and liabilities. In accordance with the “Segment Reporting” Topic of the ASC, the Company’s chief operating decision maker (the Company’s\nChief Executive Officer) determined that there is only one reporting unit.\nThe Company’s annual impairment analysis includes a qualitative assessment to determine if it is necessary to perform the quantitative impairment test. In performing\na qualitative assessment, the Company reviewed events and circumstances that could affect the significant inputs used to determine if the fair value is less than the carrying\nvalue of goodwill. As a result of this qualitative assessment, the Company determined that a triggering event had occurred to necessitate performing the quantitative\nimpairment test. After performing the quantitative impairment test in accordance with ASC 350-20-35-3C, the Company determined that goodwill was impaired by\n$10,183. As a result of the impairment losses recognized, the carrying amount of the Company’s goodwill was reduced to $9,581 as of December 31, 2022.\nF-11\nThe following table provides a breakdown of the change in goodwill for the year ended December 31, 2022:\n2022\nSound Concepts Solofire Total\nBeginning Balance $ 3,427 $ 16,337 $ 19,764\nImpairment loss recognized during the period (1,665) (8,518) (10,183)\nEnding Balance $ 1,762 $ 7,819 $ 9,581\nOn June 13, 2023, the Company entered into a definitive agreement to sell all of the operating assets and liabilities of the SaaS business to SW Sales for $6,500,\nincluding $4,750 of cash paid upon closing. The operations of the SaaS business have been presented within discontinued operations. Upon completion of the sale of assets\nto SW Sales, in which the buyer assumed all liabilities related to the SaaS business, the Company recorded an impairment of $5,441 within loss from discontinued\noperations as the carrying amount of the net assets exceeded the sale price, less selling costs.\nLong-Lived Assets\nThe Company evaluates long-lived assets, other than goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances\nindicate that their net book value may not be recoverable. When such factors and circumstances exist, the Company compares the projected undiscounted future cash flows\nassociated with the related asset or group of assets over their estimated useful lives against their respective carrying amount. Impairment, if any, is based on the excess of\nthe carrying amount over the fair value, based on market value when available, or discounted expected cash flows, of those assets and is recorded in the period in which the\ndetermination is made.\nIn December 2022, the Company recognized an impairment loss of $1,340, net of accumulated amortization of $4,560, on its finite lived intangible assets that had\nbeen recognized as part of the Sound Concepts acquisition in 2019. As a result of the impairment losses recognized, the carrying amount of the Company’s consolidated\ndefinite lived intangible assets were reduced to $833 as of December 31, 2022.\nOn June 13, 2023, the Company entered into a definitive agreement to sell all of the operating assets and liabilities of the SaaS business to SW Sales for $6,500,\nincluding $4,750 of cash paid upon closing. The operations of the SaaS business have been presented within discontinued operations. Upon completion of the sale of assets\nto SW Sales, in which the buyer assumed all liabilities related to the SaaS business, the Company recorded an impairment of $5,441 within loss from discontinued\noperations as the carrying amount of the net assets exceeded the sale price, less selling costs.\nLeases\nThe Company leases certain corporate office space under lease agreements with monthly payments over a period of 36 months. The Company determines whether a\ncontract contains a lease at contract inception. A contract is or contains a lease if the contract conveys the right to control the use of the identified asset for a period of time\nin exchange for consideration. Control is determined based on the right to obtain all of the economic benefits from use of the identified asset and the right to direct the use\nof the identified asset. Operating lease right-of-use assets (“ROU”) for operating leases represent the right to use an underlying asset for the lease term, and operating lease\nliabilities represent the obligation to make lease payments. Lease liabilities are recognized based on the present value of the future minimum lease payments over the lease\nterm at the commencement date. Operating lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term and is included in the general and administrative line in\nthe Company’s consolidated statements of operations.\nIncome Taxes\nThe Company accounts for income taxes under FASB ASC 740, Income Taxes. Under the asset and liability method of ASC 740, deferred tax assets and liabilities are\nrecognized for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the financial statements or tax returns. Under this method, deferred tax assets and\nliabilities are determined based on the differences between the financial reporting and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which\nthe differences are expected to reverse. The deferred tax assets of the Company relate primarily to operating loss carry-forwards for federal and state income tax purposes.\nA full valuation allowance for deferred tax assets has been provided because the Company believes it is not more likely than not that the deferred tax asset will be realized.\nRealization of deferred tax assets is dependent on the Company generating sufficient taxable income in future periods.\nThe Company periodically evaluates its tax positions to determine whether it is more likely than not that such positions would be sustained upon examination by a tax\nauthority for all open tax years, as defined by the statute of limitations, based on their technical merits. The Company accrues interest and penalties, if incurred, on\nunrecognized tax benefits as components of the income tax provision in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. As of December 31, 2023, and 2022, the\nCompany has not established a liability for uncertain tax positions.\nReclassification for Discontinued Operations\nPursuant to ASC 740, Income Taxes, the 2022 tax footnote disclosure has been reclassified to reflect the presentation of continuing and discontinued operations\nseparately for the Company’s composition of its deferred tax balances and the rate reconciliation table. See Note 15 – Income Taxes.\nAdjustment\nDuring the preparation of the Company’s 2023 consolidated financial statements, the Company identified an adjustment with respect to its 2022 income tax accounting\nfootnote. Accordingly, we have adjusted the 2022 income tax footnote (See Note 15 – Income Taxes) for the increases to both the deferred tax asset and associated\nvaluation allowance by approximately $5.5 million. The adjustment had no impact to the Company’s consolidated balance sheet, statement of operations, or its statement of\ncash flows.\nF-12\nPreferred Stock\nThe Company applies the accounting standards for distinguishing liabilities from equity when determining the classification and measurement of its preferred stock.\nPreferred shares subject to mandatory redemption are classified as liability instruments and are measured at fair value. Conditionally redeemable preferred shares\n(including preferred shares that feature redemption rights that are either within the control of the holder or subject to redemption upon the occurrence of uncertain events\nnot solely within the Company’s control) are classified as temporary equity. At all other times, preferred shares are classified as part of stockholders’ equity. Accordingly,\nthe Series C Preferred Stock offering on December 29, 2023 is classified as part of stockholders’ equity as of December 31, 2023.\nFair Value of Financial Instruments\nThe Company follows the guidance of FASB ASC 820 (“ASC 820”) and FASB ASC 825 for disclosure and measurement of the fair value of its financial instruments.\nASC 820 establishes a framework for measuring fair value under GAAP and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. To increase consistency and\ncomparability in fair value measurements and related disclosures, ASC 820 establishes a fair value hierarchy which prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to\nmeasure fair value into three (3) broad levels. The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or\nliabilities and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs.\nThe three (3) levels of fair value hierarchy defined by ASC 820 are described below:\nLevel 1:Quoted market prices available in active markets for identical assets or liabilities as of the reporting date.\nLevel 2:Pricing inputs other than quoted prices in active markets included in Level 1, which are either directly or indirectly observable as of the reporting date.\nLevel 3:Pricing inputs that are generally unobservable inputs and not corroborated by market data.\nThe carrying amount of the Company’s financial assets and liabilities, such as cash, prepaid expenses and other current assets, accounts payable, and accrued expenses\napproximate their fair value due to their short-term nature. The carrying amount of the Company’s financial obligations approximate their fair values due to the fact that the\ninterest rates on these obligations are based on prevailing market interest rates. The Company uses Level 2 inputs for its valuation methodology for the derivative\nliabilities.\nDerivative Financial Instruments\nThe Company evaluates its financial instruments to determine if such instruments are derivatives or contain features that qualify as embedded derivatives. For\nderivative financial instruments that are accounted for as liabilities, the derivative instrument is initially recorded at its fair value and is then re-valued at each reporting\ndate, with changes in the fair value reported in the consolidated statements of operations. The classification of derivative instruments, including whether such instruments\nshould be recorded as liabilities or as equity, is evaluated at the end of each reporting period. Derivative instrument liabilities are classified in the consolidated balance\nsheet as current or non-current based on whether or not net-cash settlement of the derivative instrument could be required within 12 months of the balance sheet date.\nThe Company uses Level 2 inputs for its valuation methodology for the derivative liabilities as their fair values were determined by using a Binomial pricing model.\nThe Company’s derivative liabilities are adjusted to reflect fair value at each period end, with any increase or decrease in the fair value being recorded in results of\noperations as adjusted to fair value of derivatives.\nShare-Based Compensation\nThe Company issues stock options, warrants, shares of common stock and restricted stock units as share-based compensation to employees and non-employees. The\nCompany accounts for its share-based compensation in accordance with FASB ASC 718, Compensation – Stock Compensation. Share-based compensation cost is\nmeasured at the grant date, based on the estimated fair value of the award, and is recognized as expense over the requisite service period. The fair value of restricted stock\nunits is determined based on the number of shares granted and the quoted price of its common stock and is recognized as expense over the service period. Forfeitures are\naccounted for as they occur. Recognition of compensation expense for non-employees is in the same period and manner as if the Company had paid cash for services.\nF-13\nNet Loss Per Share\nBasic net loss per share is computed by using the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted net loss per share is computed\ngiving effect to all dilutive potential shares of common stock that were outstanding during the period. Dilutive potential shares of common stock consist of incremental\nshares of common stock issuable upon exercise or conversion.\nAs of December 31, 2023, and 2022, the Company had total outstanding options of 2,086,882 and 139,054, respectively, outstanding warrants of 919,664 and 952,638,\nrespectively, outstanding restricted stock units of 153,366 and 89,898, respectively, the Notes that are convertible into 0 and 11,329 shares at $120.00 per share,\nrespectively, and convertible notes issued to a related party that are convertible into 0 and 20,784 shares at $41.20 per share, respectively, which were all excluded from the\ncomputation of net loss per share because they are anti-dilutive due to the Company’s net loss position during the reported periods.\nConcentration of Credit and Other Risks\nFinancial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist of cash and accounts receivable. Cash is deposited with a limited\nnumber of financial institutions. The balances held at any one financial institution at times may be in excess of Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”) insurance\nlimits of up to $250.\nThe Company extends limited credit to customers based on an evaluation of their financial condition and other factors. The Company generally does not require\ncollateral or other security to support accounts receivable. The Company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers and maintains an allowance for doubtful\naccounts and sales credits. The Company believes that any concentration of credit risk in its accounts receivable is substantially mitigated by the Company’s evaluation\nprocess, relatively short collection terms and the high level of credit worthiness of its customers.\nThe Company’s concentration of credit risk includes its concentrations from key customers and vendors. The details of these significant customers and vendors are\npresented in the following table for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022:\nYears Ended December 31,\n2023 2022\nThe Company’s largest customers are\npresented below as a percentage of the\naggregate\nRevenues and Accounts receivable No customers individually over 10% No customers individually over 10%\nThe Company’s largest vendors are presented\nbelow as a percentage of the aggregate\nOne vendor that accounted for 20% of its One vendor that accounted for 22% of its\nPurchases purchases individually and in the aggregate purchases individually and in the aggregate\nF-14\nSupplemental Cash Flow Information\nYears Ended December 31,\n2023 2022\nSupplemental disclosures of cash flow information:\nCash paid for interest $ 399 $ 359\nCash paid for income taxes $ 2 $ 1\nSupplemental disclosure of non-cash investing and financing activities attributable to\ncontinuing operations:\nFair value of common shares issued to settle accounts payable and accrued expenses 346 465\nFair value of common shares issued as payment on notes payable 5,097 -\nDerecognition of operating lease right-of-use asset 1,186 -\nDerecognition of operating lease liabilities 1,870 -\nDerecognition of other assets and liabilities related to lease termination 421 -\nRecognition of operating lease right-of-use asset and related lease liability 245 -\nFair value of common stock received in exchange for employee’s payroll taxes - 12\nAccrued capitalized software development costs - 215\nDiscount recognized from convertible notes payable - 300\nDiscount recognized from notes payable - 450\nUnpaid offering costs related to common stock offerings 105 -\nUnpaid offering costs related to preferred stock offering 180 -\nSupplemental disclosure of non-cash investing and financing activities attributable to\ndiscontinued operations:\nDiscount recognized from advances on future receipts 558 997\nDerecognition of operating lease right-of-use assets - 543\nDerecognition of operating lease liabilities - 521\nRecognition of operating lease right-of-use asset and related lease liability $ - $ 212\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nRecently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements\nIn August 2020, the FASB issued ASU No. 2020-06 (“ASU 2020-06”) “Debt—Debt with Conversion and Other Options (Subtopic 470-20) and Derivatives and\nHedging—Contracts in Entity’s Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40).” ASU 2020-06 reduces the number of accounting models for convertible debt instruments by eliminating\nthe cash conversion and beneficial conversion models. As a result, a convertible debt instrument will be accounted for as a single liability measured at its amortized cost as\nlong as no other features require bifurcation and recognition as derivatives. By removing those separation models, the effective interest rate of convertible debt instruments\nwill be closer to the coupon interest rate. Further, the diluted net income per share calculation for convertible instruments will require the Company to use the if-converted\nmethod. ASU 2020-06 will be effective January 1, 2024, for the Company and is to be adopted through a cumulative-effect adjustment to the opening balance of retained\nearnings. Early adoption is permitted, but no earlier than January 1, 2021, including interim periods within that year. Effective January 1, 2022, the Company early adopted\nASU 2020-06 and that adoption did not have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements or the related disclosures.\nIn May 2021, the FASB issued ASU 2021-04, Earnings Per Share (Topic 260), Debt—Modifications and Extinguishments (Subtopic 470-50), Compensation—Stock\nCompensation (Topic 718), and Derivatives and Hedging—Contracts in Entity’s Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40): Issuer’s Accounting for Certain Modifications or\nExchanges of Freestanding Equity-Classified Written Call Options. ASU 2021-04 provides clarification and reduces diversity in an issuer’s accounting for modifications or\nexchanges of freestanding equity-classified written call options (such as warrants) that remain equity classified after modification or exchange. An issuer measures the\neffect of a modification or exchange as the difference between the fair value of the modified or exchanged warrant and the fair value of that warrant immediately before\nmodification or exchange. ASU 2021-04 introduces a recognition model that comprises four categories of transactions and the corresponding accounting treatment for each\ncategory (equity issuance, debt origination, debt modification, and modifications unrelated to equity issuance and debt origination or modification). ASU 2021-04 is\neffective for all entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2021, including interim periods within those fiscal years. An entity should apply the guidance\nprovided in ASU 2021-04 prospectively to modifications or exchanges occurring on or after the effective date. The Company adopted ASU 2021-04 effective January 1,\n2022. The adoption of ASU 2021-04 did not have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements or the related disclosures.\nF-15\nIn October 2021, the FASB issued ASU 2021-08, Business Combinations (Topic 805): Accounting for Contract Assets and Contract Liabilities from Contracts with\nCustomers. ASU 2021-08 will require companies to recognize and measure contract assets and contract liabilities relating to contracts with customers that are acquired in a\nbusiness combination in accordance with ASC 606. Under current GAAP, an acquirer generally recognizes assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business\ncombination, including contract assets and contract liabilities arising from revenue contracts with customers, at fair value on the acquisition date. ASU No. 2021-08 will\nresult in the acquirer recording acquired contract assets and liabilities on the same basis that would have been recorded by the acquiree before the acquisition under ASC\nTopic 606. The ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022, with early adoption permitted. The Company adopted ASU 2021-08 effective January\n1, 2022 on a prospective basis and the adoption impact of the new standard will depend on the magnitude of future acquisitions. The standard did not impact acquired\ncontract assets or liabilities from business combinations occurring prior to the adoption date.\nIn June 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13, Credit Losses – Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments (“ASC 326”). The standard significantly\nchanges how entities will measure credit losses for most financial assets, including accounts and notes receivables. The standard will replace today’s “incurred loss”\napproach with an “expected loss” model, under which companies will recognize allowances based on expected rather than incurred losses. Entities will apply the standard’s\nprovisions as a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of the first reporting period in which the guidance is effective. The Company adopted\nASU 2016-13 effective January 1, 2023. The adoption of ASU 2016-13 did not have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements or the related\ndisclosures.\nOther recent accounting pronouncements issued by the FASB, including its Emerging Issues Task Force, the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, and\nthe Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) did not or are not believed by management to have a material impact on the Company’s present or future\nconsolidated financial statements.\n3. CAPITALIZED SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT COSTS\nIn 2020, the Company began developing MARKET.live, a livestream ecommerce platform, and has capitalized $7,131 and $7,108 of internal and external\ndevelopment costs as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. In October 2021, the Company entered into a 10-year license and services agreement with a third party\n(the “Primary Contractor”) to develop on a work-for-hire basis certain components of MARKET.live.

INCOME TAXES\nAs of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the total current state tax expense is $2 and $1, respectively. There are no current federal taxes payable and no federal or state\ndeferred taxes.\nThe items accounting for the difference between income taxes computed at the federal statutory rate and the provision for income taxes attributable to continuing\noperations were as follows:\nYears Ended December 31,\n2023 2022\nStatutory federal income tax rate 21.0% 21.0%\nState taxes, net of federal benefit 2.2% 2.3%\nNon-deductible items (1.0)% (1.1)%\nChange in valuation allowance (20.5)% (22.2)%\nPrior year true up (1.7)% 0.0%\nEffective income tax rate 0.0% 0.0%\nThe items accounting for the difference between income taxes computed at the federal statutory rate and the provision for income taxes attributable to discontinued\noperations were as follows:\nYears Ended December 31,\n2023 2022\nStatutory federal income tax rate 21.0% 21.0%\nState taxes, net of federal benefit 2.2% 2.3%\nGoodwill and intangible assets 16.7% (13.0)%\nChange in valuation allowance (39.9)% (10.3)%\nPrior year true up 0.0% 0.0%\nEffective income tax rate 0.0% 0.0%\nSignificant components of the Company’s deferred tax assets and liabilities related to continuing operations are as follows:\nYears Ended December 31,\n2023 2022\nNet operating loss carry-forwards $ 30,863 $ 23,651\nShare based compensation 1,385 1,019\nLong-lived assets 115 663\nSection 174 R&D amortization 1,837 -\nOther temporary differences 426 198\nLess: Valuation allowance (34,626) (25,531)\nDeferred tax assets, net $ - $ -\nSignificant components of the Company’s deferred tax assets and liabilities related to discontinued operations are as follows:\nYears Ended December 31,\n2023 2022\nNet operating loss carry-forwards $ - $ -\nShare based compensation - -\nLong-lived assets - 3,309\nSection 174 R&D amortization - -\nOther temporary differences - 91\nLess: Valuation allowance - (3,400)\nDeferred tax assets, net $ - $ -\nASC 740 requires that the tax benefit of net operating loss carry-forwards be recorded as an asset to the extent that management assesses that realization is “more\nlikely than not.” Realization of the future tax benefits is dependent on the Company’s ability to generate sufficient taxable income within the carry forward period. Because\nof the Company’s recent history of operating losses, management believes that recognition of the deferred tax assets arising from the above-mentioned future tax benefits is\ncurrently not likely to be realized and, accordingly, recorded a 100% valuation allowance against all deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2023 amounting to $34.6\nmillion.\nAny uncertain tax positions would be related to tax years that remain open and subject to examination by the relevant tax authorities. The Company has no liabilities\nrelated to uncertain tax positions or unrecognized benefits for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022.\nF-30\nAs of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the Company had federal net operating loss carry-forwards of approximately $127.5 million and $92.6 million, respectively, and\nstate net operating loss carry-forwards of approximately $83.3 million and $67.9 million, respectively, which may be available to offset future taxable income for tax\npurposes. As of December 31, 2023, approximately $12.5 million of federal net operating loss carry-forwards begin to expire in 2034. While the remaining amount of\napproximately $115.0 million does not expire, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 limits the amount of federal net operating loss utilized each year after December 31, 2017\nto 80% of taxable income. As of December 31, 2023, approximately $31.7 million of state net operating loss carry-forwards begin to expire in 2031.\nNet operating loss carryforwards may be limited upon the ownership change under IRS Section 382. IRS Section 382 places limitations (the “Section 382 Limitation”)\non the amount of taxable income which can be offset by net operating loss carry-forwards after a change in control (generally greater than 50% change in ownership) of a\nloss corporation. Generally, after a change in control, a loss corporation cannot deduct operating loss carry-forwards in excess of the Section 382 Limitation. Due to these\n“change in ownership” provisions, utilization of the net operating loss may be subject to an annual limitation regarding their utilization against taxable income in future\nperiods. The Company has not concluded its analysis of Section 382 through December 31, 2023 but believes the provisions will not limit the availability of losses to offset\nfuture income.\nThe Company is subject to income taxes in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and the state of Nevada. The tax regulations within each jurisdiction are subject to\ninterpretation of related tax laws and regulations and require significant judgment to apply. As of December 31, 2023, tax years 2019 through 2022 remain open for IRS\naudit. The Company has not received any notice of audit from the IRS or state authorities for any of the open tax years.\n16.

The Company disputed the former employee’s\nclaims and interposed several affirmative defenses, including that the claims are contradicted by documentary evidence, barred by the applicable statute of limitations, and\nbarred by a written, executed release. On February 9, 2021, the former employee’s counsel filed a motion for summary judgment, or in the alternative, summary\nadjudication against the Company. On October 13, 2021, the California court issued an order (i) denying the former employee’s motion for summary judgment on his\nclaims against the Company, but (ii) granting the former employee’s motion to dismiss the Company’s affirmative defenses, which ruling the Company contends was in\nerror. Under the rules, the Company is precluded from appealing the dismissal of its affirmative defenses until after a trial. On August 29, 2023 after a bench trial at which\nthe Company was precluded from introducing evidence of its affirmative defenses, the court found in favor of Plaintiff Meyerson; and judgment was entered in Meyerson’s\nfavor in the amount of $584 which included interest. Meyerson’s counsel thereafter submitted an untimely request for attorney’s fees and costs which the Company has\nopposed. As of this date, that motion has yet to be decided. After the trial, the Company filed a timely appeal from the judgment (Meyerson v. Verb Technology Company,\nInc. (2023 2nd Appellate District) Case No.: B334777, seeking among other things, that the trial court’s finding be vacated and that the Company’s affirmative defenses be\nreinstated. As of this date, the appeal has yet to be heard. The Company has accrued the liability at December 31, 2023 and believe the accrual is adequate pending the\noutcome of the appeal process.\nb. Legal Malpractice Action\nThe Company was involved in a dispute with Baker Hostetler LLP (“BH”) relating to corporate legal services provided by BH to the Company. The Company filed its\ncomplaint in the Superior Court of California for the County of Los Angeles on May 17, 2021, styled Verb Technology Company, Inc. v. Baker Hostetler LLP, et al. (Case\nNo. 21STCV18387). The Company’s complaint arises from BH’s alleged legal malpractice, breach of fiduciary duties owed to the Company, breach of contract, and\nviolations of California’s Business and Professions Code Section 17200 et seq. The Company was seeking, amongst other things, compensatory damages from BH. On\nOctober 5, 2021, BH filed a cross-complaint against the Company alleging, amongst other things, that the Company owes it approximately $915 in legal fees. The\nCompany disputed owing this amount to BH. On March 1, 2023, BH and the Company entered into an out of court settlement and the Company agreed to pay $25 on\nexecution of the settlement agreement and $6.25 per month over a period of 12 months with a total settlement amount of $100. The remaining unpaid settlement amount of\n$31 was accrued by the Company as of December 31, 2023.\nc. Dispute with Warrant Holder\nThe Company is currently in a dispute with Iroquois Capital Investment Group LLC and Iroquois Master Fund, Ltd (collectively, “Iroquois”) relating to a securities\npurchase agreement (the “SPA”) entered between the Company, Iroquois and certain other investors. The Company filed a complaint in the Supreme Court of New York\nfor the County of New York on April 6, 2022, styled Verb Technology Company, Inc. v. Iroquois Capital Investment Group LLC, et al. (Index No. 651708/2022). The\nCompany’s complaint seeks a judicial declaration of its duties and obligations under the SPA. On May 5, 2022, Iroquois filed counterclaims against the Company for\ndeclaratory relief, breach of contract, and breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing relating to the SPA. Iroquois alleges damages of $1,500. The\nCompany disputes Iroquois’ counterclaims and damages allegations. On September 19, 2023, the Company and Iroquois agreed to a settlement of the matter and an\nexchange of general releases. Pursuant to the settlement, the Company issued 183,486 shares to Iroquois and certain other investors. The fair market value of the shares\nissued was based on the closing price of the Company’s common stock on the date of the settlement, which amounted to $200. In exchange for the shares, 32,140 warrants\nwere cancelled as part of the settlement agreement.\nF-31\nFrom time to time, the Company is involved in various other legal proceedings, disputes or claims arising from or related to the normal course of its business activities.\nAlthough the results of legal proceedings, disputes and other claims cannot be predicted with certainty, the Company believes it is not currently a party to any other legal\nproceedings, disputes or claims which, if determined adversely to the Company, would, individually or taken together, have a material adverse effect on the Company’s\nbusiness, operating results, financial condition or cash flows. However, regardless of the merit of the claims raised or the outcome, legal proceedings may have an adverse\nimpact on the Company as a result of defense and settlement costs, diversion of management time and resources, and other factors.\nBoard of Directors\nThe Company has committed an aggregate of $250 in board fees to its three board members over the term of their appointment for services to be rendered. Board fees\nare accrued and paid monthly. The members will serve on the board until the annual meeting for the year in which their term expires or until their successors has been\nelected and qualified.\nOn November 17, 2022, the board of directors approved a cost savings plan to improve the Company’s liquidity and preserve cash for operations. In connection with\nthe cost savings plan, the board agreed to accept a 25% reduction in cash compensation over a four-month period. In consideration of the reduction in cash compensation,\nthe board will be compensated with equity award grants.\nTotal board fees expensed and paid in 2023 totaled $312.\n17.

Purpose. The purpose of this Verb Technology Company, Inc. (the “Company”) Clawback Policy (this “Policy”) is to enable the Company to recover Erroneously\nAwarded Compensation from Covered Executive Officers in the event that the Company is required to prepare an Accounting Restatement. This Policy is designed\nto comply with, and shall be interpreted to be consistent with, Section 954 of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010, as codified\nin Section 10D of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), Rule 10D-1 promulgated under the Exchange Act (“Rule 10D-1”) and\nListing Rule 5608 of the corporate governance rules of The Nasdaq Stock Market (“Nasdaq”) (the “Listing Standards”). Unless otherwise defined in this Policy,\ncapitalized terms shall have the meaning ascribed to such terms in Section 2.\n2. Definitions. As used in this Policy, the following capitalized terms shall have the meanings set forth below.\na. “Accounting Restatement” means an accounting restatement of the Company’s financial statements due to the Company’s material noncompliance with any\nfinancial reporting requirement under the securities laws, including any required accounting restatement to correct an error in previously issued financial\nstatements that is material to the previously issued financial statements (i.e., a “Big R” restatement), or to correct an error that is not material to the previously\nissued financial statements, but that would result in a material misstatement if the error were corrected in the current period or left uncorrected in the current\nperiod (i.e., a “little r” restatement).\nb. “Accounting Restatement Date” means the earlier to occur of (i) the date the Board, a committee of the Board, or the officer or officers of the Company\nauthorized to take such action if the Board’s action is not required, concludes, or reasonably should have concluded, that the Company is required to prepare an\nAccounting Restatement and (ii) the date a court, regulator, or other legally authorized body directs the Company to prepare an Accounting Restatement.\nc. “Applicable Period” means, with respect to any Accounting Restatement, the three completed fiscal years immediately preceding the Accounting Restatement\nDate, as well as any transition period (that results from a change in the Company’s fiscal year) within or immediately following those three completed fiscal\nyears (except that a transition period that comprises a period of at least nine months shall count as a completed fiscal year).\nd. “Board” means the board of directors of the Company.\ne. “Code” means the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. Any reference to a section of the Code or regulation thereunder includes such section or\nregulation, any valid regulation or other official guidance promulgated under such section, and any comparable provision of any future legislation or regulation\namending, supplementing, or superseding such section or regulation.\nf. “Covered Executive Officer” means an individual who is currently or previously served as the Company’s principal executive officer, principal financial officer,\nprincipal accounting officer (or, if there is no such accounting officer, the controller), vice president of the Company in charge of a principal business unit,\ndivision, or function (such as sales, administration, or finance), an officer who performs (or performed) a policy-making function, or any other person who\nperforms (or performed) similar policy-making functions for the Company or is otherwise determined to be an executive officer of the Company pursuant to Item\n401(b) of Regulation S-K. An executive officer of the Company’s parent or subsidiary is deemed a “Covered Executive Officer” if the executive officer performs\n(or performed) such policy- making functions for the Company.\ng. “Erroneously Awarded Compensation” means, in the event of an Accounting Restatement, the amount of Incentive-Based Compensation previously received that\nexceeds the amount of Incentive-Based Compensation that otherwise would have been received had it been determined based on the restated amounts in such\nAccounting Restatement, and must be computed without regard to any taxes paid by the relevant Covered Executive Officer; provided, however, that for\nIncentive-Based Compensation based on stock price or total stockholder return, where the amount of Erroneously Awarded Compensation is not subject to\nmathematical recalculation directly from the information in an Accounting Restatement: (i) the amount of Erroneously Awarded Compensation must be based on\na reasonable estimate of the effect of the Accounting Restatement on the stock price or total stockholder return upon which the Incentive-Based Compensation\nwas received and (ii) the Company must maintain documentation of the determination of that reasonable estimate and provide such documentation to Nasdaq.\nh. “Financial Reporting Measure” means any measure that is determined and presented in accordance with the accounting principles used in preparing the\nCompany’s financial statements and any measure that is derived wholly or in part from such measure. A Financial Reporting Measure is not required to be\npresented within the Company’s financial statements or included in a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to qualify as a “Financial\nReporting Measure.”\ni. “Incentive-Based Compensation” means any compensation that is granted, earned, or vested based wholly or in part upon the attainment of a Financial Reporting\nMeasure. Incentive-Based Compensation is deemed “received” for purposes of this Policy in the Company’s fiscal period during which the Financial Reporting\nMeasure specified in the Incentive-Based Compensation award is attained, even if the payment or grant of such Incentive-Based Compensation occurs after the\nend of that period.\n3. Administration. This Policy shall be administered by the Board, the Compensation Committee of the Board (the “Compensation Committee”), the Audit Committee\nof the Board (the “Audit Committee”) or a special committee comprised of members of the Compensation Committee and Audit Committee. For purposes of this\nPolicy, the body charged with administering this Policy shall be referred to herein as the “Administrator.” The Administrator is authorized to interpret and construe\nthis Policy and to make all determinations necessary, appropriate or advisable for the administration of this Policy, in each case, to the extent permitted under the\nListing Standards and in compliance with (or pursuant to an exemption from the application of) Section 409A of the Code. All determinations and decisions made by\nthe Administrator pursuant to the provisions of this Policy shall be final, conclusive and binding on all persons, including the Company, its affiliates, its stockholders\nand Covered Executive Officers, and need not be uniform with respect to each person covered by this Policy.\nIn the administration of this Policy, the Administrator is authorized and directed to consult with the full Board or such other committees of the Board as may be\nnecessary or appropriate as to matters within the scope of such other committee’s responsibility and authority. Subject to any limitation at applicable law, the\nAdministrator may authorize and empower any officer or employee of the Company to take any and all actions necessary or appropriate to carry out the purpose and\nintent of this Policy (other than with respect to any recovery under this Policy involving such officer or employee). Any action or inaction by the Administrator with\nrespect to a Covered Executive Officer under this Policy in no way limits the Administrator’s decision to act or not to act with respect to any other Covered\nExecutive Officer under this Policy or under any similar policy, agreement or arrangement, nor shall any such action or inaction serve as a waiver of any rights the\nCompany may have against any Covered Executive Officer other than as set forth in this Policy.\n4. Application of this Policy. This Policy applies to all Incentive-Based Compensation received by a person: (a) after beginning service as a Covered Executive Officer;\n(b) who served as a Covered Executive Officer at any time during the performance period for such Incentive-Based Compensation; (c) while the Company had a\nlisted class of securities on a national securities exchange; and (d) during the Applicable Period. For the avoidance of doubt, Incentive-Based Compensation that is\nsubject to both a Financial Reporting Measure vesting condition and a service-based vesting condition shall be considered received when the relevant Financial\nReporting Measure is achieved, even if the Incentive-Based Compensation continues to be subject to the service-based vesting condition.\n5. Recovery Erroneously Awarded Compensation. In the event of an Accounting Restatement, the Company must recover Erroneously Awarded Compensation\nreasonably promptly, in amounts determined pursuant to this Policy. The Company’s obligation to recover Erroneously Awarded Compensation is not dependent on\nthe filing of restated financial statements. Recovery under this Policy with respect to a Covered Executive Officer shall not require the finding of any misconduct by\nsuch Covered Executive Officer or such Covered Executive Officer being found responsible for the accounting error leading to an Accounting Restatement. In the\nevent of an Accounting Restatement, the method for recouping Erroneously Awarded Compensation shall be determined by the Administrator in its sole and absolute\ndiscretion, to the extent permitted under the Listing Standards and in compliance with (or pursuant to an exemption from the application of) Section 409A of the\nCode.\nRecovery may include, without limitation, (i) reimbursement of all or a portion of any incentive compensation award, (ii) cancellation of incentive compensation\nawards and (iii) any other method authorized by applicable law or contract.\nThe Company is authorized and directed pursuant to this Policy to recover Erroneously Awarded Compensation in compliance with this Policy unless the Compensation\nCommittee has determined that recovery would be impracticable solely for the following limited reasons, and subject to the following procedural and disclosure requirements:\na. The direct expenses paid to a third party to assist in enforcing this Policy would exceed the amount to be recovered. Before reaching such conclusion, the\nAdministrator must make a reasonable attempt to recover such Erroneously Awarded Compensation, document such reasonable attempt(s) to recover, and provide\nthat documentation to Nasdaq;\nb. Recovery would violate home country law where that law was adopted prior to November 28, 2022. Before reaching such conclusion, the Administrator must\nobtain an opinion of home country counsel, acceptable to Nasdaq, that recovery would result in such a violation, and must provide such opinion to Nasdaq; or\nc. Recovery would likely cause an otherwise tax-qualified retirement plan, under which benefits are broadly available to employees of the Company, to fail to meet\nthe requirements of Section 401(a)(13) or Section 411(a) of the Code.\n6. Prohibition on Indemnification and Insurance Reimbursement. The Company is prohibited from indemnifying any Covered Executive Officer against the loss of any\nErroneously Awarded Compensation. Further, the Company is prohibited from paying or reimbursing a Covered Executive Officer for the cost of purchasing\ninsurance to cover any such loss. The Company is also prohibited from entering into any agreement or arrangement whereby this Policy would not apply or fail to be\nenforced against a Covered Executive Officer.\n7. Required Policy-Related Disclosure and Filings. The Company shall file all disclosures with respect to this Policy in accordance with the requirements of the federal\nsecurities laws, including disclosures required by U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filings. A copy of this Policy and any amendments hereto shall be\nposted on the Company’s website and filed as an exhibit to the Company’s annual report on Form 10-K.\n8. Acknowledgement. Each Covered Executive Officer shall sign and return to the Company within thirty (30) calendar days following the later of (i) the effective date\nof this Policy set forth below or (ii) the date such individual becomes a Covered Executive Officer, the Acknowledgement Form attached hereto as Exhibit A,\npursuant to which the Covered Executive Officer agrees to be bound by, and to comply with, the terms and conditions of this Policy.\n9. Amendment; Termination. The Board may amend this Policy from time to time in its sole and absolute discretion and shall amend this Policy as it deems necessary\nto reflect the Listing Standards or to comply with (or maintain an exemption from the application of) Section 409A of the Code. The Board may terminate this Policy\nat any time; provided, that the termination of this Policy would not cause the Company to violate any federal securities laws, or rules promulgated by the U.S.\nSecurities and Exchange Commission or the Listing Standards.\n10. Other Recovery Obligations; General Rights. The Board intends that this Policy shall be applied to the fullest extent of the law. To the extent that the application of\nthis Policy would provide for recovery of Incentive- Based Compensation that the Company already recovered pursuant to Section 304 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act or\nother recovery obligations, any such amount recovered from a Covered Executive Officer will be credited to any recovery required under this Policy in respect of\nsuch Covered Executive Officer.\n11. Effective Date. This Policy shall be effective as of November 15, 2023. The terms of this Policy shall apply to any Incentive- Based Compensation that is received by\nCovered Executive Officers on or after October 2, 2023, even if such Incentive-Based Compensation was approved, awarded or granted to Covered Executive\nOfficers prior to such date.\nThis Policy shall not limit the rights of the Company to take any other actions or pursue other remedies that the Company may deem appropriate under the circumstances and\nunder applicable law, in each case, to the extent permitted under the Listing Standards and in compliance with (or pursuant to an exemption from the application of) Section\n409A of the Code.\nThis Policy is binding and enforceable against all Covered Executive Officers and their beneficiaries, heirs, executors, administrators or other legal representatives."
