(“Murano” or the “Company”), a London headquartered real estate company that owns, develops and invests in hotel, resort and commercial properties throughout Mexico, announces today that it has completed its business combination with HCM Acquisition Corp (NASDAQ: HCMA) (“HCM”), a special purpose acquisition company.\n\nThe business combination was approved by HCMA stockholders in a special meeting held on March 5th 2024. The combined company will operate as Murano Global Investments and its common stock and warrants will begin trading on Thursday, March 21, 2024 on the Nasdaq Capital Market under the ticker symbols “MRNO” and “MRNOW”, respectively.\n\n“Becoming a publicly listed company represents an important milestone for our organization as it opens up a new source of capital and significantly enhances the international profile of the Company, which will help to advance our growth plans,” said Elias Sacal, CEO of Murano. “With a portfolio that includes two premium-branded hotels located in the heart of Mexico City, an all-inclusive luxury resort in Cancun, and a pipeline of compelling projects in Cancun and Bajamar with world-class operators, we are primed to steadily expand our portfolio in top tourist destinations across Mexico.\n\nMarcos Sacal, COO of Murano, commented, “Our expertise is large-scale real estate projects, and we believe that as a publicly traded company we will have an unmatched ability to develop outstanding assets. We look forward to continuing to leverage our deep industry and market knowledge as well as our longstanding relationships to capitalize on the opportunities ahead. We also believe that the deep real estate expertise that has been developed in Mexico is transferable to other markets throughout the world.”\n\nShawn Matthews, CEO of HCM stated, “Murano Global Investments is one of the very few entities that have the vision, experience and professional network to succeed in Mexico’s nuanced real estate development and hospitality market. It is these differentiators that initially drew us to the company, and having gotten to know the team better over the course of this process, I’m confident it will succeed in executing its growth strategy. We look forward to continuing to offer our support along the way as shareholders, advisors and friends.”\n\nAs a public company, Murano Global Investments will focus on advancing its promising development projects, expanding its relationship with global hospitality brands and identifying attractive investment opportunities that align with its long-term growth strategy.\n\n**About Murano Global Investments** Murano Global Investments (Nasdaq: MRNO) is a real estate company that owns, develops and invests in hotel, resort and commercial properties throughout Mexico. Over the last 20+ years, Murano’s experienced management team has deployed more than $2 billion in total capitalization for the acquisition, repositioning and development of transformational real estate projects.
