Nov. 15th, 10am ET\nHolmdel, NJ – November 14, 2024 – BIO-key® International, Inc. (Nasdaq: BKYI), an innovative provider of\nworkforce and customer Identity and Access Management (IAM) solutions featuring passwordless, phoneless\nand token-less Identity-Bound Biometric (IBB) authentication, announced results for its third quarter ended\nSeptember 30, 2024 (Q3’24). BIO-key’s 2023 Q3 and nine month results were restated and filed with the\nCompany’s 2023 Form 10-K and are reflected in this release. BIO-key will host an investor call tomorrow, Friday,\nNovember 15th at 10:00am ET (details below).\nFinancial Highlights\n• Q3’24 revenues rose 18% to $2.1M from $1.8M in Q3’23, principally due to a $0.5M increase in license\nrevenue related to expanded software deployments by long-term customers.\n• Gross profit improved to $1.7M (78.3% gross margin) in Q3’24 vs. $0.3M (18.7% gross margin) in Q3’23,\ndue to an increase in high-margin license revenue, lower costs to support deployments, and a $1M\nhardware reserve taken in the prior-year period.\n• BIO-key trimmed Q3’24 operating expenses by $46,000 versus Q3’23, reflecting proactive reductions in\nadministration, sales personnel costs and marketing show expenses, offset by higher professional\nservices expenses principally related to financing activities.\n• BIO-key reported a Q3’24 net loss of $0.7M compared to a Q3’23 net loss of $1.8M, due primarily to an\nincrease in high-margin license revenue, level operating expenses, and the prior-year hardware reserve.\n• Cash used in operating activities was $2.4M through the first nine months of 2024 vs. $2.3M in the prior-\nyear period. The current-year period reflects BIO-key’s net loss through the first nine months and positive\nadjustments for non-cash expenses of approximately $667,000.\nRecent Highlights\n• Following the close of Q3’24, BIO-key Secured a $910k Order to Upgrade a Long-time Financial Services\nCustomer to its Enhanced Biometric Customer Identification Technology\n• A Leading International Defense Ministry Awarded BIO-key $500k in Follow-On Orders for Biometric User\nAuthentication\n• British Columbia Added 10,000 Users to its BIO-key Biometric Solution Deployment for Sign-on and\nPhysical Access Control\n• BIO-key’s PortalGuard Identity and Access Management Solution and Identity-Bound Biometrics Became\nAvailable on the Amazon Web Services (AWS) Marketplace\n• Williamsburg, VA advanced its Zero Trust initiative with BIO-key’s Identity-Bound Biometrics.\n• BIO-key Raised $1.9M in Gross Proceeds via Warrant Inducement\nCommentary\nBIO-key CEO, Mike DePasquale commented, “We had a very productive third quarter, with revenue increasing\n18% year-over-year and $1M compared to Q2’24, supported by license fee revenue which rose to $1.4M in\nQ3’24 from $1.0M in Q3’23. Our Q3’24 revenues reflected strength in orders from existing customers who\nare expanding their deployment of BIO-key solutions. This momentum continued into Q4 with an exciting\norder from a long-time foreign financial services customer to utilize our biometric identification technology\nfor customer identification within their branches.\n“This firm has already enrolled the fingerprint biometrics of over 25M of its customers using BIO-key\ntechnology as part of its know your customer (KYC) process. They are now upgrading to BIO-key’s “fingerprint\nonly” identification solution which will enable them to identify each of their customers with just a fingerprint\nscan, eliminating the need for a bank card, account or ID number. This highly secure and efficient identification\napproach is expected to save an estimated thirty seconds per client encounter, benefiting both customers and\nbank personnel.\n“We believe this is one of the world’s largest deployments of one-to-many biometric technology in a private\ncommercial or enterprise setting, as compared to one-to-one matching of a fingerprint scan with a biometric\nassociated with an account, ID number or card. Working with the client and our partner at AWS, we intend to\npublish a more detailed whitepaper on this deployment to fully explain the unique benefits our advanced\nbiometric identity solutions can provide to other enterprises. We are of course very excited about this large-\nscale adoption of our technology and look to leverage the value and benefits of use in this example for our\ndirect and Channel Alliance Partner (CAP) sales programs.\n“Given the nature of our size and the timing and impact of larger customer orders, we do expect our\nperformance to vary on a quarter-to-quarter basis as we build a growing base of high-margin, annually\nrecurring revenue streams from software licenses and services. We expect full year 2024 revenues to meet\nor exceed the $7.75M achieved in 2023, and we continue to pursue opportunities to lower our overhead and\nvariable costs, as we progress the business toward positive operating cash flow and profitability in the coming\nquarters. Additionally, we continue to seek potential strategic opportunities that can leverage our core\nstrengths and business platform to create value for our shareholders.\n“From a financial perspective, we were able to raise $1.9M during the third quarter through a warrant\ninducement agreement, pursuant to which an existing institutional investor exercised warrants to purchase\n1,030,556 BIO-key shares at $1.85 per share. Reflecting these proceeds, our cash position improved to $1.8M\nat close of Q3’24 vs. $0.5M at year end 2023.”\nFinancial Results\nBIO-key’s Q3’24 revenues increased 18% to $2.1M from $1.8M in Q3’23. License revenue increased $491,000\nor 52% to $1.4M and hardware sales increased 56% to $436,000, as several long-term customers expanded\ntheir license deployments and purchased additional biometric readers. Declines in recurring and non-\nrecurring service revenues of $320,522 stemmed from the loss of one large recurring service agreement and\none large customization customer from the prior-year period. For the nine months ended September 30,\n2024, revenues were $5.5M compared to $5.9M in the comparable 2023 period, as increased license fees and\nhardware revenue was offset by lower service revenues.\nQ3’24 Gross profit was $1.7M (78.3% gross margin) versus $0.3M (18.7% gross margin) in Q3’23, primarily\nreflecting the impact of a $1M hardware reserve in Q3’23, a higher proportion of high margin license fee\nrevenue in Q3’24, and lower costs to support deployments, including license fees for third-party software\nincluded in BIO-key’s Swivel Secure offerings.\nBIO-key trimmed operating expenses by $46,000 in Q3’24 versus Q3’23, reflecting reductions in\nadministration expenses, including lower headquarters expense, sales personnel costs, and marketing show\nexpenses, partially offset by an increase in professional services, principally related to the Company’s\nfinancing activities. Also offsetting lower SG&A costs was a $122,000 increase in research, development and\nengineering expense due to increased personnel costs to support new product development.\nReflecting higher revenue and gross profit and flat operating expenses, BIO-key’s net loss improved to $0.7M,\nor $0.39 per share, in Q3’24, from a net loss of $1.8M, or $3.22 per share, in Q3’23. Likewise, BIO-key reduced\nits net loss for the first nine months of 2024 to $2.9M, or $1.69 per share, compared to a net loss of $6.1M,\nor $10.79 per share, in the first nine months of 2023. Q3’23 results included the hardware reserve of $1.0M\nand the first nine months of 2023 included a hardware reserve of $2.5M.\nBalance Sheet\nAt September 30, 2024, BIO-key had current assets of approximately $4.6M, including $1.8M of cash and cash\nequivalents, $2.0M of net accounts receivable and due from factor, and $387,000 of inventory. This compares\nto current assets of $2.6M at December 31, 2023, including approximately $511,000 of cash equivalents,\n$1.3M of net accounts receivable and due from factor, and $446,000 of inventory.\nConference Call Details\nDate / Time: Friday, November 15th at 10 a.m. ET\nCall Dial In #: 1-877-418-5460 U.S. or 1-412-717-9594 Int’l\nLive Webcast / Replay: Webcast & Replay Link – Available for 3 months.\nAudio Replay: 1-877-344-7529 U.S. or 1-412-317-0088 Int’l; code 7307131\nAbout BIO-key International, Inc.

          "content": "BIO-key Secures $910,000 Order to Upgrade Long-Time Financial\nServices Customer to Enhanced Biometric Customer Identification Technology\nHolmdel, NJ – October 29, 2024 - BIO-key® International, Inc. (NASDAQ: BKYI), an innovative provider of\nworkforce and customer identity and access management (IAM) solutions featuring Identity-Bound\nBiometrics (IBB) for phoneless, tokenless, passwordless and phish-resistant authentication, announced\nthat it has received a $910,000 order from a long-term financial services customer to upgrade to BIO-key’s\n“fingerprint only” Biometric Customer Identification Technology.\nThe technology enhancement builds on the customer’s expanding deployment of BIO-key technology to\nverify the identity of customers, now totaling over 25 million enrolled individuals. Previously customers\nwere verified at a branch location by matching their fingerprint scan and their ID number, account number\nor card. By upgrading to BIO-key’s “fingerprint only” identification, the customer will be able to identify\neach of its clients by a simple fingerprint scan – without the need for a card, account or ID number, saving\nan estimated thirty seconds per client encounter.\nThe financial services customer plans to upgrade all its users to BIO-key’s fingerprint-only identity solution\nin order to further streamline what is already a best-in-class client experience of its existing BIO-key-based\nverification solution. The new client identification solution will be entirely hosted on Amazon Web Services\n(AWS) infrastructure in order to support the technical demands of real-time, one-to-many biometric\nidentification as compared to one-to-one matching of a fingerprint scan with a biometric associated with\nan account number, ID number or card.\nFollowing full deployment of the enhanced biometric customer identification solution during 2025, BIO-\nkey expects annual recurring revenue (ARR) from this financial services customer to increase to\napproximately $1.4M per year.\n“This financial services customer remains on the cutting edge of biometric technology deployment as it\nworks to deliver the best possible customer experience and protection against fraud”, said Jim Sullivan,\nBIO-key’s SVP of Strategy and CLO. “After closely working with our team on advance testing, they found\nthat upgrading to BIO-key’s one-to-many fingerprint-only identification technology would not only provide\na better user experience but would also save a substantial amount of time at every client encounter,\navoiding the time to retrieve a physical ID card. BIO-key’s unparalleled accuracy in identification and speed\nof indexed search makes this leap in efficient customer engagement possible. The upgrade advances our\ncustomer’s commitment to leveraging the power of biometric technology to execute secure digital, paper-\nless transactions for their clients. We believe this is one of the world’s largest deployments of one-to-many\nbiometric technology in a private commercial or enterprise setting. Working with the client and our\npartner at AWS, we intend to publish a more detailed whitepaper on this deployment in order to support\nother enterprises’ understanding the benefits our advanced biometric identity solutions can provide.”\nAbout BIO-key International, Inc.

(NASDAQ: BKYI), an\ninnovative provider of workforce and customer identity and access management (IAM) solutions\nfeaturing phoneless, tokenless, passwordless and phish-resistant authentication solutions,\nannounced the company will sponsor, speak, and exhibit at ISC2 Security Congress 2024, in Las\nVegas on October 14 – 16, 2024. BIO-key will be hosting a session on Passkeys. Passkeys and zero\ntrust are core enabling concepts of the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)\nguidance on cybersecurity for digital identities. Passkeys are identified as aiding adherence to NIST\nAuthentication Assurance Levels (AAL) standards in the NIST 800-63B Passkey Supplementary\nGuidelines released in May 2024.\nPasskeys have historically been stored or secured by phones, personal laptops or hardware\ntokens but many enterprise users work in phone-free, roving user environments. The cost of\nhardware tokens for thousands of users becomes a drain on critical security budgets. BIO-\nkey’s core differentiator in the authentication category is allowing users to take advantage of a\nbiometric passwordless authentication solution that does not require the use of phones or tokens.\nThis unique capability fills a crucial business use case gap that traditional MFA overlooks – roving\nusers working without phones, providing a secure authentication experience that reduces the total\ncost of ownership and provides the highest levels of usability and security. BIO-key’s award-winning\nunified IAM platform, PortalGuard®, has helped organizations of all sizes balance risk with flexibility\nand productivity for users and identity administrators. The company’s newest offering, Passkey:YOU\nbrings a phoneless, tokenless, passwordless experience to any IdP via a managed passkey secured\nby a touch of a fingerprint or any door badge.\nThe ISC Security Congress, themed “Boldly Forward,” brings together thousands of cybersecurity\n2\nprofessionals and inspires attendees from all stages of the cybersecurity profession to elevate their\ncareers, providing the opportunity to acquire new strategies, skills, and expertise to overcome the\nindustry’s most pressing challenges.\n“Continuous Education is vital for security professionals to stay ahead of innovative threat actors,”\nstates BIO-key’s Director of Marketing, Mary Roark, CISSP. “Conferences such as this provide\nattendees with interactive sessions where everyone can learn something new and put it into practice\nas soon as they return to the office.”\nAttendees are encouraged to stop by booth 716 or join the virtual conference to learn about BIO-\nkey’s IAM solutions and the new Passkey: YOU. If you plan to attend the event, we invite you to our\nlive speaking session: \"Introducing Passkey:YOU – a Passwordless Authentication Solution that\nChecks All the Boxes.\" Join us on Monday, October 14, from 12:45 to 1:10 PM PT in Theatre 1.\n“From shared workstations to remote access, to users prohibited from having phones or tokens,\nenterprises face a complex and ever-changing landscape of access requirements,” said Galen\nRodgers, VP of North America Sales & Channel. “Traditional authentication methods are insufficient,\nso security leaders attending ISC2 are exploring solutions that can offer flexibility to accommodate\nthe needs of diverse users and use cases while maintaining the highest level of security. BIO-key is\nconfident that adding passkeys and biometric authentication will accelerate their zero trust\nstrategies.”\nRESOURCES:\nhttps://www.bio-key.com/identity-bound-biometrics/passkey-authentication/\nAbout BIO-key International, Inc.

          "content": "CASE STUDY\nKrumland Auto Group\nAbout Company\nIndustry: Automotive retailer and dealer\nLocation: Roswell, New Mexico\nFounded in 1952, Krumland Auto Group (\"Krumland”) has established itself as a reputable and customer-centric\nautomotive dealership group, serving the community with a wide range of high-quality vehicles and exceptional service.\nWith a rich history spanning over seven decades, Krumland has evolved into a trusted name in the automotive industry,\nknown for its dedication to customer satisfaction and its extensive inventory of new and used vehicles. The company's\ncommitment to exceptional customer service has earned it a loyal clientele and numerous accolades over the years,\nmaking it a trusted destination for automotive needs in the region.\nIn the fall of 2021, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) proposed an amendment to the Safeguards Rule, requiring\nnon-financial institutions engaged in financial transactions to develop, implement, and maintain a comprehensive\nsecurity program to safeguard customer information. Krumland took proactive measures to enhance its data security\nprotocols to comply with this new regulation. One crucial aspect was the implementation of multi-factor authentication\n1\n(MFA) for anyone accessing customer information. Among various vendor options available, the company selected\nBIO-key's PortalGuard IDaaS, a solution that fulfilled its core authentication security requirements while enhancing the\nuser experience.\nPortalGuard’s flexible MFA methods include phoneless, tokenless, and passwordless Identity-Bound Biometrics (IBB)\nthat seamlessly integrated with the company's IT workflows and systems, ensuring the highest level of security while\nmaintaining operational efficiency. Unlike any other product or solution in the authentication category, BIO-key’s IBB\nprovides a FIDO2-compliant passwordless authentication option, which allows users to take advantage of a true\nbiometric passwordless authentication solution that does not require the use of phones or tokens to assist in the\nauthentication process. With phish-resistant MFA and passwordless authentication top of mind for organizations of all\nsizes and across all industries, Krumland addressed a critical business use case that traditional MFA overlooks – users\nwho cannot use a phone or token to authenticate.\nKey Issues & Existing Challenges Addressed by PortalGuard\nAs the deadline loomed for compliance with the FTC's Safeguards Rule, Krumland faced the challenge of identifying a suitable\nmulti-factor authentication (MFA) solution that could meet their requirements and be implemented before the deadline.\nKrumland had specific criteria for their MFA solution, emphasizing the need for a comprehensive and flexible system capable of\nsecuring desktops, web applications, remote access, and remote desktops. It was also critical to be able to fully integrate with\ntheir existing Microsoft Active Directory servers and Cisco Systems VPN Client was crucial to their decision-making process.\nPerhaps of the utmost importance, however, was finding a solution to fit the needs of the company’s technicians. Many of the IAM\noptions on the market could only address some of Krumland’s unique requirements – such as employees being unable to use\nmobile devices or fingerprint readers for authentication – and BIO-key emerged as the comprehensive solution to the company’s\nsecurity challenges.\nThe PortalGuard Resolution\nBefore engaging with BIO-key, Krumland had initially provided its end users with SMS one-time passcodes for multi-factor\nauthentication; however, it became clear to the company’s IT team that a more sophisticated security solution was needed to\naddress their security requirements while improving the user experience. With a diverse group of users across the Accounting,\nSales, and Manufacturing departments, the company required a solution that support vastly different use cases and environments\nwhile adhering to new government compliance regulations and cybersecurity insurance requirements.\n2\nIn 2021, Krumland deployed PortalGuard for multi-factor authentication – supported by the additional layer of security provided by\nIBB – which was critical to securing roving user access on the shop floor and shared workstations on the sales floor. The company\nimplemented IBB authentication supported by BIO-key’s PIV-Pro and SideSwipe fingerprint readers at each workstation. Employees\non the shop floor were no longer concerned with using their mobile devices to authenticate with the quick, simple fingerprint scan;\nevery user could access applications and data seamlessly while avoiding using less secure authentication methods.\nIn addition, Krumland’s shop technicians required additional authentication options to support their unique use case, as many\nwork in hostile environments, wearing protective clothing and gloves. Leveraging the authentication flexibility of PortalGuard,\nBIO-key’s implementation team provided the company with additional configuration options to ensure secure and seamless access\nto applications and data throughout the workday.\n“It prevented us from losing millions of dollars in lost revenue due to the new MFA requirements placed on dealerships like ours.\nForcing technicians to remove their gear just to access their phones would create a tremendous loss of productivity for them, which\nin turn would cost us money.” – IT Director, Krumland Auto Group\nBased on the number of technicians at Krumland, the average number of times per day a desktop screen locks, and the amount of\ntime it takes to remove and then re-apply protective gear, BIO-key helped the company save over $6M annually.\nIn less than 60 days, Krumland was fully deployed with PortalGuard and Identity-Bound Biometrics – enabling MFA authentication\nfor its users before the required compliance deadline. With PortalGuard Desktop, the company could also implement MFA for\nworkstation access, bolstering security to sensitive information for remote access and remote desktops.\nTop reasons Krumland Auto Group selected BIO-key\nProvided the most compelling solution for a phoneless, tokenless, and passwordless MFA solution to\nmeet its government compliance regulations and cybersecurity insurance requirements\nUnrivalled deployment options to address unique use cases\nEasy integration and management for the IT team\nRapid implementation and return on investment\n3"
