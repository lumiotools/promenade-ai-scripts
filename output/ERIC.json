The analysis is included among a wealth of statistical network insights in the November 2024 edition of the Ericsson (NASDAQ: ERIC) Mobility Report, which extends the forecast period until the end of 2030.\n\nWhile the rate of mobile network traffic data growth is declining - estimated at 21 percent year-on year for 2024 - it is still expected to grow almost three-fold by the end of 2030 from present day numbers.\n\nThe report highlights how early-mover service providers are already offering value delivery models based on differentiated connectivity - guaranteed uninterrupted high-end connectivity when you need it most - to create new monetization and growth opportunities. Related case studies from T-Mobile in the U.S. and Elisa in Finland are included.\n\nFredrik Jejdling, Executive Vice President, Head of Business Area Networks, Ericsson, says: \"Service differentiation and performance-based opportunities are crucial as our industry evolves. This is highlighted in the November 2024 Ericsson Mobility Report, which includes detailed analysis, statistical insights, and customer use cases. The shift towards high-performing programmable networks, enabled by openness and cloud, will empower service providers to offer and charge for services based on the value delivered, not merely data volume. This report offers valuable insights into what our industry can achieve and the steps necessary to get there.\"\n\nThe report underlines the global potential for differentiated connectivity development by highlighting that, beyond China, 5G mid-band is currently only deployed at about 30 percent of sites globally.\n\nOf about 320 CSPs currently offering commercial 5G services, less than 20 percent are 5G SA. The densification of mid-band and 5G SA sites is seen as a key catalyst to capitalize on the full potential of 5G, including programmable and intelligent network capabilities.\n\nAlmost 60 percent of the 6.3 billion global 5G subscriptions forecast by the end of 2030 are expected to be 5G Standalone (SA) subscriptions.\n\nOn global mobile data traffic, 5G networks are expected to carry about 80 percent of total mobile data traffic by the end of 2030 - compared to 34 percent by the end of 2024.\n\nFixed Wireless Access (FWA) continues to grow in popularity globally as the second largest 5G use case after enhanced Mobile Broadband (eMBB).\n\nIn four out of six regions, more than 80 percent of CSPs now offer FWA. The number of FWA service providers offering speed-based tariff plans - with downlink and uplink data parameters similar to cable or fiber offerings - has increased from 30 percent to 43 percent in the last year alone.\n\nWestern Europe has witnessed rapid growth in FWA speed-based offerings with 52 percent of CSPs in the region now doing so compared to 32 percent a year ago. Europe alone accounts for 73 percent of all 5G FWA launches globally in the past 12 months.\n\nOf the 350 million projected global FWA connections by the end of 2030, almost 80 percent are forecast to be over 5G.\n\nThe report also addresses how AI, including Generative AI Applications - already integrated across smartphones, laptops, watches and FWA products - could impact uplink and downlink network traffic, driving potential mobile traffic growth beyond current baseline predictions.\n\nOther featured report statistics include the projection that global 5G subscriptions are expected to reach almost 2.3 billion by the end of 2024, amounting to 25 percent of all global mobile subscriptions. 5G subscription numbers are expected to overtake the global number of 4G subscriptions during 2027.\n\nThe first 6G deployments are expected in 2030, building on and scaling the capabilities of 5G SA and 5G Advanced.\n\nThe 40-page report includes three case study articles:\n\n  * T-Mobile takes network slicing from pilots to real-world scenarios (with T-Mobile in the U.S. About network slicing use cases.)\n  * Premium FWA services enabled in Finland with 5G SA (with Elisa in Finland. About Elisa’s 5G SA FWA offering.)\n  * A multi-New Radio (NR) carrier strategy for best performance (with stc in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA).\n\n\n\nEricsson will host Ericsson Mobility Report online seminars at 09.00 (CET) and at 18.00 (CET) on Tuesday, December 3.

This is in support of PSA Singapore’s (PSA) plans to build the world’s largest fully automated port by the 2040s to meet the rapidly rising demand for global transshipment. Existing automated vehicles deployed at the port, such as Automated Guided Vehicles (AGVs) will be upgraded to 5G to enhance real-time shipment tracking and further streamline crane operations to enable seamless transportation of cargo from berth to ships and vice versa.\n\nTo support these enhancements, Singtel will activate a network slice from its 5G network to provide the dedicated resources, like high speeds, high bandwidth, and low latency, needed for mission-critical applications to run smoothly around the clock. It will also create secure private networks tailored to the port’s specific security needs, to help mitigate the risk of data breaches and unauthorised access.\n\n5G will be an enabler for PSA to achieve an annual handling capacity of 65 million twenty-foot equivalent units (TEUs), almost double current demand, when Tuas Port is fully completed.\n\nMr Ng Tian Chong, CEO Singtel Singapore, said, “5G’s high speeds and low latency help to improve real-time communication and data transfer which enables highly efficient port operations. With network slicing, these capabilities are augmented with increased security features and higher performance assurance. As a homegrown technology company, we are proud to help PSA scale its operations, boost trade in the region, and further strengthen Singapore’s position as a leading port globally.” \n\nMr Nelson Quek, Regional CEO, Southeast Asia at PSA International said, “As a forward-thinking organisation and early adopter of innovative solutions and digitalisation, PSA continuously seeks and embraces cutting-edge technologies to advance our port operations. We are pleased to be working with Singtel and Ericsson to deploy a 5G network at Tuas Port to support our growing fleet of Automated Guided Vehicles. Leveraging 5G’s rapid data transmission and connectivity capabilities, PSA aims to further streamline operations and optimise resource utilisation through real-time monitoring, enabling us to respond agilely to the evolving needs of our customers and stakeholders.”\n\nMr Daniel Ode, Head of Singapore, Philippines and Brunei, Ericsson said, “5G has been enabling the digital transformation of various industries, from manufacturing, power and utilities, mining, to airports and seaports. The seaport sector, with its complex operations and reliance on real-time data, is benefiting significantly from 5G capabilities. At PSA, automated vehicles moving cargo seamlessly across the port will enable PSA to scale its operations, eliminate human errors and increase efficiency.”\n\nOver the next three years, PSA will also be exploring 5G applications in areas such as predictive maintenance, which involves drone-based surveillance and extended reality applications, to detect potential issues early and pre-empt equipment failure, thereby improving efficiency and reducing costly downtime.\n\n##### Smoother, more optimised operations with 5G\n\nContainer throughput at ports worldwide is estimated to total 906 million TEUs by the end of 2024. As of October 2024, PSA Singapore had handled 34.1 million – one of the busiest in the world. Singapore’s seaport, one of the most efficient globally, leverages automated cranes and vehicles, and smart logistics systems to enable faster, more precise handling of cargo. Tuas Port currently fully covered with triple-band 5G, 3.5GHz, 2.1GHz and newly available low band 700MHz.\n\nFrom 2025, guided by Singtel’s 5G network slicing capabilities, the PSA’s driverless AGVs will be capable of independently transporting containers, thereby optimising yard operations and reducing labour costs. The ultra-reliable and low-latency communication enables operators to manoeuvre massive cargo with precision from a safe distance, using remote-controlled cranes with the fastest response time. PSA will also be able to better process real-time shipment tracking data so berth planners can optimise scheduling and traffic flow for greater operational efficiency, even during high congestion periods.\n\n##### Boosting Singapore businesses’ digital transformation efforts\n\nSingtel has been at the forefront of investing in advanced technologies to deliver cutting-edge solutions that help enterprises accelerate digital transformation and streamline operations. In 2022, it achieved nationwide 5G standalone coverage and held 30 trials at Sentosa demonstrating viable 5G use cases for industries that require fast speeds and low latency for mission critical applications, such as homeland security.\n\nOver the years, Singtel has unlocked advanced 5G features like network slicing, paving the way for widespread enterprise adoption and unlocking new possibilities for innovation.\n\nFor more information, visit Singtel Network Slicing \n\n**About Singtel**\n\nSingtel is a leading Asian communications technology group, operating next-generation connectivity, digital infrastructure and digital businesses including regional data centre arm Nxera and regional IT services arm NCS.
