Pursuant to the Repurchase Program, the Company can repurchase up to $50 million worth of its common stock at the discretion of NMFC’s management team. The Repurchase Program was set to expire on December 31, 2024, but the Company’s board of directors elected to extend the Repurchase Program through December 31, 2025. Under the Repurchase Program, NMFC may, but is not obligated to, repurchase its outstanding common stock in the open market from time to time provided that NMFC complies with the prohibitions under its Code of Ethics and the guidelines specified in Rule 10b-18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, including certain price, market volume and timing constraints. Unless further extended by NMFC’s board of directors, the Company expects the Repurchase Program to be in place until the earlier of December 31, 2025 or until $50 million worth of NMFC’s outstanding shares of common stock have been repurchased. To date, approximately $2.9 million worth of repurchases have been made by the Company under the Repurchase Program. \n\nThe Company’s board of directors authorized the extension of the Repurchase Program because it believes that sustained market volatility and uncertainty may cause NMFC’s common stock to be undervalued from time to time. The timing and number of shares to be repurchased will depend on a number of factors, including market conditions and alternative investment opportunities. In addition, any subsequent repurchases will also be conducted in accordance with the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended. There are no assurances that the Company will engage in additional repurchases, but if market conditions warrant, the Company now has an extended period of time to take advantage of situations where NMFC’s management believes share repurchases would be advantageous to the Company and to its shareholders. \n\n**ABOUT NEW MOUNTAIN FINANCE CORPORATION**\n\nNew Mountain Finance Corporation (NASDAQ: NMFC) is a leading business development company (BDC) focused on providing direct lending solutions to U.S. middle market companies backed by top private equity sponsors.

Formation and Business Purpose\n\nNew Mountain Finance Corporation (“NMFC” or the “Company”) is a Delaware corporation that was originally incorporated on June 29, 2010 and completed its initial public offering (\"IPO\") on May 19, 2011. NMFC is a closed-end, non-diversified management investment company that has elected to be regulated as a business development company (“BDC”) under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the “1940 Act”). NMFC has elected to be treated, and intends to comply with the requirements to continue to qualify annually, as a regulated investment company (“RIC”) under Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”). Since NMFC’s IPO, and through September 30, 2024, NMFC has raised approximately $1,034,550 in net proceeds from additional offerings of its common stock.\n\nNew Mountain Finance Advisers, L.L.C. (the “Investment Adviser”), formerly known as New Mountain Finance Advisers BDC, L.L.C., is a wholly-owned subsidiary of New Mountain Capital Group, L.P. (together with New Mountain Capital, L.L.C. and its affiliates, \"New Mountain Capital\"), whose ultimate owners include Steven B. Klinsky, other current and former New Mountain Capital professionals and related vehicles and a minority investor. New Mountain Capital is a global investment firm with over $55 billion of assets under management and a track record of investing in the middle market. New Mountain Capital focuses on investing in defensive growth companies across its private equity, credit and net lease investment strategies. The Investment Adviser manages the Company's day-to-day operations and provides it with investment advisory and management services. The Investment Adviser also manages other funds that may have investment mandates that are similar, in whole or in part, to the Company's. New Mountain Finance Administration, L.L.C. (the \"Administrator”), a wholly-owned subsidiary of New Mountain Capital, provides the administrative services necessary to conduct the Company's day-to-day operations. \n\nThe Company has established the following wholly-owned direct and indirect subsidiaries:\n\n•New Mountain Finance Holdings, L.L.C. (\"NMF Holdings\") and New Mountain Finance DB, L.L.C. (\"NMFDB\"), whose assets are used to secure NMF Holdings’ credit facility and were used to secure NMFDB’s credit facility, until its termination on September 30, 2024, respectively;\n\n•New Mountain Finance SBIC, L.P. (\"SBIC I\") and New Mountain Finance SBIC II, L.P. (\"SBIC II\"), who have received licenses from the U.S. Small Business Administration (\"SBA\") to operate as small business investment companies (\"SBICs\") under Section 301(c) of the Small Business Investment Act of 1958, as amended (the \"1958 Act\"), and their general partners, New Mountain Finance SBIC G.P., L.L.C. (\"SBIC I GP\"), and New Mountain Finance SBIC II G.P., L.L.C. (\"SBIC II GP\"), respectively;\n\n•NMF Ancora Holdings, Inc. (\"NMF Ancora\"), NMF QID NGL Holdings, Inc. (\"NMF QID\"), NMF YP Holdings, Inc. (\"NMF YP\"), NMF Permian Holdings, LLC (\"NMF Permian\"), NMF HB, Inc. (\"NMF HB\"), NMF TRM, LLC (\"NMF TRM\"), NMF Pioneer, Inc. (\"NMF Pioneer\") and NMF OEC, Inc. (\"NMF OEC\"), which are treated as corporations for U.S. federal income tax purposes and are intended to facilitate our compliance with the requirements to be treated as a RIC under the Code by holding equity or equity related investments in portfolio companies organized as limited liability companies (or other forms of pass-through entities); the Company consolidates these corporations for accounting purposes but the corporations are not consolidated for U.S. federal income tax purposes and may incur U.S. federal income tax expense as a result of their ownership of the portfolio companies; and\n\n•New Mountain Finance Servicing, L.L.C. (\"NMF Servicing\"), which serves as the administrative agent on certain investment transactions.\n\nNew Mountain Net Lease Corporation (\"NMNLC\") is a majority-owned consolidated subsidiary of the Company, which acquires commercial real estate properties that are subject to \"triple net\" leases and has elected to be treated, and intends to comply with the requirements to continue to qualify annually, as a real estate investment trust, or REIT, within the meaning of Section 856(a) of the Code.\n\nNMFC is a BDC focused on providing direct lending solutions to U.S. upper middle market companies backed by private equity sponsors. The Company’s investment objective is to generate current income and capital appreciation through the sourcing and origination of senior secured loans and select junior capital positions, to growing businesses in defensive industries that offer attractive risk-adjusted returns. The Company’s investment approach leverages the deep sector knowledge and operating resources of New Mountain Capital.\n\n64\n\n[Table of Contents](#i72f805c51bb9408d93e6f5060262cdd1_10)\n\nSenior secured loans may include traditional first lien loans or unitranche loans. The Company invests a significant portion of its portfolio in unitranche loans, which are loans that combine both senior and subordinated debt, generally in a first-lien position. Because unitranche loans combine characteristics of senior and subordinated debt, they have risks similar to the risks associated with secured debt and subordinated debt. Certain unitranche loan investments may include “last-out” positions, which generally heighten the risk of loss. In some cases, the Company’s investments may also include equity interests.\n\nNMFC primarily invests in senior secured debt of U.S. sponsor-backed, middle market companies. We define middle market companies as those with annual earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (\"EBITDA\") of $10 million to $200 million. The Company focuses on defensive growth businesses that generally exhibit the following characteristics: (i) acyclicality, (ii) sustainable secular growth drivers, (iii) niche market dominance and high barriers to competitive entry, (iv) recurring revenue and strong free cash flow, (v) flexible cost structures and (vi) seasoned management teams.\n\nSimilar to the Company, the investment objective of SBIC I and SBIC II is to generate current income and capital appreciation under the investment criteria used by the Company. However, SBIC I and SBIC II investments must be in SBA eligible small businesses. The Company’s portfolio may be concentrated in a limited number of industries. As of September 30, 2024, the Company’s top five industry concentrations were software, business services, healthcare, investment funds (which includes the Company's investments in its joint ventures) and consumer services.\n\nNote 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\n\nBasis of accounting—The Company’s consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”). The Company is an investment company following accounting and reporting guidance in Accounting Standards Codification Topic 946, Financial Services—Investment Companies (“ASC 946”). The Company consolidates its wholly-owned direct and indirect subsidiaries: NMF Holdings, NMFDB, NMF Servicing, SBIC I, SBIC I GP, SBIC II, SBIC II GP, NMF Ancora, NMF QID, NMF YP, NMF Permian, NMF HB, NMF TRM, NMF Pioneer and NMF OEC and its majority-owned consolidated subsidiary: NMNLC. For majority-owned consolidated subsidiaries, the third-party equity interest is referred to as non-controlling interest. The net income attributable to non-controlling interests for such subsidiaries is presented as “Net increase (decrease) in net assets resulting from operations related to non-controlling interest” in the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Operations. The portion of shareholders' equity that is attributable to non-controlling interests for such subsidiaries is presented as “Non-controlling interest”, a component of total equity, on the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Assets and Liabilities.\n\nThe Company’s consolidated financial statements reflect all adjustments and reclassifications which, in the opinion of management, are necessary for the fair presentation of the results of operations and financial condition for all periods presented. All intercompany transactions have been eliminated. Revenues are recognized when earned and expenses when incurred. The financial results of the Company’s portfolio investments are not consolidated in the financial statements. \n\nThe Company’s interim consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP and pursuant to the requirements for reporting on Form 10-Q and Article 6 or 10 of Regulation S-X. Accordingly, the Company’s interim consolidated financial statements do not include all of the information and notes required by GAAP for annual financial statements. In the opinion of management, all adjustments, consisting solely of normal recurring accruals considered necessary for the fair presentation of financial statements for the interim period, have been included. The current period’s results of operations will not necessarily be indicative of results that ultimately may be achieved for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2024.\n\nInvestments—The Company applies fair value accounting in accordance with GAAP. Fair value is the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Investments are reflected on the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Assets and Liabilities at fair value, with changes in unrealized gains and losses resulting from changes in fair value reflected in the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Operations as “Net change in unrealized appreciation (depreciation) of investments” and realizations on portfolio investments reflected in the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Operations as “Net realized gains (losses) on investments”.\n\nThe Company values its assets on a quarterly basis, or more frequently if required under the 1940 Act. In all cases, the Company’s board of directors is ultimately and solely responsible for determining the fair value of the portfolio investments on a quarterly basis in good faith, including investments that are not publicly traded, those whose market prices are not readily available and any other situation where its portfolio investments require a fair value determination. Security transactions are accounted for on a trade date basis. The Company’s quarterly valuation procedures are set forth in more detail below:\n\n(1)Investments for which market quotations are readily available on an exchange are valued at such market quotations based on the closing price indicated from independent pricing services.\n\n65\n\n[Table of Contents](#i72f805c51bb9408d93e6f5060262cdd1_10)\n\n(2)Investments for which indicative prices are obtained from various pricing services and/or brokers or dealers are valued through a multi-step valuation process, as described below, to determine whether the quote(s) obtained is representative of fair value in accordance with GAAP.\n\na.Bond quotes are obtained through independent pricing services. Internal reviews are performed by the investment professionals of the Investment Adviser to ensure that the quote obtained is representative of fair value in accordance with GAAP and, if so, the quote is used. If the Investment Adviser is unable to sufficiently validate the quote(s) internally and if the investment’s par value or its fair value exceeds the materiality threshold, the investment is valued similarly to those assets with no readily available quotes (see (3) below); and\n\nb.For investments other than bonds, the Company looks at the number of quotes readily available and performs the following procedures:\n\ni.Investments for which two or more quotes are received from a pricing service are valued using the mean of the mean of the bid and ask of the quotes obtained. The Company will evaluate the reasonableness of the quote, and if the quote is determined to not be representative of fair value, the Company will use one or more of the methodologies outlined below to determine fair value; and\n\nii.Investments for which one quote is received from a pricing service are validated internally. The investment professionals of the Investment Adviser analyze the market quotes obtained using an array of valuation methods (further described below) to validate the fair value. If the Investment Adviser is unable to sufficiently validate the quote internally and if the investment’s par value or its fair value exceeds the materiality threshold, the investment is valued similarly to those assets with no readily available quotes (see (3) below).\n\n(3)Investments for which quotations are not readily available through exchanges, pricing services, brokers, or dealers are valued through a multi-step valuation process:\n\na.Each portfolio company or investment is initially valued by the investment professionals of the Investment Adviser responsible for the credit monitoring;\n\nb.Preliminary valuation conclusions will then be documented and discussed with the Company’s senior management;\n\nc.If an investment falls into (3) above for four consecutive quarters and if the investment’s par value or its fair value exceeds the materiality threshold, then at least once each fiscal year, the valuation for each portfolio investment for which the Company does not have a readily available market quotation will be reviewed by an independent valuation firm engaged by the Company’s board of directors; and\n\nd.When deemed appropriate by the Company’s management, an independent valuation firm may be engaged to review and value investment(s) of a portfolio company, without any preliminary valuation being performed by the Investment Adviser. The investment professionals of the Investment Adviser will review and validate the value provided.\n\nFor investments in revolving credit facilities and delayed draw commitments, the cost basis of the funded investments purchased is offset by any costs/netbacks received for any unfunded portion on the total balance committed. The fair value is also adjusted for the price appreciation or depreciation on the unfunded portion. As a result, the purchase of a commitment not completely funded may result in a negative fair value until it is called and funded.\n\nThe values assigned to investments are based upon available information and do not necessarily represent amounts which might ultimately be realized, since such amounts depend on future circumstances and cannot be reasonably determined until the individual positions are liquidated. Due to the inherent uncertainty of determining the fair value of investments that do not have a readily available market value, the fair value of the Company’s investments may fluctuate from period to period and the fluctuations could be material.\n\nSee Note 3. Investments, for further discussion relating to investments.\n\nDerivative instruments and hedging activities—The Company follows the guidance in Accounting Standards Codification Topic 815, Derivatives and Hedging (\"ASC 815\"), when accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities. The Company may utilize derivatives to support its overarching risk management objectives. The primary market risk that the Company is exposed to is interest rate risk, which we seek to mitigate through derivative transactions. \n\n66\n\n[Table of Contents](#i72f805c51bb9408d93e6f5060262cdd1_10)\n\nThe Company enters into derivative financial instruments to manage interest rate risk, facilitate asset/liability management strategies and manage other exposures. These instruments primarily include interest rate swaps. All derivative financial instruments are recognized as other assets or other liabilities, as applicable, at fair value.\n\nThe Company has entered into an International Swaps and Derivatives Association, Inc. 2002 Master Agreement, (together with the Schedule and Credit Support Annex thereto and any transactions thereunder, the \"ISDA Master Agreement\"), on March 18, 2024, with a derivative counterparty (the “ISDA Counterparty”). The ISDA Master Agreement is a bilateral agreement between the Company and the ISDA Counterparty that governs over-the-counter derivatives, into which the Company enters for hedging purposes. The ISDA Master Agreement provides for, among other things, collateral posting terms and netting provisions in the event of certain specified defaults and/or termination events, including bankruptcy or insolvency of the counterparty. The ISDA Master Agreement also includes termination rights that permit the termination of outstanding transactions by the ISDA Counterparty in the event the Company fails to maintain sufficient asset levels, and by the Company in the event the ISDA Counterparty is downgraded below a specified minimum rating level. The Company minimizes counterparty credit risk by only entering into agreements with counterparties that it believes to be of good standing and by monitoring the financial stability of those counterparties. The collateral terms of the ISDA Master Agreement provide for the bilateral posting of collateral in the form of cash or U.S. government securities for any outstanding exposure under the transactions. In the case of the Company, the agreement provides for the segregation of posted collateral at the Company’s custodian subject to a perfected security interest in favor of the ISDA Counterparty. Upon the close-out of the transactions outstanding under the ISDA Master Agreement following a default, the ISDA Master Agreement provides for a single net payment between the parties equal to the close-out replacement value of the terminated transactions, the right to offset receivables and payables with the same counterparty and/or the right to liquidate collateral. \n\nInterest rate swaps are agreements to exchange interest payments based upon notional amounts and subject the Company to market risk associated with changes in interest rates and changes in interest rate volatility, as well as the credit risk that the counterparty will fail to perform. The Company designates all interest rate swaps as hedging instruments in a qualifying fair value hedge accounting relationship. As a result, the change in fair value of the hedging instrument and hedged item are recorded in \"Interest expense\" and recognized as components of \"Interest expense\" in the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Operations. The fair value of the interest rate swap is included as a component of \"Derivative asset at fair value\" or \"Derivative liability at fair value\" on the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Assets and Liabilities. Derivative assets at fair value and derivative liabilities at fair value, including variation margin as applicable, are included in the \"Net change due to hedging activity\" line item in the operating section in the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.\n\nThe Company elected not to offset derivative assets and liabilities and cash collateral held with the same counterparty where it has a legally enforceable master netting agreement.\n\nRefer to Note 4. Fair Value and Note 7. Borrowings for more information on derivative instruments and hedging activities.\n\nNew Mountain Net Lease Corporation\n\nNMNLC was formed to acquire commercial real estate properties that are subject to \"triple net\" leases. NMNLC's investments as of September 30, 2024 are disclosed on the Company's Consolidated Schedule of Investments.\n\nOn March 30, 2020, an affiliate of the Investment Adviser purchased directly from NMNLC 105,030 shares of NMNLC’s common stock at a price of $107.73 per share, which represented the net asset value per share of NMNLC at the date of purchase, for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $11,315. Immediately thereafter, NMNLC redeemed 105,030 shares of its common stock held by NMFC in exchange for a promissory note with a principal amount of $11,315 and a 7.0% interest rate, which was repaid by NMNLC to NMFC on March 31, 2020. Effective July 1, 2024, NMNLC purchased 63,575 shares of NMNLC's common stock from an affiliate of the Investment Adviser at remaining original cost, a price of $73.39 per share, for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $4,666. Immediately thereafter, NMNLC sold 63,575 shares of its common stock to NMFC at remaining original cost, a price of $73.39 per share, for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $4,666.\n\n67\n\n[Table of Contents](#i72f805c51bb9408d93e6f5060262cdd1_10)\n\nBelow is certain summarized property information for NMNLC as of September 30, 2024:\n\nLease | Total | Fair Value as of  \n---|---|---  \nPortfolio Company| Tenant| Expiration Date| Location| Square Feet| September 30, 2024  \nNM NL Holdings LP / NM GP Holdco LLC| Various| Various| Various| Various| $| 104,888  \nNM CLFX LP| Victor Equipment Company| 8/31/2033| TX| 423| 10,031  \nNM YI, LLC| Young Innovations, Inc.| 10/31/2039| IL / MO| 212| 9,961  \n$| 124,880  \n  \nCollateralized agreements or repurchase financings—The Company follows the guidance in Accounting Standards Codification Topic 860, Transfers and Servicing—Secured Borrowing and Collateral (“ASC 860”), when accounting for transactions involving the purchases of securities under collateralized agreements to resell (resale agreements). These transactions are treated as collateralized financing transactions and are recorded at their contracted resale or repurchase amounts, as specified in the respective agreements. Interest on collateralized agreements is accrued and recognized over the life of the transaction and included in interest income. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company held one collateralized agreement to resell with a cost basis of $30,000 and $30,000, respectively, and a fair value of $13,500 and $16,500, respectively. The collateralized agreement to resell is on non-accrual. The collateralized agreement to resell is guaranteed by a private hedge fund, PPVA Fund, L.P. The private hedge fund is currently in liquidation under the laws of the Cayman Islands. Pursuant to the terms of the collateralized agreement, the private hedge fund was obligated to repurchase the collateral from the Company at the par value of the collateralized agreement. The private hedge fund has breached its agreement to repurchase the collateral under the collateralized agreement. The default by the private hedge fund did not release the collateral to the Company, and therefore, the Company does not have full rights and title to the collateral. A claim has been filed with the Cayman Islands joint official liquidators to resolve this matter. The joint official liquidators have recognized the Company’s contractual rights under the collateralized agreement. The Company continues to exercise its rights under the collateralized agreement and continues to monitor the liquidation process of the private hedge fund. The fair value of the collateralized agreement to resell is reflective of the increased risk of the position.\n\nCash and cash equivalents—Cash and cash equivalents include cash and short-term, highly liquid investments. The Company defines cash equivalents as securities that are readily convertible into known amounts of cash and so near maturity that there is insignificant risk of changes in value. These securities have original maturities of three months or less. The Company did not hold any cash equivalents as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023.\n\nRevenue recognition\n\nSales and paydowns of investments: Realized gains and losses on investments are determined on the specific identification method.\n\nInterest and dividend income: Interest income, including amortization of premium and discount using the effective interest method, is recorded on the accrual basis and periodically assessed for collectability. Interest income also includes interest earned from cash on hand. Upon the prepayment of a loan or debt security, any prepayment penalties are recorded as part of interest income. The Company has loans and certain preferred equity investments in the portfolio that contain a payment-in-kind (“PIK”) interest or dividend provision. PIK interest and dividends are accrued and recorded as income at the contractual rates, if deemed collectible. The PIK interest and dividends are added to the principal or share balances on the capitalization dates and are generally due at maturity or when redeemed by the issuer. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company recognized PIK and non-cash interest from investments of $9,050 and $27,735, respectively, and PIK and non-cash dividends from investments of $8,319 and $23,484, respectively. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Company recognized PIK and non-cash interest from investments of $7,917 and $24,807, respectively, and PIK and non-cash dividends from investments of $6,988 and $20,225, respectively.\n\nDividend income on common equity is recorded on the record date for private portfolio companies or on the ex-dividend date for publicly traded portfolio companies. Dividend income on preferred securities is recorded as dividend income on an accrual basis to the extent that such amounts are deemed collectible.\n\nNon-accrual income: Investments are placed on non-accrual status when principal or interest payments are past due for 30 days or more and when there is reasonable doubt that principal or interest will be collected. Accrued cash and un-capitalized PIK interest or dividends are reversed when an investment is placed on non-accrual status. Previously capitalized PIK interest or dividends are not reversed when an investment is placed on non-accrual status. Interest or dividend payments received on non-accrual investments may be recognized as income or applied to principal depending upon management’s judgment of the \n\n68\n\n[Table of Contents](#i72f805c51bb9408d93e6f5060262cdd1_10)\n\nultimate collectability. Non-accrual investments are restored to accrual status when past due principal and interest is paid and, in management’s judgment, are likely to remain current.\n\nOther income: Other income represents delayed compensation, consent or amendment fees, revolver fees, structuring fees, upfront fees and other miscellaneous fees received and are typically non-recurring in nature. Delayed compensation is income earned from counterparties on trades that do not settle within a set number of business days after the trade date. Other income may also include fees from bridge loans. The Company may from time to time enter into bridge financing commitments, an obligation to provide interim financing to a counterparty until permanent credit can be obtained. These commitments are short-term in nature and may expire unfunded. A fee is received by the Company for providing such commitments. Structuring fees and upfront fees are recognized as income when earned, usually when paid at the closing of the investment, and are non-refundable.\n\nInterest and other financing expenses—Interest and other financing fees are recorded on an accrual basis by the Company. See Note 7. Borrowings, for details.\n\nDeferred financing costs—The deferred financing costs of the Company consist of capitalized expenses related to the origination and amending of the Company’s borrowings. The Company amortizes these costs into expense over the stated life of the related borrowing. See Note 7. Borrowings, for details. \n\nDeferred offering costs—The Company's deferred offering costs consist of fees and expenses incurred in connection with equity offerings and the filing of shelf registration statements. Upon the issuance of shares, offering costs are charged as a direct reduction to net assets. Deferred offering costs are included in other assets on the Company's Consolidated Statements of Assets and Liabilities.\n\nIncome taxes—The Company has elected to be treated, and intends to comply with the requirements to qualify annually, as a RIC under Subchapter M of the Code. As a RIC, the Company is not subject to U.S. federal income tax on the portion of taxable income and gains timely distributed to its stockholders.\n\nTo continue to qualify and be subject to tax treatment as a RIC, the Company is required to meet certain income and asset diversification tests in addition to timely distributing at least 90.0% of its investment company taxable income, as defined by the Code. Since U.S. federal income tax regulations differ from GAAP, distributions in accordance with tax regulations may differ from net investment income and realized gains recognized for financial reporting purposes.\n\nDifferences between taxable income and the results of operations for financial reporting purposes may be permanent or temporary in nature. Permanent differences are reclassified among capital accounts in the financial statements to reflect their tax character. Differences in classification may also result from the treatment of short-term gains as ordinary income for U.S. federal income tax purposes.\n\nFor U.S. federal income tax purposes, distributions paid to stockholders of the Company are reported as ordinary income, return of capital, long term capital gains or a combination thereof.\n\nThe Company will be subject to a 4.0% nondeductible U.S. federal excise tax on certain undistributed income unless the Company distributes, in a timely manner as required by the Code, an amount at least equal to the sum of (1) 98.0% of its respective net ordinary income earned for the calendar year and (2) 98.2% of its respective capital gain net income for the one-year period ending October 31 in the calendar year.\n\nCertain consolidated subsidiaries of the Company are subject to U.S. federal and state income taxes. These taxable entities are not consolidated for U.S. federal income tax purposes and may generate income tax liabilities or assets from permanent and temporary differences in the recognition of items for financial reporting and U.S. federal income tax purposes.\n\nThe following table summarizes the current income tax expense (benefit), deferred income tax provision (benefit) and total income tax provision (benefit), for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023:\n\nThree Months Ended| Nine Months Ended  \n---|---  \nSeptember 30, 2024| September 30, 2023| September 30, 2024| September 30, 2023  \nCurrent income tax expense (benefit)| $| 118 | $| (627)| $| 353 | $| 401  \nDeferred income tax provision (benefit) | 1,037 | (291)| 1,804 | (66)  \nTotal income tax provision (benefit)| $| 1,155 | $| (918)| $| 2,157 | $| 335  \n  \n69\n\n[Table of Contents](#i72f805c51bb9408d93e6f5060262cdd1_10)\n\nAs of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company had $1,100 of deferred tax liabilities and $594 of deferred tax assets, respectively, primarily relating to deferred taxes attributable to certain differences between the computation of income for U.S. federal income tax purposes as compared to GAAP. \n\nBased on its analysis, the Company has determined that there were no uncertain income tax positions that do not meet the more likely than not threshold as defined by Accounting Standards Codification Topic 740, Income Taxes (\"ASC 740\") through December 31, 2023. The 2020 through 2023 tax years remain subject to examination by the U.S. federal, state, and local tax authorities.\n\nDistributions—Distributions to common stockholders of the Company are recorded on the record date as set by the board of directors. The Company intends to make distributions to its stockholders that will be sufficient to enable the Company to maintain its status as a RIC. The Company intends to distribute approximately all of its net investment income (see Note 5. Agreements, for details) on a quarterly basis and substantially all of its taxable income on an annual basis, except that the Company may retain certain net capital gains for reinvestment.\n\nThe Company has adopted a dividend reinvestment plan that provides for reinvestment of any distributions declared on behalf of its stockholders, unless a stockholder elects to receive cash.\n\nThe Company applies the following in implementing the dividend reinvestment plan. If the price at which newly issued shares are to be credited to stockholders' accounts is equal to or greater than 110.0% of the last determined net asset value of the shares, the Company will use only newly issued shares to implement its dividend reinvestment plan. Under such circumstances, the number of shares to be issued to a stockholder is determined by dividing the total dollar amount of the distribution payable to such stockholder by the market price per share of the Company's common stock on NASDAQ Global Select Market (\"NASDAQ\") on the distribution payment date. Market price per share on that date will be the closing price for such shares on NASDAQ or, if no sale is reported for such day, the average of their electronically reported bid and ask prices.\n\nIf the price at which newly issued shares are to be credited to stockholders' accounts is less than 110.0% of the last determined net asset value of the shares, the Company will either issue new shares or instruct the plan administrator to purchase shares in the open market to satisfy the additional shares required. Shares purchased in open market transactions by the plan administrator will be allocated to a stockholder based on the average purchase price, excluding any brokerage charges or other charges, of all shares of common stock purchased in the open market. The number of shares of the Company's common stock to be outstanding after giving effect to payment of the distribution cannot be established until the value per share at which additional shares will be issued has been determined and elections of the Company's stockholders have been tabulated.\n\nStock repurchase program—On February 4, 2016, the Company's board of directors authorized a program for the purpose of repurchasing up to $50,000 worth of the Company's common stock (the \"Repurchase Program\"). Under the Repurchase Program, the Company was permitted, but was not obligated, to repurchase its outstanding common stock in the open market from time to time provided that it complied with the Company's code of ethics and the guidelines specified in Rule 10b-18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the \"Exchange Act\"), including certain price, market volume and timing constraints. In addition, any repurchases were conducted in accordance with the 1940 Act. On October 23, 2024, the Company's board of directors extended the Company's Repurchase Program and the Company expects the Repurchase Program to be in place until the earlier of December 31, 2025 or until $50,000 of its outstanding shares of common stock have been repurchased. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, the Company did not repurchase any shares of the Company's common stock. The Company previously repurchased $2,948 outstanding shares of its common stock under the Repurchase Program.\n\nEarnings per share—The Company's earnings per share (\"EPS\") amounts have been computed based on the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding for the period. Basic EPS is computed by dividing net increase (decrease) in net assets resulting from operations by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period of computation. Diluted EPS is computed by dividing net increase (decrease) in net assets resulting from operations by the weighted average number of shares of common stock assuming all potential shares had been issued, and its related net impact to net assets accounted for, and the additional shares of common stock were dilutive. Diluted EPS reflects the potential dilution, using the as-if-converted method for convertible debt, which could occur if all potentially dilutive securities were exercised.\n\nForeign securities—The accounting records of the Company are maintained in U.S. dollars. Investment securities denominated in foreign currencies are translated into U.S. dollars based on the rate of exchange of such currencies on the date of valuation. Purchases and sales of investment securities and income and expense items denominated in foreign currencies are translated into U.S. dollars based on the rate of exchange of such currencies on the respective dates of the transactions. The Company isolates that portion of the results of operations resulting from changes in foreign exchange rates on investments from the fluctuations arising from changes in market prices of securities held. Such fluctuations are included with \"Net change in unrealized appreciation (depreciation)\" and \"Net realized gains (losses)\" in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Operations.\n\n70\n\n[Table of Contents](#i72f805c51bb9408d93e6f5060262cdd1_10)\n\nInvestments denominated in foreign currencies may be negatively affected by movements in the rate of exchange between the U.S. dollar and such foreign currencies. This movement is beyond the control of the Company and cannot be predicted.\n\nUse of estimates—The preparation of the Company's consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the Company's consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Changes in the economic environment, financial markets, and other metrics used in determining these estimates could cause actual results to differ from the estimates used, and the differences could be material.\n\nNote 3.

During the first quarter of 2021, the Company placed an aggregate principal amount of $5,230 of its subordinated position on non-accrual status. During the third quarter of 2021, the Company placed an initial aggregate principal amount of $13,479 of its first lien term loans on non-accrual status. During the third quarter of 2023, the Company placed the remaining aggregate principal amount of $17,927 of its first lien term loans on non-accrual status. As of September 30, 2024, the Company's positions in AAC on non-accrual status had an aggregate cost basis of $31,370, an aggregate fair value of $17,999 and total unearned interest income of $1,299 and $3,684, respectively, for the three and nine months then ended.\n\nDuring the first quarter of 2020, the Company placed its junior preferred shares in UniTek Global Services, Inc. (\"UniTek\") on non-accrual status. As of September 30, 2024, the Company's junior preferred shares in UniTek had an aggregate cost basis of $34,393, an aggregate fair value of $0 and total unearned dividend income of $2,221 and $6,448, respectively, for the three and nine months then ended. During the third quarter of 2021, the Company placed an aggregate amount of $19,795 of its investment in the senior preferred shares of UniTek on non-accrual status.

Commitments and Contingencies. \n\nPPVA Black Elk (Equity) LLC\n\nOn May 3, 2013, the Company entered into a collateralized securities purchase and put agreement (the “SPP Agreement”) with a private hedge fund. Under the SPP Agreement, the Company purchased twenty million Class E Preferred Units of Black Elk Energy Offshore Operations, LLC (“Black Elk”) for $20,000 with a corresponding obligation of the private hedge fund, PPVA Black Elk (Equity) LLC, to repurchase the preferred units for $20,000 plus other amounts due under the SPP Agreement. The majority owner of Black Elk was the private hedge fund. In August 2014, the Company received a payment of $20,540, the full amount due under the SPP Agreement.\n\nIn August 2017, a trustee (the “Trustee”) for Black Elk informed the Company that the Trustee intended to assert a fraudulent conveyance claim (the “Claim”) against the Company and one of its affiliates seeking the return of the $20,540 repayment. Black Elk filed a Chapter 11 bankruptcy petition pursuant to the U.S. Bankruptcy Code in August 2015. The Trustee alleged that individuals affiliated with the private hedge fund conspired with Black Elk and others to improperly use proceeds from the sale of certain Black Elk assets to repay, in August 2014, the private hedge fund’s obligation to the Company under the SPP Agreement. The Company was unaware of these claims at the time the repayment was received. The private hedge fund is currently in liquidation under the laws of the Cayman Islands.\n\nOn December 22, 2017, the Company settled the Trustee’s $20,540 Claim for $16,000 and filed a claim with the Cayman Islands joint official liquidators of the private hedge fund for $16,000 that is owed to the Company under the SPP Agreement. The SPP Agreement was restored and is in effect since repayment has not been made. The Company continues to exercise its rights under the SPP Agreement and continues to monitor the liquidation process of the private hedge fund. During the year ended December 31, 2018, the Company received a $1,500 payment from its insurance carrier in respect to the settlement. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the SPP Agreement had a cost basis of $14,500 and $14,500, respectively and a fair value of $6,525 and $7,975, respectively, which is reflective of the higher inherent risk in this transaction.\n\nNMFC Senior Loan Program III LLC\n\nNMFC Senior Loan Program III LLC (\"SLP III\") was formed as a Delaware limited liability company and commenced operations on April 25, 2018. SLP III is structured as a private joint venture investment fund between the Company and SkyKnight Income II, LLC (“SkyKnight II”) and operates under a limited liability company agreement (the \"SLP III Agreement\"). The purpose of the joint venture is to invest primarily in senior secured loans issued by portfolio companies within the Company's core industry verticals. These investments are typically broadly syndicated first lien loans. All investment decisions must be unanimously approved by the board of managers of SLP III, which has equal representation from the Company and SkyKnight II. SLP III had a five year investment period and will continue in existence until July 8, 2029. On July 3, 2024, the investment period was extended until July 8, 2027. The investment period may be extended for up to one year pursuant to certain terms of the SLP III Agreement.\n\nSLP III is capitalized with equity contributions which are called from its members, on a pro-rata basis based on their equity commitments, as transactions are completed. Any decision by SLP III to call down on capital commitments requires approval by the board of managers of SLP III. As of September 30, 2024, the Company and SkyKnight II have committed and contributed $160,000 and $40,000, respectively, of equity to SLP III. The Company’s investment in SLP III is disclosed on the Company’s Consolidated Schedule of Investments as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. \n\nOn May 2, 2018, SLP III entered into its revolving credit facility with Citibank, N.A. As of the amendment on July 3, 2024, the maturity date of SLP III's revolving credit facility was extended from January 8, 2026 to January 8, 2029, and the reinvestment period was extended from July 8, 2026 to July 8, 2027. As of the amendment on July 3, 2024, during the reinvestment period, the credit facility bears interest at a rate of the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (\"SOFR\") plus 1.65%, and after the reinvestment period it will bear interest at a rate of SOFR plus 1.95%. From June 23, 2023 to July 3, 2024, during the reinvestment period, the credit facility bore interest at a rate of the SOFR plus 1.80%, and after the reinvestment period it bore interest at a rate of SOFR plus 2.10%.

As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, approximately $5,567 and $5,338, respectively, of dividend income related to SLP III was included in interest and dividend receivable.\n\nThe Company has determined that SLP III is an investment company under ASC 946; however, in accordance with such guidance the Company will generally not consolidate its investment in a company other than a wholly-owned investment company subsidiary. Furthermore, ASC 810 concludes that in a joint venture where both members have equal decision making authority, it is not appropriate for one member to consolidate the joint venture since neither has control. Accordingly, the Company does not consolidate SLP III.\n\n81\n\n[Table of Contents](#i72f805c51bb9408d93e6f5060262cdd1_10)\n\nNMFC Senior Loan Program IV LLC\n\nNMFC Senior Loan Program IV LLC (\"SLP IV\") was formed as a Delaware limited liability company on April 6, 2021, and commenced operations on May 5, 2021. SLP IV is structured as a private joint venture investment fund between the Company and SkyKnight Income Alpha, LLC (\"SkyKnight Alpha\") and operates under the First Amended and Restated Limited Liability Company Agreement of NMFC Senior Loan Program IV LLC, dated May 5, 2021 (the \"SLP IV Agreement\"). Upon the effectiveness of the SLP IV Agreement, the members contributed their respective membership interests in NMFC Senior Loan Program I LLC (\"SLP I\") and NMFC Senior Loan Program II LLC (\"SLP II\") to SLP IV. Immediately following the contribution of their membership interests, SLP I and SLP II became wholly-owned subsidiaries of SLP IV.The purpose of the joint venture is to invest primarily in senior secured loans issued by portfolio companies within the Company's core industry verticals. These investments are typically broadly syndicated first lien loans. All investment decisions must be unanimously approved by the board of managers of SLP IV, which has equal representation from the Company and SkyKnight Alpha. SLP IV had a five year investment period and will continue in existence until May 5, 2029. On March 15, 2024, the investment period was extended until May 5, 2027 pursuant to the terms of the SLP IV Agreement.\n\nSLP IV is capitalized with equity contributions which were transferred and contributed from its members. As of September 30, 2024, the Company and SkyKnight Alpha have transferred and contributed $112,400 and $30,600, respectively, of their membership interests in SLP I and SLP II to SLP IV. The Company’s investment in SLP IV is disclosed on the Company’s Consolidated Schedule of Investments as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. \n\nOn May 5, 2021, SLP IV entered into a $370,000 revolving credit facility with Wells Fargo Bank, National Association which matures on March 27, 2029. As of the amendment on March 27, 2024, the facility bears interest at a rate of SOFR plus 1.90%. From April 28, 2023 to March 27, 2024, the facility bore interest at a rate of SOFR plus 1.70%. Prior to the amendment on April 28, 2023, the facility bore interest at a rate of LIBOR plus 1.60% per annum.

For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Company earned approximately $3,653 and $11,381, respectively, of dividend income related to SLP IV, which is included in dividend income. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, approximately $3,794 and $4,103, respectively, of dividend income related to SLP IV was included in interest and dividend receivable.\n\nThe Company has determined that SLP IV is an investment company under ASC 946; in accordance with such guidance the Company will generally not consolidate its investment in a company other than a wholly-owned investment company subsidiary. Furthermore, ASC 810 concludes that in a joint venture where both members have equal decision making authority, it is not appropriate for one member to consolidate the joint venture since neither has control. Accordingly, the Company does not consolidate SLP IV.\n\n87\n\n[Table of Contents](#i72f805c51bb9408d93e6f5060262cdd1_10)\n\nUnconsolidated Significant Subsidiaries\n\nIn accordance with Regulation S-X Rule 10-01(b)(1), the Company evaluates its unconsolidated controlled portfolio companies to determine if any are as “significant subsidiaries.” This determination is made based upon an analysis performed under Rules 3-09 and 4-08(g) of Regulation S-X, pursuant to which the Company must determine if any of its portfolio companies are considered a “significant subsidiary\" as defined by Rule 1-02(w) of Regulation S-X under this rule. As of September 30, 2024, the Company did not have any portfolio companies that were deemed to be a \"significant subsidiary.\" \n\nInvestment Risk Factors\n\nFirst and second lien debt that the Company invests in is almost entirely rated below investment grade or may be unrated. Debt investments rated below investment grade are often referred to as \"leveraged loans\", \"high yield\" or \"junk\" debt investments, and may be considered \"high risk\" compared to debt investments that are rated investment grade. These debt investments are considered speculative because of the credit risk of the issuers. Such issuers are considered more likely than investment grade issuers to default on their payments of interest and principal, and such risk of default could reduce the net asset value and income distributions of the Company. In addition, some of the Company's debt investments will not fully amortize during their lifetime, which could result in a loss or a substantial amount of unpaid principal and interest due upon maturity. First and second lien debt may also lose significant market value before a default occurs. Furthermore, an active trading market may not exist for these securities. This illiquidity may make it more difficult to value the investments.\n\nSubordinated debt is generally subject to similar risks as those associated with first and second lien debt, except that such debt is subordinated in payment and/or lower in lien priority. Subordinated debt is subject to the additional risk that the cash flow of the borrower and the property securing the debt, if any, may be insufficient to meet scheduled payments after giving effect to the senior secured and unsecured obligations of the borrower.\n\nThe Company may directly invest in the equity of private companies or, in some cases, equity investments could be made in connection with a debt investment. Equity investments may or may not fluctuate in value, resulting in recognized realized gains or losses upon disposition.\n\nNote 4. Fair Value\n\nPursuant to Rule 2a-5, a market quotation is readily available for purposes of Section 2(a)(41) of the 1940 Act with respect to a security only when that “quotation is a quoted price (unadjusted) in active markets for identical investments that the fund can access at the measurement date, provided that a quotation will not be readily available if it is not reliable.” Fair value is the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. ASC 820 establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes and ranks the inputs to valuation techniques used in measuring investments at fair value. The hierarchy classifies the inputs used in measuring fair value into three levels as follows:\n\nLevel I—Quoted prices (unadjusted) are available in active markets for identical investments and the Company has the ability to access such quotes as of the reporting date. The type of investments which would generally be included in Level I include active exchange-traded equity securities and exchange-traded derivatives. As required by ASC 820, the Company, to the extent that it holds such investments, does not adjust the quoted price for these investments, even in situations where the Company holds a large position and a sale could reasonably impact the quoted price.\n\nLevel II—Pricing inputs are observable for the investments, either directly or indirectly, as of the reporting date, but are not the same as those used in Level I. Level II inputs include the following:\n\n•Quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets;\n\n•Quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in non-active markets (examples include corporate and municipal bonds, which trade infrequently);\n\n•Pricing models whose inputs are observable for substantially the full term of the asset or liability (examples include most over-the-counter derivatives, including foreign exchange forward contracts); and\n\n•Pricing models whose inputs are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data through correlation or other means for substantially the full term of the asset or liability.\n\nLevel III—Pricing inputs are unobservable for the investment and include situations where there is little, if any, market activity for the investment.\n\nThe inputs used to measure fair value may fall into different levels. In all instances when the inputs fall within different levels of the hierarchy, the level within which the fair value measurement is categorized is based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety. As such, a Level III fair value measurement may include \n\n88\n\n[Table of Contents](#i72f805c51bb9408d93e6f5060262cdd1_10)\n\ninputs that are both observable and unobservable. Gains and losses for such assets categorized within the Level III table below may include changes in fair value that are attributable to both observable inputs and unobservable inputs.\n\nThe inputs into the determination of fair value require significant judgment or estimation by management and consideration of factors specific to each investment. A review of the fair value hierarchy classifications is conducted on a quarterly basis. Changes in the observability of valuation inputs may result in the transfer of certain investments within the fair value hierarchy from period to period.\n\nThe following table summarizes the levels in the fair value hierarchy that the Company’s portfolio investments fall into as of September 30, 2024:\n\nTotal| Level I| Level II| Level III  \n---|---|---|---  \nFirst lien| $| 2,072,485 | $| — |

beginning of the period in which the reclassification occurred.\n\nExcept as noted in the tables above, there were no other transfers in or out of Level I, II, or III during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023. Transfers into Level III occur as quotations obtained through pricing services are deemed not representative of fair value as of the balance sheet date and such assets are internally valued. As quotations obtained through pricing services are substantiated through additional market sources, investments are transferred out of Level III. In addition, transfers out of Level III and transfers into Level III occur based on the increase or decrease in the availability of certain observable inputs. \n\nThe Company invests in revolving credit facilities. These investments are categorized as Level III investments as these assets are not actively traded and their fair values are often implied by the term loans of the respective portfolio companies.\n\nThe Company generally uses the following framework when determining the fair value of investments where there are little, if any, market activity or observable pricing inputs. The Company typically determines the fair value of its performing debt investments utilizing an income approach. Additional consideration is given using a market based approach, as well as reviewing the overall underlying portfolio company's performance and associated financial risks. The following outlines additional details on the approaches considered:\n\nCompany Performance, Financial Review, and Analysis: Prior to investment, as part of its due diligence process, the Company evaluates the overall performance and financial stability of the portfolio company. Post investment, the Company analyzes each portfolio company's current operating performance and relevant financial trends versus prior year and budgeted results, including, but not limited to, factors affecting its revenue and earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (\"EBITDA\") growth, margin trends, liquidity position, covenant compliance and changes to its capital structure. The Company also attempts to identify and subsequently track any developments at the portfolio company, within its customer or vendor base or within the industry or the macroeconomic environment, generally, that may alter any material element of its original investment thesis. This analysis is specific to each portfolio company. The Company leverages the knowledge gained from its original due diligence process, augmented by this subsequent monitoring, to continually refine its outlook for each of its portfolio companies and ultimately form the valuation of its investment in each portfolio company. When an external event such as a purchase transaction, public offering or subsequent sale occurs, the Company will consider the pricing indicated by the external event to corroborate the private valuation.\n\nFor debt investments, the Company may employ the Market Based Approach (as described below) to assess the total enterprise value of the portfolio company, in order to evaluate the enterprise value coverage of the Company’s debt investment. For equity investments or in cases where the Market Based Approach implies a lack of enterprise value coverage for the debt investment, the Company may additionally employ a discounted cash flow analysis based on the free cash flows of the portfolio company to assess the total enterprise value. After enterprise value coverage is demonstrated for the Company’s debt \n\n91\n\n[Table of Contents](#i72f805c51bb9408d93e6f5060262cdd1_10)\n\ninvestments through the method(s) above, the Income Based Approach (as described below) may be employed to estimate the fair value of the investment.\n\nMarket Based Approach: The Company may estimate the total enterprise value of each portfolio company by utilizing EBITDA or revenue multiples of publicly traded comparable companies and comparable transactions. The Company considers numerous factors when selecting the appropriate companies whose trading multiples are used to value its portfolio companies. These factors include, but are not limited to, the type of organization, similarity to the business being valued, and relevant risk factors, as well as size, profitability and growth expectations. The Company may apply an average of various relevant comparable company EBITDA or revenue multiples to the portfolio company's latest twelve month (\"LTM\") EBITDA or revenue or projected EBITDA or revenue to calculate the enterprise value of the portfolio company. Significant increases or decreases in the EBITDA or revenue multiple will result in an increase or decrease in enterprise value, which may result in an increase or decrease in the fair value estimate of the investment. In applying the market based approach as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company used the relevant EBITDA or revenue multiple ranges set forth in the table below to determine the enterprise value of its portfolio companies. The Company believes these were reasonable ranges in light of current comparable company trading levels and the specific portfolio companies involved.\n\nIncome Based Approach: The Company also may use a discounted cash flow analysis to estimate the fair value of the investment. Projected cash flows represent the relevant security's contractual interest, fee and principal payments plus the assumption of full principal recovery at the investment's expected maturity date. These cash flows are discounted at a rate established utilizing a combination of a yield calibration approach and a comparable investment approach. The yield calibration approach incorporates changes in the credit quality (as measured by relevant statistics) of the portfolio company, as compared to changes in the yield associated with comparable credit quality market indices, between the date of origination and the valuation date. The comparable investment approach utilizes an average yield-to maturity of a selected set of high-quality, liquid investments to determine a comparable investment discount rate. Significant increases or decreases in the discount rate would result in a decrease or increase in the fair value measurement. In applying the income based approach as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company used the discount ranges set forth in the table below to value investments in its portfolio companies.\n\nThe unobservable inputs used in the fair value measurement of the Company's Level III investments as of September 30, 2024 were as follows:\n\nRange  \n---  \nType| Fair Value as of September 30, 2024| Approach| Unobservable Input| Low| High| WeightedAverage(1)  \nFirst lien| $| 1,796,760 | Market & Income Approach| EBITDA multiple| 5.0x| 35.0x| 15.1x  \nRevenue multiple| 4.0x| 19.5x| 8.0x  \nDiscount rate| 6.5 | %| 21.1 | %| 9.7 | %  \n222,303 | Other| N/A(2)| N/A| N/A| N/A  \nSecond lien| 175,751 | Market & Income Approach| EBITDA multiple| 8.6x| 21.0x| 18.2x  \nDiscount rate| 9.5 | %| 21.0 | %| 11.4 | %  \n15,581 | Other| N/A(2)| N/A| N/A| N/A  \nSubordinated| 99,386 | Market & Income Approach| EBITDA multiple| 7.7x| 24.5x| 16.3x  \nDiscount rate| 12.2 | %| 23.8 | %| 16.9 | %  \nEquity and other| 424,106 | Market & Income Approach| EBITDA multiple| 5.0x| 32.0x| 13.0x  \nRevenue multiple| 4.5x| 19.5x| 7.1x  \nDiscount rate| 8.4 | %| 52.6 | %| 9.2 | %  \n397,280 | Income Approach| Discount rate| 6.3 | %| 12.5 | %| 10.0 | %  \n10,718 | Other| N/A(2)| N/A| N/A| N/A  \n$| 3,141,885  \n  \n(1)Unobservable inputs were weighted by the relative fair value of the investments.\n\n(2)Fair value was determined based on transaction pricing or recent acquisition or sale as the best measure of fair value with no material changes in operations of the related portfolio company since the transaction date.\n\n92\n\n[Table of Contents](#i72f805c51bb9408d93e6f5060262cdd1_10)\n\nThe unobservable inputs used in the fair value measurement of the Company's Level III investments as of December 31, 2023 were as follows:\n\nRange  \n---  \nType| Fair Value as of December 31, 2023| Approach| Unobservable Input| Low| High| WeightedAverage(1)  \nFirst lien| $| 1,559,300 | Market & income approach| EBITDA multiple| 5.0x| 24.0x| 15.1x  \nRevenue multiple| 5.0x| 19.5x| 10.6x  \nDiscount rate| 8.6 | %| 22.0 | %| 10.2 | %  \n78,589 | Other| N/A(2)| N/A| N/A| N/A  \nSecond lien| 403,180 | Market & income approach| EBITDA multiple| 7.0x| 20.0x| 14.4x  \nDiscount rate| 9.2 | %| 30.0 | %| 12.1 | %  \n3,000 | Other| N/A(2)| N/A| N/A| N/A  \nSubordinated| 82,871 | Market & income approach| EBITDA multiple| 8.0x| 22.0x| 16.0x  \nDiscount rate| 12.9 | %| 20.9 | %| 11.9 | %  \nEquity and other| 430,828 | Market & income approach| EBITDA multiple| 5.5x| 34.0x| 12.6x  \nRevenue multiple| 9.0x| 11.0x| 10.0x  \nDiscount rate| 9.8 | %| 43.1 | %| 12.2 | %  \n370,807 | Income approach| Discount rate| 6.4 | %| 12.6 | %| 10.1 | %  \n10,274 | Other| N/A(2)| N/A| N/A| N/A  \n$| 2,938,849  \n  \n(1)Unobservable inputs were weighted by the relative fair value of the investments.\n\n(2)Fair value was determined based on transaction pricing or recent acquisition or sale as the best measure of fair value with no material changes in operations of the related portfolio company since the transaction date.\n\nThe carrying value of the collateralized agreement approximates fair value as of September 30, 2024 and is considered a Level III investment. The fair value of other financial assets and liabilities approximates their carrying value based on the short-term nature of these items.\n\nThe 2021A Unsecured Notes, 2022A Unsecured Notes, SBA-guaranteed debentures, Holdings Credit Facility, DB Credit Facility, NMFC Credit Facility and NMNLC Credit Facility II are considered Level III investments. The fair value of the 2022 Convertible Notes, the 8.250% Unsecured Notes, the 6.875% Unsecured Notes and the 6.200% Unsecured Notes are based on quoted prices and are considered Level II investments. See Note 7. Borrowings, for details. \n\nThe following are the principal amounts and fair values of the Company’s borrowings as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. Fair value is estimated by discounting remaining payments using applicable current market rates, which take into account changes in the Company’s marketplace credit ratings or market quotes, if available.\n\nAs of  \n---  \nSeptember 30, 2024| December 31, 2023  \nPrincipal Amount| Fair Value| Principal Amount| Fair Value  \nUnsecured Notes| $| 990,000 | $| 988,569 | $| 506,500 | $| 490,200  \nHoldings Credit Facility| 407,563 | 406,072 | 515,063 | 511,511  \nSBA-guaranteed debentures| 300,000 | 270,806 | 300,000 | 259,811  \nConvertible Notes| 260,000 | 263,250 | 260,000 | 264,706  \nNMFC Credit Facility (1)| 55,031 | 54,105 | 36,813 | 36,507  \nNMNLC Credit Facility II| 2,908 | 2,908 | 2,853 | 2,846  \nDB Credit Facility (2)| — | — | 186,400 | 184,506  \nTotal Borrowings| $| 2,015,502 | $| 1,985,710 | $| 1,807,629 | $| 1,750,087  \n  \n(1) As of September 30, 2024, the principal amount of the NMFC Credit Facility was $55,031, which includes £26,650 denominated in GBP and €17,400 denominated in EUR that has been converted to U.S. dollars. As of September 30, 2024, the fair value of the NMFC Credit Facility was $54,105, which included £26,659 denominated in GBP and \n\n93\n\n[Table of Contents](#i72f805c51bb9408d93e6f5060262cdd1_10)\n\n€16,557 denominated in EUR that has been converted to U.S. dollars.

As of December 31, 2023, the fair value of the NMFC Credit Facility was $36,507, which included £22,660 denominated in GBP and €694 denominated in EUR that has been converted to U.S. dollars. \n\n(2) On September 30, 2024, the Company repaid all amounts outstanding under the DB Credit Facility, including outstanding borrowings and accrued interest, and terminated the DB Credit Facility.\n\nThe following table summarizes the notional amounts and fair values of the Company's derivative instruments as of September 30, 2024. The Company's derivative instruments are considered Level II investments. \n\nAs of September 30, 2024  \n---  \nNotional Amount| Fair Value  \nAsset| Liability  \nDerivatives in fair value hedging relationships:  \nInterest rate swaps| $| 600,000 | $| 8,320 | $| (781)  \nTotal derivatives designated as hedging instruments| $| 600,000 | $| 8,320 | $| (781)  \nTotal derivatives| $| 600,000 | $| 8,320 | $| (781)  \nTotal net derivatives(1)| $| 600,000 | $| 7,539  \n  \n(1)As of September 30, 2024, the Company had net derivative assets at fair value subject to such enforceable master netting arrangement in the amount of $7,539 and a collateral balance of $10,370, included in \"Payable to broker\" on the Consolidated Statements of Assets and Liabilities. If the Company had elected to offset, the net amount would be $0.\n\nFair value risk factors—The Company seeks investment opportunities that offer the possibility of attaining substantial capital appreciation. Certain events particular to each industry in which the Company's portfolio companies conduct their operations, as well as general economic, political and public health conditions, may have a significant negative impact on the operations and profitability of the Company's investments and/or on the fair value of the Company's investments. The Company's investments are subject to the risk of non-payment of scheduled interest or principal, resulting in a reduction in income to the Company and their corresponding fair valuations. Also, there may be risk associated with the concentration of investments in one geographic region or in certain industries. These events are beyond the control of the Company and cannot be predicted. Furthermore, the ability to liquidate investments and realize value is subject to uncertainties.\n\nNote 5. Agreements\n\nThe Company entered into an investment advisory and management agreement (the “Investment Management Agreement”) with the Investment Adviser which was most recently re-approved by the Company's board of directors on January 30, 2024, at an in-person meeting, for a period of 12 months commencing on March 1, 2024. Under the Investment Management Agreement, the Investment Adviser manages the day-to-day operations of, and provides investment advisory services to, the Company. For providing these services, the Investment Adviser receives a fee from the Company, consisting of two components—a base management fee and an incentive fee. On November 1, 2021, the Company entered into Amendment No. 1 to the Investment Management Agreement (“Amendment No. 1”). As described below, the sole purpose of Amendment No. 1 was to reduce the base management fee from 1.75% of the Company’s gross assets to 1.4% of the Company’s gross assets. \n\nPursuant to Amendment No. 1, the base management fee is calculated at an annual rate of 1.4% of the Company's gross assets, which equals the Company's total assets on the Consolidated Statements of Assets and Liabilities, less cash and cash equivalents. The base management fee is payable quarterly in arrears, and is calculated based on the average value of the Company's gross assets, which equals the Company's total assets, as determined in accordance with GAAP, less cash and cash equivalents at the end of each of the two most recently completed calendar quarters, and appropriately adjusted on a pro rata basis for any equity capital raises or repurchases during the current calendar quarter. To the extent the Company invests in derivatives, the Company uses the actual value of the derivatives, as reported on the Consolidated Statements of Assets and Liabilities, for purposes of calculating its base management fee.\n\nEffective as of and for the quarter ended March 31, 2021 through the quarter ending December 31, 2024, the Investment Adviser entered into a fee waiver agreement (the \"Fee Waiver Agreement\"), amended on August 7, 2023, pursuant to which the Investment Adviser will waive base management fees in order to reach a target base management fee of 1.25% on gross assets (the “Reduced Base Management Fee”). The Fee Waiver Agreement was most recently extended for a period of one year through the quarter ending December 31, 2024 by the Investment Adviser on August 7, 2023. The Investment Adviser \n\n94\n\n[Table of Contents](#i72f805c51bb9408d93e6f5060262cdd1_10)\n\ncannot recoup management fees that the Investment Adviser has previously waived. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, management fees waived were approximately $970 and $2,732, respectively. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, management fees waived were approximately $1,013 and $3,172, respectively.\n\nThe incentive fee consists of two parts. The first part is calculated and payable quarterly in arrears and equals 20.0% of the Company’s “Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income” for the immediately preceding quarter, subject to a “preferred return”, or “hurdle”, and a “catch-up” feature. “Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income” means interest income, dividend income and any other income (including any other fees (other than fees for providing managerial assistance), such as commitment, origination, structuring, upfront, diligence and consulting fees or other fees that the Company receives from portfolio companies) accrued during the calendar quarter, minus the Company’s operating expenses for the quarter (including the base management fee, expenses payable under an administration agreement, as amended and restated (the “Administration Agreement”), with the Administrator, and any interest expense and distributions paid on any issued and outstanding preferred stock (of which there were none as of September 30, 2024), but excluding the incentive fee). Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income includes, in the case of investments with a deferred interest feature (such as original issue discount, debt instruments with PIK interest and zero coupon securities), accrued income that the Company has not yet received in cash. Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income does not include any realized capital gains, realized capital losses or unrealized capital appreciation or depreciation.\n\nPre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income, expressed as a rate of return on the value of the Company’s net assets at the end of the immediately preceding calendar quarter, will be compared to a \"hurdle rate\" of 2.0% per quarter (8.0% annualized), subject to a \"catch-up\" provision measured as of the end of each calendar quarter. The hurdle rate is appropriately pro-rated for any partial periods. The calculation of the Company’s incentive fee with respect to the Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income for each quarter is as follows:\n\n•No incentive fee is payable to the Investment Adviser in any calendar quarter in which the Company’s Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income does not exceed the hurdle rate of 2.0% (the \"preferred return\" or \"hurdle\").\n\n•100.0% of the Company’s Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income with respect to that portion of such Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income, if any, that exceeds the hurdle rate but is less than or equal to 2.5% in any calendar quarter (10.0% annualized) is payable to the Investment Adviser. This portion of the Company’s Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income (which exceeds the hurdle rate but is less than or equal to 2.5%) is referred to as the \"catch-up\". The catch-up provision is intended to provide the Investment Adviser with an incentive fee of 20.0% on all of the Company’s Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income as if a hurdle rate did not apply when the Company's Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income exceeds 2.5% in any calendar quarter.\n\n•20.0% of the amount of the Company’s Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income, if any, that exceeds 2.5% in any calendar quarter (10.0% annualized) is payable to the Investment Adviser once the hurdle is reached and the catch-up is achieved. \n\nThe second part of the incentive fee will be determined and payable in arrears as of the end of each calendar year (or upon termination of the Investment Management Agreement) and will equal 20.0% of the Company’s realized capital gains, if any, on a cumulative basis from inception through the end of each calendar year, computed net of all realized capital losses and unrealized capital depreciation on a cumulative basis, less the aggregate amount of any previously paid capital gain incentive fee.\n\nIn accordance with GAAP, the Company accrues a hypothetical capital gains incentive fee based upon the cumulative net realized capital gains and realized capital losses and the cumulative net unrealized capital appreciation and unrealized capital depreciation on investments held at the end of each period. Actual amounts paid to the Investment Adviser are consistent with the Investment Management Agreement and are based only on actual realized capital gains computed net of all realized capital losses and unrealized capital depreciation on a cumulative basis from inception through the end of each calendar year.\n\n95\n\n[Table of Contents](#i72f805c51bb9408d93e6f5060262cdd1_10)\n\nThe following table summarizes the management fees and incentive fees incurred by the Company for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023:\n\nThree Months Ended| Nine Months Ended  \n---|---  \nSeptember 30, 2024| September 30, 2023| September 30, 2024| September 30, 2023  \nManagement fee| $| 11,700 | $| 11,334 | $| 34,048 | $| 34,549  \nLess: management fee waiver| (970)| (1,013)| (2,732)| (3,172)  \nTotal management fee| 10,730 | 10,321 | 31,316 | 31,377  \nIncentive fee, excluding accrued capital gains incentive fees| $| 8,821 | $| 10,169 | $| 27,760 | $| 29,748  \nAccrued capital gains incentive fees(1)| $| — | $| — | $| — | $| —  \n  \n(1)As of September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, no actual capital gains incentive fee was owed under the Investment Management Agreement by the Company, as cumulative net realized capital gains did not exceed cumulative unrealized capital depreciation.\n\nThe Company has entered into the Administration Agreement with the Administrator under which the Administrator provides administrative services. The Administration Agreement was most recently re-approved by the board of directors on January 30, 2024 for a period of 12 months commencing on March 1, 2024. The Administrator maintains, or oversees the maintenance of, the Company’s consolidated financial records, prepares reports filed with the SEC, generally monitors the payment of the Company's expenses and oversees the performance of administrative and professional services rendered by others. The Company reimburses the Administrator for the Company's allocable portion of overhead and other expenses incurred by the Administrator in performing its obligations to the Company under the Administration Agreement. Pursuant to the Administration Agreement and further restricted by the Company, the Administrator may, in its own discretion, submit to the Company for reimbursement some or all of the expenses that the Administrator has incurred on behalf of the Company during any quarterly period. As a result, the amount of expenses for which the Company will have to reimburse the Administrator may fluctuate in future quarterly periods and there can be no assurance given as to when, or if, the Administrator may determine to limit the expenses that the Administrator submits to the Company for reimbursement in the future. However, it is expected that the Administrator will continue to support part of the expense burden of the Company in the near future and may decide to not calculate and charge through certain overhead related amounts as well as continue to cover some of the indirect costs. The Administrator cannot recoup any expenses that the Administrator has previously waived. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, approximately $618 and $1,804, respectively, of indirect administrative expenses were included in administrative expenses, of which no expenses were waived by the Administrator. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, approximately $563 and $1,659, respectively, of indirect administrative expenses were included in administrative expenses, of which no expenses were waived by the Administrator. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, approximately $580 and $682, respectively, of indirect administrative expenses were included in payable to affiliates. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the reimbursement to the Administrator represented approximately 0.02% and 0.05%, respectively, of the Company's gross assets. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, the reimbursement to the Administrator represented approximately 0.02% and 0.05%, respectively, of the Company's gross assets.\n\nThe Company, the Investment Adviser and the Administrator have also entered into a Trademark License Agreement, as amended, with New Mountain Capital, pursuant to which New Mountain Capital has agreed to grant the Company, the Investment Adviser and the Administrator a non-exclusive, royalty-free license to use the \"New Mountain\" and the \"New Mountain Finance\" names, as well as the NMF logo. Under the Trademark License Agreement, as amended, subject to certain conditions, the Company, the Investment Adviser and the Administrator will have a right to use the \"New Mountain\" and \"New Mountain Finance\" names, as well as the NMF logo, for so long as the Investment Adviser or one of its affiliates remains the investment adviser of the Company. Other than with respect to this limited license, the Company, the Investment Adviser and the Administrator will have no legal right to the \"New Mountain\" or the \"New Mountain Finance\" names, as well as the NMF logo.\n\nIn addition, pursuant to an exemptive order issued by the SEC on April 8, 2020 and applicable to all BDCs through December 31, 2020 (the “Temporary Relief), the Company was permitted, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, to complete follow-on investments in its existing portfolio companies with certain affiliates that are private funds if such private funds did not hold an investment in such existing portfolio company. Without the Temporary Relief, such private funds would not be able to participate in such co-investments with the Company unless the private funds had previously acquired securities of the portfolio company in a co-investment transaction with the Company. Although the Temporary Relief expired on December 31, 2020, the SEC’s Division of Investment Management had indicated that until March 31, 2022, it would not recommend enforcement action, to the extent that any BDC with an existing co-investment order continued to engage in certain \n\n96\n\n[Table of Contents](#i72f805c51bb9408d93e6f5060262cdd1_10)\n\ntransactions described in the Temporary Relief, pursuant to the same terms and conditions described therein. The Temporary Relief is no longer effective; however, on August 30, 2022, the Company received an Order from the SEC that amended its existing Exemptive Order to permit the Company to complete follow-on investments in its existing portfolio companies with certain affiliates that are private funds if such private funds do not hold an investment in such existing portfolio company, subject to certain conditions.\n\nNote 6. Related Parties\n\nThe Company has entered into a number of business relationships with affiliated or related parties.\n\nThe Company has entered into the Investment Management Agreement with the Investment Adviser, a wholly-owned subsidiary of New Mountain Capital. Therefore, New Mountain Capital is entitled to any profits earned by the Investment Adviser, which includes any fees payable to the Investment Adviser under the terms of the Investment Management Agreement, less expenses incurred by the Investment Adviser in performing its services under the Investment Management Agreement.\n\nThe Company has entered into the Fee Waiver Agreement with the Investment Adviser, pursuant to which the Investment Adviser originally agreed to voluntarily reduce the base management fees payable to the Investment Adviser by the Company under the Investment Management Agreement beginning with the quarter ended March 31, 2021 through the quarter ended December 31, 2022. Subsequently, the Company and the Investment Adviser extended the term of the Fee Waiver Agreement to be effective through the quarter ending December 31, 2024. See Note 5. Agreements, for details. \n\nThe Company has entered into the Administration Agreement with the Administrator, a wholly-owned subsidiary of New Mountain Capital. The Administrator arranges office space for the Company and provides office equipment and administrative services necessary to conduct their respective day-to-day operations pursuant to the Administration Agreement. The Company reimburses the Administrator for the allocable portion of overhead and other expenses incurred by it in performing its obligations to the Company under the Administration Agreement, which includes the fees and expenses associated with performing administrative, finance and compliance functions, and the compensation of the Company's chief financial officer and chief compliance officer and their respective staffs. \n\nThe Company, the Investment Adviser and the Administrator have entered into a royalty-free Trademark License Agreement, as amended, with New Mountain Capital, pursuant to which New Mountain Capital has agreed to grant the Company, the Investment Adviser and the Administrator a non-exclusive, royalty-free license to use the name \"New Mountain\" and \"New Mountain Finance\", as well as the NMF logo.\n\nThe Company has adopted a formal code of ethics that governs the conduct of its officers and directors. These officers and directors also remain subject to the duties imposed by the 1940 Act and the Delaware General Corporation Law.\n\nThe Investment Adviser and its affiliates may also manage other funds in the future that may have investment mandates that are similar, in whole or in part, to the Company’s investment mandates. The Investment Adviser and its affiliates may determine that an investment is appropriate for the Company or for one or more of those other funds. In such event, depending on the availability of such investment and other appropriate factors, the Investment Adviser or its affiliates may determine that the Company should invest side-by-side with one or more other funds. Any such investments will be made only to the extent permitted by applicable law and interpretive positions of the SEC and its staff and consistent with the Investment Adviser’s allocation procedures. On October 8, 2019, the SEC issued an exemptive order (the “Exemptive Order”), which superseded a prior order issued on December 18, 2017, which permits the Company to co-invest in portfolio companies with certain funds or entities managed by the Investment Adviser or its affiliates in certain negotiated transactions where co-investing would otherwise be prohibited under the 1940 Act, subject to the conditions of the Exemptive Order. Pursuant to the Exemptive Order, the Company is permitted to co-invest with its affiliates if a “required majority” (as defined in Section 57(o) of the 1940 Act) of the Company's independent directors make certain conclusions in connection with a co-investment transaction, including, but not limited to, that (1) the terms of the potential co-investment transaction, including the consideration to be paid, are reasonable and fair to the Company and its stockholders and do not involve overreaching in respect of the Company or its stockholders on the part of any person concerned, and (2) the potential co-investment transaction is consistent with the interests of the Company's stockholders and is consistent with its then-current investment objective and strategies. The Exemptive Order was amended on August 30, 2022 to permit the Company to complete follow-on investments in its existing portfolio companies with certain affiliates that are private funds if such private funds do not hold an investment in such existing portfolio company, subject to certain conditions.\n\nOn March 30, 2020, an affiliate of the Investment Adviser purchased directly from NMNLC 105,030 shares of NMNLC’s common stock at a price of $107.73 per share, which represented the net asset value per share of NMNLC at the date of purchase, for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $11,315. Immediately thereafter, NMNLC redeemed 105,030 shares of its common stock held by the Company in exchange for a promissory note with a principal amount of $11,315 and a 7.0% interest rate, which was repaid by NMNLC to the Company on March 31, 2020. Effective July 1, 2024, \n\n97\n\n[Table of Contents](#i72f805c51bb9408d93e6f5060262cdd1_10)\n\nNMNLC purchased 63,575 shares of NMNLC's common stock from an affiliate of the Investment Adviser at remaining original cost, a price of $73.39 per share, for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $4,666. Immediately thereafter, NMNLC sold the 63,575 shares of its common stock to NMFC at remaining original cost, a price of $73.39 per share, for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $4,666.\n\nOn March 30, 2020, the Company entered into an unsecured revolving credit facility with NMF Investments III, L.L.C., an affiliate of the Investment Adviser, with a $30,000 maximum amount of revolver borrowings available and a maturity date of December 31, 2022. On May 4, 2020, the Company entered into an Amended and Restated Uncommitted Revolving Loan Agreement with NMF Investments III, L.L.C., which increased the maximum amounts of revolving borrowings available thereunder from $30,000 to $50,000. On December 17, 2021, the Company entered into Amendment No. 1 to the Amended and Restated Uncommitted Revolving Loan Agreement with NMF Investments III, L.L.C., which lowered the interest rate and extended the maturity date from December 31, 2022 to December 31, 2024. On October 31, 2023, we entered into a Second Amended and Restated Uncommitted Revolving Loan Agreement with NMF Investments III, L.L.C., which increased the maximum amounts of revolving borrowings thereunder from $50,000 to $100,000, extended the maturity date from December 31, 2024 to December 31, 2027 and changed the interest rate to the Applicable Federal Rate. Refer to Note 7. Borrowings for discussion of the Unsecured Management Company Revolver (defined below).\n\nNote 7. Borrowings\n\nOn June 8, 2018 the Company's shareholders approved the application of the modified asset coverage requirements set forth in Section 61(a) of the 1940 Act, which resulted in the reduction of the minimum asset coverage ratio applicable to the Company from 200.0% to 150.0% as of June 9, 2018 (which means the Company can borrow $2 for every $1 of its equity). As a result of the Company's exemptive relief received on November 5, 2014, the Company is permitted to exclude the SBA-guaranteed debentures held by SBIC I and SBIC II from the 150.0% asset coverage ratio that the Company is required to maintain under the 1940 Act. The agreements governing the NMFC Credit Facility, the Convertible Notes (as defined below) and certain of the Unsecured Notes (as defined below) contain certain covenants and terms, including a requirement that the Company not exceed a debt-to-equity ratio of 1.65 to 1.00 at the time of incurring additional indebtedness and a requirement that the Company not exceed a secured debt ratio of 0.70 to 1.00 at any time. As of September 30, 2024, the Company’s asset coverage ratio was 179.2%.\n\nHoldings Credit Facility—On October 24, 2017, the Company entered into the Third Amended and Restated Loan and Security Agreement (as amended from time to time, the \"Loan and Security Agreement\") among the Company, as the Collateral Manager, NMF Holdings, as the Borrower, Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, as the Administrative Agent and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as the Lender and Collateral Custodian (the \"Holdings Credit Facility\"). As of the amendment on October 26, 2023, the maturity date of the Holdings Credit Facility is October 26, 2028, and the maximum facility amount is the lesser of $800,000 and the actual commitments of the lenders to make advances as of such date.\n\nAs of September 30, 2024, the maximum amount of revolving borrowings available under the Holdings Credit Facility is $730,000. Under the Holdings Credit Facility, NMF Holdings is permitted to borrow up to 35.0%, 45.0%, 55.0%, 67.5% or 70.0% of the purchase price of pledged assets, subject to approval by Wells Fargo Bank, National Association. The Holdings Credit Facility is non-recourse to the Company and is collateralized by all of the investments of NMF Holdings on an investment by investment basis. All fees associated with the origination, amending or upsizing of the Holdings Credit Facility are capitalized on the Company's Consolidated Statement of Assets and Liabilities and charged against income as other financing expenses over the life of the Holdings Credit Facility. The Holdings Credit Facility contains certain customary affirmative and negative covenants and events of default. In addition, the Holdings Credit Facility requires the Company to maintain a minimum asset coverage ratio of 150.0%. The covenants are generally not tied to mark to market fluctuations in the prices of NMF Holdings investments, but rather to the performance of the underlying portfolio companies.\n\nAs of the amendment on July 29, 2024, the Holdings Credit Facility bears interest at a rate of SOFR plus 2.15% per annum for Broadly Syndicated Loans (as defined in the Eleventh Amendment to the Loan and Security Agreement).

The Company may not redeem the 2022 Convertible Notes prior to July 15, 2025. On or after July 15, 2025, the Company may redeem the 2022 Convertible Notes for cash, in whole or from time to time in part, at our option at a redemption price, subject to an exception for redemption dates occurring after a record date but on or prior to the interest payment date, equal to the sum of (i) 100% of the principal amount of the 2022 Convertible Notes to be redeemed, (ii) accrued and unpaid interest thereon to, but excluding, the redemption date and (iii) a make-whole premium.\n\nThe following table summarizes certain key terms related to the convertible features of the 2022 Convertible Notes as of September 30, 2024:\n\n2022 Convertible Notes  \n---  \nInitial conversion premium(1)| 14.7 | %  \nInitial conversion rate(2)| 70.4225  \nInitial conversion price| $| 14.20  \nConversion rate at September 30, 2024(1)(2)| 73.0051  \nConversion price at September 30, 2024(2)(3)| $| 13.70  \nLast conversion price calculation date| September 16, 2024  \n  \n(1)Conversion rates denominated in shares of common stock per $1 principal amount of the 2022 Convertible Notes converted.\n\n(2)Represents conversion rate and conversion price, as applicable, taking into account certain de minimis adjustments that will be made on the conversion date.\n\n102\n\n[Table of Contents](#i72f805c51bb9408d93e6f5060262cdd1_10)\n\n(3)The conversion price in effect at September 30, 2024 on the 2022 Convertible Notes was calculated on September 16, 2024.\n\nThe conversion rate will be subject to adjustment upon certain events, such as stock splits and combinations, mergers, spin-offs, increases in dividends in excess of $0.30 per share per quarter for the 2022 Convertible Notes and certain changes in control. Certain of these adjustments, including adjustments for increases in dividends, are subject to a conversion price floor of $12.38 per share for the 2022 Convertible Notes. In no event will the total number of shares of common stock issuable upon conversion exceed 80.7754 per $1 principal amount of the 2022 Convertible Notes. The Company has determined that the embedded conversion option in the 2022 Convertible Notes is not required to be separately accounted for as a derivative under GAAP.\n\nThe 2022 Convertible Notes are unsecured obligations and rank senior in right of payment to the Company’s existing and future indebtedness, if any, that is expressly subordinated in right of payment to the 2022 Convertible Notes; equal in right of payment to the Company’s existing and future unsecured indebtedness that is not so subordinated; effectively junior in right of payment to any of the Company’s secured indebtedness (including existing unsecured indebtedness that the Company later secures) to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness; and structurally junior to all existing and future indebtedness (including trade payables) incurred by the Company’s subsidiaries and financing vehicles. As reflected in Note 11. Earnings Per Share, the issuance is considered part of the if-converted method for calculation of diluted earnings per share.\n\nThe following table summarizes the interest expense, amortization of financing costs and amortization of premium incurred on the 2018 Convertible Notes and 2022 Convertible Notes (together, the \"Convertible Notes\") for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023:\n\nThree Months Ended| Nine Months Ended  \n---|---  \nSeptember 30, 2024| September 30, 2023| September 30, 2024| September 30, 2023  \nInterest expense| $| 4,875 | $| 5,696 | $| 14,625 | $| 17,892  \nAmortization of financing costs| $| 410 | $| 447 | $| 1,210 | $| 1,276  \nAmortization of premium| $| (30)| $| (52)| $| (87)| $| (101)  \nWeighted average interest rate| 7.5 | %| 7.2 | %| 7.5 | %| 7.0 | %  \nEffective interest rate| 8.1 | %| 7.7 | %| 8.1 | %| 7.5 | %  \nAverage debt outstanding| $| 260,000 | $| 317,138 | $| 260,000 | $| 340,881  \n  \nAs of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the outstanding balance on the 2022 Convertible Notes was $260,000 and $260,000, respectively.

The NPA provides for future issuances of unsecured notes in separate series or tranches.\n\nThe 2019A Unsecured Notes bore interest at an annual rate of 5.494%. The 2021A Unsecured Notes bear interest at an annual rate of 3.875%, payable semi-annually in arrears on January 29 and July 29 of each year. The 2022A Unsecured Notes \n\n103\n\n[Table of Contents](#i72f805c51bb9408d93e6f5060262cdd1_10)\n\nbear interest at an annual rate of 5.900%, payable semi-annually in arrears on June 15 and December 15 of each year. These interest rates are subject to increase in the event that: (i) subject to certain exceptions, the underlying unsecured notes or the Company ceases to have an investment grade rating or (ii) the aggregate amount of the Company’s unsecured debt falls below $150,000. In each such event, the Company has the option to offer to prepay the underlying unsecured notes at par, in which case holders of the underlying unsecured notes who accept the offer would not receive the increased interest rate. In addition, the Company is obligated to offer to prepay the underlying unsecured notes at par if the Investment Adviser, or an affiliate thereof, ceases to be the Company’s investment adviser or if certain change in control events occur with respect to the Investment Adviser. \n\nThe NPA contains customary terms and conditions for unsecured notes issued in a private placement, including, without limitation, an option to offer to prepay all or a portion of the unsecured notes under its governance at par (plus a make-whole amount, if applicable), affirmative and negative covenants such as information reporting, maintenance of the Company’s status as a BDC under the 1940 Act and a RIC under the Code, minimum stockholders’ equity, minimum asset coverage ratio, and prohibitions on certain fundamental changes at the Company or any subsidiary guarantor, as well as customary events of default with customary cure and notice, including, without limitation, nonpayment, misrepresentation in a material respect, breach of covenant, cross-default under other indebtedness of the Company or certain significant subsidiaries, certain judgments and orders, and certain events of bankruptcy.

The 6.200% Unsecured Notes bear interest at an annual rate of 6.200%, payable semi-annually on April 15 and October 15 of each year, beginning on April 15, 2025. The Company may redeem the 6.200% Unsecured Notes, in whole or in part, at any time prior to October 15, 2027, at par plus a \"make-whole\" premium and accrued interest.\n\nThe Unsecured Notes are unsecured obligations and rank senior in right of payment to the Company’s existing and future indebtedness, if any, that is expressly subordinated in right of payment to the Unsecured Notes; equal in right of payment to the Company’s existing and future unsecured indebtedness that is not so subordinated; effectively junior in right of payment to any of the Company’s secured indebtedness (including existing unsecured indebtedness that the Company later secures) to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness; and structurally junior to all existing and future indebtedness (including trade payables) incurred by the Company’s subsidiaries and financing vehicles.\n\n104\n\n[Table of Contents](#i72f805c51bb9408d93e6f5060262cdd1_10)\n\nThe following table summarizes the interest expense and amortization of financing costs incurred on the Unsecured Notes for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023:\n\nThree Months Ended| Nine Months Ended  \n---|---  \nSeptember 30, 2024| September 30, 2023| September 30, 2024| September 30, 2023  \nInterest expense(1)| $| 12,277 | $| 4,644 | $| 33,765 | $| 15,602  \nAmortization of financing costs| $| 526 | $| 143 | $| 1,539 | $| 524  \nAmortization of discount| $| 165 | $| — | $| 422 | $| —  \nWeighted average interest rate| 6.7 | %| 4.7 | %| 6.5 | %| 4.8 | %  \nEffective interest rate| 7.3 | %| 4.9 | %| 7.0 | %| 5.0 | %  \nAverage debt outstanding| $| 706,304 | $| 391,500 | $| 676,414 | $| 433,661  \n  \n(1)Interest expense includes net expense recognized on fair value hedges.\n\nAs of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the outstanding balance on the Unsecured Notes was $993,577 and $506,500, respectively, and the Company was in compliance with the terms of the NPA and Indenture as of such dates, as applicable.\n\nIn connection with the issuance of the 6.875% Unsecured Notes, the Company entered into an interest rate swap on March 22, 2024 with Morgan Stanley Bank N.A., in which the Company receives a fixed interest rate of 6.875% and pays a floating interest rate of one-month SOFR plus 2.8183% on the notional amount of $300,000. In connection with the issuance of the 6.200% Unsecured Notes, the Company entered into an interest rate swap on September 23, 2024 with Morgan Stanley Bank, N.A., in which the Company receives a fixed interest rate of 6.200% and pays a floating rate of one-month SOFR plus 2.882% on the notional amount of $300,000. The Company designates interest rate swaps as fair value hedges in a qualifying fair value hedge accounting relationship to mitigate risk of changes in the fair value of financial liabilities due to interest rate risk. As a result, the Company will present changes in fair value of the hedging instruments and the related hedged items in interest expense within the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Operations.\n\nThe Company recorded and formally documented all hedging relationships, its risk management objective and strategy upon entering into each hedging relationship. For each hedging relationship, the Company performs quarterly quantitative assessments of the hedge effectiveness to assess that the hedging relationships are highly effective in offsetting changes in fair values of hedged items and whether the relationship is expected to continue to be highly effective in the future. To the extent the changes in fair value of the derivative do not offset the changes in fair value of the hedged item, the difference is recognized. The corresponding adjustment to the hedged asset or liability is included in the basis of the hedged item, while the corresponding change in the fair value of the derivative instrument is recorded as an adjustment to \"Derivative assets at fair value\" or \"Derivative liabilities at fair value\", as applicable.\n\nIf a hedge relationship is de-designated or if hedge accounting is discontinued because the hedged item no longer exists, the derivative will continue to be recorded as a \"Derivative asset at fair value\" or \"Derivative liability at fair value\" in the Consolidated Statements of Assets and Liabilities at its fair value, with changes in fair value recognized in net change in unrealized appreciation (depreciation).\n\n105\n\n[Table of Contents](#i72f805c51bb9408d93e6f5060262cdd1_10)\n\nThe following table presents the effect of hedging derivative instruments on the Consolidated Statements of Operations and the total amounts for the respective line items affected:\n\nThree Months Ended| Nine Months Ended  \n---|---  \nSeptember 30, 2024| September 30, 2024  \n(Losses) gains on fair value hedging relationship:  \nInterest rate swap contract:  \nInterest expense recognized on derivative| $| (1,189)| $| (2,270)  \nGains recognized on derivative| 9,092 | 7,539  \nLosses recognized on hedged item| (9,350)| (8,175)  \nNet expense recognized on fair value hedge| $| (1,447)| $| (2,906)  \n  \nThe following table summarizes the carrying value of the Company's hedged assets and liabilities in fair value hedges and the associated cumulative basis adjustments included in those carrying values as of September 30, 2024.\n\nDescription| Carrying Value| Cumulative Amount of Basis Adjustment  \n---|---|---  \n6.875% Unsecured Notes| $| 306,122 | $| (8,817)  \n6.200% Unsecured Notes| $| 297,455 | $| 642  \n  \nThe Company’s derivative instrument contracts are subject to ISDA Master Agreements which contain certain covenants and other provisions upon the occurrence of specific credit-risk-related events which may allow the counterparties to terminate derivatives contracts if the Company fails to maintain sufficient asset coverage for its derivative contracts or upon certain credit events. As a result, the hedging relationship terminates and is immediately accelerated and deemed payable pursuant to the ISDA Master Agreement. \n\nThe aggregate fair values of all derivative instruments with any credit-risk-related contingent features that were in an asset position on September 30, 2024 was $7,539, for which Morgan Stanley Bank N.A. had posted collateral of $10,370. The Company does not have any derivatives that are not designated as hedging instruments.\n\nSBA-guaranteed debentures—On August 1, 2014 and August 25, 2017, respectively, SBIC I and SBIC II received licenses from the SBA to operate as SBICs.\n\nThese SBIC licenses allow each of SBIC I and SBIC II to obtain leverage by issuing SBA-guaranteed debentures, subject to the issuance of a capital commitment by the SBA and other customary procedures. SBA-guaranteed debentures are non-recourse to the Company, interest only debentures with interest payable semi-annually and have a ten year maturity. The principal amount of SBA-guaranteed debentures is not required to be paid prior to maturity but may be prepaid at any time without penalty. The interest rate of SBA-guaranteed debentures is fixed on a semi-annual basis at a market-driven spread over U.S. Treasury Notes with ten year maturities. The SBA, as a creditor, will have a superior claim to the assets of SBIC I and SBIC II over the Company's stockholders in the event SBIC I and SBIC II are liquidated or the SBA exercises remedies upon an event of default.\n\nThe maximum amount of borrowings available under current SBA regulations for a single licensee is $150,000 as long as the licensee has at least $75,000 in regulatory capital, receives a capital commitment from the SBA and has been through an examination by the SBA subsequent to licensing. In June 2018, legislation amended the 1958 Act by increasing the individual leverage limit from $150,000 to $175,000, subject to SBA approvals.\n\nAs of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, SBIC I had regulatory capital of $75,000 and $75,000, respectively, and SBA-guaranteed debentures outstanding of $150,000 and $150,000, respectively. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, SBIC II had regulatory capital of $75,000 and $75,000, respectively, and $150,000 and $150,000, respectively, of SBA-guaranteed debentures outstanding. The SBA-guaranteed debentures incur upfront fees of 3.435%, which consists of a 1.00% commitment fee and a 2.435% issuance discount, which are amortized over the life of the SBA-guaranteed debentures. \n\n106\n\n[Table of Contents](#i72f805c51bb9408d93e6f5060262cdd1_10)\n\nThe following table summarizes the Company’s SBA-guaranteed debentures as of September 30, 2024:\n\nIssuance Date| Maturity Date| Debenture Amount| Interest Rate| SBA Annual Charge  \n---|---|---|---|---  \nFixed SBA-guaranteed debentures(1):  \nMarch 25, 2015| March 1, 2025| $| 37,500 | 2.517 | %| 0.355 | %  \nSeptember 23, 2015| September 1, 2025| 37,500 | 2.829 | %| 0.355 | %  \nSeptember 23, 2015| September 1, 2025| 28,795 | 2.829 | %| 0.742 | %  \nMarch 23, 2016| March 1, 2026| 13,950 | 2.507 | %| 0.742 | %  \nSeptember 21, 2016| September 1, 2026| 4,000 | 2.051 | %| 0.742 | %  \nSeptember 20, 2017| September 1, 2027| 13,000 | 2.518 | %| 0.742 | %  \nMarch 21, 2018| March 1, 2028| 15,255 | 3.187 | %| 0.742 | %  \nFixed SBA-guaranteed debentures(2):  \nSeptember 19, 2018| September 1, 2028| 15,000 | 3.548 | %| 0.222 | %  \nSeptember 25, 2019| September 1, 2029| 19,000 | 2.283 | %| 0.222 | %  \nMarch 25, 2020| March 1, 2030| 41,000 | 2.078 | %| 0.222 | %  \nMarch 25, 2020| March 1, 2030| 24,000 | 2.078 | %| 0.275 | %  \nSeptember 23, 2020| September 1, 2030| 51,000 | 1.034 | %| 0.275 | %  \nTotal SBA-guaranteed debentures| $| 300,000  \n  \n(1)SBA-guaranteed debentures are held by SBIC I.\n\n(2)SBA-guaranteed debentures are held by SBIC II.\n\nPrior to pooling, the SBA-guaranteed debentures bear interest at an interim interest rate equal to the Federal Home Loan Bank of Chicago's Fixed Regular Advance Rate (Bank Advance Rate), plus 41 basis points. Once pooled, which occurs in March and September each year, the SBA-guaranteed debentures bear interest at a fixed rate that is set to the current 10-year treasury rate plus a spread at each pooling date.\n\nThe following table summarizes the interest expense and amortization of financing costs incurred on the SBA-guaranteed debentures for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023:\n\nThree Months Ended| Nine Months Ended  \n---|---  \nSeptember 30, 2024| September 30, 2023| September 30, 2024| September 30, 2023  \nInterest expense| $| 2,043 | $| 2,042 | $| 6,084 | $| 6,061  \nAmortization of financing costs| $| 253 | $| 253 | $| 753 | $| 750  \nWeighted average interest rate| 2.7 | %| 2.7 | %| 2.7 | %| 2.7 | %  \nEffective interest rate| 3.0 | %| 3.0 | %| 3.0 | %| 3.0 | %  \nAverage debt outstanding| $| 300,000 | $| 300,000 | $| 300,000 | $| 300,000  \n  \nThe SBIC program is designed to stimulate the flow of private investor capital into eligible small businesses, as defined by SBA regulations that, among other things: require SBICs to invest in eligible small businesses and invest at least 25.0% of investment capital in eligible smaller enterprises (as defined by the SBA regulations), place certain limitations on the financing terms of investments, regulate the types of financing provided by an SBIC, prohibit investments in small businesses with certain characteristics or in certain industries and require capitalization thresholds that limit distributions to the Company. SBICs are subject to an annual periodic examination by an SBA examiner to determine the SBIC's compliance with the relevant SBA regulations and an annual financial audit of its financial statements that are prepared on a basis of accounting other than GAAP (such as ASC 820) by an independent auditor.\n\nLeverage risk factors—The Company utilizes and may utilize leverage to the maximum extent permitted by the law for investment and other general business purposes. The Company's lenders will have fixed dollar claims on certain assets that are superior to the claims of the Company's common stockholders, and the Company would expect such lenders to seek recovery against these assets in the event of a default. The use of leverage also magnifies the potential for gain or loss on amounts invested. Leverage may magnify interest rate risk (particularly on the Company's fixed-rate investments), which is the risk that the prices of portfolio investments will fall or rise if market interest rates for those types of securities rise or fall. As a result, leverage may cause greater changes in the Company's net asset value. Similarly, leverage may cause a sharper decline in \n\n107\n\n[Table of Contents](#i72f805c51bb9408d93e6f5060262cdd1_10)\n\nthe Company's income than if the Company had not borrowed. Such a decline could negatively affect the Company's ability to make distributions to its stockholders. Leverage is generally considered a speculative investment technique. The Company's ability to service any debt incurred will depend largely on financial performance and will be subject to prevailing economic conditions and competitive pressures.\n\nNote 8. Regulation\n\nThe Company has elected to be treated, and intends to comply with the requirements to continue to qualify annually, as a RIC under Subchapter M of the Code. In order to continue to qualify and be subject to tax treatment as a RIC, among other things, the Company is generally required to timely distribute to its stockholders at least 90.0% of its investment company taxable income, as defined by the Code, for each year. The Company, among other things, intends to make and will continue to make the requisite distributions to its stockholders, which will generally relieve the Company from U.S. federal, state, and local income taxes (excluding excise taxes which may be imposed under the Code).\n\nAdditionally, as a BDC, the Company must not acquire any assets other than \"qualifying assets\" as defined in Section 55(a) of the 1940 Act unless, at the time the acquisition is made, at least 70.0% of its total assets are qualifying assets (with certain limited exceptions). In addition, the Company must offer to make available to all \"eligible portfolio companies\" (as defined in the 1940 Act) significant managerial assistance.\n\nNote 9. Commitments and Contingencies\n\nIn the normal course of business, the Company may enter into contracts that contain a variety of representations and warranties and which provide general indemnifications. The Company may also enter into future funding commitments such as revolving credit facilities, bridge financing commitments or delayed draw commitments. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had unfunded commitments on revolving credit facilities of $146,530, no outstanding bridge financing commitments and other future funding commitments of $130,848. As of December 31, 2023, the Company had unfunded commitments on revolving credit facilities of $112,803, no outstanding bridge financing commitments and other future funding commitments of $43,948. The unfunded commitments on revolving credit facilities and delayed draws are disclosed on the Company’s Consolidated Schedules of Investments.\n\nThe Company also had revolving borrowings available under the Holdings Credit Facility, the DB Credit Facility (prior to its termination on September 30, 2024), the NMFC Credit Facility, the Unsecured Management Company Revolver and the NMNLC Credit Facility II as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. See Note 7. Borrowings, for details.\n\nThe Company may from time to time enter into financing commitment letters. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company had commitment letters to purchase investments in the aggregate par amount of $87,649 and $11,105, respectively, which could require funding in the future.\n\n108\n\n[Table of Contents](#i72f805c51bb9408d93e6f5060262cdd1_10)\n\nNote 10.

Recent Accounting Standards Updates\n\nIn March 2020, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the \"FASB\") issued ASU 2020-04, Reference Rate Reform. The amendments in ASU 2020-04 provide optional expedients and exceptions for applying GAAP to contracts, hedging relationships, and other transactions affected by reference rate reform if certain criteria are met. The standard was effective as of March 12, 2020 through December 31, 2022. Management is currently evaluating the impact of the optional guidance on the Company's consolidated financial statements and disclosures. The Company did not utilize the optional expedients and exceptions provided by ASU 2020-04 during the quarter ended September 30, 2024. In December 2022, the FASB issued ASU No. 2022-06, Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Deferral of the Sunset Date of Topic 848, which deferred the sunset day of this guidance to December 31, 2024. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of this guidance on its consolidated financial statements.\n\nNote 14.

Based on our reviews we are not aware of any material modifications that should be made to the accompanying interim financial information for it to be in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\n\nWe have previously audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated statement of assets and liabilities of the Company, including the consolidated schedule of investments as of December 31, 2023, and the related consolidated statements of operations, changes in net assets and cash flows for the year then ended (not presented herein); and in our report dated February 26, 2024, we expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements. In our opinion, the information set forth in the accompanying consolidated statement of assets and liabilities as of December 31, 2023, is fairly stated, in all material respects, in relation to the consolidated statement of assets and liabilities from which it has been derived.\n\nBasis for Review Results\n\nThis interim financial information is the responsibility of the Company's management. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\n\nWe conducted our reviews in accordance with standards of the PCAOB. A review of interim financial information consists principally of applying analytical procedures and making inquiries of persons responsible for financial and accounting matters. It is substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB, the objective of which is the expression of an opinion regarding the financial statements taken as a whole. Accordingly, we do not express such an opinion.\n\n/s/ DELOITTE & TOUCHE LLP\n\nOctober 30, 2024\n\n114\n\n[Table of Contents](#i72f805c51bb9408d93e6f5060262cdd1_10)\n\nItem 2.

The Investment Adviser also manages other funds that may have investment mandates that are similar, in \n\n115\n\n[Table of Contents](#i72f805c51bb9408d93e6f5060262cdd1_10)\n\nwhole or in part, to ours. New Mountain Finance Administration, L.L.C. (the \"Administrator”), a wholly-owned subsidiary of New Mountain Capital, provides the administrative services necessary to conduct our day-to-day operations.\n\nWe have established the following wholly-owned direct and indirect subsidiaries:\n\n•New Mountain Finance Holdings, L.L.C. (\"NMF Holdings\") and New Mountain Finance DB, L.L.C. (\"NMFDB\"), whose assets are used to secure NMF Holdings’ credit facility and were used to secured NMFDB’s credit facility, until its termination on September 30, 2024, respectively;\n\n•New Mountain Finance SBIC, L.P. (\"SBIC I\") and New Mountain Finance SBIC II, L.P. (\"SBIC II\"), who have received licenses from the U.S. Small Business Administration (\"SBA\") to operate as small business investment companies (\"SBICs\") under Section 301(c) of the Small Business Investment Act of 1958, as amended (the \"1958 Act\") and their general partners, New Mountain Finance SBIC G.P., L.L.C. (\"SBIC I GP\") and New Mountain Finance SBIC II G.P., L.L.C. (\"SBIC II GP\"), respectively;\n\n•NMF Ancora Holdings, Inc. (\"NMF Ancora\"), NMF QID NGL Holdings, Inc. (\"NMF QID\"), NMF YP Holdings, Inc. (\"NMF YP\"), NMF Permian Holdings, LLC (\"NMF Permian\"), NMF HB, Inc. (\"NMF HB\"), NMF TRM, LLC (\"NMF TRM\"), NMF Pioneer, Inc. (\"NMF Pioneer\") and NMF OEC, Inc. (\"NMF OEC\"), which are treated as corporations for U.S. federal income tax purposes and are intended to facilitate our compliance with the requirements to be treated as a RIC under the Code by holding equity or equity related investments in portfolio companies organized as limited liability companies (or other forms of pass-through entities); we consolidate these corporations for accounting purposes but the corporations are not consolidated for income tax purposes and may incur income tax expense as a result of their ownership of the portfolio companies; and\n\n•New Mountain Finance Servicing, L.L.C. (\"NMF Servicing\"), which serves as the administrative agent on certain investment transactions.\n\nNew Mountain Net Lease Corporation (\"NMNLC\") is a majority-owned consolidated subsidiary of ours, which acquires commercial real estate properties that are subject to \"triple net\" leases has elected to be treated, and intends to comply with the requirements to continue to qualify annually, as a real estate investment trust, or REIT, within the meaning of Section 856(a) of the Code.\n\nWe are a leading BDC focused on providing direct lending solutions to U.S. upper middle market companies backed by top private equity sponsors. Our investment objective is to generate current income and capital appreciation through the sourcing and origination of senior secured loans and select junior capital positions, to growing businesses in defensive industries that offer attractive risk-adjusted returns. Our differentiated investment approach leverages the deep sector knowledge and operating resources of New Mountain Capital.\n\nSenior secured loans may include traditional first lien loans or unitranche loans. We invest a significant portion of our portfolio in unitranche loans, which are loans that combine both senior and subordinated debt, generally in a first-lien position. Because unitranche loans combine characteristics of senior and subordinated debt, they have risks similar to the risks associated with secured debt and subordinated debt. Certain unitranche loan investments may include “last-out” positions, which generally heighten the risk of loss. In some cases, our investments may also include equity interests.\n\nWe primarily invest in senior secured debt of U.S. sponsor-backed, middle market companies. We define middle market companies as those with annual earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (\"EBITDA\") of $10 million to $200 million. Our focus is on defensive growth businesses that generally exhibit the following characteristics: (i) acyclicality, (ii) sustainable secular growth drivers, (iii) niche market dominance and high barriers to competitive entry, (iv) recurring revenue and strong free cash flow, (v) flexible cost structures and (vi) seasoned management teams. \n\nSimilar to us, the investment objective of SBIC I and SBIC II is to generate current income and capital appreciation under the investment criteria we use. However, SBIC I and SBIC II investments must be in SBA eligible small businesses. Our portfolio may be concentrated in a limited number of industries. As of September 30, 2024, our top five industry concentrations were software, business services, healthcare, investment funds (which includes our investments in our joint ventures) and consumer services.\n\nAs of September 30, 2024, our net asset value was approximately $1,361.3 million and our portfolio had a fair value, as determined in good faith by the board of directors, of approximately $3,265.3 million in 127 portfolio companies, with a weighted average yield to maturity at cost for income producing investments (\"YTM at Cost\") of approximately 10.5% and a weighted average yield to maturity at cost for all investments (\"YTM at Cost for Investments\") of approximately 9.5%. The YTM at Cost calculation assumes that all investments, including secured collateralized agreements, not on non-accrual are purchased at cost on the quarter end date and held until their respective maturities with no prepayments or losses and exited at par at maturity. The YTM at Cost for Investments calculation assumes that all investments, including secured collateralized agreements, are purchased at cost on the quarter end date and held until their respective maturities with no prepayments or losses and exited at par at maturity. YTM at Cost and YTM at Cost for Investments calculations exclude the impact of existing \n\n116\n\n[Table of Contents](#i72f805c51bb9408d93e6f5060262cdd1_10)\n\nleverage. YTM at Cost and YTM at Cost for Investments use Sterling Overnight Interbank Average Rate (\"SONIA\"), Secured Overnight Financing Rate (\"SOFR\") and Euro Interbank Offered Rate (\"EURIBOR\") curves at each quarter's end date. The actual yield to maturity may be higher or lower due to the future selection of the SONIA, SOFR and EURIBOR contracts by the individual companies in our portfolio or other factors.\n\nRecent Developments\n\nOn October 23, 2024, our board of directors declared a fourth quarter 2024 distribution of $0.32 per share and a supplemental distribution related to third quarter earnings of $0.01 per share, each payable on December 31, 2024 to holders of record as of December 17, 2024.\n\nCritical Accounting Estimates\n\nThe preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (\"GAAP\") requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and revenues and expenses during the periods reported. Actual results could materially differ from those estimates. We have identified the following items as critical accounting policies.\n\nBasis of Accounting\n\nWe consolidate our wholly-owned direct and indirect subsidiaries: NMF Holdings, NMF Servicing, NMFDB, SBIC I, SBIC I GP, SBIC II, SBIC II GP, NMF Ancora, NMF QID, NMF YP, NMF Permian, NMF HB, NMF TRM, NMF Pioneer and NMF OEC and our majority-owned consolidated subsidiary, NMNLC. We are an investment company following accounting and reporting guidance as described in Accounting Standards Codification Topic 946, Financial Services—Investment Companies (\"ASC 946\"). \n\nValuation and Leveling of Portfolio Investments\n\nAt all times consistent with GAAP and the 1940 Act, we conduct a valuation of our assets, which impacts our net asset value.\n\nWe value our assets on a quarterly basis, or more frequently if required under the 1940 Act. In all cases, our board of directors is ultimately and solely responsible for determining the fair value of our portfolio investments on a quarterly basis in good faith, including investments that are not publicly traded, those whose market prices are not readily available and any other situation where our portfolio investments require a fair value determination. Security transactions are accounted for on a trade date basis. Our quarterly valuation procedures are set forth in more detail below:\n\n(1)Investments for which market quotations are readily available on an exchange are valued at such market quotations based on the closing price indicated from independent pricing services.\n\n(2)Investments for which indicative prices are obtained from various pricing services and/or brokers or dealers are valued through a multi-step valuation process, as described below, to determine whether the quote(s) obtained is representative of fair value in accordance with GAAP.\n\na.Bond quotes are obtained through independent pricing services. Internal reviews are performed by the investment professionals of the Investment Adviser to ensure that the quote obtained is representative of fair value in accordance with GAAP and, if so, the quote is used. If the Investment Adviser is unable to sufficiently validate the quote(s) internally and if the investment's par value or its fair value exceeds the materiality threshold, the investment is valued similarly to those assets with no readily available quotes (see (3) below); and\n\nb.For investments other than bonds, we look at the number of quotes readily available and perform the following procedures:\n\ni.Investments for which two or more quotes are received from a pricing service are valued using the mean of the mean of the bid and ask of the quotes obtained. We will evaluate the reasonableness of the quote, and if the quote is determined to not be representative of fair value, we will use one or more of the methodologies outlined below to determine fair value;\n\nii.Investments for which one quote is received from a pricing service are validated internally. The investment professionals of the Investment Adviser analyze the market quotes obtained using an array of valuation methods (further described below) to validate the fair value. If the Investment Adviser is unable to sufficiently validate the quote internally and if the investment's par value or its fair value exceeds the materiality threshold, the investment is valued similarly to those assets with no readily available quotes (see (3) below).\n\n117\n\n[Table of Contents](#i72f805c51bb9408d93e6f5060262cdd1_10)\n\n(3)Investments for which quotations are not readily available through exchanges, pricing services, brokers, or dealers are valued through a multi-step valuation process:\n\na.Each portfolio company or investment is initially valued by the investment professionals of the Investment Adviser responsible for the credit monitoring;\n\nb.Preliminary valuation conclusions will then be documented and discussed with our senior management;\n\nc.If an investment falls into (3) above for four consecutive quarters and if the investment's par value or its fair value exceeds the materiality threshold, then at least once each fiscal year, the valuation for each portfolio investment for which we do not have a readily available market quotation will be reviewed by an independent valuation firm engaged by our board of directors; and\n\nd.When deemed appropriate by our management, an independent valuation firm may be engaged to review and value investment(s) of a portfolio company, without any preliminary valuation being performed by the Investment Adviser. The investment professionals of the Investment Adviser will review and validate the value provided.\n\nFor investments in revolving credit facilities and delayed draw commitments, the cost basis of the funded investments purchased is offset by any costs/netbacks received for any unfunded portion on the total balance committed. The fair value is also adjusted for the price appreciation or depreciation on the unfunded portion. As a result, the purchase of a commitment not completely funded may result in a negative fair value until it is called and funded.\n\nThe values assigned to investments are based upon available information and do not necessarily represent amounts which might ultimately be realized, since such amounts depend on future circumstances and cannot be reasonably determined until the individual positions are liquidated. Due to the inherent uncertainty of determining the fair value of investments that do not have a readily available market value, the fair value of our investments may fluctuate from period to period and the fluctuations could be material.\n\nGAAP fair value measurement guidance classifies the inputs used in measuring fair value into three levels as follows:\n\nLevel I—Quoted prices (unadjusted) are available in active markets for identical investments and we have the ability to access such quotes as of the reporting date. The type of investments which would generally be included in Level I include active exchange-traded equity securities and exchange-traded derivatives. As required by Accounting Standards Codification Topic 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures (\"ASC 820\"), we, to the extent that we hold such investments, do not adjust the quoted price for these investments, even in situations where we hold a large position and a sale could reasonably impact the quoted price. \n\nLevel II—Pricing inputs are observable for the investments, either directly or indirectly, as of the reporting date, but are not the same as those used in Level I. Level II inputs include the following:\n\n•Quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets;\n\n•Quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in non-active markets (examples include corporate and municipal bonds, which trade infrequently);\n\n•Pricing models whose inputs are observable for substantially the full term of the asset or liability (examples include most over-the-counter derivatives, including foreign exchange forward contracts); and\n\n•Pricing models whose inputs are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data through correlation or other means for substantially the full term of the asset or liability.\n\nLevel III—Pricing inputs are unobservable for the investment and include situations where there is little, if any, market activity for the investment.\n\nThe inputs used to measure fair value may fall into different levels. In all instances when the inputs fall within different levels of the hierarchy, the level within which the fair value measurement is categorized is based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety. As such, a Level III fair value measurement may include inputs that are both observable and unobservable. Gains and losses for such assets categorized within the Level III table below may include changes in fair value that are attributable to both observable inputs and unobservable inputs.\n\nThe inputs into the determination of fair value require significant judgment or estimation by management and consideration of factors specific to each investment. A review of the fair value hierarchy classifications is conducted on a quarterly basis. Changes in the observability of valuation inputs may result in the transfer of certain investments within the fair value hierarchy from period to period. \n\n118\n\n[Table of Contents](#i72f805c51bb9408d93e6f5060262cdd1_10)\n\nSee Item 1.—Financial Statements and Supplementary Data—Note 4. Fair Value in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for additional information on fair value hierarchy as of September 30, 2024.\n\nWe generally use the following framework when determining the fair value of investments where there are little, if any, market activity or observable pricing inputs. We typically determine the fair value of our performing debt investments utilizing an income approach. Additional consideration is given using a market based approach, as well as reviewing the overall underlying portfolio company's performance and associated financial risks. The following outlines additional details on the approaches considered:\n\nCompany Performance, Financial Review, and Analysis: Prior to investment, as part of our due diligence process, we evaluate the overall performance and financial stability of the portfolio company. Post investment, we analyze each portfolio company's current operating performance and relevant financial trends versus prior year and budgeted results, including, but not limited to, factors affecting its revenue and earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (\"EBITDA\") growth, margin trends, liquidity position, covenant compliance and changes to its capital structure. We also attempt to identify and subsequently track any developments at the portfolio company, within its customer or vendor base or within the industry or the macroeconomic environment, generally, that may alter any material element of our original investment thesis. This analysis is specific to each portfolio company. We leverage the knowledge gained from our original due diligence process, augmented by this subsequent monitoring, to continually refine our outlook for each of our portfolio companies and ultimately form the valuation of our investment in each portfolio company. When an external event such as a purchase transaction, public offering or subsequent sale occurs, we will consider the pricing indicated by the external event to corroborate the private valuation.\n\nFor debt investments, we may employ the Market Based Approach (as described below) to assess the total enterprise value of the portfolio company, in order to evaluate the enterprise value coverage of our debt investment. For equity investments or in cases where the Market Based Approach implies a lack of enterprise value coverage for the debt investment, we may additionally employ a discounted cash flow analysis based on the free cash flows of the portfolio company to assess the total enterprise value. After enterprise value coverage is demonstrated for our debt investments through the method(s) above, the Income Based Approach (as described below) may be employed to estimate the fair value of the investment.\n\nMarket Based Approach: We may estimate the total enterprise value of each portfolio company by utilizing EBITDA or revenue multiples of publicly traded comparable companies and comparable transactions. We consider numerous factors when selecting the appropriate companies whose trading multiples are used to value our portfolio companies. These factors include, but are not limited to, the type of organization, similarity to the business being valued, and relevant risk factors, as well as size, profitability and growth expectations. We may apply an average of various relevant comparable company EBITDA or revenue multiples to the portfolio company's latest twelve month (\"LTM\") EBITDA or revenue, or projected EBITDA or revenue to calculate the enterprise value of the portfolio company. Significant increases or decreases in the EBITDA or revenue multiples will result in an increase or decrease in enterprise value, which may result in an increase or decrease in the fair value estimate of the investment. \n\nIncome Based Approach: We also may use a discounted cash flow analysis to estimate the fair value of the investment. Projected cash flows represent the relevant security's contractual interest, fee and principal payments plus the assumption of full principal recovery at the investment's expected maturity date. These cash flows are discounted at a rate established utilizing a combination of a yield calibration approach and a comparable investment approach. The yield calibration approach incorporates changes in the credit quality (as measured by relevant statistics) of the portfolio company, as compared to changes in the yield associated with comparable credit quality market indices, between the date of origination and the valuation date. The comparable investment approach utilizes an average yield-to maturity of a selected set of high-quality, liquid investments to determine a comparable investment discount rate. Significant increases or decreases in the discount rate would result in a decrease or increase in the fair value measurement. \n\nSee Item 1.—Financial Statements and Supplementary Data—Note 4.

SLP III is structured as a private joint venture investment fund between us and SkyKnight Income II, LLC (“SkyKnight II”) and operates under a limited liability company agreement (the \"SLP III Agreement\"). The purpose of the joint venture is to invest primarily in senior secured loans issued by portfolio companies within our core industry verticals. These investments are typically broadly syndicated first lien loans. All investment decisions must be unanimously approved by the board of managers of SLP III, which has equal representation from us and SkyKnight II. SLP III has a five year investment period and will continue in existence until July 8, 2029. On July 3, 2024, the investment period was extended until July 8, 2027. The investment period may be extended for up to one year pursuant to certain terms of the SLP III Agreement. \n\n119\n\n[Table of Contents](#i72f805c51bb9408d93e6f5060262cdd1_10)\n\nSLP III is capitalized with equity contributions which are called from its members, on a pro-rata basis based on their equity commitments, as transactions are completed.

These transactions are treated as collateralized financing transactions and are recorded at their contracted resale or repurchase amounts, as specified in the respective agreements. Interest on collateralized agreements is accrued and recognized over the life of the transaction and included in interest income. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we held one collateralized agreement to resell with a cost basis of $30.0 million and $30.0 million, respectively, and a fair value of $13.5 million and $16.5 million, respectively. The collateralized agreement to resell is on non-accrual. The collateralized agreement to resell is guaranteed by a private hedge fund, PPVA Fund, L.P. The private hedge fund is currently in liquidation under the laws of the Cayman Islands. Pursuant to the terms of the collateralized agreement, the private hedge fund was obligated to repurchase the collateral from us at the par value of the collateralized agreement. The private hedge fund has breached its agreement to repurchase the collateral under the collateralized agreement. The default by the private hedge fund did not release the collateral to us, therefore, we do not have full rights and title to the collateral. A claim has been filed with the Cayman Islands joint official liquidators to resolve this matter. The joint official liquidators have recognized our contractual rights under the collateralized agreement. We continue to exercise our rights under the collateralized agreement and continue to monitor the liquidation process of the private hedge fund. The fair value of the collateralized agreement to resell is reflective of the increased risk of the position.\n\nPPVA Black Elk (Equity) LLC\n\nOn May 3, 2013, we entered into a collateralized securities purchase and put agreement (the “SPP Agreement”) with a private hedge fund. Under the SPP Agreement, we purchased twenty million Class E Preferred Units of Black Elk Energy Offshore Operations, LLC (“Black Elk”) for $20.0 million with a corresponding obligation of the private hedge fund, PPVA Black Elk (Equity) LLC, to repurchase the preferred units for $20.0 million plus other amounts due under the SPP Agreement. The majority owner of Black Elk was the private hedge fund. In August 2014, we received a payment of $20.5 million, the full amount due under the SPP Agreement.\n\nIn August 2017, a trustee (the “Trustee”) for Black Elk informed us that the Trustee intended to assert a fraudulent conveyance claim (the “Claim”) against us and one of its affiliates seeking the return of the $20.5 million repayment. Black Elk filed a Chapter 11 bankruptcy petition pursuant to the U.S. Bankruptcy Code in August 2015. The Trustee alleged that individuals affiliated with the private hedge fund conspired with Black Elk and others to improperly use proceeds from the sale of certain Black Elk assets to repay, in August 2014, the private hedge fund’s obligation to us under the SPP Agreement. We were unaware of these claims at the time the repayment was received. The private hedge fund is currently in liquidation under the laws of the Cayman Islands.\n\nOn December 22, 2017, we settled the Trustee’s $20.5 million Claim for $16.0 million and filed a claim with the Cayman Islands joint official liquidators of the private hedge fund for $16.0 million that is owed to us under the SPP Agreement. The SPP Agreement was restored and is in effect since repayment has not been made. We continue to exercise our rights under the SPP Agreement and continue to monitor the liquidation process of the private hedge fund. During the year ended December 31, 2018, we received a $1.5 million payment from our insurance carrier in respect to the settlement. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the SPP Agreement had a cost basis of $14.5 million and $14.5 million, respectively, and a fair value of $6.5 million and $8.0 million, respectively, which is reflective of the higher inherent risk in this transaction.\n\n122\n\n[Table of Contents](#i72f805c51bb9408d93e6f5060262cdd1_10)\n\nRevenue Recognition\n\nSales and paydowns of investments: Realized gains and losses on investments are determined on the specific identification method.\n\nInterest and dividend income: Interest income, including amortization of premium and discount using the effective interest method, is recorded on the accrual basis and periodically assessed for collectability. Interest income also includes interest earned from cash on hand. Upon the prepayment of a loan or debt security, any prepayment penalties are recorded as part of interest income. We have loans and certain preferred equity investments in the portfolio that contain a payment-in-kind (“PIK”) interest or dividend provision. PIK interest and dividends are accrued and recorded as income at the contractual rates, if deemed collectible. The PIK interest and dividends are added to the principal or share balances on the capitalization dates and are generally due at maturity or when redeemed by the issuer. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 we recognized PIK and non-cash interest from investments of approximately $9.1 million and $27.7 million, respectively, and PIK and non-cash dividends from investments of approximately $8.3 million and $23.5 million, respectively. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, we recognized PIK and non-cash interest from investments of approximately $7.9 million and $24.8 million, respectively, and PIK and non-cash dividends from investments of approximately $7.0 million and $20.2 million, respectively.\n\nDividend income on common equity is recorded on the record date for private portfolio companies or on the ex-dividend date for publicly traded portfolio companies. Dividend income on preferred securities is recorded as dividend income on an accrual basis to the extent that such amounts are deemed collectible.\n\nNon-accrual income: Investments are placed on non-accrual status when principal or interest payments are past due for 30 days or more and when there is reasonable doubt that principal or interest will be collected. Accrued cash and un-capitalized PIK interest or dividends are reversed when an investment is placed on non-accrual status. Previously capitalized PIK interest or dividends are not reversed when an investment is placed on non-accrual status. Interest or dividend payments received on non-accrual investments may be recognized as income or applied to principal depending upon management’s judgment of the ultimate collectibility. Non-accrual investments are restored to accrual status when past due principal and interest is paid and, in management’s judgment, are likely to remain current.\n\nOther income: Other income represents delayed compensation, consent or amendment fees, revolver fees, structuring fees, upfront fees and other miscellaneous fees received and are typically non-recurring in nature. Delayed compensation is income earned from counterparties on trades that do not settle within a set number of business days after trade date. Other income may also include fees from bridge loans. We may from time to time enter into bridge financing commitments, an obligation to provide interim financing to a counterparty until permanent credit can be obtained. These commitments are short-term in nature and may expire unfunded. A fee is received for providing such commitments. Structuring fees and upfront fees are recognized as income when earned, usually when paid at the closing of the investment, and are non-refundable.\n\nMonitoring of Portfolio Investments\n\nWe monitor the performance and financial trends of our portfolio companies on at least a quarterly basis. We attempt to identify any developments within the portfolio company, the industry or the macroeconomic environment that may alter any material element of our original investment strategy. Our portfolio monitoring procedures are designed to provide a simple yet comprehensive analysis of our portfolio companies based on their operating performance and underlying business characteristics, which in turn forms the basis of its Risk Rating (as defined below).\n\nWe use an investment risk rating system to characterize and monitor the credit profile and expected level of returns on each investment in the portfolio. As such, we assign each investment a composite score (“Risk Rating”) based on two metrics – 1) Operating Performance and 2) Business Characteristics:\n\n•Operating Performance assesses the health of the investment in context of its financial performance and the market environment it faces. The metric is expressed in Tiers of “4” to “1”, with “4” being the best and “1” being the worst:\n\n◦Tier 4 – Business performance is in-line with or above expectations\n\n◦Tier 3 – Moderate business underperformance and/or moderate market headwinds\n\n◦Tier 2 – Significant business underperformance and/or significant market headwinds\n\n◦Tier 1 – Severe business underperformance and/or severe market headwinds\n\n•Business Characteristics assesses the health of the investment in context of the underlying portfolio company’s business and credit quality, the underlying portfolio company’s current balance sheet, and the level of support from the \n\n123\n\n[Table of Contents](#i72f805c51bb9408d93e6f5060262cdd1_10)\n\nequity sponsor. The metric is expressed as on a qualitative scale of “A” to “C”, with “A” being the best and “C” being the worst.\n\nThe Risk Rating for each investment is a composite of these two metrics. The Risk Rating is expressed in categories of Green, Yellow, Orange and Red, with Green reflecting an investment that is in-line with or above expectations and Red reflecting an investment performing materially below expectations. The mapping of the composite scores to these categories are below:\n\n•Green – 4C, 3B, 2A, 4B, 3A, and 4A (e.g., Tier 4 for Operating Performance and C for Business Characteristics)\n\n•Yellow – 3C, 2B, and 1A\n\n•Orange – 2C and 1B\n\n•Red – 1C \n\nThe following table shows the Risk Rating of our portfolio companies as of September 30, 2024:\n\n(in millions)| As of September 30, 2024  \n---|---  \nRisk Rating| Cost| Percent| Fair Value| Percent  \nGreen| $| 3,143.6 | 95.4 | %| $| 3,189.0 | 97.3 | %  \nYellow| 80.3 | 2.4 | %| 53.0 | 1.6 | %  \nOrange| 72.4 | 2.2 | %| 36.8 | 1.1 | %  \nRed| — | — | — | —   \nTotal| $| 3,296.3 | 100.0 | %| $| 3,278.8 | 100.0 | %  \n  \nAs of September 30, 2024, all investments in our portfolio had a Green Risk Rating with the exception of four portfolio companies that had a Yellow Risk Rating, and six portfolio companies that had an Orange Risk Rating. As of September 30, 2024, no portfolio companies had a Red Risk Rating.\n\nDuring the second quarter of 2022, we placed our second lien positions in National HME, Inc. (\"National HME\") on non-accrual status. As of September 30, 2024, our second lien position in National HME had an aggregate cost basis of $7.9 million, an aggregate fair value of $3.0 million and total unearned interest income of $0.5 million and $1.5 million, respectively, for the three and nine months then ended. As of September 30, 2024, our investment in National HME had an Orange Risk Rating.\n\nAs of September 30, 2024, our aggregate principal amount of our subordinated position and first lien term loans in American Achievement Corporation (\"AAC\") was $5.2 million and $31.4 million, respectively. During the first quarter of 2021, we placed an aggregate principal amount of $5.2 million of our subordinated position on non-accrual status. During the third quarter of 2021, we placed an aggregate principal amount of $13.5 million of our first lien term loans on non-accrual status. During the third quarter of 2023, we placed the remaining aggregate principal amount of $17.9 million of our first lien term loans on non-accrual status. As of September 30, 2024, our positions in AAC on non-accrual status had an aggregate cost basis of $31.4 million, an aggregate fair value of $18.0 million and total unearned interest income of $1.3 million and $3.7 million, for the three and nine months then ended. As of September 30, 2024, our investment in AAC had an Orange Risk Rating.\n\nDuring the first quarter of 2020, we placed our investment in our junior preferred shares of UniTek Global Services, Inc. (\"UniTek\") on non-accrual status. As of September 30, 2024, our junior preferred shares of UniTek had an aggregate cost basis of $34.4 million, an aggregate fair value of $0 and total unearned dividend income of $2.2 million and $6.4 million, respectively, for the three and nine months then ended.

For the three months ended September 30, 2024, total investment income of approximately $95.3 million consisted of approximately $61.9 million in cash interest from investments, approximately $9.0 million in PIK and non-cash interest from investments, approximately $0.1 million in prepayment fees, net amortization of purchase premiums and discounts of approximately $1.7 million, approximately $12.0 million in cash dividends from investments, approximately $8.4 million in PIK and non-cash dividends from investments and approximately $2.2 million in other income. The decrease in interest income of approximately $1.2 million during the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023 was primarily due to the decrease in total coupon rates on our floating rate investments, partially offset by a larger invested balance. The increase in dividend income of approximately $2.2 million during the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023 was primarily due to an increase in cash dividends from SLP III and an increase in PIK dividends on our preferred equity investments. Other income during the three months ended September 30, 2024, which represents fees that are generally non-recurring in nature, was primarily attributable to upfront and amendment fees received from 19 different portfolio companies.\n\n125\n\n[Table of Contents](#i72f805c51bb9408d93e6f5060262cdd1_10)\n\nOperating Expenses\n\nThree Months Ended  \n---  \n(in thousands)| September 30, 2024| September 30, 2023  \nManagement fee| $| 11,700 | $| 11,334   \nLess: management fee waiver| (970)| (1,013)  \nTotal management fee| 10,730 | 10,321   \nIncentive fee| 8,821 | 10,169   \nInterest and other financing expenses| 37,661 | 31,425   \nProfessional fees| 1,019 | 850   \nAdministrative expenses| 1,059 | 995   \nOther general and administrative expenses| 531 | 542   \nTotal expenses| 59,821 | 54,302   \nIncome tax expense (benefit)| 118 | (627)  \nNet expenses after income taxes| $| 59,939 | $| 53,675   \n  \nOur total net operating expenses increased by approximately $6.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023.

Our incentive fee decreased by approximately $1.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in incentives fees was attributable to a decrease in net investment income. Interest and other financing expenses increased by approximately $6.2 million during the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023 as a result of the acceleration of financing costs upon termination of the DB Credit Facility, an increase in our cost of borrowings due to higher SOFR rates on our floating rate facilities, our 8.250% Unsecured Notes, issued on November 13, 2023 and our 6.875% Unsecured Notes, issued on February 1, 2024, partially offset by the repayment of our 2019A Unsecured Notes on February 5, 2024.

As movement in unrealized appreciation or depreciation can be the result of realizations, we look at net realized and unrealized gains or losses together. The net loss for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily driven by unrealized depreciation in New Permian Holdco, Inc., TVG-Edmentum Holdings, LLC (\"Edmentum\") and AAC, partially offset by unrealized appreciation in HB Wealth Management, LLC (\"Homrich\"), NM NL Holdings, L.P. and NM YI, LLC. The provision for income taxes was attributable to equity investments that are held as of September 30, 2024 in eight of our corporate subsidiaries.

In addition, we may from time to time enter into additional debt facilities, increase the size of existing facilities or issue additional debt securities, including unsecured debt and/or debt securities convertible into common stock. Any such incurrence or issuance would be subject to prevailing market conditions, our liquidity requirements, contractual and regulatory restrictions and other factors. On June 8, 2018 our shareholders approved the application of the modified asset coverage requirements set forth in Section 61(a) of the 1940 Act, which resulted in the reduction of the minimum asset coverage ratio applicable to us from 200.0% to 150.0% as of June 9, 2018. In accordance with the 1940 Act, with certain limited exceptions, we are only allowed to borrow amounts such that our asset coverage, calculated pursuant to the 1940 Act, is at least 150.0% after such borrowing (which means we can borrow $2 for every $1 of our equity). As a result of our exemptive relief received on November 5, 2014, we are permitted to exclude the SBA-guaranteed debentures held by SBIC I and SBIC II from the 150.0% asset coverage ratio that we are required to maintain under the 1940 Act. The agreements governing the NMFC Credit Facility, the Convertible Notes and certain of the Unsecured Notes (as defined in Item 1— Financial Statements—Note 7. Borrowings) contain certain covenants and terms, including a requirement that we not exceed a debt-to-equity ratio of 1.65 to 1.00 at the time of incurring additional indebtedness and a requirement that we not exceed a secured debt ratio of 0.70 to 1.00 at any time. As of September 30, 2024, our asset coverage ratio was 179.2%.\n\n129\n\n[Table of Contents](#i72f805c51bb9408d93e6f5060262cdd1_10)\n\nAs of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, our borrowings consisted of the 2019A Unsecured Notes (repaid on February 5, 2024), 2021A Unsecured Notes, 2022A Unsecured Notes, 8.250% Unsecured Notes, 6.875% Unsecured Notes (issued on February 1, 2024), SBA-guaranteed debentures, Holdings Credit Facility, 2022 Convertible Notes, DB Credit Facility (repaid and terminated on September 30, 2024), NMFC Credit Facility, NMNLC Credit Facility II and Unsecured Management Company Revolver. See Item 1—Financial Statements —Note 7. Borrowings in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for additional information. \n\nAt September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had cash and cash equivalents of approximately $61.9 million and $70.1 million, respectively. Our cash (used in) provided by operating activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023 was approximately $(153.2) million and $207.0 million, respectively. We expect that all current liquidity needs will be met with cash flows from operations and other activities.\n\nOn November 3, 2021, we entered into an equity distribution agreement, as amended on May 18, 2023, August 23, 2023, June 27, 2024 and August 1, 2024 (the “Distribution Agreement”) with B. Riley Securities, Inc. and Raymond James & Associates, Inc. (collectively, the “Agents”). The Distribution Agreement originally provided that we may issue and sell our shares from time to time through the Agents, up to $250.0 million worth of our common stock by means of at-the-market (\"ATM\") offerings. As of the amendment on June 27, 2024, we increased the maximum amount of shares to be sold through the ATM program from $250.0 million to $400.0 million. \n\nFor the three months ended September 30, 2024, we did not sell any shares of common stock under the Distribution Agreement. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we sold 5,292,556 shares of common stock under the Distribution Agreement and received total accumulated net proceeds of approximately $67.7 million, including $0.0 million of offering expenses, from these sales. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, we sold 502,623 and 502,623 shares, respectively, of common stock, under the Distribution Agreement and received total accumulated net proceeds of approximately $6.6 million and $6.6 million, respectively, including $0.0 million and $0.0 million, respectively, of offering expenses, from these sales.\n\nWe generally use net proceeds from these ATM offerings to make investments, to pay down liabilities and for general corporate purposes. As of September 30, 2024, shares representing approximately $258.0 million of our common stock remain available for issuance and sale under the Distribution Agreement.\n\nOff-Balance Sheet Agreements\n\nWe may become a party to financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk in the normal course of business to meet the financial needs of our portfolio companies. These instruments may include commitments to extend credit and involve, to varying degrees, elements of liquidity and credit risk in excess of the amount recognized in the balance sheet. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had outstanding commitments to third parties to fund investments totaling $277.4 million and $156.8 million, respectively, under various undrawn revolving credit facilities, delayed draw commitments or other future funding commitments.\n\nWe may from time to time enter into financing commitment letters or bridge financing commitments, which could require funding in the future. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had commitment letters to purchase investments in an aggregate par amount of $87.6 million and $11.1 million, respectively. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had not entered into any bridge financing commitments which could require funding in the future.\n\n130\n\n[Table of Contents](#i72f805c51bb9408d93e6f5060262cdd1_10)\n\nContractual Obligations\n\nA summary of our significant contractual payment obligations as of September 30, 2024 is as follows:\n\nContractual Obligations Payments Due by Period  \n---  \n(in millions)| Total| Less than1 Year| 1 - 3 Years| 3 - 5 Years| More than5 Years  \nUnsecured Notes(1)| $| 990.0 | $| — | $| 275.0 | $| 715.0 | $| —   \nHoldings Credit Facility(2)| 407.6 | — | — | 407.6 | —   \nSBA-guaranteed debentures(3)| 300.0 | 103.8 | 30.9 | 49.3 | 116.0   \n2022 Convertible Notes(4)| 260.0 | — | 260.0 | — | —   \nNMFC Credit Facility(5)| 55.0 | — | 5.6 | 49.4 | —   \nNMNLC Credit Facility II(6)| 2.9 | 2.9 | — | — | —   \nTotal Contractual Obligations(7)| $| 2,015.5 | $| 106.7 | $| 571.5 | $| 1,221.3 | $| 116.0   \n  \n(1)$200.0 million of the 2021A Unsecured Notes will mature on January 29, 2026 unless earlier repurchased, $75.0 million of the 2022A Unsecured Notes will mature on June 15, 2027 unless earlier repurchased, $115.0 million of the 8.250% Unsecured Notes will mature on November 15, 2028 unless earlier redeemed, $300.0 million of the 6.875% Unsecured Notes will mature on February 1, 2029 unless earlier redeemed and $300.0 million of the 6.200% Unsecured Notes will mature on October 15, 2027 unless earlier redeemed.\n\n(2)Under the terms of the $730.0 million Holdings Credit Facility, all outstanding borrowings under that facility ($407.6 million as of September 30, 2024) must be repaid on or before October 26, 2028.

As of September 30, 2024, there were no borrowings outstanding. \n\nWe have entered into an investment management and advisory agreement (the \"Investment Management Agreement\") with the Investment Adviser in accordance with the 1940 Act. Under the Investment Management Agreement, the Investment Adviser has agreed to provide us with investment advisory and management services. We have agreed to pay for these services (1) a management fee and (2) an incentive fee based on our performance.\n\nWe have also entered into the administration agreement, as amended and restated (the \"Administration Agreement\") with the Administrator. Under the Administration Agreement, the Administrator has agreed to arrange office space for us and provide office equipment and clerical, bookkeeping and record keeping services and other administrative services necessary to conduct our respective day-to-day operations. The Administrator has also agreed to maintain, or oversee the maintenance of, our financial records, our reports to stockholders and reports filed with the SEC.\n\nIf any of the contractual obligations discussed above are terminated, our costs under any new agreements that are entered into may increase. In addition, we would likely incur significant time and expense in locating alternative parties to provide the services we expect to receive under the Investment Management Agreement and the Administration Agreement.\n\n131\n\n[Table of Contents](#i72f805c51bb9408d93e6f5060262cdd1_10)\n\nDistributions and Dividends\n\nDistributions declared and paid to stockholders for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 totaled approximately $111.6 million.\n\nThe following table reflects cash distributions, including dividends and returns of capital, if any, per share that have been declared by our board of directors for the two most recently completed fiscal years and the current fiscal year to date:\n\nFiscal Year Ended| Date Declared| Record Date| Payment Date| Per ShareAmount (1)  \n---|---|---|---|---  \nDecember 31, 2024  \nThird Quarter| July 23, 2024| September 16, 2024| September 30, 2024| $| 0.34 | (2)  \nSecond Quarter| April 18, 2024| June 14, 2024| June 28, 2024| 0.34 | (3)  \nFirst Quarter| January 30, 2024| March 15, 2024| March 29, 2024| 0.36 | (4)  \n$| 1.04   \nDecember 31, 2023  \nFourth Quarter| December 8, 2023| December 22, 2023| December 29, 2023| $| 0.10 | (5)  \nFourth Quarter| October 24, 2023| December 15, 2023| December 29, 2023| 0.36 | (6)  \nThird Quarter| July 27, 2023| September 15, 2023| September 29, 2023| 0.36 | (7)  \nSecond Quarter| April 25, 2023| June 16, 2023| June 30, 2023| 0.35 | (8)  \nFirst Quarter| January 24, 2023| March 17, 2023| March 31, 2023| 0.32   \n$| 1.49   \nDecember 31, 2022  \nFourth Quarter| November 2, 2022| December 16, 2022| December 30, 2022| $| 0.32   \nThird Quarter| August 3, 2022| September 16, 2022| September 30, 2022| 0.30   \nSecond Quarter| May 3, 2022| June 16, 2022| June 30, 2022| 0.30   \nFirst Quarter| February 23, 2022| March 17, 2022| March 31, 2022| 0.30   \n$| 1.22   \n  \n(1)Tax characteristics of all distributions paid are reported to stockholders on Form 1099 after the end of the calendar year.

Therefore, New Mountain Capital is entitled to any profits earned by the Investment Adviser, which includes any fees payable to the Investment Adviser under the terms of the Investment Management Agreement, less expenses incurred by the Investment Adviser in performing its services under the Investment Management Agreement.\n\n•We have entered into a fee waiver agreement (the \"Fee Waiver Agreement\") with the Investment Adviser, pursuant to which the Investment Adviser agreed to voluntarily reduce the base management fees payable to the Investment Adviser by us under the Investment Management Agreement beginning with the quarter ended March 31, 2021 through the quarter ending December 31, 2024. See Item 1— Financial Statements—Note 5.Agreements in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for details.\n\n•We have entered into the Administration Agreement with the Administrator, a wholly-owned subsidiary of New Mountain Capital. The Administrator arranges our office space and provides office equipment and administrative services necessary to conduct our respective day-to-day operations pursuant to the Administration Agreement. We reimburse the Administrator for the allocable portion of overhead and other expenses incurred by it in performing its obligations to us under the Administration Agreement, which includes the fees and expenses associated with performing administrative, finance, and compliance functions, and the compensation of our chief financial officer and chief compliance officer and their respective staffs. Pursuant to the Administration Agreement and further restricted by us, the Administrator may, in its own discretion, submit to us for reimbursement some or all of the expenses that the Administrator has incurred on our behalf during any quarterly period. As a result, the amount of expenses for which we will have to reimburse the Administrator may fluctuate in future quarterly periods and there can be no assurance given as to when, or if, the Administrator may determine to limit the expenses that the Administrator submits to us for reimbursement in the future. However, it is expected that the Administrator will continue to support part of our expense burden in the near future and may decide to not calculate and charge through certain overhead related amounts as well as continue to cover some of the indirect costs. The Administrator cannot recoup any expenses that the Administrator has previously waived. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 approximately $0.6 million and $1.8 million, respectively, of indirect administrative expenses were included in administrative expenses, of which no expenses were waived by the Administrator. As of September 30, 2024, approximately $0.6 million of indirect administrative expenses were included in payable to affiliates. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the reimbursement to the Administrator represented approximately 0.02% and 0.05%, respectively, of our gross assets.\n\n•We, the Investment Adviser and the Administrator have entered into a royalty-free Trademark License Agreement, as amended, with New Mountain Capital, pursuant to which New Mountain Capital has agreed to grant us, the Investment Adviser and the Administrator a non-exclusive, royalty-free license to use the name \"New Mountain\" and \"New Mountain Finance\", as well as the NMF logo.\n\nIn addition, we have adopted a formal code of ethics that governs the conduct of our officers and directors, which is available on our website at www.newmountainfinance.com. These officers and directors also remain subject to the duties imposed by the 1940 Act and the Delaware General Corporation Law.\n\nThe Investment Adviser and its affiliates may also manage other funds in the future that may have investment mandates that are similar, in whole or in part, to our investment mandates. The Investment Adviser and its affiliates may determine that an investment is appropriate for us and for one or more of those other funds. In such event, depending on the availability of such investment and other appropriate factors, the Investment Adviser or its affiliates may determine that we should invest side-by-side with one or more other funds. Any such investments will be made only to the extent permitted by applicable law and interpretive positions of the SEC and its staff, and consistent with the Investment Adviser's allocation procedures. On October 8, 2019, the SEC issued an exemptive order (the “Exemptive Order”), which superseded a prior order issued on December 18, 2017, which permits us to co-invest in portfolio companies with certain funds or entities managed by the Investment Adviser or its affiliates in certain negotiated transactions where co-investing would otherwise be prohibited under the 1940 Act, subject to the conditions of the Exemptive Order. Pursuant to the Exemptive Order, we are permitted to co-invest with our affiliates if a “required majority” (as defined in Section 57(o) of the 1940 Act) of our independent directors make certain conclusions in connection with a co-investment transaction, including, but not limited to, that (1) the terms of the potential co-investment transaction, including the consideration to be paid, are reasonable and fair to us and our stockholders and do not involve overreaching in respect of us or our stockholders on the part of any person concerned, and (2) the potential co-investment transaction is consistent with the interests of our stockholders and is consistent with our then-current investment objective and strategies. The Exemptive Order was amended on August 30, 2022 to permit us to complete follow-on \n\n134\n\n[Table of Contents](#i72f805c51bb9408d93e6f5060262cdd1_10)\n\ninvestments in our existing portfolio companies with certain affiliates that are private funds if such private funds do not hold an investment in such existing portfolio company, subject to certain conditions.\n\nOn March 30, 2020, an affiliate of the Investment Adviser purchased directly from NMNLC 105,030 shares of NMNLC’s common stock at a price of $107.73 per share, which represented the net asset value per share of NMNLC at the date of purchase, for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $11.3 million. Immediately thereafter, NMNLC redeemed 105,030 shares of its common stock held by NMFC in exchange for a promissory note with a principal amount of $11.3 million and a 7.0% interest rate, which was repaid by NMNLC to NMFC on March 31, 2020. Effective July 1, 2024, NMNLC purchased 63,575 shares of NMNLC's common stock from an affiliate of the Investment Adviser at remaining original cost, a price of $73.39 per share, for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $4.7 million. Immediately thereafter, NMNLC sold the 63,575 shares of its common stock to NMFC at remaining original cost, a price of $73.39 per share, for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $4.7 million.\n\nOn March 30, 2020, we entered into the Uncommitted Revolving Loan Agreement with NMF Investments III, L.L.C., an affiliate of the Investment Adviser, with a $30.0 million maximum amount of revolver borrowings available and a maturity date of December 31, 2022. On May 4, 2020, we entered into an Amended and Restated Uncommitted Revolving Loan Agreement with NMF Investments III, L.L.C., which increased the maximum amounts of revolving borrowings available thereunder from $30.0 million to $50.0 million. On December 17, 2021, we entered into Amendment No. 1 to the Amended and Restated Uncommitted Revolving Loan Agreement with NMF Investments III, L.L.C., which lowered the interest rate and extended the maturity date from December 31, 2022 to December 31, 2024. On October 31, 2023, we entered into the Second Amended and Restated Uncommitted Revolving Loan Agreement with NMF Investments III, L.L.C., which increased the maximum amount of revolving borrowings thereunder from $50.0 million to $100.0 million, extended the maturity date from December 31, 2024 to December 31, 2027 and changed the interest rate to the Applicable Federal Rate. Refer to Item 1 — Financial Statements — Note 7. Borrowings for discussion of the Unsecured Management Company Revolver.\n\n135\n\n[Table of Contents](#i72f805c51bb9408d93e6f5060262cdd1_10)\n\nItem 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\n\nWe are subject to certain financial market risks, such as interest rate fluctuations. Because we fund a portion of our investments with borrowings, our net investment income is affected by the difference between the rate at which we invest and the rate at which we borrow. As a result, there can be no assurance that a significant change in market interest rates will not have a material adverse effect on our net investment income. From March 2022 to July 2023, the Federal Reserve was periodically raising interest rates to combat inflation and maintained the same rate benchmark from July 2023 to September 2024. While the Federal Reserve cut its benchmark rate in the third quarter of 2024 for the first time since March 2020 and indicated that there may be additional rate cuts in 2024, future reductions to benchmark rates are not certain. In a high interest rate environment, our net investment income would increase due to an increase in interest income generated by our investment portfolio. However, our cost of funds would also increase, which could also impact net investment income. It is possible that the Federal Reserve's tightening cycle could result in a recession in the United States, which would likely decrease interest rates. Alternatively, in a prolonged low interest rate environment, including a reduction of base rates, such as SONIA or SOFR, to zero, the difference between the total interest income earned on interest earning assets and the total interest expense incurred on interest bearing liabilities may be compressed, reducing our net interest income and potentially adversely affecting our operating results. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, certain of the loans held in our portfolio had floating SOFR, SONIA, EURIBOR or Prime interest rates. As of September 30, 2024, approximately 84.94% of our investments at fair value (excluding investments on non-accrual, unfunded debt investments and non-interest bearing equity investments) represent floating-rate investments with a SOFR, SONIA or EURIBOR floor (includes investments bearing prime interest rate contracts) and approximately 15.06% of investments at fair value represent fixed-rate investments. Additionally, our senior secured revolving credit facilities are also subject to floating interest rates and are currently paid based on floating SOFR, SONIA or EURIBOR rates.\n\nThe following table estimates the potential changes in interest income, net of interest expense, should interest rates decrease by 200, 150, 100 or 50 basis points, or increase by 50, 100, 150 or 200 basis points. Interest income is calculated as revenue from interest generated from our portfolio of investments held on September 30, 2024. Interest expense is calculated based on the terms of our outstanding revolving credit facilities, convertible notes and unsecured notes. For our credit facilities, we use the outstanding balance as of September 30, 2024. This analysis does not take into account the impact of the incentive fee or other expenses. These hypothetical calculations are based on a model of the investments in our portfolio, held as of September 30, 2024, and are only adjusted for assumed changes in the underlying base interest rates. \n\nActual results could differ significantly from those estimated in the table.\n\nChange in Interest Rates| EstimatedPercentageChange in InterestIncome Net ofInterest Expense (unaudited)  \n---|---  \n-200 Basis Points| (14.16)| %  \n-150 Basis Points| (10.62)| %  \n-100 Basis Points| (7.08)| %  \n-50 Basis Points| (3.54)| %  \n+50 Basis Points| 3.54 | %  \n+100 Basis Points| 7.08 | %  \n+150 Basis Points| 10.62 | %  \n+200 Basis Points| 14.16 | %  \n  \n136\n\n[Table of Contents](#i72f805c51bb9408d93e6f5060262cdd1_10)\n\nItem 4. Controls and Procedures\n\n(a)Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\n\nAs of September 30, 2024 (the end of the period covered by this report), we, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) of the Exchange Act). Based on that evaluation, our management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective and provided reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in our periodic SEC filings is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. However, in evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognized that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and management necessarily was required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of such possible controls and procedures.\n\n(b)Changes in Internal Controls Over Financial Reporting\n\nManagement has not identified any change in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.\n\n137\n\n[Table of Contents](#i72f805c51bb9408d93e6f5060262cdd1_10)\n\nPART II. OTHER INFORMATION\n\nThe terms “we”, “us”, “our” and the “Company” refers to New Mountain Finance Corporation and its consolidated subsidiaries.\n\nItem 1. Legal Proceedings\n\nWe, our consolidated subsidiaries, the Investment Adviser and the Administrator are not currently subject to any material pending legal proceedings as of September 30, 2024. From time to time, we or our consolidated subsidiaries may be a party to certain legal proceedings incidental to the normal course of our business including the enforcement of our rights under contracts with our portfolio companies. While the outcome of these legal proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty, we do not expect that these proceedings will have a material effect upon our business, financial condition or results of operations.\n\nItem 1A. Risk Factors\n\nIn addition to the other information set forth in this report, you should carefully consider the factors discussed in Item 1A. Risk Factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, which could materially affect our business, financial condition and/or operating results, including the Risk Factor titled \"Small Business Credit Availability Act allows us to incur additional leverage, which could increase the risk of investing in our securities\". The risks described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K are not the only risks we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and/or operating results. There have been no material changes during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 to the risk factors discussed in Item 1A. Risk Factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, other than those set forth below:\n\nWe may be subject to additional risks if we invest in foreign securities.\n\nThe 1940 Act generally requires that 70.0% of our investments be in issuers each of whom is, among other things, organized under the laws of, and has its principal place of business in the United States. Our investment strategy does not presently contemplate significant investments in securities of non-U.S. companies. However, we may desire to make such investments in the future, to the extent that such transactions and investments are permitted under the 1940 Act and any other applicable laws. We expect that these investments would focus on the same types of investments that we make in U.S. middle market companies and accordingly would be complementary to our overall strategy and enhance the diversity of our holdings. Investing in foreign companies could expose us to additional risks not typically associated with investing in U.S. companies. These risks include changes in exchange control regulations, political and social instability, expropriation, imposition of foreign taxes, less liquid markets and less available information than is generally the case in the U.S., higher transaction costs, less government supervision of exchanges, brokers and issuers, less developed bankruptcy laws, difficulty in enforcing contractual obligations, lack of uniform accounting and auditing standards and greater price volatility. Investments denominated in foreign currencies would be subject to the risk that the value of a particular currency will change in relation to one or more other currencies. Among the factors that may affect currency values are trade balances, the level of short-term interest rates, differences in relative values of similar assets in different currencies, long-term opportunities for investment and capital appreciation and political developments. We may employ hedging techniques to minimize these risks, but we can offer no assurance that we will, in fact, hedge currency risk, or that if we do, such strategies will be effective.\n\nHedging using derivatives may impact investment performance.\n\nWe may use over-the-counter (OTC) and cleared derivatives to hedge against fluctuations of the relative values of our portfolio positions from changes in market interest rates or currency exchange rates. Hedging against a decline in the values of our portfolio positions would not eliminate the possibility of fluctuations in the values of such positions or prevent losses if the values of the positions declined. However, such hedging could establish other positions designed to gain from those same developments, thereby offsetting the decline in the value of such portfolio positions.\n\nHedging transactions may limit the opportunity for gain if the values of the underlying portfolio positions increased. Moreover, it might not be possible to hedge against an exchange rate or interest rate fluctuation that was so generally anticipated that we would not be able to enter into a hedging transaction at an acceptable price. If we choose to engage in hedging transactions, there can be no assurances that we will achieve the intended benefits of such transactions and, depending on the degree of exposure such transactions could create, such transactions may expose us to risk of loss.\n\nWhile we may enter into derivatives transactions to seek to reduce currency exchange rate and interest rate risks, unanticipated changes in currency exchange rates or interest rates could result in poorer overall investment performance than if we had not engaged in any such hedging transactions. In addition, the degree of correlation between price movements of the instruments used in a hedging strategy and price movements in the portfolio positions being hedged could vary. Moreover, for a variety of reasons, we might not seek to establish a perfect correlation between the hedging instruments and the portfolio holdings being hedged. Any imperfect correlation could prevent us from achieving the intended hedge and expose us to risk of \n\n138\n\n[Table of Contents](#i72f805c51bb9408d93e6f5060262cdd1_10)\n\nloss. In addition, it might not be possible to hedge fully or perfectly against currency fluctuations affecting the value of securities denominated in non-U.S. currencies because the value of those securities would likely fluctuate as a result of factors not related to currency fluctuations.\n\nOur ability to enter into transactions involving derivatives and unfunded commitment transactions may be limited. \n\nIn 2020, the SEC adopted Rule 18f-4 under the 1940 Act, which relates to the use of derivatives and other transactions that create future payment or delivery obligations by BDCs (and other funds that are registered investment companies). Under Rule 18f-4, for which compliance was required beginning in August 2022, BDCs that use derivatives are subject to a value-at-risk leverage limit, certain derivatives risk management program and testing requirements and requirements related to board reporting. These new requirements apply unless the BDC qualifies as a “limited derivatives user,” as defined in Rule 18f-4. A BDC that enters into reverse repurchase agreements or similar financing transactions could either (i) comply with the asset coverage requirements of Section 18, as modified by Section 61 of the 1940 Act, when engaging in reverse repurchase agreements or (ii) choose to treat such agreements as derivatives transactions under Rule 18f-4. In addition, under Rule 18f-4, a BDC may enter into an unfunded commitment agreement that is not a derivatives transaction, such as an agreement to provide financing to a portfolio company, if the BDC has a reasonable belief, at the time it enters into such an agreement, that it will have sufficient cash and cash equivalents to meet its obligations with respect to all of its unfunded commitment agreements, in each case as it becomes due. If the BDC cannot meet this requirement, it is required to treat the unfunded commitment as a derivatives transaction subject to the aforementioned requirements of Rule 18f-4. \n\nWe qualify as a “limited derivatives user” for purposes of Rule 18f-4 and as a result the requirements applicable to us under Rule 18f-4 may limit our ability to use derivatives and enter into certain other financial contracts. However, if we fail to qualify as a limited derivatives user and become subject to the additional requirements under Rule 18f-4, compliance with such requirements may increase cost of doing business, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\n\nValuing OTC derivatives may be less certain than actively traded financial instruments. \n\nIn general, valuing OTC derivatives is less certain than valuing actively traded financial instruments such as exchange traded futures contracts and securities or cleared swaps because, for OTC derivatives, the price and terms on which such OTC derivatives are entered into or can be terminated are individually negotiated, and those prices and terms may not reflect the best price or terms available from other sources. In addition, while market makers and dealers generally quote indicative prices or terms for entering into or terminating OTC contracts, they typically are not contractually obligated to do so, particularly if they are not a party to the transaction. As a result, it may be difficult to obtain an independent value for an outstanding OTC derivatives transaction. \n\nOur rights under an OTC derivative may be restricted by regulations. \n\nRegulations adopted by global prudential regulators that are now in effect require certain prudentially regulated entities and certain of their affiliates and subsidiaries (including swap dealers) to include in their derivatives contracts and certain other financial contracts terms that delay or restrict the rights of counterparties to terminate such contracts, foreclose upon collateral, exercise other default rights or restrict transfers of credit support in the event that the prudentially regulated entity and/or its affiliates are subject to certain types of resolution or insolvency proceedings. Similar regulations and laws have been adopted in non-U.S. jurisdictions that may apply to any of our counterparties that located in those jurisdictions. It is possible that these new requirements, as well as potential additional resulted government regulation, could adversely affect our ability to terminate existing derivatives contracts, exercise default rights, or satisfy obligations owed to us with collateral received under such contracts. \n\nThe use of OTC derivatives may expose us to early termination risk, which could result in significant losses. \n\nOTC derivatives do not have uniform terms. An OTC derivatives counterparty may have the right to close out our position due to the occurrence of certain events (for example, if a counterparty is unable to hedge its obligations to us, or if we defaults on certain terms of the OTC swaps agreement, or if there is a material decline in our NAV on a particular day) and request immediate payment of amounts owed by us under the agreement. If the level of our NAV has a dramatic intraday move, the terms of our OTC derivatives document may permit the counterparty to early close out a transaction with us at a price calculated by the counterparty that, in good faith, represents such counterparty’s loss, which may not represent fair market value. An OTC derivatives counterparty may also have the right to close out our position for no reason, in some cases with same day notice.\n\n139\n\n[Table of Contents](#i72f805c51bb9408d93e6f5060262cdd1_10)\n\nItem 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds\n\nWe did not engage in unregistered sales of equity securities during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024.\n\nIssuer Purchases of Equity Securities\n\nDividend Reinvestment Plan\n\nDuring the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as part of our dividend reinvestment plan for our common stockholders, our dividend reinvestment plan administrator purchased 422,990 shares of our common stock for approximately $5.3 million in the open market in order to satisfy the reinvestment portion of our distribution.

Under the Repurchase Program, we were permitted, but were not obligated, to repurchase our outstanding common stock in the open market from time to time, provided that we complied with our code of ethics and the guidelines specified in Rule 10b-18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the \"Exchange Act\") including certain price, market volume and timing constraints. In addition, any repurchases were conducted in accordance with the 1940 Act. On October 23, 2024, our board of directors extended our Repurchase Program and we expect the Repurchase Program to be in place until the earlier of December 31, 2025 or until $50.0 million of outstanding shares of common stock have been repurchased. To date, approximately $2.9 million of common stock has been repurchased by us under the Repurchase Program. We did not repurchase any shares of our common stock under the Repurchase Program during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024.\n\nItem 3.
