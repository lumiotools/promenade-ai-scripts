(Nasdaq: MRNS), a pharmaceutical company dedicated to the development of innovative therapeutics to treat seizure disorders, today reported business highlights and financial results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2024. \n\n“We are pleased to see continued commercial growth of ZTALMY with more than 200 patients active on therapy and a steady increase in demand,” said Scott Braunstein, M.D., Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Marinus. “In 2024, our Phase 3 data in status epilepticus and tuberous sclerosis complex showed meaningful clinical activity in certain refractory patients, however, the trials did not meet the thresholds for statistical significance. Given this outcome, we have made the difficult decision to explore strategic alternatives with the goal of maximizing stockholder value while supporting the growth of ZTALMY for patients with CDKL5 deficiency disorder (CDD).” \n\nDr. Braunstein continued, “I extend my deepest gratitude to our dedicated employees for their significant contributions to our work, and to the patients and clinicians who participated in our trials. We are proud to have delivered the first-and-only FDA-approved treatment for patients with seizures associated with CDD and hope that our research will serve as a foundation for future innovations in areas of high unmet need.” \n\n** ZTALMY ** ®  **(ganaxolone) Oral Suspension CV **\n\n  * Generated net product revenue of $8.5 million for the third quarter of 2024 representing 56% growth versus the third quarter of 2023. \n  * Narrowing full year 2024 net product revenue guidance to $33 to $34 million from a range of $33 to $35 million. \n  * Announced issuance of new U.S. patent for ZTALMY oral titration regimens covering the treatment of a range of epilepsies, expiring September 2042. \n\n\n\n** Clinical Updates **\n\n  * The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted Marinus a Type C meeting, scheduled for the fourth quarter of 2024, to discuss a potential path forward for intravenous (IV) ganaxolone in refractory status epilepticus (RSE). \n  * [Presented data](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.businesswire.com%2Fnews%2Fhome%2F20241017642755%2Fen%2FMarinus-Pharmaceuticals-Presents-Clinical-Data-From-Pivotal-Phase-3-RAISE-Trial-in-Refractory-Status-Epilepticus-at-the-Neurocritical-Care-Society-2024-Annual-Meeting&esheet=54150766&newsitemid=20241112598483&lan=en-US&anchor=Presented+data&index=2&md5=58311cef43443e2c724fcf126da0aa78) from the Phase 3 RAISE trial evaluating IV ganaxolone for the treatment of RSE at the Neurocritical Care Society Annual Meeting in October 2024. \n  * Announced [topline results](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.businesswire.com%2Fnews%2Fhome%2F20241024735870%2Fen%2FMarinus-Pharmaceuticals-Announces-Topline-Results-From-Phase-3-TrustTSC-Trial-of-Oral-Ganaxolone-in-Tuberous-Sclerosis-Complex-and-Commences-Process-to-Explore-Strategic-Alternatives&esheet=54150766&newsitemid=20241112598483&lan=en-US&anchor=topline+results&index=3&md5=755aa0979aac09c7a82f5c915e582509) from the Phase 3 TrustTSC trial of oral ganaxolone in tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) whereby the trial did not achieve statistical significance in the primary endpoint. \n  * Marinus will continue to support the commercial growth of ZTALMY and activities required by the FDA and European Medicines Agency specific to post-approval commitments related to the CDD indication. \n\n\n\n_Ganaxolone development in the RAISE trial has been supported in part by the Department of Health and Human Services; Administration for Strategic Preparedness and Response; Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA) under contract number 75A50120C00159._\n\n** General Business and Financial Update **\n\n  * Marinus has commenced a process to explore strategic alternatives with the goal of maximizing value for its stockholders and has engaged Barclays as an advisor to assist in reviewing its strategic alternatives. \n  * Full year 2024 guidance has been narrowed with projected ZTALMY net product revenue between $33 and $34 million and combined selling, general and administrative (SG&A) and research and development (R&D) expenses in the range of approximately $135 to $138 million, including stock-based compensation expense of approximately $20 million. \n  * Cost reduction activities were initiated in the fourth quarter of 2024, including suspending further ganaxolone clinical development and a workforce reduction of approximately 45%. \n  * Through the execution of the cost reduction plans, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of $42.2 million as of September 30, 2024, to fund the Company’s operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements into the second quarter of 2025. \n\n\n\n** Financial Results **\n\n  * Recognized $8.5 million and $23.9 million in net product revenue for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, as compared to $5.4 million and $13.0 million for the same periods in the prior year, respectively. \n  * Recognized $0.1 million and $0.3 million in Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA) federal contract revenue for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, as compared to $1.9 million and $10.8 million for the same periods in the prior year, respectively. The decrease was primarily driven by activity associated with the start-up of the API onshoring initiative in the first quarter of 2023 and completion of the BARDA base period funding in the fourth quarter of 2023. \n  * R&D expenses were $16.3 million and $61.3 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, as compared to $23.7 million and $73.0 million for the same periods in the prior year, respectively. The reduction was due primarily to reduced costs in 2024 associated with the RAISE trial completion and costs associated with start-up of the API onshoring effort in the first quarter of 2023. \n  * SG&A expenses were $12.6 million and $47.9 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, as compared to $14.9 million and $45.8 million for the same periods in the prior year, respectively. The primary drivers of the decrease for the three month period were decreased personnel and consulting expenses, while the drivers of the increase for the nine month period were increased stock-based compensation expense and commercial expense. \n  * The Company had net losses of $24.2 million and $98.7 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively; cash used in operating activities decreased to $87.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to $91.0 million for the same period a year ago. \n  * At September 30, 2024, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of $42.2 million, compared to cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of $150.3 million at December 31, 2023. \n\n\n\nReaders are referred to, and encouraged to read in its entirety, the Company’s Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended September 30, 2024, to be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, which includes further detail on the Company’s business plans, operations, financial condition, and results of operations. \n\n**Selected Financial Data (in thousands, except share and per share amounts)**\n\n**September 30,** **2024** **(unaudited)** |  **December 31, 2023**  \n---|---  \nASSETS   \nCash and cash equivalents  |  $  |  42,184  |  $  |  120,572   \nShort-term investments  |  -  |  29,716   \nOther assets  |  21,440  |  20,620   \nTotal assets  |  $  |  63,624  |  $  |  170,908   \nLIABILITIES AND STOCKHOLDERS’ (DEFICIT) EQUITY   \nCurrent liabilities  |  $  |  34,504  |  $  |  40,624   \nLong term debt, net  |  41,713  |  61,423   \nRevenue interest financing payable, net  |  36,039  |  33,766   \nOther long-term liabilities  |  18,108  |  18,330   \nTotal liabilities  |  130,364  |  154,143   \nTotal stockholders’ (deficit) equity  |  (66,740)  |  16,765   \nTotal liabilities and stockholders’ (deficit) equity  |  $  |  63,624  |  $  |  170,908   \n**Three Months Ended September 30,** |  **Six Months Ended September 30,**  \n---|---  \n**2024 (Unaudited)** |  **2023 (Unaudited)** |  **2024 (Unaudited)** |  **2023 (Unaudited)**  \nRevenue:   \nProduct revenue, net  |  $  |  8,468  |  $  |  5,429  |  $  |  23,928  |  $  |  13,010   \nFederal contract revenue  |  56  |  1,891  |  295  |  10,753   \nCollaboration revenue  |  17  |  18  |  53  |  36   \nTotal revenue  |  8,541  |  7,338  |  24,276  |  23,799   \nExpenses:   \nResearch and development  |  16,334  |  23,661  |  61,349  |  73,006   \nSelling, general and administrative  |  12,573  |  14,868  |  47,909  |  45,794   \nRestructuring Costs  |  -  |  -  |  1,950  |  -   \nCost of product revenue  |  714  |  455  |  2,205  |  1,047   \nTotal expenses:  |  29,621  |  38,984  |  113,413  |  119,847   \nLoss from operations  |  (21,080  |  )  |  (31,646  |  )  |  (89,137  |  )  |  (96,048  |  )   \nInterest income  |  598  |  1,895  |  3,169  |  6,366   \nInterest expense  |  (3,843  |  )  |  (4,242  |  )  |  (12,806  |  )  |  (12,597  |  )   \nOther income, net  |  100  |  1,021  |  52  |  1,105   \nLoss before income taxes  |  (24,225  |  )  |  (32,972  |  )  |  (98,722  |  )  |  (101,174  |  )   \nBenefit for income taxes  |  -  |  -  |  -  |  1,538   \nNet loss applicable to common shareholders  |  $  |  (24,225  |  )  |  $  |  (32,972  |  )  |  $  |  (98,722  |  )  |  $  |  (99,636  |  )   \nPer share information:   \nNet loss per share of common stock—basic and diluted  |  $  |  (0.42  |  )  |  $  |  (0.61  |  )  |  $  |  (1.73  |  )  |  $  |  (1.89  |  )   \nBasic and diluted weighted average shares outstanding  |  57,229,229  |  53,920,109  |  57,049,038  |  52,755,114   \nOther comprehensive loss   \nUnrealized gain (loss) on available-for-sale securities  |  -  |  43  |  20  |  (71  |  )   \nTotal comprehensive loss  |  $  |  (24,225  |  )  |  $  |  (32,929  |  )  |  $  |  (98,702  |  )  |  $  |  (99,707  |  )   \n  \n**About Marinus Pharmaceuticals**\n\nMarinus is a commercial-stage pharmaceutical company dedicated to the development of innovative therapeutics for seizure disorders.

(Nasdaq: MRNS), a pharmaceutical company dedicated to the development of innovative therapeutics to treat seizure disorders, today announced that the Phase 3 TrustTSC trial evaluating oral ganaxolone for the treatment of seizures associated with tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) in children and adults did not meet the primary endpoint of percent change in 28-day TSC-associated seizure frequency. While reductions in seizure frequency favored the ganaxolone arm, the primary endpoint did not achieve statistical significance. \n\n“As the first controlled trial in TSC that allowed enrollment of patients taking a range of concomitant antiseizure medications, which included mTOR inhibitors and cannabidiol, these data represent a significant advancement in our understanding of the use of ganaxolone with other standard of care treatments,” said Scott Braunstein, M.D., Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Marinus. “We are disappointed that the results of the TrustTSC trial are not likely to be sufficient for an sNDA filing. We are deeply grateful for the contributions of the clinical trial investigators, patients, and caregivers whose support and participation made the study possible.” \n\nTrustTSC ([NCT05323734](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fclinicaltrials.gov%2Fstudy%2FNCT05323734%3Fterm%3DTrustTSC%26rank%3D2&esheet=54141531&newsitemid=20241024735870&lan=en-US&anchor=NCT05323734&index=2&md5=9926c0dc8fc9ea9627fe43b4fbcf5389)) was a global Phase 3 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial of adjunctive oral ganaxolone treatment in children and adults with TSC-related epilepsy (n=129). \n\nTopline data demonstrated that: \n\n  * The trial did not achieve statistical significance on its primary endpoint of percent reduction in 28-day frequency of TSC-associated seizures: median reduction was 19.7% for ganaxolone compared with 10.2% for placebo (p=0.09). \n  * Ganaxolone was generally well-tolerated with a safety profile consistent with previous clinical trials. The most frequent adverse event was somnolence: 28.1% for ganaxolone compared with 16.9% for placebo. \n\n\n\nMarinus will continue to support and invest in the commercial growth of ZTALMY ® (ganaxolone) oral suspension CV, which is FDA-approved for the treatment of seizures associated with CDKL5 deficiency disorder in patients two years of age and older, where more than 200 patients are receiving treatment. \n\nAs a result of the TrustTSC outcome, Marinus is discontinuing further ganaxolone clinical development and is taking additional steps to reduce costs, including a reduction in its workforce. The Company has also commenced a process to explore strategic alternatives with the goal of maximizing value for its stockholders. Marinus has engaged Barclays as an advisor to assist in reviewing its strategic alternatives. There can be no assurance that the exploration of strategic alternatives will result in any agreements or transactions, or as to the timing of any such agreements or transactions. Marinus does not intend to discuss or disclose further developments regarding the exploration of strategic alternatives unless and until its board of directors has approved a definitive action or otherwise determined that further disclosure is appropriate or required by law. \n\n**About the TrustTSC Trial** TrustTSC ([NCT05323734](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fclinicaltrials.gov%2Fstudy%2FNCT05323734%3Fterm%3DTrustTSC%26rank%3D2&esheet=54141531&newsitemid=20241024735870&lan=en-US&anchor=NCT05323734&index=3&md5=1462e8b4cfd145f5b9eade6641f7f145)) was a global Phase 3 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial of adjunctive oral ganaxolone treatment in children and adults with TSC-related epilepsy. The trial consisted of a four-week baseline period, followed by a 16-week double-blind treatment phase, which included a 28-day titration period followed by a 12-week maintenance period. Participants then had the opportunity to enter the ongoing long-term open-label extension. The primary endpoint was percent change in 28-day TSC-associated seizure frequency. TrustTSC enrolled participants at sites in the U.S., Western Europe, Canada, Israel, Australia and China. To be eligible, participants were required to have inadequate seizure control and have been treated with at least two prior antiseizure medications. \n\n**About Tuberous Sclerosis Complex** Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is a rare, multisystem genetic disorder caused by inherited mutations in the _TSC1_ gene or _TSC2_ gene. It is often characterized by non-cancerous tumors, skin abnormalities, and severe neurological manifestations, including refractory seizures and neurodevelopmental delays. The condition is a leading cause of genetic epilepsy, often occurring in the first year of life as either focal seizures or infantile spasms. While the disease phenotype can be extremely variable, neurologic manifestations such as epilepsy can be seen in up to 90% of TSC patients. \n\n**About ZTALMY ® (ganaxolone) oral suspension ** ZTALMY (ganaxolone) is a neuroactive steroid GABA A  receptor modulator that acts on a well-characterized target in the brain known to have anti-seizure effects. It is a prescription medicine that has been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and the European Commission for appropriate patients with CDKL5 deficiency disorder. \n\n[U.S. Prescribing Information](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fmarinuspharma.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fprescribing-information.pdf&esheet=54141531&newsitemid=20241024735870&lan=en-US&anchor=U.S.+Prescribing+Information&index=4&md5=4d839b98252e1d72d3390d4709ba83b7) for ZTALMY ® (ganaxolone) oral suspension CV. \n\n[European Union Summary of Product Characteristics](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ema.europa.eu%2Fen%2Fdocuments%2Fproduct-information%2Fztalmy-epar-product-information_en.pdf&esheet=54141531&newsitemid=20241024735870&lan=en-US&anchor=European+Union+Summary+of+Product+Characteristics&index=5&md5=ba6e111a93739a8f123eb061c1e8bfe3) for ZTALMY. \n\n**About Marinus Pharmaceuticals** Marinus is a commercial-stage pharmaceutical company dedicated to the development of innovative therapeutics for seizure disorders.

(Nasdaq: MRNS), a pharmaceutical company dedicated to the development of innovative therapeutics to treat seizure disorders, today presented new data from the pivotal Phase 3 RAISE trial evaluating intravenous (IV) ganaxolone for the treatment of refractory status epilepticus (RSE) at the Neurocritical Care Society (NCS) Annual Meeting. Topline data demonstrating that the trial met one of two co-primary endpoints were reported in June 2024. \n\nIn the RAISE trial ([NCT04391569](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fclinicaltrials.gov%2Fstudy%2FNCT04391569&esheet=54137277&newsitemid=20241017642755&lan=en-US&anchor=NCT04391569&index=2&md5=6ee9917d34fca8d5244fce7a34761f10)), patients with RSE that failed at least two antiseizure medications were randomized to IV ganaxolone or placebo in addition to standard of care treatment. The co-primary endpoints were the proportion of patients with status epilepticus (SE) cessation within 30 minutes and the proportion of patients not progressing to IV anesthesia within 36 hours of study drug initiation. \n\nThe RAISE trial prespecified secondary endpoints presented at NCS included: \n\n  * The median time to SE cessation: 4.2 minutes in patients treated with IV ganaxolone compared to 307.2 minutes for placebo (nominal p<0.0001). \n  * The proportion of patients with no escalation of treatment within 24 hours: 45% for IV ganaxolone compared to 19% for placebo (nominal p=0.0059). \n\n\n\nAlso presented were the previously reported RAISE topline results: \n\n  * A statistically significant proportion of patients achieved SE cessation within 30 minutes of initiating IV ganaxolone compared to placebo: 80% vs. 13%, respectively (p<0.0001). \n  * The trial failed to achieve statistical significance in the proportion of patients not progressing to IV anesthesia for 36 hours following initiation of IV ganaxolone compared to placebo: 63% vs. 51%, respectively (p=0.162). \n  * The median reduction in EEG seizure burden through 36 hours was 93% in patients treated with IV ganaxolone, compared to 36% for placebo (nominal p=0.003). \n  * The incidence of serious adverse events was similar between the treatment and placebo arms (n=19 for IV ganaxolone, n=18 for placebo), with hypotension being more commonly seen in the IV ganaxolone arm. \n\n\n\n“The RAISE data presented today support that IV ganaxolone has the potential to play an important role in the treatment of RSE, demonstrating rapid cessation of SE as well as evidence of seizure control from EEG monitoring,” said Brandon Foreman, M.D., M.S., FACNS, FNCS, Associate Professor of Neurology & Rehabilitation Medicine and Neurosurgery at the University of Cincinnati and Associate Director for Neurocritical Care Research, who presented the RAISE data in an oral session today. \n\nDr. Foreman continued, “With 80% of patients achieving SE cessation within 30 minutes of IV ganaxolone administration and a median time to SE cessation of 4.2 minutes, there is clear indication of rapid antiseizure activity in highly refractory patients. Although the RAISE trial did not achieve statistical significance on the second coprimary endpoint, other secondary measures of durability, such as reductions in EEG seizure burden and proportion of patients with no treatment escalation within 24 hours, showed clinically meaningful benefits.” \n\n“The findings we shared today underscore the potential of IV ganaxolone in the management of RSE, while also highlighting the challenges inherent in advancing research in this highly variable, complex disorder,” said Joseph Hulihan, M.D., Chief Medical Officer of Marinus. “We have completed the first placebo-controlled trial in RSE, which has yielded important insights into the benefit ganaxolone could provide to these critically ill patients. We look forward to reviewing our data package with the FDA and discussing next steps for IV ganaxolone.” \n\n_Ganaxolone development in the RAISE trial has been being supported in part by the Department of Health and Human Services; Administration for Strategic Preparedness and Response; Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA) under contract number 75A50120C00159._\n\n**About Status Epilepticus**\n\nStatus epilepticus (SE) is a life-threatening condition resulting from either the failure of the mechanisms responsible for seizure termination or from the initiation of mechanisms which lead to abnormally prolonged seizures. SE is the one of the most common neurological emergencies in the U.S., affecting up to 150,000 patients each year, and is associated with substantial morbidity, mortality, and healthcare costs. Patients who do not respond to 1st- and 2nd-line treatments (benzodiazepines and intravenous antiseizure medications) are considered to have refractory SE (RSE). \n\n**About Intravenous (IV) Ganaxolone**\n\nGanaxolone is a neuroactive steroid that works by modulating both synaptic and extrasynaptic GABA A receptors via a unique binding site to potentiate two types of inhibitory signaling. IV ganaxolone has pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties well-suited for the treatment of status epilepticus. IV ganaxolone received orphan drug designation from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for the potential treatment of status epilepticus. \n\n**About Marinus Pharmaceuticals**\n\nMarinus is a commercial-stage pharmaceutical company dedicated to the development of innovative therapeutics for seizure disorders. The Company’s product, ZTALMY ® (ganaxolone) oral suspension CV, is an FDA-approved prescription medication introduced in the U.S. in 2022.

The U.S. patent No. 12,115,169 expires in September 2042. \n\n“The new patent granted to Marinus further strengthens the IP protection of ZTALMY and supports our development and commercialization plans for ganaxolone in TSC and other areas of high unmet need, such as LGS,” said Scott Braunstein, M.D., Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Marinus. “Our patent portfolio is the result of decades of research and scientific innovation, fortified by robust data on the pharmacology and effective clinical dosing of ganaxolone. We are pleased that the USPTO recognized that the claimed titration regimens are markedly different from prior titration regimens. We believe that this revised ganaxolone titration schedule has the potential to have a meaningful impact on tolerability, compliance, and lead to improved patient outcomes in a range of epilepsy disorders.” \n\n**About Marinus Pharmaceuticals**\n\nMarinus is a commercial-stage pharmaceutical company dedicated to the development of innovative therapeutics for seizure disorders.

(Nasdaq: MRNS), a pharmaceutical company dedicated to the development of innovative therapeutics to treat seizure disorders, today is hosting an Investor and Analyst Day and will present an in-depth review of the Company’s development program for ZTALMY ® (ganaxolone) oral suspension CV in tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) ahead of the Phase 3 TrustTSC trial topline data readout anticipated in the first half of the fourth quarter of 2024. The event begins at 9 a.m. ET and will be available via webcast [here](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fevent.webcasts.com%2Fstarthere.jsp%3Fei%3D1684028%26tp_key%3Dd394c0c18a&esheet=54124841&newsitemid=20240920105991&lan=en-US&anchor=here&index=2&md5=d26340592c0cafd92f163f32540b332d) . \n\n“Today, we are highlighting exciting clinical and commercial progress as we prepare to report topline data from our global Phase 3, TrustTSC trial,” said Scott Braunstein, M.D., Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Marinus. “Newly reported data from our Phase 2 TSC trial patients showed durable and increasing reductions in seizure frequency in the long-term extension follow-up period. These data, along with a low discontinuation rate in the TrustTSC trial and a high proportion of patients transitioning into the open-label extension, increase our confidence that ZTALMY has the potential to be a meaningful treatment option for TSC patients with refractory epilepsy.” \n\n\"Patients with TSC face significant challenges due to the complex nature of their condition, which is often characterized by severe neurological manifestations, including refractory seizures and neurodevelopmental delays. Despite advancements in treatment, there remains a substantial unmet need for therapies that can reduce the frequency of seizures in children and adults,” said Dr. Mary Kay Koenig, M.D., Director of the Center for Treatment of Pediatric Neurodegenerative Disease (CTPND), Director of Research for the Division of Child & Adolescent Neurology at the University of Texas McGovern Medical School and an Investigator in the TrustTSC trial. \n\nDr. Braunstein added, “Alongside our clinical momentum, we are poised and ready for a rapid and efficient U.S. launch in TSC, pending FDA approval, based on our established commercial infrastructure, insights gained from our successful launch in CDD, and deep understanding of the market. In addition, we are excited to share that we expect the patent office to grant new intellectual property for ganaxolone that covers the titration regimen used in the TrustTSC trial. With a U.S. market opportunity of approximately $2.5 billion in CDD and TSC, we believe our differentiated approach and ganaxolone’s unique mechanism of action, combined with expected favorable reimbursement dynamics, can enable broader patient access and address critical unmet needs in these challenging therapeutic areas.” \n\nHighlights from today’s presentations are summarized below. \n\n** ZTALMY ** ®\n\n  * On track to achieve full year 2024 ZTALMY net product revenue guidance of between $33 and $35 million \n  * Data from several proprietary market research studies show a consistent unmet need among tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) patients with refractory epilepsy and indicate likely broad payer coverage given the high disease burden and need for new therapies \n  * Real-world claims data indicates that approximately 26% of coded TSC patients have tried and failed three or more antiseizure medications, supporting the Company’s addressable patient population assumptions and representing an attractive commercial opportunity \n\n\n\n** Clinical Pipeline **\n\nTuberous Sclerosis Complex (TSC)\n\nPhase 3 TrustTSC Trial\n\n  * Topline data for the global Phase 3 TrustTSC trial of oral ganaxolone in TSC remains on track for the first half of the fourth quarter of 2024 \n    * Enrollment (n=129) completed in May 2024, with last patient visit in September \n    * The trial is designed with 90% power to detect a 25% difference from placebo in percent seizure reduction \n  * The fully enrolled trial maintained a low double-blind discontinuation rate of 6.2% with approximately 93% of patients continuing to the open-label extension \n  * Targeting submission of a supplemental New Drug Application (NDA) to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in April 2025 with a request for priority review \n\n\n\nPhase 2 TSC Trial: Long-term Extension Follow-up\n\n  * New long-term extension follow-up data showed durable and increasing reductions in seizure frequency among patients treated with ganaxolone over a period of up to two years \n  * Nine of the 23 patients enrolled in the open-label Phase 2 TSC trial qualified for and entered the long-term extension; seven patients completed two years of follow up with two patients discontinuing within that time \n    * Patients (n=9) experienced a cumulative median reduction in seizure frequency of 56% within two years \n    * Patients (n=6 with available data) experienced a median reduction in seizure frequency of 87% during months 22-24 \n  * Safety findings were consistent with the double-blind phase; no new safety findings had emerged at the time of analysis \n  * Data accepted for presentation at the American Epilepsy Society Annual Meeting in December 2024 \n\n\n\nOther Rare Genetic Epilepsies\n\n  * Presenting strategy to expand ZTALMY development in a range of developmental and epileptic encephalopathies, including Lennox-Gastaut syndrome, with clinical trials to begin in the second half of 2025, pending the TSC topline data \n  * Targeting submission of an Investigational New Drug application for a novel oral ganaxolone prodrug in the fourth quarter of 2025 \n\n\n\nGeneral Business and Financial Update\n\n  * Full year 2024 guidance remains unchanged with projected ZTALMY net product revenue between $33 and $35 million and combined selling, general and administrative and research & development expenses in the range of approximately $135 to $140 million, including stock-based compensation expense of approximately $20 million \n  * The Company expects that cash and cash equivalents of $64.7 million as of June 30, 2024, will be sufficient to fund the Company’s operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements into the second quarter of 2025 \n  * The Company continues to make investments to expand ZTALMY manufacturing capacity necessary for the global launch of the CDKL5 deficiency disorder indication and potential TSC expansion \n  * Targeting total Company profitability within 18 months of a U.S. TSC launch \n\n\n\n**About Marinus Pharmaceuticals**\n\nMarinus is a commercial-stage pharmaceutical company dedicated to the development of innovative therapeutics for seizure disorders.
