(NASDAQ: MRSN), a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on discovering and developing a pipeline of antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) targeting cancers in areas of high unmet medical need, today provided a business update and reported financial results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2024.\n\n“During the third quarter of 2024, our team continued its strong execution as we advanced the dose escalation portions of our Phase 1 clinical trials of XMT-1660 and XMT-2056, made further progress in our collaborations and maintained the strength of our balance sheet,” said Martin Huber, M.D., President and Chief Executive Officer of Mersana Therapeutics. “In multiple presentations over the course of the past year, we shared data demonstrating the potential for Dolasynthen ADCs to generate anti-tumor activity and avoid many of the toxicities that have limited other ADC platforms. We are looking forward to presenting initial XMT-1660 clinical data later this year. We also are finalizing plans to begin the expansion portion of our trial, with an initial focus on patients with triple-negative breast cancer who have previously been treated with at least one topoisomerase-1 ADC.”\n\n**_Recent Accomplishments, Strategic Priorities and Expected Milestones_**\n\n**XMT-1660:** Mersana continues to advance its Phase 1 clinical trial of XMT-1660, the company’s lead Dolasynthen ADC candidate targeting B7-H4. The dose escalation portion of the trial is ongoing, with the company having recently escalated to a dose of 115 milligrams per meter squared administered every four weeks. A maximum tolerated dose has not yet been established. Approximately 75 percent of the patients that have been enrolled in the trial to date have triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) or hormone receptor-positive breast cancer (HR+BC). Among the enrolled patients with TNBC, approximately 90 percent have received a prior topoisomerase-1 (topo-1) ADC, and among the enrolled patients with HR+BC, approximately half have received a prior topo-1 ADC. Last week at World ADC 2024, Mersana presented new preclinical data demonstrating XMT-1660’s anti-tumor activity following topo-1 treatment. By the end of 2024, Mersana plans both to share initial safety, tolerability, efficacy and biomarker data from its Phase 1 dose escalation and backfill cohorts at a company event and to initiate the expansion portion of the trial in patients with TNBC who have previously been treated with at least one topo-1 ADC.\n\n**XMT-2056:** Mersana continues to escalate dosing in its Phase 1 clinical trial of XMT-2056, the company’s lead Immunosynthen ADC candidate targeting a novel HER2 epitope. GSK plc has an exclusive global license option to co-develop and commercialize XMT-2056. At the Society for Immunotherapy of Cancer (SITC) 2024 Annual Meeting last week, Mersana presented new preclinical data demonstrating XMT-2056’s ability to activate STING signaling and inhibit tumor growth at very low doses.\n\n**Collaborations:** Mersana continues to advance its Johnson & Johnson and Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany collaborations. The collaboration with Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany focuses on discovering novel Immunosynthen ADCs for up to two targets. The collaboration with Johnson & Johnson focuses on discovering novel Dolasynthen ADCs for up to three targets. In the third quarter of 2024, Mersana achieved and received payment for an $8 million development milestone under the Johnson & Johnson collaboration and achieved a $1 million development milestone under the Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany collaboration, for which payment was received in the fourth quarter of 2024.\n\n**_Third Quarter 2024 Financial Results_**\n\n  * Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities as of September 30, 2024, were $155.2 million. Mersana continues to expect that its capital resources will be sufficient to support its current operating plan commitments into 2026.\n  * Net cash used in operating activities for the third quarter of 2024 was $8.6 million, which reflects the impact of the aforementioned $8 million milestone payment and a $3.5 million payment for manufacturing activities from Johnson & Johnson.\n\n\n  * Collaboration revenue for the third quarter of 2024 was $12.6 million, compared to $7.7 million for the same period in 2023. The year-over-year change was primarily related to an increase in revenue recognized under Mersana’s collaboration and license agreements with Johnson & Johnson and Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany.\n  * Research and development (R&D) expenses for the third quarter of 2024 were $14.8 million, compared to $30.5 million for the same period in 2023. Included in the third quarter of 2024 R&D expenses were $2.3 million in non-cash stock-based compensation expenses. The year-over-year decline in R&D expenses was primarily related to reduced costs associated with manufacturing and clinical development activities for UpRi, a discontinued ADC candidate, and reduced employee compensation expense following the company’s restructuring in 2023.\n  * General and administrative (G&A) expenses for the third quarter of 2024 were $9.9 million, compared to $12.9 million during the same period in 2023. Included in the third quarter of 2024 G&A expenses were $1.7 million in non-cash stock-based compensation expenses. The year-over-year decline in G&A expenses was primarily related to reduced consulting and professional services fees and reduced employee compensation expense following the aforementioned restructuring.\n  * Net loss for the third quarter of 2024 was $11.5 million, or $0.09 per share, compared to a net loss of $41.7 million, or $0.35 per share, for the same period in 2023.\n\n\n\n**_Conference Call Reminder_** Mersana will host a conference call today at 8:00 a.m. ET to discuss business updates and its financial results for the third quarter of 2024. To access the call, please dial 833-255-2826 (domestic) or 412-317-0689 (international). A live webcast of the presentation will be available on the Investors & Media section of the Mersana website at www.mersana.com, and a replay of the webcast will be available in the same location following the conference call for approximately 90 days.\n\n**_About Mersana Therapeutics_** Mersana Therapeutics is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on the development of novel antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) and driven by the knowledge that patients are waiting for new treatment options.

(NASDAQ: MRSN), a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on discovering and developing a pipeline of antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) targeting cancers in areas of high unmet medical need, today provided a business update and reported financial results for the second quarter ended June 30, 2024.\n\n“The second quarter of 2024 was a time of continued progress at Mersana as we advanced dose escalation in Phase 1 clinical trials of XMT-1660, our lead Dolasynthen ADC candidate, and XMT-2056, our lead Immunosynthen ADC candidate,” said Martin Huber, M.D., President and Chief Executive Officer of Mersana Therapeutics. “At the same time, we made further progress in our collaborations while also benefiting from last year’s efforts to reduce operating expenses. We believe these collective accomplishments have put us in a strong position as we approach our initial clinical data readout for XMT-1660, which is planned for the second half of this year.”\n\n**_Recent Accomplishments, Strategic Priorities and Expected Milestones_**\n\n**XMT-1660:** Mersana continues to advance its Phase 1 clinical trial of XMT-1660, the company’s lead Dolasynthen ADC candidate targeting B7-H4. The dose escalation portion of the trial is ongoing at a dose level of 80 milligrams per meter squared every four weeks, and a maximum tolerated dose has yet to be established. Additionally, the company has been proactively exploring more frequent dosing and enrolling patients in backfill cohorts to inform the optimal dose and schedule for expansion. Mersana plans to share initial safety, tolerability, efficacy and biomarker data from dose escalation and backfill cohorts and plans to initiate the expansion portion of the trial in the second half of 2024.\n\n**XMT-2056:** Mersana continues to enroll patients in the dose escalation portion of its Phase 1 clinical trial of XMT-2056, the company’s lead Immunosynthen ADC candidate targeting a novel HER2 epitope. GSK plc has an exclusive global license option to co-develop and commercialize XMT-2056. Additionally, mechanistic underpinnings related to Mersana’s Immunosynthen platform were recently described in a _Nature Communications_ publication entitled, “Tumor Cell-Directed STING Agonist Antibody Drug Conjugates Induce Type III Interferons and Anti-Tumor Innate Immune Responses.”\n\n**Collaborations:** Mersana continues to advance its Johnson & Johnson and Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany collaborations. The collaboration with Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany focuses on the discovery of novel Immunosynthen ADCs for up to two targets. The collaboration with Johnson & Johnson focuses on the discovery of novel Dolasynthen ADCs for up to three targets. In August 2024, Mersana earned an $8 million development milestone under the Johnson & Johnson collaboration, for which payment is due in the third quarter of 2024.\n\n**_Second Quarter 2024 Financial Results_**\n\n  * Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities as of June 30, 2024 were $162.7 million. Mersana continues to expect that its capital resources will be sufficient to support its current operating plan commitments into 2026.\n  * Net cash used in operating activities for the second quarter of 2024 was $21.8 million.\n\n\n  * Collaboration revenue for the second quarter of 2024 was $2.3 million, compared to $10.7 million for the same period in 2023. The year-over-year change was primarily related to reduced collaboration revenue recognized under Mersana’s collaboration and license agreements with Johnson & Johnson and Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany.\n  * Research and development (R&D) expenses for the second quarter of 2024 were $17.2 million, compared to $49.0 million for the same period in 2023. Included in R&D expenses for the second quarter of 2024 were $2.4 million in non-cash stock-based compensation expenses. The year-over-year decline in R&D expenses was primarily related to reduced costs associated with manufacturing and clinical activities for UpRi, a discontinued ADC candidate, and reduced employee compensation expense following the company’s restructuring in 2023.\n  * General and administrative (G&A) expenses for the second quarter of 2024 were $10.5 million, compared to $18.2 million during the same period in 2023. Included in G&A expenses for the second quarter of 2024 were $2.0 million in non-cash stock-based compensation expenses. The year-over-year decline in G&A expenses was primarily related to reduced consulting and professional services fees and reduced employee compensation expense following the aforementioned restructuring.\n  * Net loss for the second quarter of 2024 was $24.3 million, or $0.20 per share, compared to a net loss of $54.3 million, or $0.47 per share, for the same period in 2023.\n\n\n\n**_Conference Call Reminder_** Mersana will host a conference call today at 8:00 a.m. ET to discuss business updates and its financial results for the second quarter of 2024. To access the call, please dial 833-255-2826 (domestic) or 412-317-0689 (international).
