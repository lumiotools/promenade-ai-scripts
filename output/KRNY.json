Announces First Quarter Fiscal 2025 Results and Declaration of Cash Dividend\n\nOctober 24, 2024\n\n[ Download (opens in new window) ](//s203.q4cdn.com/800744596/files/doc_news/Kearny-Financial-Corp.-Announces-First-Quarter-Fiscal-2025-Results-and-Declaration-of-Cash-Dividend-2024.pdf)\n\nFAIRFIELD, N.J., Oct. 24, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Kearny Financial Corp. (NASDAQ GS: KRNY) (the “Company”), the holding company of Kearny Bank (the “Bank”), reported net income for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 of $6.1 million, or $0.10 per diluted share, compared to a GAAP net loss of $90.1 million, or $1.45 per diluted share, for the quarter ended June 30, 2024. The net loss for the quarter ended June 30, 2024 included a goodwill impairment of $95.3 million, as previously disclosed. Excluding this item, net income for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 increased $496,000 from adjusted net income of $5.6 million for the quarter ended June 30, 2024.\n\nThe Company also announced that its Board of Directors has declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.11 per share, payable on November 20, 2024, to stockholders of record as of November 6, 2024.\n\nCraig L. Montanaro, President and Chief Executive Officer, commented, “I’m pleased to report that this quarter saw our net interest margin reach its inflection point and begin to ascend. Despite four basis points of quarterly compression, each successive month of the quarter reflected an increase in our net interest margin. The recent fed funds rate reduction of 50 basis points has already begun translating into a cost of funds benefit in October. Additional fed funds rate cuts, which the market is anticipating, will be a positive catalyst for our liability-sensitive balance sheet.”\n\nMr. Montanaro continued, “Regarding asset quality, our loan portfolio remains strong. Minimal exposure to New York City rent-regulated multifamily and office real estate, coupled with our robust commercial real estate ACL coverage ratios and peer-leading charge-off ratios, leaves us well-positioned in the current environment.”\n\n**Balance Sheet**\n\n  * Total assets were $7.77 billion at September 30, 2024, an increase of $88.9 million, or 1.2%, from June 30, 2024.\n  * Investment securities totaled $1.20 billion at September 30, 2024, a decrease of $5.5 million, or 0.5%, from June 30, 2024.\n  * Loans receivable totaled $5.78 billion at September 30, 2024, an increase of $51.5 million, or 0.9%, from June 30, 2024, primarily reflecting growth in one- to four-family residential mortgage loans and construction loans.\n  * Deposits were $5.47 billion at September 30, 2024, an increase of $312.4 million, or 6.1%, from June 30, 2024. This increase was largely the result of a reallocation from Federal Home Loan Bank (“FHLB”) advances into brokered certificates of deposits, due to the relatively more favorable economics of brokered deposits compared to advances.\n  * Borrowings were $1.48 billion at September 30, 2024, a decrease of $229.9 million, or 13.4%, from June 30, 2024, primarily reflecting a decrease in FHLB borrowings offset by an increase in brokered certificates of deposits, as noted above.\n  * At September 30, 2024, the Company maintained available secured borrowing capacity with the FHLB and the Federal Reserve Discount Window of $2.06 billion, an increase of $240.0 million from June 30, 2024, and represents 26.5% of total assets.\n\n\n\n**Earnings**\n\n**Net Interest Income and Net Interest Margin**\n\n  * Net interest margin contracted four basis points to 1.80% for the quarter ended September 30, 2024. The decrease for the quarter was driven by increases in the cost and average balances of interest-bearing deposits and a decrease in the average balance of interest-earning assets, partially offset by decreases in the average balances of interest-bearing borrowings and higher yields on interest-earning assets.\n  * For the quarter ended September 30, 2024, net interest income decreased $830,000 to $32.4 million from $33.3 million for the quarter ended June 30, 2024. Included in net interest income for the quarters ended September 30, 2024 and June 30, 2024, respectively, was purchase accounting accretion of $649,000 and $612,000, and loan prepayment penalty income of $52,000 and $366,000.\n\n\n\n**Non-Interest Income**\n\n  * Non-interest income decreased $1.2 million to income of $4.6 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, from $5.8 million for the quarter ended June 30, 2024. Included in non-interest income for the quarter ended June 30, 2024 was a non-recurring contract renewal bonus of $750,000 and $1.1 million in non-recurring payments on two life insurance policies, partially offset by a $392,000 non-recurring exchange charge related to the December 2023 Bank Owned Life Insurance (“BOLI”) restructure. No such non-recurring items were recorded during the quarter ended September 30, 2024.\n  * Income from BOLI decreased $642,000 to $2.6 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 from $3.2 million for the quarter ended June 30, 2024, primarily driven by the non-recurring items recorded for the quarter ended June 30, 2024, as disclosed above.\n\n\n\n**Non-Interest Expense**\n\n  * For the quarter ended September 30, 2024, non-interest expense decreased $96.8 million, or 76.5%, to $29.8 million from $126.6 million for the quarter ended June 30, 2024, driven by a non-cash goodwill impairment recognized in the prior comparative period. Excluding the goodwill impairment, adjusted non-interest expense increased $605,000 from $29.2 million, primarily driven by increases in salary and benefits expense and other expense.\n  * Salary and benefits expense increased $232,000 primarily driven by annual merit increases and higher payroll taxes, partially offset by a non-recurring decrease in stock-based compensation.\n  * Other expense increased $344,000 primarily driven by an increase of $243,000 in the provision for credit losses on off balance sheet commitments.\n\n\n\n**Income Taxes**\n\n  * Income tax expense totaled $1.1 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, compared to an income tax benefit of $917,000 for the quarter ended June 30, 2024. The increase in income tax expense was primarily due to higher pre-tax income in the current quarter, coupled with a partial reversal of the deferred tax liability associated with the previously recorded goodwill impairment in the prior quarter.\n\n\n\n**Asset Quality**\n\n  * The balance of non-performing assets remained steady at $39.9 million, or 0.51% of total assets, at September 30, 2024, and $39.9 million, or 0.52% of total assets, at June 30, 2024, respectively.\n  * Net charge-offs totaled $124,000, or 0.01% of average loans, on an annualized basis, for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, compared to $3.5 million, or 0.25% of average loans, on an annualized basis, for the quarter ended June 30, 2024.\n  * For the quarter ended September 30, 2024, the Company recorded a provision for credit losses of $108,000, compared to $3.5 million for the quarter ended June 30, 2024. The provision for credit loss expense for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 was primarily driven by loan growth.\n  * The allowance for credit losses (“ACL”) was $44.9 million, or 0.78% of total loans, at September 30, 2024 and remained unchanged from June 30, 2024.\n\n\n\n**Capital**\n\n  * For the quarter ended September 30, 2024, book value per share decreased $0.06, or 0.5%, to $11.64 while tangible book value per share decreased $0.05, or 0.5%, to $9.85.\n  * At September 30, 2024, total stockholders’ equity included after-tax net unrealized losses on securities available for sale of $76.0 million, partially offset by after-tax unrealized gains on derivatives of $11.0 million. After-tax net unrecognized losses on securities held to maturity of $8.2 million were not reflected in total stockholders’ equity.\n  * At September 30, 2024, the Company’s tangible equity to tangible assets ratio equaled 8.31% and the regulatory capital ratios of both the Company and the Bank were in excess of the levels required by federal banking regulators to be classified as “well-capitalized” under regulatory guidelines.\n\n\n\nThis earnings release should be read in conjunction with Kearny Financial Corp.’s Q1 2025 Investor Presentation, a copy of which is available through the Investor Relations link located at the bottom of the page of our website at [www.kearnybank.com](http://www.kearnybank.com) and via a Current Report on Form 8-K on the website of the Securities and Exchange Commission at [www.sec.gov](http://www.sec.gov).\n\n_Statements contained in this news release that are not historical facts are forward-looking statements as that term is defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

Announces Fourth Quarter and Fiscal Year End 2024 Results and Declaration of $0.11 Per Share Cash Dividend\n\nJuly 25, 2024\n\n[ Download (opens in new window) ](//s203.q4cdn.com/800744596/files/doc_news/Kearny-Financial-Corp.-Announces-Fourth-Quarter-and-Fiscal-Year-End-2024-Results-and-Declaration-of-0.11-Per-Share-Cash-Dividend-2024.pdf)\n\nFAIRFIELD, N.J., July 25, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Kearny Financial Corp. (NASDAQ GS: KRNY) (the “Company”), the holding company of Kearny Bank (the “Bank”), reported a GAAP net loss for the quarter ended June 30, 2024 of $90.1 million, or $1.45 per diluted share, attributable to a non-cash, after-tax, goodwill impairment of $95.3 million. Excluding the impact of the goodwill impairment and other non-recurring transactions, adjusted net income for the quarter ended June 30, 2024 was $5.6 million, or $0.09 per diluted share, as compared to net income of $7.4 million, or $0.12 per diluted share, for the quarter ended March 31, 2024.\n\n“Goodwill impairment in no way affects our ongoing strategy or our ability to serve the banking needs of our clients,” said Craig L. Montanaro, President & Chief Executive Officer. “It also has no impact on our financial condition, robust liquidity position, or peer-leading regulatory capital ratios. This impairment simply reflects the impact of the current interest rate environment on bank stock prices, including our own.”\n\nFor the fiscal year ended June 30, 2024, the Company reported a GAAP net loss of $86.7 million, or $1.39 per diluted share, compared to GAAP net income of $40.8 million, or $0.63 per diluted share, for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2023, primarily attributable to the non-cash goodwill impairment mentioned above. Excluding the impact of the goodwill impairment and other non-recurring transactions, adjusted net income for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2024 was $28.2 million, or $0.45 per diluted share, as compared to adjusted net income of $50.6 million, or $0.78 per diluted share, for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2023.\n\nThe Company also announced that its Board of Directors has declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.11 per share, payable on August 26, 2024, to stockholders of record as of August 12, 2024.\n\n“Despite the challenging interest rate environment we have plenty of positive news to report this quarter,” Mr. Montanaro said. “The performance of our commercial real estate and multifamily portfolios continues to be outstanding, with non-performing assets having improved by $15.7 million, or 0.17% of assets, from June 30, 2023. Our deposit origination efforts, including those via our digital channel, have continued to gain traction with non interest-bearing deposits growing $12.3 million, or 2.1%, quarter-over-quarter. In addition, we now anticipate a net interest margin inflection in the near-term, as our retail time deposit portfolio has repriced above 4.00% and non-maturity deposit disintermediation has meaningfully slowed.”\n\nMr. Montanaro concluded by noting, “As described in greater detail later in this release, we fully charged-off a $3.3 million non-performing commercial & industrial lending relationship this quarter. We do not view this charge-off as a reflection of any broader weakness in our loan portfolio, but rather a borrower-specific event.”\n\n**Balance Sheet**\n\n  * Total assets were $7.68 billion at June 30, 2024, a decrease of $158.5 million, or 2.0%, from March 31, 2024 and a decrease of $381.4 million, or 4.7%, from June 30, 2023.\n  * Investment securities totaled $1.21 billion at June 30, 2024, a decrease of $29.7 million, or 2.4%, from March 31, 2024 and a decrease of $165.6 million, or 12.1%, from June 30, 2023. The decrease for the year was largely driven by the sale of available-for-sale securities, which was part of the investment securities portfolio repositioning executed in December 2023.\n  * Loans receivable totaled $5.73 billion at June 30, 2024, a decrease of $25.5 million, or 0.4%, from March 31, 2024 and a decrease of $96.6 million, or 1.7%, from June 30, 2023. The decrease for the year was largely driven by multi-family and nonresidential mortgage loans.\n  * Deposits were $5.16 billion at June 30, 2024, a decrease of $50.9 million, or 1.0%, from March 31, 2024 and a decrease of $471.1 million, or 8.4%, from June 30, 2023. The decrease from March 31, 2024 was driven by a $40.1 million decline in interest bearing government deposits and a $36.1 million decline in retail certificates of deposits (“CDs”), partially offset by growth in non-interest bearing and consumer savings deposits. Excluding brokered CDs, deposits decreased $238.8 million, or 4.8%, from June 30, 2023, driven by a $177.9 million decline in retail CDs and a $105.2 million decline in consumer savings deposits, partially offset by growth in other deposit categories.\n  * Borrowings were $1.71 billion at June 30, 2024, a decrease of $12.4 million, or 0.7%, from March 31, 2024 and an increase of $203.0 million, or 13.5%, from June 30, 2023.\n  * At June 30, 2024, the Company maintained available secured borrowing capacity of $1.82 billion, of which $1.44 billion was immediately accessible via in-place collateral and $381.4 million represented the market value of unpledged securities.\n  * Goodwill was $113.5 million at June 30, 2024, a decrease of $97.4 million, or 46.2%, from March 31, 2024 and June 30, 2023. The Company recognized a non-cash goodwill impairment, as noted above.\n\n\n\n**Earnings**\n\n**Net Interest Income and Net Interest Margin**\n\n  * Net interest margin contracted five basis points to 1.84% for the quarter ended June 30, 2024 and 40 basis points to 1.94% for the year ended June 30, 2024. The decreases for the quarter and the year were driven by increases in the cost of interest-bearing liabilities, increases in the average balances of interest-bearing borrowings and decreases in the average balances of interest-earning assets, partially offset by higher yields on interest-earning assets and decreases in the average balances of interest-bearing deposits.\n  * For the quarter ended June 30, 2024, net interest income decreased $1.0 million to $33.3 million from $34.3 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2024. Included in net interest income for the quarters ended June 30, 2024 and March 31, 2024, respectively, was purchase accounting accretion of $612,000 and $734,000, and loan prepayment penalty income of $366,000 and $61,000.\n  * For the year ended June 30, 2024, net interest income decreased $33.3 million to $142.6 million from $175.9 million for the year ended June 30, 2023. Included in net interest income for the years ended June 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, was purchase accounting accretion of $2.6 million and $5.3 million, and loan prepayment penalty income of $879,000 and $895,000.\n\n\n\n**Non-Interest Income**\n\n  * For the quarter ended June 30, 2024, non-interest income increased $1.6 million to income of $5.8 million from income of $4.2 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2024. Non-interest income for the quarter ended June 30, 2024 included a contract renewal bonus of $750,000 related to a licensing agreement with a third-party vendor. Included in other income for the quarter ended March 31, 2024 was an $884,000 non-recurring loss attributable to the sale of three related nonperforming commercial real estate loans held-for-sale. No such losses were recorded during the quarter ended June 30, 2024.\n  * Income from BOLI increased $170,000 to $3.2 million for the quarter ended June 30, 2024 from $3.0 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2024. BOLI income included a total of $1.1 million in non-recurring payments on two life insurance policies in the current period, partially offset by a $392,000 non-recurring exchange charge related to the December 2023 BOLI restructure. For the quarter ended March 31, 2024, BOLI income included a $631,000 non-recurring payment on one life insurance policy.\n  * For the year ended June 30, 2024, non-interest income decreased $4.7 million to a loss of $2.0 million. The decrease was primarily attributable to a pre-tax loss of $18.1 million related to the investment securities portfolio repositioning executed during December 2023 compared to a pre-tax loss of $15.2 million on the sale of securities in the prior year period. Included in other income for the year ended June 30, 2023 was a nonrecurring gain of $2.9 million attributable to the sale of a former branch location. No such gains were recorded during the year ended June 30, 2024.\n\n\n\n**Non-Interest Expense**\n\n  * For the quarter ended June 30, 2024, non-interest expense increased $97.5 million, or 335.5%, to $126.6 million from $29.1 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2024, driven by a non-cash goodwill impairment recognized in the current quarter. Excluding the goodwill impairment, adjusted non-interest expense increased $122,000, or 0.4%, to $29.2 million from $29.1 million in the prior quarter, driven primarily by a nonrecurring increase in post-retirement benefits expense.\n  * For the year ended June 30, 2024, non-interest expense increased $91.4 million, or 73.9%, to $215.2 million from $123.8 million for the year ended June 30, 2023, driven by non-cash goodwill impairment, as noted above. Excluding the goodwill impairment, adjusted non-interest expense decreased $4.4 million, or 3.6%, to $117.8 million from $122.2 million in the prior year period. The decrease was primarily attributable to decreases in salary and employee benefits expenses, occupancy, advertising and other expenses, which resulted from a continued execution of the company-wide operating efficiency initiative previously announced in December 2022.\n  * Salaries and employee benefits decreased $6.4 million, or 8.4%, for the year ended June 30, 2024 reflecting lower average headcount and a decrease in incentive payments tied to origination volume, partially offset by annual merit increases. Included in salaries and employee benefits for the year ended June 30, 2023 was $757,000 of severance expense from a workforce realignment.\n  * For the year ended June 30, 2023, the Company recorded $800,000 in branch consolidation expense, of which $250,000 was recorded in occupancy expense and $550,000 was recorded in other expense. No such expenses were recorded during the year ended June 30, 2024.\n\n\n\n**Income Taxes**\n\n  * Income tax expense was reduced by $917,000 for the quarter ended June 30, 2024 compared to an expense of $1.7 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2024. The decrease in income tax expense for the quarter was mainly attributable to a partial reversal of the deferred tax liability associated with the goodwill impairment, as discussed above.\n  * Income tax expense totaled $5.9 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2024 compared to $11.6 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2023. The decrease in income tax expense was due to lower pre-tax income, partially offset by $5.7 million of tax expense related to the surrender of BOLI policies during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2024.\n\n\n\n**Asset Quality**\n\n  * The balance of non-performing assets increased $336,000 to $39.9 million, or 0.52% of total assets, at June 30, 2024, from $39.5 million, or 0.50% of total assets, at March 31, 2024. The balance of non-performing assets was $55.6 million, or 0.69% of total assets, at June 30, 2023. The decrease from June 30, 2023 was primarily driven by the January 2024 sales of three related non-performing commercial real estate loans held-for-sale and the Company’s sole Other Real Estate Owned asset.\n  * Net charge-offs totaled $3.5 million, or 0.25% of average loans, on an annualized basis, for the quarter ended June 30, 2024, compared to $286,000, or 0.02% of average loans, on an annualized basis, for the quarter ended March 31, 2024. For the year ended June 30, 2024, net charge-offs totaled $10.0 million, or 0.17% of average loans, compared to $810,000, or 0.01% of average loans, for the year ended June 30, 2023.\n  * The charge-offs recorded during the quarter ended June 30, 2024 were primarily driven by a $3.3 million non-performing commercial and industrial loan relationship with a masonry and concrete business (the “borrower”). This relationship was originated in 2021 and is secured by the borrower’s business assets and receivables, as well as the personal guarantee of the principal. The borrower had made consistent and timely payments on these loans until recently, when the business ceased operations due to operating losses and litigation. The Company is currently pursuing all available remedies against the borrower and guarantor.\n  * For the quarter ended June 30, 2024, the Company recorded a provision for credit losses of $3.5 million, compared to $349,000 for the quarter ended March 31, 2024. The provision for credit loss expense for the quarter ended June 30, 2024 was primarily driven by the charge-offs described above. For the years ended June 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company recorded a provision for credit losses of $6.2 million and $2.5 million, respectively.\n  * The allowance for credit losses (“ACL”) was $44.9 million, or 0.78% of total loans, at June 30, 2024, unchanged from March 31, 2024, and a decrease of $3.8 million from $48.7 million, or 0.83% of total loans, at June 30, 2023. The decrease in the ACL from June 30, 2023 was largely attributable to a reduction in reserves for individually evaluated loans, resulting from the charge-offs noted above.\n\n\n\n**Capital**\n\n  * At June 30, 2024 the Company's tangible equity to tangible assets ratio increased to 8.43% while the Company's Common Equity Tier 1 Capital Ratio increased to 14.79%. All of the Company's capital ratios remained strong and were significantly in excess of regulatory well-capitalized standards.\n  * At June 30, 2024, book value per share totaled $11.70 while tangible book value per share totaled $9.90.\n  * At June 30, 2024, total stockholders’ equity included after-tax net unrealized losses on securities available for sale of $93.0 million, partially offset by after-tax unrealized gains on derivatives of $29.6 million. After-tax net unrecognized losses on securities held to maturity of $11.7 million were not reflected in total stockholders’ equity.\n\n\n\nThis earnings release should be read in conjunction with Kearny Financial Corp.’s Q4 2024 Investor Presentation, a copy of which is available through the Investor Relations link located at the bottom of the page of our website at [www.kearnybank.com](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=kL4CibXqizhBQS6ttpLiSW4NVlvCa4eBcfsZjWi4akPCSIA0SaOQQE1FMZFLu8ClNRkAAu4F0PbaojgXdqPCOxNi8OAIkauLE_ASfrSL7aY=) and via a Current Report on Form 8-K on the website of the Securities and Exchange Commission at [www.sec.gov](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=_sDcG5RpJN5qigFgQZLyTcZ3yjZhM7DHACowmZawiscmXNzb6tAaYcKizkXtKx7TLvH5sddlJ2t05Zl7wn-RcQ==). \n\n_Statements contained in this news release that are not historical facts are forward-looking statements as that term is defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

These forward-looking\nstatements are subject to risks and uncertainties, such as statements of the Company’s plans, objectives, expectations, estimates and\nintentions that are subject to change based on various important factors (some of which are beyond the Company’s control). In addition to\nthe factors described under Item 1A. Risk Factors in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K, and subsequent filings with the Securities\nand Exchange Commission, the following factors, among others, could cause the Company’s financial performance to differ materially from\nthe plans, objectives, expectations, estimates and intentions expressed in such forward-looking statements:\n• the strength of the United States economy in general and the strength of the local economy in which the Company conducts\noperations,\n• the effects of, and changes in, trade, monetary and fiscal policies and laws, including interest rate policies of the Board of Governors\nof the Federal Reserve System, inflation, interest rates, market and monetary fluctuations,\n• the impact of changes in laws, regulations and government policies regarding financial institutions (including laws concerning\ntaxation, banking, securities and insurance),\n• changes in accounting policies and practices, as may be adopted by regulatory agencies, the Financial Accounting Standards Board\n(“FASB”) or the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board,\n• technological changes,\n• competition among financial services providers, and\n• the success of the Company at managing the risks involved in the foregoing and managing its business.\nThe Company cautions that the foregoing list of important factors is not exhaustive.

AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Unaudited)\n1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nPrinciples of Consolidation\nThe unaudited consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Kearny Financial Corp. (the “Company”), its wholly-owned subsidiary,\nKearny Bank (the “Bank”) and the Bank’s wholly-owned subsidiaries. The Company conducts its business principally through the Bank. Management prepared\nthe unaudited consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”),\nincluding the elimination of all significant inter-company accounts and transactions during consolidation.\nBasis of Presentation\nThe accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements were prepared in accordance with instructions for Form 10-Q and Regulation S-X and\ndo not include the information or footnotes necessary for a complete presentation of financial condition, income, comprehensive income, changes in\nstockholders’ equity and cash flows in conformity with GAAP. However, in the opinion of management, all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring\nadjustments) necessary for a fair presentation of the unaudited consolidated financial statements have been included. The results of operations for the three\nmonths ended September 30, 2024 are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the entire fiscal year or any other period.\nThe data in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Condition at June 30, 2024 was derived from the Company’s 2024 Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nThat data, along with the interim unaudited financial information presented in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition, Income, Comprehensive\nIncome, Changes in Stockholders’ Equity and Cash Flows should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements, including the notes\nthereto, included in the Company’s 2024 Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nThe accounting and reporting policies of the Company conform to U.S. GAAP and to general practice within the financial services industry. A\ndiscussion of these policies can be found in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, included in the Company’s 2024 Annual Report on Form 10-\nK. There have been no material changes to the Company’s significant accounting policies since June 30, 2024.\n2. SUBSEQUENT EVENTS\nThe Company has evaluated events and transactions occurring subsequent to the statement of financial condition date of September 30, 2024, for\nitems that should potentially be recognized or disclosed in these consolidated financial statements. The evaluation was conducted through the date this\ndocument was filed.\nOn October 24, 2024, the Company declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.11 per share, payable on November 20, 2024 to stockholders of record as\nof November 6, 2024.\n3. RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS\nAccounting Standards Issued Not Yet Adopted\nIn November 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the “FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2023-07, Segment\nReporting - Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures (Topic 280), to improve reportable segment disclosures by requiring public entities to disclose\nsignificant expense categories and amounts for each reportable segment, where significant expense categories are defined as those that are regularly reported to\nan entity’s chief operating decision-maker and included in a segment’s reported measures of profit or loss. For public companies, the requirements will become\neffective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024, with early adoption\npermitted. As the Company has only one reportable segment, this ASU is not expected to have a material effect on the Company’s consolidated financial\nstatements.\nIn December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09, Income Taxes - Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures (Topic 740), which requires reporting\ncompanies to improve the transparency of certain income tax related disclosures, including the rate reconciliation and taxes paid disclosures. For public\ncompanies, the requirements will become effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024, with early adoption permitted. The Company does not\nexpect this ASU to have a material effect on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.\n- 7 -\nTable of Contents\nIn March 2024, the FASB issued ASU 2024-01, Compensation-Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Scope Applications of Profits Interests and Similar\nAwards. ASU 2024-01 adds an example to Topic 718 which illustrates how to apply the scope guidance to determine whether profits interest and similar\nawards should be accounted for as share-based payment arrangements under Topic 718 or under other U.S. GAAP. ASU 2024-01 is effective for annual periods\nbeginning after December 15, 2024, and interim periods within those annual periods, although early adoption is permitted. The Company does not expect this\nASU to have an impact on our consolidated financial statements.\n4.

An impairment related to credit factors would be recorded through an allowance for credit losses. The allowance is limited to the amount by\nwhich the security’s amortized cost basis exceeds the fair value. An impairment that has not been recorded through an allowance for credit losses shall be\nrecorded through other comprehensive income, net of applicable taxes. Investment securities will be written down to fair value through the Consolidated\nStatement of Income if management intends to sell, or may be required to sell, the securities before they recover in value. The issuers of these securities\ncontinue to make timely principal and interest payments and none of these securities were past due or were placed in nonaccrual status at September 30, 2024.\nThe Company also monitors the credit quality of the issuers through credit ratings from various rating agencies. Credit ratings express opinions about the credit\nquality of a security and are utilized by the Company to make informed decisions. Management believes that the unrealized losses on these securities are a\nfunction of changes in market interest rates and credit spreads, not changes in credit quality. No allowance for credit losses was recorded at September 30, 2024\non available for sale securities.\nAt September 30, 2024, the held to maturity securities portfolio consists of agency mortgage-backed securities and obligations of state and political\nsubdivisions. The mortgage-backed securities are issued by U.S. government agencies and are implicitly guaranteed by the U.S. government. The obligations\nof state and political subdivisions in the portfolio are highly rated by major rating agencies and have a long history of no credit losses. The Company regularly\nmonitors the obligations of state and\n- 11 -\nTable of Contents\npolitical subdivisions sector of the market and reviews collectability including such factors as the financial condition of the issuers as well as credit ratings in\neffect as of the reporting period. No allowance for credit losses was recorded at September 30, 2024 on held to maturity securities.\n5.

Loans that\nbecome 90 days or more past due, but are well secured and in the process of collection, may remain on accrual status. Nonaccrual loans are generally returned\nto accrual status when all payments due are brought current and the Company expects to receive all remaining principal and interest payments owed\nsubstantially in accordance with the terms of the loan agreement. Payments received in cash on nonaccrual loans, including both the principal and interest\nportions of those payments, are generally applied to reduce the carrying value of the loan. The Company did not recognize interest income on non-accrual loans\nduring the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023.\nThe following tables present information relating to the Company’s nonperforming loans as of September 30, 2024 and June 30, 2024:\nPerformance Status\nSeptember 30, 2024\nNonaccrual Nonaccrual\n90 Days and Over Loans with Loans with no\nPast Due Allowance for Allowance for Total\nAccruing Credit Losses Credit Losses Nonperforming Performing Total\n(In Thousands)\nMulti-family mortgage $ — $ — $ 21,980 $ 21,980 $ 2,624,207 $ 2,646,187\nNonresidential mortgage — 5,522 3,636 9,158 941,613 950,771\nCommercial business — 545 34 579 145,405 145,984\nConstruction — — — — 227,327 227,327\nOne- to four-family residential mortgage — 2,357 5,733 8,090 1,760,140 1,768,230\nHome equity loans — — 42 42 44,699 44,741\nOther consumer — — 5 5 2,960 2,965\nTotal loans $ — $ 8,424 $ 31,430 $ 39,854 $ 5,746,351 $ 5,786,205\nPerformance Status\nJune 30, 2024\nNonaccrual Nonaccrual\n90 Days and Over Loans with Loans with no\nPast Due Allowance for Allowance for Total\nAccruing Credit Losses Credit Losses Nonperforming Performing Total\n(In Thousands)\nMulti-family mortgage $ — $ — $ 22,591 $ 22,591 $ 2,623,260 $ 2,645,851\nNonresidential mortgage — 5,695 4,128 9,823 938,252 948,075\nCommercial business — 714 — 714 142,033 142,747\nConstruction — — — — 209,237 209,237\nOne- to four-family residential mortgage — 2,295 4,410 6,705 1,749,346 1,756,051\nHome equity loans — — 44 44 44,060 44,104\nOther consumer — — 5 5 2,680 2,685\nTotal loans $ — $ 8,704 $ 31,178 $ 39,882 $ 5,708,868 $ 5,748,750\n- 13 -\nTable of Contents\nLoan Modifications Made to Borrowers Experiencing Financial Difficulty\nThe following tables presents the amortized cost basis at September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023 of loan modifications made to borrowers\nexperiencing financial difficulty that were restructured during the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, by type of modification:\nThree Months Ended September 30, 2024\nPayment Delay and\nInterest Rate\nPayment Delay Term Extension Reductions Total Percent of Total Class\n(Dollars In Thousands)\nMulti-family mortgage $ 8,782 $ — $ 2,666 $ 11,448 0.43 %\nNonresidential mortgage 178 — — 178 0.02 %\nTotal $ 8,960 $ — $ 2,666 $ 11,626 0.21 %\nThree Months Ended September 30, 2023\nPayment Delay Term Extension Total Percent of Total Class\n(Dollars In Thousands)\nCommercial business $ 45 $ — $ 45 0.03 %\nOne- to four-family residential mortgage 489 — 489 0.03 %\nTotal $ 534 $ — $ 534 0.03 %\nNo modifications involved forgiveness of principal for the three months ended September 30, 2024, and September 30, 2023, respectively.

Loans previously modified as TDRs and\nloan modifications made to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty will generally be evaluated for individual impairment, however, after a period of\nsustained repayment performance which permits the credit to be returned to accrual status, the loans would generally be removed from individual impairment\nanalysis and returned to its corresponding pool. As of September 30, 2024, the carrying value of individually analyzed loans, including loans acquired with\ndeteriorated credit quality that were individually analyzed, totaled $39.8 million, of which $32.3 million were considered collateral dependent.\nFor collateral dependent loans where management has determined that foreclosure of the collateral is probable, or where the borrower is experiencing\nfinancial difficulty and repayment of the loan is to be provided substantially through the operation or sale of the collateral, the allowance for credit losses is\nmeasured based on the difference between the fair value of the collateral, less costs to sell, and the amortized cost basis of the loan as of the measurement date.\nSee Note 12 for additional disclosure regarding fair value of individually analyzed collateral dependent loans.\nThe following table presents the carrying value and related allowance of collateral dependent individually analyzed loans at the dates indicated:\nSeptember 30, 2024 June 30, 2024\nCarrying Value Related Allowance Carrying Value Related Allowance\n(In Thousands)\nCommercial loans:\nMulti-family mortgage $ 21,980 $ — $ 22,591 $ —\nNonresidential mortgage (1) 7,966 493 8,598 508\nTotal commercial loans 29,946 493 31,189 508\nOne- to four-family residential mortgage (2) 2,343 — 1,406 —\nConsumer loans:\nHome equity loans (2) 18 — 18 —\nTotal $ 32,307 $ 493 $ 32,613 $ 508\n___________________________\n(1) Secured by income-producing nonresidential property.\n(2) Secured by one- to four-family residential properties.\nCredit Quality Indicators\nThe Company categorizes loans into risk categories based on relevant information about the ability of borrowers to service their debt such as: current\nfinancial information, historical payment experience, credit documentation, public information, and current economic trends, among other factors. The\nCompany analyzes loans individually to classify the loans as to credit risk. The Company uses the following definitions for risk ratings:\nPass – Loans that are well protected by the current net worth and paying capacity of the obligor (or guarantors, if any) or by the fair value, less cost to\nacquire and sell, of any underlying collateral in a timely manner.\nSpecial Mention – Loans which do not currently expose the Company to a sufficient degree of risk to warrant an adverse classification but have some\ncredit deficiencies or other potential weaknesses.\nSubstandard – Loans which are inadequately protected by the paying capacity and net worth of the obligor or the collateral pledged, if any.\nSubstandard assets include those characterized by the distinct possibility that the Company will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected.\nDoubtful – Loans which have all of the weaknesses inherent in those classified as Substandard, with the added characteristic that the weaknesses\npresent make collection or liquidation in full highly questionable and improbable, on the basis of currently existing facts, conditions and values.\nLoss – Loans which are considered uncollectible or of so little value that their continuance as assets is not warranted.\n- 15 -\nTable of Contents\nThe following table presents the risk category of loans and current period gross charge-offs as of September 30, 2024 by loan segment and

ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES\nAllowance for Credit Losses on Loans Receivable\nThe following tables present the balance of the allowance for credit losses at September 30, 2024 and June 30, 2024. The balance of the allowance for\ncredit losses is based on an expected loss methodology, referred to as the “CECL” methodology. The tables identify the valuation allowances attributable to\nspecifically identified impairments on individually analyzed loans, including those acquired with deteriorated credit quality, as well as valuation allowances for\nimpairments on loans collectively evaluated. The tables include the underlying balance of loans receivable applicable to each category as of those dates.\nAllowance for Credit Losses\nSeptember 30, 2024\nLoans Loans\nacquired with acquired with\ndeteriorated deteriorated\ncredit quality credit quality\nindividually collectively Loans individually Loans collectively Total allowance for\nanalyzed evaluated analyzed evaluated credit losses\n(In Thousands)\nMulti-family mortgage $ — $ — $ — $ 24,368 $ 24,368\nNonresidential mortgage — 28 493 6,392 6,913\nCommercial business — 7 124 1,574 1,705\nConstruction — 13 — 1,490 1,503\nOne- to four-family residential mortgage 57 73 81 9,774 9,985\nHome equity loans — — — 357 357\nOther consumer — — — 92 92\nTotal loans $ 57 $ 121 $ 698 $ 44,047 $ 44,923\nBalance of Loans Receivable\nSeptember 30, 2024\nLoans Loans\nacquired with acquired with\ndeteriorated deteriorated\ncredit quality credit quality\nindividually collectively Loans individually Loans collectively\nanalyzed evaluated analyzed evaluated Total loans\n(In Thousands)\nMulti-family mortgage $ — $ — $ 21,980 $ 2,624,207 $ 2,646,187\nNonresidential mortgage 613 1,741 8,545 939,872 950,771\nCommercial business — 2,811 579 142,594 145,984\nConstruction — 5,735 — 221,592 227,327\nOne- to four-family residential mortgage 1,519 3,119 6,571 1,757,021 1,768,230\nHome equity loans 23 — 19 44,699 44,741\nOther consumer — — — 2,965 2,965\nTotal loans $ 2,155 $ 13,406 $ 37,694 $ 5,732,950 $ 5,786,205\nUnaccreted yield adjustments (1,959)\nLoans receivable, net of yield adjustments $ 5,784,246\n- 18 -\nTable of Contents\nAllowance for Credit Losses\nJune 30, 2024\nLoans Loans\nacquired with acquired with\ndeteriorated deteriorated\ncredit quality credit quality\nindividually collectively Loans individually Loans collectively Total allowance for\nanalyzed evaluated analyzed evaluated credit losses\n(In Thousands)\nMulti-family mortgage $ — $ — $ — $ 24,125 $ 24,125\nNonresidential mortgage — 31 517 5,577 6,125\nCommercial business — 6 228 1,339 1,573\nConstruction — — — 1,230 1,230\nOne- to four-family residential mortgage 9 95 108 11,249 11,461\nHome equity loans — — — 349 349\nOther consumer — — — 76 76\nTotal loans $ 9 $ 132 $ 853 $ 43,945 $ 44,939\nBalance of Loans Receivable\nJune 30, 2024\nLoans Loans\nacquired with acquired with\ndeteriorated deteriorated\ncredit quality credit quality\nindividually collectively Loans individually Loans collectively\nanalyzed evaluated analyzed evaluated Total loans\n(In Thousands)\nMulti-family mortgage $ — $ — $ 22,591 $ 2,623,260 $ 2,645,851\nNonresidential mortgage 284 2,145 9,539 936,107 948,075\nCommercial business — 2,794 714 139,239 142,747\nConstruction — 5,735 — 203,502 209,237\nOne- to four-family residential mortgage 1,276 3,431 5,429 1,745,915 1,756,051\nHome equity loans 24 — 20 44,060 44,104\nOther consumer — — — 2,685 2,685\nTotal loans $ 1,584 $ 14,105 $ 38,293 $ 5,694,768 $ 5,748,750\nUnaccreted yield adjustments (15,963)\nLoans receivable, net of yield adjustments $ 5,732,787\nThe following tables present the activity in the allowance for credit losses on loans for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023.\nChanges in the Allowance for Credit Losses\nThree Months Ended September 30, 2024\nProvision for Balance at\nBalance at (reversal of) September 30,\nJune 30, 2024 Charge-offs Recoveries credit losses 2024\n(In Thousands)\nMulti-family mortgage $ 24,125 $ — $ — $ 243 $ 24,368\nNonresidential mortgage 6,125 — — 788 6,913\nCommercial business 1,573 (127) 5 254 1,705\nConstruction 1,230 — — 273 1,503\nOne- to four-family residential mortgage 11,461 (2) — (1,474) 9,985\nHome equity loans 349 — — 8 357\nOther consumer 76 — — 16 92\nTotal loans $ 44,939 $ (129) $ 5 $ 108 $ 44,923\n- 19 -\nTable of Contents\nChanges in the Allowance for Credit Losses\nThree Months Ended September 30, 2023\nProvision for Balance at\nBalance at (reversal of) September 30,\nJune 30, 2023 Charge-offs Recoveries credit losses 2023\n(In Thousands)\nMulti-family mortgage $ 26,362 $ — $ — $ (772) $ 25,590\nNonresidential mortgage 8,953 (2,033) 109 408 7,437\nCommercial business 1,440 (189) 6 156 1,413\nConstruction 1,336 — — (19) 1,317\nOne- to four-family residential mortgage 10,237 — — 466 10,703\nHome equity loans 338 — — 4 342\nOther consumer 68 — — 2 70\nTotal loans $ 48,734 $ (2,222) $ 115 $ 245 $ 46,872\nAllowance for Credit Losses on Off Balance Sheet Commitments\nThe following table presents the activity in the allowance for credit losses on off balance sheet commitments recorded in other non-interest expense\nfor the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023:\nThree Months Ended\nSeptember 30,\n2024 2023\n(In Thousands)\nBalance at beginning of the period $ 796 $ 741\nProvision for (reversal of) credit losses 273 (74)\nBalance at end of the period $ 1,069 $ 667\n7.

DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES\nRisk Management Objective of Using Derivatives\nThe Company uses various financial instruments, including derivatives, to manage its exposure to interest rate risk. The Company’s derivative\nfinancial instruments are used to manage differences in the amount, timing, and duration of the Company’s known or expected cash receipts and its known or\nexpected cash payments principally related to specific wholesale funding positions and assets.\nFair Values of Derivative Instruments on the Statement of Financial Condition\nThe tables below present the fair value of the Company’s derivative financial instruments as well as their classification on the Statements of Financial\nCondition as of September 30, 2024 and June 30, 2024:\nSeptember 30, 2024\nAsset Derivatives Liability Derivatives\nLocation Fair Value Location Fair Value\n(In Thousands)\nDerivatives designated as hedging instruments:\nInterest rate contracts Other assets $ 23,331 Other liabilities $ 9,136\nTotal $ 23,331 $ 9,136\n- 21 -\nTable of Contents\nJune 30, 2024\nAsset Derivatives Liability Derivatives\nLocation Fair Value Location Fair Value\n(In Thousands)\nDerivatives designated as hedging instruments:\nInterest rate contracts Other assets $ 54,362 Other liabilities $ —\nTotal $ 54,362 $ —\nCash Flow Hedges of Interest Rate Risk\nThe Company’s uses derivatives to add stability to interest expense and interest income and to manage its exposure to interest rate movements. The\nCompany has entered into interest rate swaps, interest rate caps and an interest rate floor as part of its interest rate risk management strategy. These interest rate\nproducts are designated as cash flow hedges. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had a total of 13 interest rate swaps and caps with a total notional\namount of $1.53 billion hedging specific wholesale funding and six interest rate floors with a notional amount of $600.0 million hedging floating-rate available\nfor sale securities.\nFor derivatives designated as cash flow hedges, the gain or loss on the derivative is recorded in other comprehensive income, net of tax, and\nsubsequently reclassified into interest expense in the same period during which the hedged transaction affects earnings.\nFor cash flow hedges on the Company’s wholesale funding positions, amounts reported in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) related to\nderivatives will be reclassified to interest expense as interest payments are made on the Company’s hedged variable rate wholesale funding positions. During\nthe three months ended September 30, 2024, the Company reclassified $8.7 million as a reduction in interest expense. During the next twelve months, the\nCompany estimates that $12.6 million will be reclassified as a reduction in interest expense.\nFor cash flow hedges on the Company’s assets, amounts reported in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) related to derivatives will be\nreclassified to interest income as interest payments are received on the Company’s hedged variable rate assets. During the three months ended September 30,\n2024, the Company did not reclassify any amount to interest income. During the next twelve months, the Company estimates that $1.9 million will be\nreclassified as a reduction in interest income.\nThe table below presents the pre-tax effects of the Company’s derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges on the Consolidated Statements\nof Income for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023:\nThree Months Ended\nSeptember 30,\n2024 2023\n(In Thousands)\nAmount of (loss) gain recognized in other comprehensive income $ (17,538) $ 14,109\nAmount of gain reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income to interest expense $ 8,693 $ 9,471\nFair Value Hedges of Interest Rate Risk\nThe Company is exposed to changes in the fair value of certain of its fixed-rate assets due to changes in benchmark interest rates. The Company uses\ninterest rate swaps to manage its exposure to changes in fair value on these instruments attributable to changes in the designated benchmark interest rate.\nInterest rate swaps designated as fair value hedges involve the payment of fixed-rate amounts to a counterparty in exchange for the Company receiving\nvariable-rate payments over the life of the agreements without the exchange of the underlying notional amount. Such derivatives are used to hedge the changes\nin fair value of certain of its pools of fixed rate assets. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had five interest rate swaps with a notional amount of $725.0\nmillion hedging fixed-rate residential mortgage loans.\nFor derivatives designated and that qualify as fair value hedges, the gain or loss on the derivatives as well as the offsetting loss or gain on the hedged\nitem attributable to the hedged risk are recognized in interest income.\n- 22 -\nTable of Contents\nThe table below presents the effects of the Company’s derivative instruments designated as fair value hedges on the Consolidated Statements of\nIncome for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023:\nThree Months Ended\nSeptember 30,\n2024 2023\n(In Thousands)\nGain (loss) on hedged items recorded in interest income on loans $ 13,655 $ (4,120)\n(Loss) gain on hedges recorded in interest income on loans $ (10,798) $ 6,650\nAs of September 30, 2024 and June 30, 2024, the following amounts were recorded on the Statement of Financial Condition related to cumulative\nbasis adjustment for fair value hedges:\nSeptember 30, June 30,\n2024 2024\n(In Thousands)\nLoans receivable:\nCarrying amount of the hedged assets(1) $ 729,335 $ 715,680\nFair value hedging adjustment included in the carrying amount of the hedged assets $ 4,335 $ (9,320)\n___________________________________\n(1) This amount includes the amortized cost basis of the closed portfolios of loans receivable used to designate hedging relationships in which the hedged item is the stated\namount of assets in the closed portfolios anticipated to be outstanding for the designated hedge period.

The Company also has agreements with its derivative counterparties that contain a provision where if the Company fails to maintain its status\nas a well-capitalized institution, then the Company could be required to terminate its derivative positions with the counterparty. At September 30, 2024, eight of\nthe Company’s derivatives were in a net liability position.

FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS\nFair value is the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (exit price) in the principal or most advantageous\nmarket for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. There are three levels of inputs that may be used\nto measure fair values:\nLevel 1: Quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in active markets that the entity has the ability to access as of the\nmeasurement date.\nLevel 2: Inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly. These might\ninclude quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in\nmarkets that are not active, inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability or inputs that are derived\nprincipally from, or corroborated by, market data by correlation or other means.\nLevel 3: Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities.\nLevel 3 assets and liabilities include financial instruments whose value is determined using pricing models, discounted cash flow\nmethodologies, or similar techniques, as well as instruments for which the determination of fair value requires significant management\njudgment or estimation.\nAssets and Liabilities Measured on a Recurring Basis:\nThe following methods and significant assumptions were used to estimate the fair values as of September 30, 2024 and June 30, 2024:\nInvestment Securities Available for Sale\nThe Company’s available for sale investment securities are reported at fair value utilizing Level 2 inputs. For these securities, the Company obtains\nfair value measurements from an independent pricing service. The fair value measurements consider observable data that may include dealer quotes, market\nspreads, cash flows, the U.S. Treasury yield curve, live trading levels, trade execution data, market consensus prepayment speeds, credit information and the\nsecurities’ terms and conditions, among other things. From time to time, the Company validates prices supplied by the independent pricing service by\ncomparison to prices obtained from third-party sources or derived using internal models.\n- 25 -\nTable of Contents\nDerivatives\nThe Company has contracted with a third party vendor to provide periodic valuations for its interest rate derivatives to determine the fair value of its\ninterest rate contracts. The vendor utilizes standard valuation methodologies applicable to interest rate derivatives such as discounted cash flow analysis and\nextensions of the Black-Scholes model. Such valuations are based upon readily observable market data and are therefore considered Level 2 valuations by the\nCompany.\nThose assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis are summarized below:\nSeptember 30, 2024\nQuoted\nPrices\nin Active Significant\nMarkets for Other Significant\nIdentical Observable Unobservable\nAssets Inputs Inputs\n(Level 1) (Level 2) (Level 3) Total\n(In Thousands)\nAssets:\nDebt securities available for sale:\nAsset-backed securities $ — $ 74,091 $ — $ 74,091\nCollateralized loan obligations — 378,333 — 378,333\nCorporate bonds — 132,974 — 132,974\nTotal debt securities — 585,398 — 585,398\nMortgage-backed securities available for sale:\nResidential pass-through securities — 347,851 — 347,851\nCommercial pass-through securities — 137,562 — 137,562\nTotal mortgage-backed securities — 485,413 — 485,413\nTotal securities available for sale $ — $ 1,070,811 $ — $ 1,070,811\nInterest rate contracts $ — $ 23,331 $ — $ 23,331\nTotal assets $ — $ 1,094,142 $ — $ 1,094,142\nLiabilities:\nInterest rate contracts $ — $ 9,136 $ — $ 9,136\nTotal liabilities $ — $ 9,136 $ — $ 9,136\n- 26 -\nTable of Contents\nJune 30, 2024\nQuoted Prices\nin Active Significant\nMarkets for Other Significant\nIdentical Observable Unobservable\nAssets Inputs Inputs\n(Level 1) (Level 2) (Level 3) Total\n(In Thousands)\nAssets:\nDebt securities available for sale:\nAsset-backed securities $ — $ 80,440 $ — $ 80,440\nCollateralized loan obligations — 389,543 — 389,543\nCorporate bonds — 131,797 — 131,797\nTotal debt securities — 601,780 — 601,780\nMortgage-backed securities available for sale:\nResidential pass-through securities — 337,264 — 337,264\nCommercial pass-through securities — 133,789 — 133,789\nTotal mortgage-backed securities — 471,053 — 471,053\nTotal securities available for sale $ — $ 1,072,833 $ — $ 1,072,833\nInterest rate contracts $ — $ 54,362 $ — $ 54,362\nTotal assets $ — $ 1,127,195 $ — $ 1,127,195\nAssets Measured on a Non-Recurring Basis:\nThe following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair values of the Company’s assets measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis\nat September 30, 2024 and June 30, 2024:\nIndividually Analyzed Collateral Dependent Loans\nThe fair value of collateral dependent loans that are individually analyzed is determined based upon the appraised fair value of the underlying\ncollateral, less costs to sell. Such collateral primarily consists of real estate and, to a lesser extent, other business assets. Management may also adjust appraised\nvalues to reflect estimated changes in market values or apply other adjustments to appraised values resulting from its knowledge of the collateral. Internal\nvaluations may be utilized to determine the fair value of other business assets. For non-collateral-dependent loans, management estimates fair value using\ndiscounted cash flows based on inputs that are largely unobservable and instead reflect management’s own estimates of the assumptions as a market participant\nwould in pricing such loans. Individually analyzed collateral dependent loans are considered a Level 3 valuation by the Company.\nOther Real Estate Owned\nOther real estate owned is recorded at estimated fair value, less estimated selling costs when acquired, thus establishing a new cost basis. Fair value is\ngenerally based on independent appraisals. These appraisals include adjustments to comparable assets based on the appraisers’ market knowledge and\nexperience. When an asset is acquired, the excess of the loan balance over fair value, less estimated selling costs, is charged to the allowance for credit losses.\nIf further declines in the estimated fair value of the asset occur, a write-down is recorded through expense. The valuation of foreclosed assets is subjective in\nnature and may be adjusted in the future because of changes in economic conditions. Other real estate owned is considered a Level 3 valuation by the\nCompany.\n- 27 -\nTable of Contents\nThose assets measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis are summarized below:\nSeptember 30, 2024\nQuoted Prices\nin Active Significant\nMarkets for Other Significant\nIdentical Observable Unobservable\nAssets Inputs Inputs\n(Level 1) (Level 2) (Level 3) Total\n(In Thousands)\nCollateral dependent loans:\nMulti-family mortgage $ — $ — $ 1,896 $ 1,896\nNonresidential mortgage — — 5,028 5,028\nTotal $ — $ — $ 6,924 $ 6,924\nJune 30, 2024\nQuoted Prices\nin Active Significant\nMarkets for Other Significant\nIdentical Observable Unobservable\nAssets Inputs Inputs\n(Level 1) (Level 2) (Level 3) Total\n(In Thousands)\nCollateral dependent loans:\nMulti-family mortgage $ — $ — $ 1,896 $ 1,896\nNonresidential mortgage — — 5,014 5,014\nTotal $ — $ — $ 6,910 $ 6,910\nThe following tables present additional quantitative information about assets measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis and for which the\nCompany has utilized adjusted Level 3 inputs to determine fair value:\nSeptember 30, 2024\nFair Valuation Unobservable Weighted\nValue Techniques Input Range Average\n(Dollars in Thousands)\nCollateral dependent loans:\nMulti-family mortgage $ 1,896 Market valuation of (1) Adjustments to reflect current (2) 13.37% 13.37 %\nunderlying collateral conditions/selling costs\nNonresidential mortgage 5,028 Market valuation of (1) Adjustments to reflect current (2) 8.64% 8.64 %\nunderlying collateral conditions/selling costs\nTotal $ 6,924\nJune 30, 2024\nFair Valuation Unobservable Weighted\nValue Techniques Input Range Average\n(Dollars in Thousands)\nCollateral dependent loans:\nMulti-family mortgage $ 1,896 Market valuation of (1) Adjustments to reflect current (2) 13.32% 13.32 %\nunderlying collateral conditions/selling costs\nNonresidential mortgage 5,014 Market valuation of (1) Adjustments to reflect current (2) 8.93% 8.93 %\nunderlying collateral conditions/selling costs\nTotal $ 6,910\n___________________________________\n(1) The fair value of collateral dependent loans is generally determined based on an independent appraisal of the fair value of a loan’s underlying collateral.\n(2) The fair value basis of collateral dependent loans is adjusted to reflect management’s estimates of selling costs including, but not limited to, real estate brokerage\ncommissions and title transfer fees.\n- 28 -\nTable of Contents\nAt September 30, 2024, collateral dependent loans valued using Level 3 inputs comprised loans with principal balances totaling $6.9 million and a\nvaluation allowance of $493,000 reflecting an aggregate fair value of $7.4 million.

For fixed rate loan commitments, including those relating to loans held for sale that are considered derivative\ninstruments for financial statement reporting purposes, the fair value also considers the difference between current levels of interest and the committed rates.\nThe carrying value, represented by the net deferred fee arising from the unrecognized commitment, and the fair value, determined by discounting the remaining\ncontractual fee over the term of the commitment using fees currently charged to enter into similar agreements with similar credit risk, is not considered material\nfor disclosure.\n(cid:0)/ (cid:0)L(cid:0)P (cid:0)L(cid:0)W(cid:0)D (cid:0)W(cid:0)L(cid:0)R (cid:0)Q (cid:0)V (cid:0)(cid:17) Fair value estimates are made at a specific point in time based on relevant market information and information about the financial\ninstruments. These estimates do not reflect any premium or discount that could result from offering for sale at one time the entire holdings of a particular\nfinancial instrument. Because no fair value exists for a significant portion of the financial instruments, fair value estimates are based on judgments regarding\nfuture expected loss experience, current economic conditions, risk characteristics of various financial instruments and other factors. These estimates are\nsubjective in nature, involve uncertainties and matters of judgment and, therefore, cannot be determined with precision. Changes in assumptions could\nsignificantly affect the estimates.\nThe fair value estimates are based on existing on-and-off balance sheet financial instruments without attempting to value anticipated future business\nand the value of assets and liabilities that are not considered financial instruments. Other significant assets and liabilities that are not considered financial assets\nand liabilities include premises and equipment, and advances from borrowers for taxes and insurance. In addition, the ramifications related to the realization of\nthe unrealized gains and losses can have a significant effect on fair value estimates and have not been considered in any of the estimates.\nFinally, reasonable comparability between financial institutions may not be likely due to the wide range of permitted valuation techniques and\nnumerous estimates which must be made given the absence of active secondary markets for many of the financial instruments. This lack of uniform valuation\nmethodologies introduces a greater degree of subjectivity to these estimated fair values.\n- 30 -\nTable of Contents\n13.

Such forward-\nlooking statements may be identified by reference to a future period or periods or by the use of forward-looking terminology, such as “may”, “will”, “believe”,\n“expect”, “estimate”, “anticipate”, “continue”, or similar terms or variations on those terms, or the negative of those terms. The actual results of the Company\ncould differ materially from those management expectations. This includes statements regarding general economic conditions, legislative and regulatory\nchanges, monetary and fiscal policies of the federal government, changes in tax policies, rates and regulations of federal, state and local tax authorities and\nfailure to integrate or profitably operate acquired businesses. Additional potential factors include changes in interest rates, the rate of inflation, deposit flows,\ncost of funds, demand for loan products and financial services, competition and changes in the quality or composition of loan and investment portfolios of the\nCompany. Other factors that could cause future results to vary from current management expectations include changes in accounting principles, policies or\nguidelines, and other economic, competitive, governmental and technological factors affecting the Company’s operations, markets, products, services and\nprices. Further description of the risks and uncertainties to the business are included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and in the Company’s Annual\nReport on Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2024, under “Item 1A. Risk Factors.”\nExcept as required by applicable law or regulation, the Company does not undertake, and specifically disclaims any obligation, to release publicly the\nresult of any revisions that may be made to any forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date of the statements or to reflect the\noccurrence of anticipated or unanticipated events.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nOur accounting policies are integral to understanding the results reported. We consider accounting policies that require management to exercise\nsignificant judgment or discretion or to make significant assumptions that have, or could have, a material impact on the carrying value of certain assets or on\nincome to be critical accounting policies. At September 30, 2024, there have been no material changes to our critical accounting policies as compared to the\ncritical accounting policies disclosed in our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K. Reference is made to Item 7 “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of\nFinancial Condition and Results of Operations” in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2024.\nComparison of Financial Condition at September 30, 2024 and June 30, 2024\n(cid:0)( (cid:0)[ (cid:0)H (cid:0)F (cid:0)X (cid:0)W(cid:0)L(cid:0)Y (cid:0)H (cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)6 (cid:0)X (cid:0)P (cid:0)P (cid:0)D (cid:0)U (cid:0)\\ (cid:0)(cid:17) Total assets increased $88.9 million to $7.77 billion at September 30, 2024 from $7.68 billion at June 30, 2024.

The decrease between the comparative periods resulted from an increase of $8.8 million in interest expense,\npartially offset by an increase of $2.1 million in interest income. Included in net interest income for the quarters ended September 30, 2024 and 2023,\nrespectively, was purchase accounting accretion of $649,000 and $650,000, and loan prepayment penalty income of $52,000 and $267,000.\nNet interest margin decreased 30 basis points to 1.80% for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, from 2.10% for the quarter ended September 30,\n2023 reflecting an increase in the cost of interest-bearing liabilities, an increase in the average balance of interest-bearing borrowings and a decrease in the\naverage balance of interest-earning assets, partially offset by an increase in the yield on interest-earning assets and a decrease in the average balance of interest-\nbearing deposits.\n- 36 -\nTable of Contents\nDetails regarding the composition of, and changes to, net interest income are presented in the table below which reflects the components of the\naverage balance sheet and of net interest income for the periods indicated. We derived the average yields and costs by dividing income or expense by the\naverage balance of assets or liabilities, respectively, for the periods presented with daily balances used to derive average balances. No tax equivalent\nadjustments have been made to yield or costs. Non-accrual loans were included in the calculation of average balances, however interest receivable on these\nloans has been fully reserved for and therefore not included in interest income.

The provision for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 was primarily driven by loan growth compared to\nprevious quarter end loan balances. By comparison, the provision for credit losses for the quarter ended September 30, 2023 was largely driven by additional\nreserves provided for individually analyzed loans and a slower prepayment rate assumption, partially offset by a decrease in the balance of loans receivable.\nAdditional information regarding the ACL and the associated provisions recognized during the quarters ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 is\npresented in Note 6 to the unaudited consolidated financial statements as well as the Comparison of Financial Condition at September 30, 2024 and June 30,\n2024.\n(cid:0)1 (cid:0)R (cid:0)Q (cid:0)(cid:16)(cid:0), (cid:0)Q (cid:0)W(cid:0)H (cid:0)U (cid:0)H (cid:0)V (cid:0)W(cid:0)(cid:3) (cid:0), (cid:0)Q (cid:0)F (cid:0)R (cid:0)P (cid:0)H .

The decrease primarily reflected decreases in\nvarious loan-related fees and charges.\nOther non-interest income decreased $181,000 to $833,000 for the quarter ended September 30, 2024. The decrease in other non-interest income was\nprimarily driven by the absence of OREO income recorded in the current period due to the sale of our sole OREO asset in January 2024.\nThe remaining changes in the other components of non-interest income between comparative periods generally reflected normal operating fluctuations\nwithin those line items.\n(cid:0)1 (cid:0)R (cid:0)Q (cid:0)(cid:16)(cid:0), (cid:0)Q (cid:0)W(cid:0)H (cid:0)U (cid:0)H (cid:0)V (cid:0)W(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)( (cid:0)[ (cid:0)S (cid:0)H (cid:0)Q (cid:0)V (cid:0)H .

This decrease was primarily driven by a\nnon-recurring decrease in stock-based compensation and lower incentive compensation, partially offset by annual merit increases and higher payroll taxes.\nEquipment and systems expense increased $59,000 to $3.9 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, largely driven by increases in\ntechnology expense associated with the Company’s ongoing digital banking initiatives.\nAdvertising and marketing expense increased $114,000 to $342,000 for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, largely driven by an increase in digital\nand online advertising campaigns to support our deposit growth initiatives.\nOther non-interest expense increased $55,000 to $3.4 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2024. This increase reflected an increase in the\nprovision for credit losses on off balance sheet commitments, offset by a decrease in OREO expenses following the sale of a our sole OREO asset in January\n2024.\nThe remaining changes in the other components of non-interest expense between comparative periods generally reflected normal operating\nfluctuations within those line items.\n(cid:0)3 (cid:0)U (cid:0)R (cid:0)Y (cid:0)L(cid:0)V (cid:0)L(cid:0)R (cid:0)Q (cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)I(cid:0)R (cid:0)U (cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0), (cid:0)Q (cid:0)F (cid:0)R (cid:0)P (cid:0)H (cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)7 (cid:0)D (cid:0)[ (cid:0)H (cid:0)V . Provision for income taxes decreased $2.2 million to $1.1 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 from $3.3\nmillion for the quarter ended September 30, 2023.\nThe decrease in income tax expense reflected a lower level of pre-tax income compared to the prior period.\nEffective tax rates for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were 15.1% and 25.2%, respectively. The decrease in the effective tax rate was\nprimarily due to lower full year projected taxable income and an increase in non-taxable BOLI income compared to the prior year period.\n- 38 -\nTable of Contents\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nLiquidity, represented by cash and cash equivalents, is a product of operating, investing and financing activities. Our primary sources of funds are\ndeposits, borrowings, cash flows from investment securities and loans receivable and funds provided from operations. While scheduled payments from the\namortization and maturity of loans and investment securities are relatively predictable sources of funds, general interest rates, economic conditions and\ncompetition greatly influence deposit flows and prepayments on loans and securities.\nAt September 30, 2024, liquidity included $155.6 million of short-term cash and cash equivalents and $1.07 billion of investment securities available\nfor sale. As of September 30, 2024, we had the capacity to borrow additional cash funds totaling $2.06 billion and $663.9 million from the FHLBNY and the\nFederal Reserve discount window, respectively, without pledging additional collateral. We had the ability to pledge additional securities to borrow an additional\n$62.8 million at September 30, 2024. As of that same date, we also had access to unsecured overnight borrowings with other financial institutions totaling\n$920.0 million of which $270.0 million was outstanding.\nAt September 30, 2024, we had outstanding commitments to originate and purchase loans totaling $52.2 million while such commitments totaled\n$47.9 million at June 30, 2024. As of those same dates, our pipeline of loans held for sale included $17.8 million and $16.0 million, respectively, of loans in\nprocess whose terms included interest rate locks to borrowers that were paired with a best-efforts commitment to sell the loan to a buyer at a fixed price and\nwithin a predetermined timeframe after the sale commitment is established.\nConstruction loans in process and unused lines of credit were $117.4 million and $154.1 million, respectively, at September 30, 2024 compared to\n$75.7 million and $157.3 million, respectively, at June 30, 2024. We are also subject to the contingent liabilities resulting from letters of credit whose\noutstanding balances totaled $160,000 at September 30, 2024 and June 30, 2024, respectively.\nCommitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a customer as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract.\nCommitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee by the customer. Our exposure to credit loss\nin the event of nonperformance by the other party to the financial instrument for commitments to extend credit is represented by the contractual notional\namount of those instruments. We use the same credit policies in making commitments and conditional obligations as we do for on-balance-sheet instruments.\nSince many of the commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon, the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash\nrequirements.\nConsistent with its goals to operate a sound and profitable financial organization, the Bank actively seeks to maintain its status as a well-capitalized\ninstitution in accordance with regulatory standards.\nThe following table sets forth the Bank’s capital position at September 30, 2024 and June 30, 2024, as compared to the minimum regulatory capital\nrequirements that were in effect as of those dates:\nAt September 30, 2024\nTo Be Well Capitalized\nUnder Prompt\nFor Capital Corrective Action\nActual Adequacy Purposes Provisions\nAmount Ratio Amount Ratio Amount Ratio\n(Dollars in Thousands)\nTotal capital (to risk-weighted assets) $ 697,316 14.48 % $ 385,336 8.00 % $ 481,670 10.00 %\nTier 1 capital (to risk-weighted assets) 655,826 13.62 % 289,002 6.00 % 385,336 8.00 %\nCommon equity tier 1 capital (to risk-weighted assets) 655,826 13.62 % 216,751 4.50 % 313,085 6.50 %\nTier 1 capital (to adjusted total assets) 655,826 8.53 % 307,498 4.00 % 384,372 5.00 %\nAt June 30, 2024\nTo Be Well Capitalized\nUnder Prompt\nFor Capital Corrective Action\nActual Adequacy Purposes Provisions\nAmount Ratio Amount Ratio Amount Ratio\n(Dollars in Thousands)\nTotal capital (to risk-weighted assets) $ 688,597 14.42 % $ 382,034 8.00 % $ 477,542 10.00 %\nTier 1 capital (to risk-weighted assets) 651,620 13.65 % 286,525 6.00 % 382,034 8.00 %\nCommon equity tier 1 capital (to risk-weighted assets) 651,620 13.65 % 214,894 4.50 % 310,402 6.50 %\nTier 1 capital (to adjusted total assets) 651,620 8.44 % 308,656 4.00 % 385,820 5.00 %\n- 39 -\nTable of Contents\nThe following table sets forth the Company’s capital position at September 30, 2024 and June 30, 2024, as compared to the minimum regulatory\ncapital requirements that were in effect as of those dates:\nAt September 30, 2024\nFor Capital\nActual Adequacy Purposes\nAmount Ratio Amount Ratio\n(Dollars in Thousands)\nTotal capital (to risk-weighted assets) $ 745,118 15.46 % $ 385,562 8.00 %\nTier 1 capital (to risk-weighted assets) 703,628 14.60 % 289,171 6.00 %\nCommon equity tier 1 capital (to risk-weighted assets) 703,628 14.60 % 216,878 4.50 %\nTier 1 capital (to adjusted total assets) 703,628 9.14 % 307,891 4.00 %\nAt June 30, 2024\nFor Capital\nActual Adequacy Purposes\nAmount Ratio Amount Ratio\n(Dollars in Thousands)\nTotal capital (to risk-weighted assets) $ 743,741 15.57 % $ 382,247 8.00 %\nTier 1 capital (to risk-weighted assets) 706,764 14.79 % 286,685 6.00 %\nCommon equity tier 1 capital (to risk-weighted assets) 706,764 14.79 % 215,014 4.50 %\nTier 1 capital (to adjusted total assets) 706,764 9.15 % 309,031 4.00 %\nIn March 2020, the federal banking agencies announced an interim final rule to delay the estimated impact on regulatory capital stemming from the\nimplementation of CECL. The interim final rule provides banks the option to delay for two years an estimate of CECL’s effect on regulatory capital, relative to\nthe incurred loss method, followed by a three-year transition period established in the previous rule (five-year transition option). We have adopted the capital\ntransition relief over the permissible five-year period. The two-year delay ended for us as of June 30, 2022 and we then began the three-year transition period.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nIn the normal course of our business of investing in loans and securities we are a party to financial instruments with off-balance-sheet risk. These\nfinancial instruments include significant purchase commitments, such as commitments related to capital expenditure plans and commitments to extend credit to\nmeet the financing needs of our customers. We had no significant off-balance sheet commitments for capital expenditures as of September 30, 2024.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nFor a discussion of the expected impact of recently issued accounting pronouncements that we have adopted, please refer to Note 3 to the unaudited\nconsolidated financial statements.\n- 40 -\nTable of Contents\nITEM 3.\nQUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURE ABOUT MARKET RISK\nThe majority of our assets and liabilities are sensitive to changes in interest rates and as such, interest rate risk is a significant form of market risk that\nwe must manage. Interest rate risk is generally defined in regulatory nomenclature as the risk to earnings or capital arising from the movement of interest rates\nand arises from several risk factors including re-pricing risk, basis risk, yield curve risk and option risk. We maintain an Asset/Liability Management (“ALM”)\nprogram in order manage our interest rate risk. The program is overseen by the Board of Directors through its Interest Rate Risk Management Committee\nwhich has assigned the responsibility for the operational aspects of the ALM program to our Asset/Liability Management Committee (“ALCO”), which is\ncomprised of various members of the senior and executive management team.\nThe quantitative analysis that we conduct measures interest rate risk from both a capital and earnings perspective. With regard to earnings, movements\nin interest rates and the shape of the yield curve significantly influence the amount of net interest income (“NII”) that we recognize. Movements in market\ninterest rates, and the effect of such movements on the risk factors noted above, significantly influence the spread between the interest earned on our interest-\nearning assets and the interest paid on our interest-bearing liabilities. Our internal interest rate risk analysis calculates the sensitivity of our projected NII over a\none year period utilizing a static balance sheet assumption through which incoming and outgoing asset and liability cash flows are reinvested into similar\ninstruments. Product pricing and earning asset prepayment speeds are appropriately adjusted for each rate scenario.\nWith regard to capital, our internal interest rate risk analysis calculates the sensitivity of our Economic Value of Equity (“EVE”) to movements in\ninterest rates. EVE represents the present value of the expected cash flows from our assets less the present value of the expected cash flows arising from our\nliabilities adjusted for the value of off-balance sheet instruments. EVE attempts to quantify our economic value using a discounted cash flow methodology. The\ndegree to which our EVE changes for any hypothetical interest rate scenario from its base case measurement is a reflection of our sensitivity to interest rate\nrisk.\nFor both earnings and capital at risk, our interest rate risk analysis calculates a base case scenario that assumes no change in interest rates. The model\nthen measures changes throughout a series of interest rate scenarios representing immediate and permanent, parallel shifts in the yield curve up and down 100,\n200 and 300 basis points with additional scenarios modeled where appropriate. The model requires that interest rates remain positive for all points along the\nyield curve for each rate scenario which may preclude the modeling of certain falling rate scenarios during periods of lower market interest rates.\nThe following tables present the results of our internal EVE and NII analyses as of September 30, 2024 and June 30, 2024, respectively:\nSeptember 30, 2024\n1 to 12 Months 13 to 24 Months\n% Change % Change % Change\nChange in Interest Rates EVE in EVE NII in NII NII in NII\n(Dollars in Thousands)\n+300 bps $ 337,481 (41.13)% $ 130,861 (7.30)% $ 137,642 (11.30)%\n+200 bps 409,658 (28.54)% 133,714 (5.28)% 142,909 (7.91)%\n+100 bps 493,835 (13.86)% 137,077 (2.90)% 149,484 (3.67)%\n0 bps 573,301 — 141,164 — 155,178 —\n-100 bps 642,587 12.09 % 145,963 3.40 % 161,207 3.89 %\n-200 bps 688,422 20.08 % 147,303 4.35 % 163,562 5.40 %\n-300 bps 750,729 30.95 % 149,611 5.98 % 166,197 7.10 %\nJune 30, 2024\n1 to 12 Months 13 to 24 Months\n% Change % Change % Change\nChange in Interest Rates EVE in EVE NII in NII NII in NII\n(Dollars in Thousands)\n+300 bps $ 331,842 (41.07)% $ 127,382 (8.51)% $ 135,753 (10.66)%\n+200 bps 400,548 (28.87)% 131,003 (5.91)% 140,351 (7.64)%\n+100 bps 483,724 (14.10)% 135,289 (2.83)% 146,594 (3.53)%\n0 bps 563,098 — 139,236 — 151,955 —\n-100 bps 640,024 13.66 % 144,991 4.13 % 157,821 3.86 %\n-200 bps 693,495 23.16 % 148,189 6.43 % 159,928 5.25 %\n-300 bps 767,451 36.29 % 150,478 8.07 % 160,093 5.36 %\n- 41 -\nTable of Contents\nThere are numerous internal and external factors that may contribute to changes in our EVE and its sensitivity. Changes in the composition and\nallocation of our balance sheet, or utilization of off-balance sheet instruments such as derivatives, can significantly alter the exposure to interest rate risk as\nquantified by the changes in the EVE sensitivity measures. Changes to certain external factors, most notably changes in the level of market interest rates and\noverall shape of the yield curve, can also alter the projected cash flows of our interest-earning assets and interest-costing liabilities and the associated present\nvalues thereof.\nNotwithstanding the rate change scenarios presented in the EVE and NII-based analyses above, future interest rates and their effect on net interest\nincome are not predictable. Computations of prospective effects of hypothetical interest rate changes are based on numerous assumptions, including relative\nlevels of market interest rates, prepayments and deposit run-offs and should not be relied upon as indicative of actual results. Certain shortcomings are inherent\nin this type of computation. Although certain assets and liabilities may have similar maturities or periods of re-pricing, they may react at different times and in\ndifferent degrees to changes in market interest rates. The interest rate on certain types of assets and liabilities, such as demand deposits and savings accounts,\nmay fluctuate in advance of changes in market interest rates, while rates on other types of assets and liabilities may lag behind changes in market interest rates.\nCertain assets, such as adjustable-rate mortgages, generally have features which restrict changes in interest rates on a short-term basis and over the life of the\nasset. In the event of a change in interest rates, prepayments and early withdrawal levels could deviate significantly from those assumed in the analyses set\nforth above. Additionally, an increase in credit risk may result as the ability of borrowers to service their debt may decrease in the event of an interest rate\nincrease.\nITEM 4.\nCONTROLS AND PROCEDURES\nAs of the end of the period covered by this Report, an evaluation was performed under the supervision and with the participation of the Company’s\nmanagement, including the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company’s\ndisclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended).

(the “Company”) pursuant to the “safe\nharbor” provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, such as\nstatements of the Company’s plans, objectives, expectations, estimates and intentions that are subject to change based on various important factors (some of which\nare beyond the Company’s control). In addition to the factors described under Item 1A. Risk Factors in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K, and subsequent\nfilings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, the following factors, among others, could cause the Company’s financial performance to differ materially from\nthe plans, objectives, expectations, estimates and intentions expressed in such forward-looking statements:\n• the strength of the United States economy in general and the strength of the local economy in which the Company conducts operations,\n• the effects of and changes in, trade, monetary and fiscal policies and laws, including interest rate policies of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve\nSystem, inflation, interest rates, market and monetary fluctuations,\n• the impact of changes in laws, regulations and government policies regarding financial institutions (including laws concerning taxation, banking, securities and\ninsurance),\n• changes in accounting policies and practices, as may be adopted by regulatory agencies, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) or the Public\nCompany Accounting Oversight Board,\n• technological changes,\n• competition among financial services providers, and\n• the success of the Company at managing the risks involved in the foregoing and managing its business.\nThe Company cautions that the foregoing list of important factors is not exhaustive. Readers should not place any undue reliance on any forward looking statements,\nwhich speak only as of the date made. The Company does not undertake any obligation to update any forward-looking statement, whether written or oral, that may\nbe made from time to time by or on behalf of the Company.\nThis presentation contains financial information determined by methods other than in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States\nof America (“GAAP”). Management uses these “non-GAAP” measures in its analysis of the Company’s performance. Management believes these non-GAAP financial\nmeasures allow for better comparability of period to period operating performance. Additionally, the Company believes this information is utilized by regulators and\nmarket analysts to evaluate a company’s financial condition and therefore, such information is useful to investors.

Taking into account our performance, stockholder feedback\nand our compensation best-practices, the Compensation Committee took the following actions concerning\nthe compensation of the NEOs:\n• Base Salaries: The Committee approved 3% increases for the NEOs effective July 1, 2023.\n• Executive Management Incentive Program: Each of the NEOs participated in the Executive\nManagement Incentive Program. For fiscal year 2024, cash incentive opportunities were\nsignificantly reduced in anticipation of challenging market conditions. Consistent with our\nfinancial performance, incentive payouts were below target ranging between 82% and 85% of the\nreduced target opportunities.\n• Long-Term Equity Awards: Each of the NEOs received an equity grant during fiscal year 2024,\nwith 50% in performance-based and 50% in time-based restricted stock units.\n“Say on Pay” Vote. On October 26, 2023, stockholders voted on a non-binding resolution to\napprove the compensation for the NEOs, commonly referred to as a “say on pay” vote. The resolution\nwas approved with a 96.45% affirmative vote, demonstrating strong support of the Compensation\nCommittee’s executive pay decisions. We received over 95% vote in favor of our executive compensation\nin each of the last five years.\nCompensation Best Practices.

Our compensation philosophy is driven by the\nfollowing guiding principles that reinforce the critical connections between business performance,\nstockholder value creation and senior leadership:\n• Pay for Performance: A substantial portion of a NEO’s total compensation should be variable\nand contingent upon the attainment of certain specific and measurable annual- and long-term\nbusiness performance objectives.\n• Stockholder Alignment: Executives should be compensated through a mix of components (base\nsalaries, annual- and long-term incentives) designed to create long-term value for our\nstockholders, as well as foster a culture of ownership.\n• Competitiveness: Target compensation is set at a level that is competitive with that being offered\nto individuals holding similar positions at other organizations with which we compete for\nbusiness and talent.\n• Attraction and Retention: The executive compensation program should enable Kearny Bank to\nretain superior executive talent, as well as attract additional top-tier leadership.\n___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\nKEARNY FINANCIAL CORP. – 2024 Proxy Statement 27\nThe Principal Components of Compensation. Our compensation philosophy is supported by the\nfollowing principal components in our executive compensation program.\nCompensation Component Form Purpose\nBase Salary Cash (Fixed) Provide a fixed level of pay that recognizes the\nNEO’s scope of responsibilities, skills, performance\nand experience for the value of his or her role.\nExecutive Management Incentive Cash (Variable) Motivate and reward NEOs for achieving annual\nProgram Company, business unit and individual goals that\nsupport the long-term strategic plan.\nLong-Term Equity Awards Equity (Variable) Provide incentives for NEOs to execute on longer-\nterm financial/strategic growth goals that drive\nstockholder value creation and support the\nCompany’s retention strategy.\nThe Decision-Making Process. The Compensation Committee oversees the executive\ncompensation program for the NEOs. The Compensation Committee is comprised of independent, non-\nemployee members of our Board of Directors. The Compensation Committee works closely with its\nindependent consultant and management to examine the effectiveness of the Company’s executive\ncompensation program throughout the year and when considering and making any material long term\nequity awards. Details of the Compensation Committee’s authority and responsibilities are specified in\nthe Compensation Committee’s charter, which is available through the Investor Relations link located at\nthe bottom of our website at www.kearnybank.com.\nThe Role of the Compensation Committee. The Compensation Committee reviews all\ncompensation and awards to the NEOs. The Compensation Committee utilizes publicly available\ninformation to gather data related to compensation practices for executive officers of financial services\ncompanies in order to determine market competitive levels of compensation as well as reviewing internal\npay levels within the executive group.\nThe Compensation Committee considers a variety of factors as it evaluates compensation for each\nofficer including:\n• the Company’s overall financial performance as compared to budget and prior year’s\nperformance;\n• bank regulatory compliance and examination results;\n• the Company’s performance metrics compared to other financial services companies in our\nmarket area, including return on assets, loan and deposit growth, level of non-performing loans,\nand other risk management metrics; and\n• the individual achievements of each officer in their respective areas of responsibility; and the\nmarket competitiveness of the Company’s compensation and benefits programs applicable to its\nexecutive management group.\nThe Compensation Committee also considers the potential risks to which the incentive\ncompensation programs may expose the Company, and the established policies, controls and procedures\nof the Company and Kearny Bank that exist to protect against such risks to the Company (See\n“Compensation Risk Assessment”).\n___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\nKEARNY FINANCIAL CORP. – 2024 Proxy Statement 28\nRole of Management. Upon the request of the Compensation Committee, the CEO may be asked\nto provide input regarding the performance and compensation of his direct reports. The Compensation\nCommittee takes this information under advisement; the Compensation Committee makes its decisions\nindependently and regularly hosts executive sessions. The CEO may not be present during voting or\ndeliberations on his compensation.\nThe Role of the Independent Consultant. The Compensation Committee has the sole authority to\nretain and terminate a compensation consultant and to approve the consultant’s fees and all other terms of\nthe engagement. For the fiscal year ended June 30, 2024, the Compensation Committee retained the\nservices of Pearl Meyer & Partners LLC (“Pearl Meyer”), an independent compensation consulting firm.\nA representative from Pearl Meyer attends the Compensation Committee meetings upon request\nfor the purpose of reviewing compensation data with the Compensation Committee and participating in\ngeneral discussions on compensation for the NEOs and periodically meets with the Compensation\nCommittee without management present. While the Compensation Committee considers input from Pearl\nMeyer when making compensation decisions, the Compensation Committee’s final decisions reflect many\nfactors and considerations.\nPearl Meyer reports directly to the Compensation Committee and provides consulting services to\nthe Committee or under the Committee's direction. The Compensation Committee has analyzed whether\nthe work of Pearl Meyer as a compensation consultant has raised any conflict of interest, taking into\nconsideration the following factors, among others: (i) the provision of other services to the Company by\nPearl Meyer; (ii) the amount of fees from the Company paid to Pearl Meyer as a percentage of Pearl\nMeyer’s total revenue; (iii) Pearl Meyer’s policies and procedures that are designed to prevent conflicts of\ninterest; (iv) any business or personal relationship of Pearl Meyer or the individual compensation advisors\nemployed by Pearl Meyer with an executive officer of the Company; (v) any business or personal\nrelationship of the individual compensation advisors with any member of the Compensation Committee;\nand (vi) any stock of the Company owned by Pearl Meyer or the individual compensation advisors\nemployed by Pearl Meyer. The Compensation Committee has determined, based on its analysis of the\nabove factors, among others, that the work of Pearl Meyer and the individual compensation advisors\nemployed by Pearl Meyer as compensation consultants to the Company has not created any conflict of\ninterest.\nThe Role of Benchmarking. It is the Compensation Committee’s goal to provide the NEOs with a\ntotal compensation package that is both competitive and reflective of the performance achieved by the\nCompany compared to the performance achieved by the Company’s peers. The Compensation Committee\nperiodically considers publicly-available data for informational purposes when making its compensation-\nrelated decisions. However, market data is not the sole determinant of the Company’s practices or\nexecutive compensation levels. When determining base salaries, incentive opportunities and annual equity\ngrants for NEOs, the Compensation Committee also considers the performance of the Company and the\nindividual, the nature of an individual’s role within the Company, as well as experience and contributions\nto his or her current role.\nThe Board and the Compensation Committee considered Pearl Meyer’s most recent executive\ncompensation review, which assisted in providing a market based framework for managing executive pay\npractices. As part of this review and analysis, Pearl Meyer developed the following peer group, which\nconsists of 19 publicly-traded commercial banks with assets between $4 billion and $14.5 billion.\n___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\nKEARNY FINANCIAL CORP. – 2024 Proxy Statement 29\nAmalgamated Financial Corp.

Base salaries for executives and other officers are reviewed by the Compensation\nCommittee on an annual basis. Salaries are reflective of the executive’s job responsibilities, job\nperformance and experience, and the competitive market.\nThe Compensation Committee determined that base salary levels should be adjusted in order to\nbetter align with the market and to recognize the significant efforts of the executive management team. As\na result, the Compensation Committee approved the following adjustments for fiscal year 2024.

All NEOs participate in the Executive Management\nIncentive Program (the “Program”). The Program is designed to recognize and reward executives for their\nannual contribution to Kearny Bank’s performance. Eligibility is limited to executives that have a\nsignificant impact on the success of the Company. The Program is a short-term cash incentive plan that\ndirectly ties annual cash awards to the Company’s performance as achieved across multiple performance\nmeasures. The performance measures and goals are defined each year and approved by the Compensation\nCommittee.\n___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\nKEARNY FINANCIAL CORP. – 2024 Proxy Statement 30\nPerformance Gates\nIn order to ensure that incentive payments are tied to performance achievement, the\nCompensation Committee has established performance gates tied to Net Income and annualized net\ncharge-off to average loans (“NCOs”).\nConsequence if Performance Gate\nPerformance Gate Not Achieved Actual Achievement Level\nNet Income at least 50% of Target No payments are made under the Achieved - Adjusted Net Income exceeded\nProgram 50% of Target\nNCOs below threshold level No payments are made under the Achieved - NCOs fell below threshold level\nProgram\nNet Income at least 75% of Target Payments under the Program will be Achieved -Adjusted Net Income exceeded\nlimited to no more than Target-level 75% of Target\nTarget Incentive Opportunities\nThe table below represents the Target opportunity as a percentage of base salary, and the\ncomponent weightings for each NEO for fiscal year 2024 and 2023 performance:\nFiscal 2024 Fiscal 2023 Component Weightings\nExecutive Target Opportunity Target Opportunity Corporate Individual\nCraig L.

Bilotta, Jr. 20.00% 35.00% 70.00% 30.00%\nAt the beginning of each year, a range of performance is established for each performance metric\n(floor which represents minimally-acceptable performance); target; and cap (which represents exceptional\nperformance). As shown in the table above, for fiscal 2024, the target opportunity was significantly\nreduced in anticipation of lower than expected levels of pre-tax, pre-provision net revenue (“PPNR”) per\nshare relative to the prior year. Results against each range determines the payout opportunity for each\nperformance metric, ranging from 0% (results are below floor) to 150% (results are at or above cap) of\nthe established target.\nCorporate Performance Metrics\nIn calculating the results for PPNR per share and the non-interest expense ratio, the\nCompensation Committee considered whether adjustments to the financial results were warranted due to\nnon-recurring items and determined, after its analysis, that adjustments to the PPNR per share and the\nnon-interest expense ratio were necessary for fiscal year 2024 to capture the Company’s core performance\nmore appropriately.\nAs a result, the Compensation Committee adjusted net income for non-recurring items. Please see\npage 33 for a detailed breakout of these adjustments and their impact on PPNR per share and the adjusted\nnon-interest expense ratio.\nThe Corporate component of the Program representing 80% of the CEO and CFO's total incentive\nopportunity and 70% for other NEOs is based on adjusted PPNR per share weighted at 70% and adjusted\nnon-interest expense ratio weighted at 30%.\n___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\nKEARNY FINANCIAL CORP. – 2024 Proxy Statement 31\nThe table below lists the performance measures in each Corporate category, the goal at target and\nthe actual results, for fiscal year 2024:\nEarned % of\nCorporate Performance Metrics Target Actual(1) Target Goal\nPPNR Per Share $0.75 $0.63 84.00%\nNon-interest Expense Ratio 1.51% 1.49% 100.75%\n______________________\n(1) The PPNR per share and Non-interest expense ratio presented include adjustments to the Company’s GAAP net income approved by\nthe Compensation Committee for purposes of this performance calculation.

The 2021 Plan provides incentives for\nexecutives to execute on longer-term performance goals that drive stockholder value creation, with an\nemphasis on performance-based vesting for restricted stock units. It also supports the Company’s\nleadership retention strategy. For the fiscal year ended June 30, 2024, each NEO received an equity grant\nunder the 2021 Plan on August 7, 2023.\nAs a result of the stockholders’ approval of the 2021 Plan, the 2016 Plan is frozen and equity\nawards that would otherwise be available for grant under the 2016 Plan will not be granted. The\nCompensation Committee will continue to administer outstanding grants under the 2016 Plan. All awards\ngranted during fiscal 2024 and described in this section are subject to the requirements stated in the\nfollowing table:\n___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\nKEARNY FINANCIAL CORP. – 2024 Proxy Statement 33\n2021 Equity Incentive Plan\nPercentage of\nType of Equity Award Overview\nPerformance – 50% of all • Awards vest at the end of a three-year performance period\nBased Restricted restricted stock\n(June 30, 2024 - June 30, 2026).\nStock Units unit awards\n• Vesting depends on the achievement of pre-tax, pre-\nprovision earnings per share (EPS) goals measured over a\nthree-year period.\n• A performance gate has been established whereby the\nawards will vest only if annualized net charge-offs to\naverage loans (“NCOs”) over the performance period are\nequal to or below 0.50%.\n• The number of shares that can be earned range from 0% to\n150% of the target depending on performance and will be\ndetermined at the end of the performance period.\nTime-Based 50% of all • Vesting: Awards vest 33% per year over a three-year\nRestricted Stock restricted stock\nperiod commencing on August 7, 2024.\nUnits unit awards\n• Paid in Company shares at vesting.\n___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\nKEARNY FINANCIAL CORP. – 2024 Proxy Statement 34\n2024 Long-Term Equity Incentive Award Grants.

The Board of Directors believes that it is in the best interest of the\nCompany and its stockholders to align the financial interests of its executive officers and directors with\nthose of stockholders. Accordingly, the Company's stock ownership guidelines for NEOs and Directors of\nthe Company require the following minimum investment in Company common stock:\nPosition Guideline\nCEO A number of shares having a market value equal to three times (3.0x) annual base salary\nAll Other NEOs A number of shares having a market value equal to two times (2.0x) annual base salary\nNon-Employee A number of shares having a market value equal to three times (3.0x) annual cash retainer\nDirectors (excluding any committee fees)\nNewly appointed Named Executive Officers and Directors have five years from the time they are\nappointed, promoted or elected, as the case may be, to meet these guidelines. In order to expedite this\nprocess, a minimum of fifty percent (50%) of shares (net of taxes) acquired through the Company’s\nequity incentive plan(s) will be required to be held upon each vesting until the stock ownership guidelines\nare met. For the purpose of determining if the stock ownership guidelines are met, unvested performance\nshares and unexercised stock options (whether vested or non-vested) will not be considered. Stock\nownership for NEOs and Directors is reviewed on an annual basis and the Nominating and Corporate\nGovernance Committee maintains responsibility for the administration of this policy. The NEOs and\nDirectors comply with the Company’s stock ownership guidelines within the approved grace period to\nsatisfy the stock ownership guidelines.\n___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\nKEARNY FINANCIAL CORP. – 2024 Proxy Statement 35\n“Claw-Back” Policies. The Board of Directors has adopted a clawback policy that complies with\nThe NASDAQ Stock Market listing standards as mandated by the SEC. The policy requires the clawback\nof incentive-based compensation erroneously received by current or former executive officers after an\naccounting restatement (calculated based on an error that was subsequently corrected in the accounting\nrestatement), regardless of any misconduct or knowledge of the officer who received the compensation.\nThis policy is intended to supplement any other clawback provisions implemented by the Company in\neffect now, or in the future. In addition to the Securities and Exchange Commission compliant clawback\npolicy, equity awards granted to executives under the 2021 Plan are generally subject to clawback if the\nCompany is required to prepare an accounting restatement due to the material noncompliance of the\nCompany, as a result of misconduct, with any financial reporting requirement under the federal securities\nlaws, and the automatic forfeiture provisions under Section 304 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 apply\nas a result. The equity awards granted under the 2021 Plan are also subject to cancellation upon a\ntermination of employment for cause.\nAnti-Hedging and Pledging Policy. Please see the disclosure provided above under the section\nentitled “Employee, Officer and Director Hedging.”\nRetirement Income. The NEOs are eligible to participate in benefit plans available to all\nemployees, including the 401(k) Plan and the ESOP. Each NEO also participates in the related ESOP\nBenefits Equalization Plan, which provides benefits that would otherwise be limited under the ESOP due\nto IRS limits, and certain NEOs participate in the frozen Kearny Bank defined benefit pension plan and\nthe frozen Benefits Equalization Plan related to the defined benefit plan (each of which have been frozen\nas of July 1, 2007 so that future service or salary changes will not increase retirement benefits).\nCompensation Risk Assessment. During the fiscal year 2024, senior management conducted an\nupdated Compensation Risk Assessment that was reviewed by the Compensation Committee and\nconcluded the Company’s compensation policies and practices do not create risks that are reasonably\nlikely to have a material adverse effect on the Company.\nTax Deductibility of Executive Compensation. Prior to the implementation of the Tax Cuts and\nJobs Act of 2017 (the “Tax Cuts Act”), Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code generally\ndisallowed a federal income tax deduction for compensation over $1.0 million paid for any fiscal year to\nour President and Chief Executive Officer and specified other executive officers, subject to certain\nexceptions such as “performance-based” compensation. As a result of the Tax Cuts Act, the Company\nmay no longer take an annual deduction for any compensation paid to its NEOs in excess of $1.0 million\nper NEO. Due to the continued importance and benefit to the Company and our stockholders of awarding\ncompensation that is structured to properly incentivize our executive officers, the Compensation\nCommittee believes that it is in our best interests to retain flexibility in awarding compensation, even if\nsome awards may be non-deductible compensation expense to the Company.\nPractices Related to the Grant of Equity Awards. Under the Company's practices, the approval of\nlong-term equity incentive compensation for the Company's regular annual equity awards is typically\nmade on the same date each year, August 7th. Neither the Board of Directors nor the Compensation\nCommittee take into account material non-public information when determining the timing or terms of\nequity awards, nor does the Company time disclosure of material non-public information for the purpose\nof affecting the value of executive compensation.\n___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\nKEARNY FINANCIAL CORP. – 2024 Proxy Statement 36\nCompensation Committee Report\nThe Compensation Committee has reviewed and discussed with management the Compensation\nDiscussion and Analysis that is required by the rules established by the Securities and Exchange\nCommission. Based on such review and discussion, the Compensation Committee recommended to the\nBoard of Directors that the Compensation Discussion and Analysis be included in this Proxy Statement\nand incorporated into the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30,\n2024.\nThis Compensation Committee Report shall not be deemed incorporated by reference by any\ngeneral statement incorporating by reference this Proxy Statement into any filing under the Securities Act\nof 1933, as amended, or the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, other than the Company’s\nAnnual Report on Form 10-K, where it shall be deemed to be “furnished,” and shall not otherwise be\ndeemed “soliciting material” or to be “filed” with the Securities and Exchange Commission under such\nActs.\nCompensation Committee: Theodore J.

) 41\n2021 Equity Incentive Plan. Stockholders of the Company approved the 2021 Plan at our 2021\nAnnual Meeting of Stockholders. Under the 2021 Plan, individuals may receive awards of restricted stock\nand grants of stock options to purchase shares of Company common stock at a specified exercise price\nduring a specified time period. The 2021 Plan provides for a total share reserve of 7,500,000 shares (the\n“Share Limit”); provided, however, that the Share Limit is reduced, on a one-for-one basis, for each share\nof common stock subject to a stock option grant, and on a three-for-one basis for each share of common\nstock issued pursuant to restricted stock awards or restricted stock unit awards.\nThe Compensation Committee believes that stock ownership provides a significant incentive in\nbuilding stockholder value by further aligning the interests of our officers and employees with\nstockholders because such compensation is directly linked to the performance of Company common\nstock. This element of compensation increases in importance as the Company common stock appreciates\nin value and serves as a retention tool for executives. The inclusion of performance-based vesting awards\nalso encourages long-term strategic focus of our executives.\nThe 2021 Plan is administered by the Compensation Committee. The Compensation Committee\nhas the authority and discretion to select the persons who will receive awards; establish the terms and\nconditions relating to each award; adopt rules and regulations relating to the 2021 Plan; and interpret the\n2021 Plan. The 2021 Plan also permits the Compensation Committee to delegate all or any portion of its\nresponsibilities and powers.\nThe Company’s employees and outside directors are eligible to receive awards under the 2021\nPlan. Awards may be granted in a combination of restricted stock awards, restricted stock units, incentive\nstock options, and non-qualified stock options. The exercise price of stock options granted under the 2021\nPlan may not be less than the fair market value on the date the stock option is granted. Stock options are\nsubject to vesting conditions and restrictions as determined by the Compensation Committee. No\ndividends will be paid with respect to any stock award subject to performance-vesting conditions unless\nand until the performance conditions are met and vesting occurs, and only on that portion of the stock\naward that actually vests.\nAll restricted stock, restricted stock units and stock option grants will be subject to conditions\nestablished by the Compensation Committee that are set forth in the award agreement. Awards granted\nunder the 2021 Plan will vest upon death, disability, or involuntary termination of employment or service\nfollowing a change in control (as such terms are defined in the 2021 Plan).\nOption Exercises and Stock Vested. The following table sets forth information regarding the\nvesting of restricted stock awards, restricted stock units and stock option exercises for each NEO during\nthe fiscal year ended June 30, 2024.\nOption Awards Stock Awards\nNumber of Number of\nShares Acquired Value Realized on Shares Acquired Value Realized\nName on Exercise (#) Exercise ($) on Vesting (#) on Vesting(1) ($)\nCraig L.

The amount of dividends paid on such\nvested shares are included as compensation for the individual in the Summary Compensation Table.\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\nKEARNY FINANCIAL CORP. – 2024 Proxy Statement 42\nFrozen Pension Plan. Kearny Bank is a participating employer in a multiple-employer pension plan\nsponsored by the Pentegra Defined Benefit Plan for Financial Institutions (the “Pension Plan”), and effective\nJuly 1, 2007, Kearny Bank froze all future enrollments and benefit accruals under the Pension Plan and\nrelated benefits equalization plan. The Pension Plan provides for monthly payments to each participating\nemployee at normal retirement age. A participant who is vested in the Pension Plan may take an early\nretirement and elect to receive a reduced monthly benefit beginning as early as age 45. The Pension Plan also\nprovides for payments in the event of disability or death. The annual benefit amount upon retirement at age 65\nequals 2% of the participant’s highest five-year average salary times years of service determined as of June\n30, 2007. Benefits are payable in the form of a monthly retirement benefit and a death benefit or an alternative\nform that is actuarially equivalent.\nFrozen Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan. Kearny Bank entered into a supplemental\nexecutive retirement plan with Mr. Montanaro, which was frozen by amendment in 2022 (the “SERP”). The\nSERP, which is a nonqualified deferred compensation plan subject to Section 409A of the Internal Revenue\nCode of 1986, as amended, provides for a lump sum payment following a termination of the executive’s\nemployment. If the executive dies prior to termination of employment, the SERP will not pay any benefits to\nthe executive’s beneficiary and instead the executive’s beneficiary will receive a death benefit under the\namended and restated executive life insurance agreement, effective as of July 1, 2022, entered into between\nKearny Bank and the executive.\nThe following table provides information with respect to the payments that each NEO may\nreceive following, or in connection with retirement, under the Pension Plan and SERP as of June 30,\n2024.\nNumber of Full Present\nYears Value of Payments\nCredited Accumulated During Last\nName Plan Name Service Benefit(1) ($) Fiscal Year ($)\nCraig L.

Accordingly, the number of years of credited service are unchanged from the prior year.\n(3) On December 21, 2022, Kearny Bank and Mr. Montanaro entered into an amendment to freeze the SERP to provide that no\nadditional benefits will accrue on the executive’s behalf after December 31, 2022.\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\nKEARNY FINANCIAL CORP. – 2024 Proxy Statement 43\nESOP.

In 2005, the ESOP borrowed funds from the Company pursuant to a loan and\nused those funds to purchase 1,745,700 shares of common stock for the ESOP in connection with the\nCompany’s initial public offering (the “2005 Loan”). In connection with the completion of the second-\nstep stock offering and conversion on May 18, 2015, the ESOP purchased an additional 3,612,500 shares\nof Company common stock. The ESOP funded its stock purchase with a loan from the Company equal to\nthe aggregate purchase price of the common stock and the outstanding balance of the 2005 Loan (the\n2005 Loan was refinanced into the new ESOP plan). This loan will be repaid principally through Kearny\nBank’s contribution to the ESOP and dividends payable on the common stock held by the ESOP over the\n20-year term of the loan. The interest rate for the ESOP loan is 3.25%.\nShares purchased by the ESOP are held in an unallocated suspense account, and shares will be\nallocated to the participants’ accounts as the loan is repaid on a pro-rata basis. The trustee will allocate the\nshares released among the participants’ accounts on the basis of each participant’s proportional share of\neligible plan compensation relative to all participants’ proportional share of eligible plan compensation.\nVested benefits will be payable generally upon the participants’ termination of employment, and\nwill be paid generally in the form of cash or Company stock, or both. Pursuant to FASB ASC Topic\n718-40, the Company will record a compensation expense each year in an amount equal to the fair market\nvalue of the shares released from the unallocated suspense account.\n401(k) Plan. Kearny Bank maintains a 401(k) Plan, a tax-qualified defined contribution\nretirement plan, for all employees who have satisfied the 401(k) Plan’s eligibility requirements. All\neligible employees can begin participation in the 401(k) Plan on the first day of the month coinciding with\nor following the date on which the employee attains age 21 and has completed three months of service\nand 250 hours of service. A participant may contribute up to 75% of his or her compensation to the 401(k)\nPlan on a pre-tax basis, subject to the limitations imposed by the Internal Revenue Code. For 2024, the\nsalary deferral contribution limit is $23,000, provided, however, that a participant over age 50 may\ncontribute an additional $7,500 to the 401(k) Plan. In addition to salary deferral contributions, the 401(k)\nPlan provides that Kearny Bank will make an employer matching contribution equal to 100% of a\nparticipant’s salary deferral contribution, provided that such amount does not exceed 1% of a participant’s\ncompensation, plus 50% of a participant’s salary deferral contribution that exceeds 1% but does not\nexceed 6% of a participant’s compensation earned during the plan year. A participant is always 100%\nvested in his or her salary deferral contributions and employer matching contributions. Each participant\nhas an individual account under the 401(k) Plan and may direct the investment of his or her account\namong a variety of investment options or vehicles available.\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\nKEARNY FINANCIAL CORP. – 2024 Proxy Statement 44\nNonqualified Deferred Compensation. Kearny Bank has implemented a Benefits Equalization\nPlan related to the ESOP. This plan constitutes a defined contribution plan providing for deferral of\ncompensation on a non-tax-qualified basis. The purpose of this plan is to provide a benefit to senior\nexecutives of Kearny Bank whose benefits under the ESOP are limited by Sections 401(a)(17) and 415 of\nthe Internal Revenue Code. For example, this plan provides participants with a benefit for any\ncompensation that they may earn in excess of $345,000 (for 2024, as indexed), comparable to the benefits\nearned by all participants under the ESOP for compensation earned below that level. Kearny Bank may\nutilize a grantor trust in connection with this plan in order to set aside funds that ultimately may be used\nto pay benefits under the plan. The assets of the grantor trust will remain subject to the claims of Kearny\nBank’s general creditors in the event of insolvency, until paid to a participant following termination of\nemployment according to the terms of the plan. Benefits under the plan will be paid in a lump sum in the\nform of shares of common stock to the extent permissible under applicable regulations, or in the\nalternative, benefits will be paid in cash based upon the value of such shares at the time that such benefit\npayments are made. The actual value of benefits under this plan and the annual financial reporting\nexpense associated with this plan are calculated annually based upon a variety of factors, including the\nactual value of benefits for participants determined under the ESOP each year, the applicable limitations\nunder the Internal Revenue Code that are subject to adjustment annually and the compensation of each\nparticipant at such time. Generally, benefits under the plan are taxable to each participant at the time of\nreceipt of such payment, and Kearny Bank will recognize a tax-deductible compensation expense at such\ntime.\nThe following table sets forth information with respect to NEOs with accumulated benefits under\nthe Benefits Equalization Plan related to the ESOP as of June 30, 2024.\nExecutive Company\nContributions Contributions in Aggregate Aggregate Aggregate\nIn Last Fiscal Last Fiscal Year(1) Gain/Loss in Last Withdrawals/ Balance at Last\nName Year ($) ($) Fiscal Year ($) Distributions ($) Fiscal Year End ($)\nCraig L.

Kearny Bank has entered into employment agreements with Messrs.\nMontanaro, Suchodolski, Joyce and DeMedici and the Company is a party to the agreements solely as a\nguarantor. In addition, the Company has entered into an employment agreement with Mr. Montanaro,\nwhich is substantially identical to the agreement Kearny Bank entered into with Mr. Montanaro, except\nthe compensation payable under Mr. Montanaro’s agreement with the Company is reduced dollar-for-\ndollar for any compensation paid by Kearny Bank. Messrs. Montanaro and Suchodolski’s agreements\nhave a three-year term and Messrs. Joyce and DeMedici’s agreements have a two-year term.\nCommencing on the first anniversary of the agreements (which is defined as July 1 of each calendar year)\nand on each subsequent anniversary thereafter, the agreements may be renewed for an additional year so\nthat the remaining term is three years for Messrs. Montanaro and Suchodolski’s agreements and two years\nfor Messrs. Joyce and DeMedici’s agreements, provided that the disinterested members of the board of\ndirectors of Kearny Bank conduct a performance evaluation of the executive and affirmatively approve\nthe extension.\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\nKEARNY FINANCIAL CORP. – 2024 Proxy Statement 45\nThe current base salaries for Messrs. Montanaro, Suchodolski, Joyce and DeMedici are $746,750,\n$446,664, $374,084 and $358,086, respectively. In addition to base salary, each executive is generally\nentitled to participate in welfare benefit plans and other benefit plans applicable to senior management of\nKearny Bank. Upon the termination of an executive’s employment at any time on or after attainment of\nage 62 and until the executive becomes eligible for Medicare coverage, the executive is eligible to receive\nreimbursement for participation in medical coverage comparable to coverage under Kearny Bank’s plan.\nIn the event of the executive’s involuntary termination of employment for reasons other than\ncause, disability or death, the executive is entitled to a severance payment equal to the executive’s base\nsalary for the remaining term of the agreement, payable in a lump sum within 10 days of the executive’s\ntermination of employment, and continued medical and dental coverage for generally the remaining term\nof the agreement. In the event the executive voluntarily resigns during the term of the employment\nagreement for “good reason” (as defined in the agreement), the executive is entitled to a severance\npayment equal to the executive’s annual base salary, payable in a lump sum within ten days of the\nexecutive’s termination of employment.\nIn the event of a change in control of the Company or Kearny Bank followed within 24 months\nby the executive’s involuntary termination of employment for any reason other than cause or the\nexecutive’s termination for good reason, then in lieu of the severance benefits described immediately\nabove, Mr. Montanaro is entitled to a severance benefit equal to 2.999 times his prior five-year average\nannual taxable compensation, Mr. Joyce is entitled to a severance benefit equal to two times the total\ncompensation earned during the most recently completed calendar year ending on or prior to the date of\nthe termination of employment, Mr. DeMedici is entitled to a severance benefit equal to two times the\nsum of (i) the executive’s base salary in effect as of the date of termination, plus (ii) two times the greater\nof (a) the highest annual cash incentive earned in the two calendar years immediately prior to the year in\nwhich the termination occurs, or (b) the annual cash incentive at target that would be payable to the\nexecutive in the year of termination if all performance-related conditions were satisfied, and Mr.\nSuchodolski is entitled to a severance benefit equal to three times the sum of (i) the executive’s base\nsalary in effect as of the date of termination, or if higher, the base salary immediately prior to the date of a\nchange in control, plus (ii) the bonus earned by the executive in the fiscal year immediately preceding the\nyear in which the date of the termination occurs, or if higher, the bonus earned in the fiscal year\nimmediately preceding the date of a change in control. In addition, the executives are entitled to continued\nparticipation in medical and dental coverage for generally the remaining term of the agreement. The\nCompany and Kearny Bank determined that it would no longer enter into employment agreements that\nprovide for change in control severance based on a multiple of average annual taxable compensation or\ntotal compensation; however, the employment agreements with Messrs. Montanaro and Joyce were\nentered into before the Company adopted this position. Accordingly, the Company’s most recent\nemployment agreement, which was entered into with Mr. Suchodolski in 2022 as described above,\nprovides for change in control severance based on a multiple of base salary and bonus.\nUpon any termination of employment (except following a change in control), the executives will\neach be required to adhere to non-competition and non-solicitation covenants for six months.\nFor quantification of the amounts that would be payable to each executive under their respective\nemployment agreement in connection with a qualifying termination of employment, see the section\nentitled “Potential Payments Upon Termination or Change in Control” below.\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\nKEARNY FINANCIAL CORP. – 2024 Proxy Statement 46\nChange in Control Agreement. Kearny Bank has entered into a change in control agreement with\nMr. Bilotta, which provides, in the event of a change in control of the Company or Kearny Bank followed\nwithin 24 months by his involuntary termination of employment for any reason other than cause or Mr.\nBilotta’s termination for good reason, a severance payment generally equal to two times his annual base\nsalary in effect as of the date of termination plus two times the bonus earned in the fiscal year\nimmediately preceding the date of a change in control, payable in a lump sum within ten days of his\ntermination of employment, and continued participation in medical and dental coverage for generally two\nyears. For quantification of the amount that would be payable to Mr. Bilotta under his change in control\nagreement in connection with a qualifying termination of employment, see the section entitled “Potential\nPayments Upon Termination or Change in Control” below.\nExecutive Life Insurance Agreements. Kearny Bank is party to an amended and restated\nexecutive life insurance agreement with Mr. Montanaro and executive life insurance agreements with\nMessrs. Suchodolski, Joyce and DeMedici pursuant to which Kearny Bank has purchased life insurance\npolicies on behalf of the executives. Under the amended and restated executive life insurance agreement\nwith Mr. Montanaro, in the event Mr. Montanaro dies while employed by the Bank, his beneficiary will\nbe entitled to a death benefit, which is based on his age at death and as specified in the agreement. If Mr.\nMontanaro dies after retirement, (as defined in the agreement), his beneficiary will be entitled to a death\nbenefit in the aggregate amount equal to two hundred percent (200%) times Mr. Montanaro’s highest\nannual base salary (not including bonus, equity compensation, deferred compensation or any other forms\nof compensation) at any time during the three calendar years prior to the date of retirement, plus\n$100,000. However, the maximum death benefit to be paid in the event of Mr. Montanaro’s death after\nretirement is $1.5 million. In the event of a change of control (as defined in the agreement) prior to Mr.\nMontanaro’s termination of employment or retirement, the death benefit under the agreement shall remain\nin effect, until Mr. Montanaro’s death.\nUnder the executive life insurance agreement with Mr. Joyce, Mr. Joyce’s beneficiary is entitled\nto a death benefit equal to two times the executive’s highest annual base salary in effect during the three\ncalendar years prior to death, plus an additional one hundred thousand dollars, if the executive dies while\nemployed by Kearny Bank or, a death benefit equal to two times the executive’s highest annual base\nsalary in effect during the three calendar years prior to retirement plus an additional one hundred thousand\ndollars, if the executive is retired at the time of death and meets certain age and service requirements. The\nmaximum death benefit, however, may not exceed $1.5 million. In the event of a change in control of\nKearny Bank prior to the executive’s death or retirement, the death benefit shall remain in effect,\nregardless of whether the age and service requirements have been met. The executive life insurance\nagreement with Messrs. Suchodolski and DeMedici are similar to Mr. Joyce’s agreement, except that in\nthe case of the executive’s termination of employment, for any reason, the benefit to the executives would\ncease. Mr. Bilotta is covered under a group term life insurance policy which provides for coverage in the\namount of two times his base salary during his employment with Kearny Bank.\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\nKEARNY FINANCIAL CORP. – 2024 Proxy Statement 47\nPotential Payments Upon Termination or Change in Control.

Suchodolski, Joyce, DeMedici and Bilotta’s agreements provide that change in control severance payments will be reduced, to the\nextent necessary, to avoid a loss of deductibility under Section 280G of the Internal Revenue Code and imposition of excise taxes on the\nnamed executive officer under Section 4999 of the Internal Revenue Code. The estimated severance payment amounts are based on multiple\nassumptions that may or may not actually occur and the amounts shown above did not need to be reduced to preserve deductibility under\nSection 280G of the Internal Revenue Code.\n(3) The death benefit includes the amount payable under each individual’s Executive Life Insurance Agreement and a death benefit of $50,000\npayable under Kearny Bank’s group term life insurance plan. Mr. Bilotta is not covered by an Executive Life Insurance Agreement and his\nbeneficiary is entitled to a death benefit under the group term life insurance plan in the amount of $687,000.\n(4) This amount represents the value of unvested restricted stock that become fully vested upon certain events, including death, disability and\nan involuntary termination, other than for cause, or termination for good reason following a change in control of the Company.\n(5) Each executive is also covered by a long-term disability plan which, if payable, provides a monthly benefit of sixty percent (60%) of base\nsalary, with a maximum benefit of $15,000 per month.\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\nKEARNY FINANCIAL CORP. – 2024 Proxy Statement 49\n2024 CEO Pay Ratio\nIn accordance with the applicable provisions of Section 953(b) of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street\nReform and Consumer Protection Act, and Item 402 (u) of Regulation S-K, we are providing the\nfollowing information about the relationship of the median of the annual total compensation of all\nemployees of our Company (excluding the President and Chief Executive Officer) and the annual total\ncompensation of our President and Chief Executive Officer.\nFor the fiscal year ended June 30, 2024, our median annual total compensation for all employees\nother than our President and Chief Executive Officer was $83,935. The annual total compensation for our\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer for the same period was $1,396,533. The ratio of our CEO’s\ncompensation to the median employee’s compensation was 17 to 1.\nWe reviewed the individual selected as our median employee for fiscal year ended June 30, 2022\nand used that incumbent for this year’s analysis as well, consistent with regulatory guidelines. In making\nthis selection, we reviewed the employee’s job and compensation history to ensure that they continued to\nbe appropriate for this reporting. In completing our analysis, we also reviewed our entire workforce to\ndetermine annualized gross pay plus the value of employer contributions to the Kearny Bank 401(k) Plan,\nKearny Bank Employee Stock Ownership Plan, and Kearny Bank’s contribution to group health insurance\npremiums. We annualized compensation for full-time and part-time permanent employees who were\nemployed less than the full year. No full-time equivalent adjustments were made for part-time employees.\nWe used this methodology to determine the annual total compensation for our median employee\nby calculating total compensation for such employee in accordance with the requirements of Item\n402(c)(2)(x) of Regulation S-K. With regard to the annual total compensation of our President and Chief\nExecutive Officer, we used the amount reported in the “Total” column of our 2024 Summary\nCompensation Table included in this Proxy Statement.\nSEC rules for identifying the median employee and calculating the pay ratio allow companies to\napply various methodologies and various assumptions and, as a result, the pay ratio reported by the\nCompany may not be comparable to the pay ratio reported by other companies.\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\nKEARNY FINANCIAL CORP. – 2024 Proxy Statement 50\nPay versus Performance\nWe are required by SEC rules to disclose the following information regarding compensation paid\nto our NEOs.

(the “Company,” or “Kearny Financial”), is a Maryland corporation that is the holding company\nfor Kearny Bank (the “Bank” or “Kearny Bank”), a nonmember New Jersey-chartered savings bank.\nThe Company is a unitary savings and loan holding company, regulated by the Board of Governors of the Federal\nReserve Bank (“FRB”) and conducts no significant business or operations of its own. The Bank’s deposits are federally insured\nby the Deposit Insurance Fund as administered by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”) and the Bank is primarily\nregulated by the New Jersey Department of Banking and Insurance (“NJDBI”) and, as a nonmember bank, the FDIC. References\nin this Annual Report on Form 10-K to the Company or Kearny Financial generally refer to the Company and the Bank, unless\nthe context indicates otherwise. References to “we,” “us,” or “our” refer to the Bank or Company, or both, as the context\nindicates.\nThe Company’s primary business is the ownership and operation of the Bank. The Bank is principally engaged in the\nbusiness of attracting deposits from the general public and using these deposits, together with other funds, to originate or purchase\nloans for its portfolio and for sale into the secondary market. Our loan portfolio is primarily comprised of loans collateralized by\ncommercial and residential real estate augmented by secured and unsecured loans to businesses and consumers. We also maintain\na portfolio of investment securities, primarily comprised of U.S. agency mortgage-backed securities, obligations of state and\npolitical subdivisions, corporate bonds, asset-backed securities and collateralized loan obligations.\nWe operate from our administrative headquarters in Fairfield, New Jersey and other administrative locations throughout\nthe State of New Jersey. As of June 30, 2024, we had 43 branch offices. The Company maintains a website at\nwww.kearnybank.com.

You may access these materials by following the links under “Investor Relations” under the “Financial\nInformation” tab at the Company’s website. Information on the Company’s website is not and should not be considered a part of\nthis Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nBusiness Strategy\nWe have evolved our business model from that of a traditional thrift into that of a full-service community bank. This\nevolution has been accomplished by growing our commercial loans and deposits, expanding our product and service offerings, de-\nnovo branching and the acquisition of other financial institutions. During this time, our strategy has been largely focused on\nprofitably deploying capital and enhancing earnings through a variety of balance sheet growth and diversification strategies. The\nkey components of our business strategy are as follows:\n• Maintain Robust Capital and Liquidity Levels\nAs demonstrated by the June 30, 2024 Common Equity Tier 1 Capital ratios of the Company and the Bank of 14.79%\nand 13.65%, respectively, we currently maintain, and plan to continue to maintain, capital levels in excess of regulatory\nminimums and internal capital adequacy guidelines.\nIn addition to our robust capital levels, we maintain significant sources of both on- and off-balance sheet liquidity and\nplan to continue to do so. At June 30, 2024, our liquid assets included $63.9 million of short-term cash and equivalents\n3\nsupplemented by $1.07 billion of investment securities classified as available for sale, which can be readily sold or\npledged as collateral, if necessary. In addition, we had the capacity to borrow additional funds totaling $789.0 million via\nunsecured overnight borrowings from other financial institutions and $1.06 billion and $381.8 million from the Federal\nHome Loan Bank of New York and FRB, respectively, without pledging additional collateral.\n• Continue Our Technology Transformation\nGiven the ongoing evolution of our business towards digital channels, we have invested significant human resources and\ncapital towards enhancing both our internal and client-facing technology systems. Our ongoing technology\ntransformation has, and will continue to, impact nearly every area of the Company including the residential and\ncommercial lending functions, retail deposit gathering, risk management and back office operations. In fiscal 2025, we\nwill continue our digital strategy, spearheaded by our recently adopted cloud-based, best-in-breed digital banking and\nonline account opening platform, and continue to serve our clients’ needs in an omnichannel environment while\nexpanding our products and services into new markets in an efficient and cost-effective manner.\n• Focus on Relationship Banking and Core Deposits\nWe focus on the acquisition and retention of core non-maturity deposit accounts and expanding customer relationships.\nOur philosophy is to provide superior, personalized service to our clients. In addition, we intend to increase core non-\nmaturity deposit accounts by growing business banking relationships through the establishment of dedicated business\ndevelopment teams and expanded product lines tailored to meet our target business customers’ needs. Core non-maturity\ndeposit accounts totaled $3.55 billion at June 30, 2024, representing 68.8% of total deposits.\n• Diversify Loan Portfolio\nWe continue to focus on the diversification of our loan portfolio through the origination of higher yielding commercial\nand industrial (“C&I”), owner-occupied commercial real estate and home equity line of credit (“HELOC”) loans to\nimprove net margins and manage interest rate risk. To that end, we have assembled a team of relationship managers with\nvast experience working with small to middle-market businesses.\n• Continue Focus on Operating Efficiency\nWe plan to continue to improve operating efficiency through organic means, such as the increased use of technology and\nthe continual evaluation of our branch network. We plan to continue to evaluate and optimize the performance of our\nexisting branch network through additional branch consolidations, where appropriate. Such efforts will take into\nconsideration historical branch profitability, market demographic trajectory, technology, geographic proximity of\nconsolidating branches and the expected impact on the Bank’s clients and communities served.\nIn December 2022, we announced the adoption of a company-wide operating efficiency initiative that included the\noptimization and reduction of vendor spend, the automation or outsourcing of routine activities, and the realignment of\nour workforce. Excluding the impact of a non-cash goodwill impairment and other non-recurring items, this operating\nefficiency initiative reduced our non-interest expense by $4.4 million to $117.8 million for the year ended June 30, 2024\nfrom $122.2 million for the year ended June 30, 2023.\nMarket Area. At June 30, 2024, our primary market area consisted of the counties in which we currently operate\nbranches, including Bergen, Essex, Hudson, Middlesex, Monmouth, Morris, Ocean, Passaic, Somerset and Union counties in New\nJersey and Kings (Brooklyn) and Richmond (Staten Island) counties in New York. Our lending is concentrated in New Jersey and\nNew York and our predominant sources of deposits are the communities in which our offices are located as well as the\nneighboring communities.\nCompetition. We operate in a highly competitive market area with a large concentration of financial institutions and we\nface substantial competition in attracting deposits and in originating loans. A number of our competitors are significantly larger\ninstitutions with greater financial and technological resources and lending limits. Our ability to compete successfully is a\nsignificant factor affecting our growth potential and profitability. Our competition for deposits and loans comes from other\ninsured depository institutions located in our primary market area as well as out-of-market depository institutions operating via\nonline channels and from non-depository institutions including mortgage banks, finance companies, insurance companies,\nbrokerage firms and financial technology companies.\n4\nLending Activities\nGeneral. Our loan portfolio is comprised of multi-family mortgage loans, nonresidential mortgage loans, commercial\nbusiness loans, construction loans, one- to four-family residential mortgage loans, home equity loans and other consumer loans. In\nrecent years our lending strategies have placed increasing emphasis on the origination of commercial loans.\nLoan Portfolio Composition.

We generally offer fixed-rate and adjustable-rate\nballoon mortgage loans on multi-family and nonresidential properties with final stated maturities ranging from three to 15 years\nwith amortization terms which generally range from 15 to 30 years.

We originate commercial term loans and lines of credit to a variety of clients in our\nmarket area. Our commercial term loans generally have terms of up to 10 years. Our commercial lines of credit have terms of up\nto one year and are generally floating-rate loans.\nConstruction Lending.

In some cases, we convert a construction loan to a permanent mortgage loan upon completion of construction.

The fixed-rate residential mortgage loans that we originate for\nportfolio generally meet the secondary mortgage market standards of the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (“Freddie\nMac”). In addition, we offer a first-time homebuyer program which provides financial incentives for persons who have not\npreviously owned real estate and are purchasing a one- to four-family property in our primary lending area for use as a primary\nresidence.\nOne- to Four-Family Residential Mortgage Loans Held for Sale. As a complement to our residential one- to four-\nfamily portfolio lending activities, we operate a mortgage banking platform which supports the origination of one- to four-family\nmortgage loans for sale into the secondary market. The loans we originate for sale generally meet the secondary mortgage market\nstandards of Freddie Mac. Such loans are generally originated by, and sourced from, the same resources and markets as those\nloans originated and held in our portfolio. Our mortgage banking business strategy resulted in the recognition of $602,000 in\ngains associated with the sale of $79.1 million of mortgage loans held for sale during the year ended June 30, 2024.

Senior management recommends, and the Board of Directors approves, our\nlending policies and loan approval limits. The Bank’s Loan Committee consists of the Chief Executive Officer, Chief Lending\nOfficer, Chief Credit Officer, Chief Risk Officer and other members of senior management. Loans which exceed certain\nthresholds, as defined within our policies, are submitted to the Bank’s Loan Committee and/or Board of Directors for approval.\nAsset Quality\nCollection Procedures on Delinquent Loans. We regularly monitor the payment status of all loans within our portfolio\nand promptly initiate collection efforts on past due loans in accordance with applicable policies and procedures. Delinquent\nborrowers are notified when a loan is 30 days past due. If the delinquency continues, subsequent efforts are made to contact the\ndelinquent borrower and additional collection notices are sent. All reasonable attempts are made to collect from borrowers prior to\nreferral to an attorney for collection. However, when a residential loan is 120 days delinquent and a commercial loan is 90 days\ndelinquent, it is our general practice to refer it to an attorney for repossession, foreclosure or other form of collection action, as\nappropriate. In certain instances, we may modify the loan or grant a limited moratorium on loan payments to enable the borrower\nto reorganize their financial affairs as we attempt to work with the borrower to establish a repayment schedule to cure the\ndelinquency.\nAs to mortgage loans, if a foreclosure action is taken and the loan is not reinstated, paid in full or refinanced, the property\nis sold at judicial sale at which we may be the buyer if there are no adequate offers to satisfy the debt. Any property acquired as\n8\nthe result of foreclosure or by deed in lieu of foreclosure is classified as other real estate owned until it is sold or otherwise\ndisposed of. When other real estate owned is acquired, it is recorded at its fair market value less estimated selling costs. The initial\nwrite-down of the property, if necessary, is charged to the allowance for credit losses. Adjustments to the carrying value of the\nproperties that result from subsequent declines in value are charged to operations in the period in which the declines are identified.\nPast Due Loans. A loan’s past due status is generally determined based upon its principal and interest (“P&I”) payment\ndelinquency status in conjunction with its past maturity status, where applicable. A loan’s P&I payment delinquency status is\nbased upon the number of calendar days between the date of the earliest P&I payment due and the as of measurement date. A\nloan’s past maturity status, where applicable, is based upon the number of calendar days between a loan’s contractual maturity\ndate and the as of measurement date. Based upon the larger of these criteria, loans are categorized into the following past due tiers\nfor financial statement reporting and disclosure purposes: Current (including 1-29 days past due), 30-59 days past due, 60-89 days\npast due and 90 or more days past due.\nAdditional information about our past due loans is presented in Note 4 to the audited consolidated financial statements.\nNonaccrual Loans. Loans are generally placed on nonaccrual status when contractual payments become 90 or more days\npast due or when we do not expect to receive all P&I payments owed substantially in accordance with the terms of the loan\nagreement, regardless of past due status. Loans that become 90 days past due but are well secured and in the process of collection,\nmay remain on accrual status. Nonaccrual loans are generally returned to accrual status when all payments due are brought current\nand we expect to receive all remaining P&I payments owed substantially in accordance with the terms of the loan agreement.\nPayments received in cash on nonaccrual loans, including both the principal and interest portions of those payments, are generally\napplied to reduce the carrying value of the loan.\nPurchased Credit Deteriorated Loans (“PCD”). PCD loans are acquired loans that, as of the acquisition date, have\nexperienced a more-than-insignificant deterioration in credit quality since origination. Non-PCD loans are acquired loans that\nhave experienced no or insignificant deterioration in credit quality since origination. To distinguish between the two types of\nacquired loans, we evaluate risk characteristics that have been determined to be indicators of deteriorated credit quality. The\ndetermining criteria may involve loan specific characteristics such as payment status, debt service coverage or other changes in\ncreditworthiness since the loan was originated, while others are relevant to recent economic conditions, such as borrowers in\nindustries impacted by the pandemic. As part of our acquisition of MSB Financial Corp., we acquired PCD loans with a par value\nof $69.4 million and an allowance for credit losses of $3.9 million. Additional information about our PCD loans is presented in\nNote 4 to the audited consolidated financial statements.\nNonperforming Assets. The following table provides information regarding our nonperforming assets which are\ncomprised of nonaccrual loans, accruing loans 90 days or more past due, nonaccrual loans held-for-sale and other real estate\nowned:\nAt June 30,\n2024 2023\n(Dollars In Thousands)\nNonaccrual loans $ 39,882 $ 42,627\nOther real estate owned — 12,956\nTotal nonperforming assets $ 39,882 $ 55,583\nTotal nonaccrual loans to total loans 0.70 % 0.73 %\nTotal nonperforming loans to total loans 0.70 % 0.73 %\nTotal nonperforming loans to total assets 0.52 % 0.53 %\nTotal nonperforming assets to total assets 0.52 % 0.69 %\nTotal nonperforming assets decreased by $15.7 million to $39.9 million at June 30, 2024 from $55.6 million at June 30,\n2023. For those same comparative periods, the number of nonperforming loans increased to 48 loans from 45 loans. There was\none property in other real estate owned (“OREO”) at 2023, which was subsequently sold in January 2024. There were no\nproperties in OREO at June 30, 2024. All nonaccrual loans held-for sale at June 30, 2023 were sold during the year ended\nJune 30, 2024.\n9\nLoan Review System. We maintain a loan review system consisting of several related functions including, but not limited\nto, classification of assets, calculation of the allowance for credit losses, independent credit file review as well as internal audit\nand lending compliance reviews. We utilize both internal and external resources, where appropriate, to perform the various loan\nreview functions, all of which operate in accordance with a scope and frequency determined by senior management and the Audit\nand Compliance Committee of the Board of Directors.\nAs one component of our loan review system we engage a third-party firm which specializes in loan review and analysis\nfunctions. As part of their review process, our third-party review firm compares their review results with their client base to\nevaluate our risk assessment among our peers. This firm assists senior management and the Board of Directors in identifying\npotential credit weaknesses; in reviewing and confirming risk ratings or adverse classifications internally ascribed to loans by\nmanagement; in identifying relevant trends that affect the collectability of the portfolio and identifying segments of the portfolio\nthat are potential problem areas; in verifying the appropriateness of the allowance for credit losses; in evaluating the activities of\nlending personnel including compliance with lending policies and the quality of their loan approval, monitoring and risk\nassessment; and by providing an objective assessment of the overall quality of the loan portfolio. Currently, third-party loan\nreviews are being conducted quarterly and include non-performing loans as well as samples of performing loans of varying types\nwithin our portfolio.\nIn addition, our loan review system includes functions performed by internal audit and compliance personnel. Internal\naudit resources perform credit review functions utilizing guidance from regulatory and Institute of Internal Auditors standards in\naddition to assessing the adequacy of, and adherence to, internal credit policies and loan administration procedures and adherence\nto regulatory guidance. Our compliance resources monitor adherence to relevant lending-related and consumer protection-related\nlaws and regulations.\nClassification of Assets. In compliance with the regulatory guidelines, our loan review system includes an evaluation\nprocess through which certain loans exhibiting adverse credit quality characteristics are classified as Substandard, Doubtful or\nLoss. An asset is classified as Substandard if it is inadequately protected by the paying capacity and net worth of the obligor or the\ncollateral pledged, if any. Substandard assets include those characterized by the distinct possibility that the insured institution will\nsustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected. Assets classified as Doubtful have all of the weaknesses inherent in those\nclassified as Substandard, with the added characteristic that the weaknesses present make collection or liquidation in full highly\nquestionable and improbable, on the basis of currently existing facts, conditions and values. Assets, or portions thereof, classified\nas Loss are considered uncollectible or of so little value that their continuance as assets is not warranted. Assets which do not\ncurrently expose us to a sufficient degree of risk to warrant an adverse classification but have some credit deficiencies or other\npotential weaknesses are designated as Special Mention by management. Adversely classified assets, together with those rated as\nSpecial Mention are generally referred to as Classified Assets. Non-classified assets are internally rated within one of four Pass\ncategories or as Watch with the latter denoting a potential deficiency or concern that warrants increased oversight or tracking by\nmanagement until remediated.\nAdditional information about our classification of assets is presented in Note 4 to the audited consolidated financial\nstatements.\nThe following table discloses our designation of certain loans as special mention or adversely classified during each of\nthe two years presented:\nAt June 30,\n2024 2023\n(In Thousands)\nSpecial mention $ 50,876 $ 17,674\nSubstandard 67,738 75,777\nDoubtful 86 75\nTotal classified loans $ 118,700 $ 93,526\nIndividually Evaluated Loans. On a case-by-case basis, we may conclude that a loan should be evaluated on an\nindividual basis based on its disparate risk characteristics. When we determine that a loan no longer shares similar risk\ncharacteristics with other loans in the portfolio, the allowance will be determined on an individual basis using the present value of\nexpected cash flows or, for collateral-dependent loans, the fair value of the collateral as of the reporting date, less estimated\nselling costs, as applicable. If the fair value of the collateral is less than the amortized cost basis of the loan, we will establish an\nallowance for the difference between the fair value of the collateral, less costs to sell, at the reporting date and the amortized cost\nbasis of the loan.\n10\nAllowance for Credit Losses - Loans\nA description of our methodology in establishing our allowance for credit losses is set forth in the section\n“Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Critical Accounting Policies -\nAllowance for Credit Losses.”\nAdditional information about our allowance for credit losses is also presented in Note 5 to the audited consolidated\nfinancial statements.\nOur allowance for credit losses is maintained at a level necessary to cover lifetime expected credit losses in financial\nassets at the balance sheet date. The following table presents allowance for credit losses ratios, along with the components of their\ncalculation, for the periods indicated:\nAt June 30,\n2024 2023\n(Dollars in Thousands)\nAllowance for credit losses - loans $ 44,939 $ 48,734\nTotal loans outstanding $ 5,748,750 $ 5,850,476\nTotal non-performing loans $ 39,882 $ 42,627\nAllowance for credit losses as a percent of total loans outstanding 0.78 % 0.83 %\nAllowance for credit losses to non-performing loans 112.68 % 114.33 %\n11\nrof\n,noitaluclac\neht\nfo\nstnenopmoc\neht\nhtiw\ngnola\n,yrogetac\nnaol\nyb\ngnidnatstuo\nsnaol\negareva\not\n)seirevocer(\nsffo-egrahc\nten\nfo\noitar\neht\nstneserp\nelbat\ngniwollof\nehT\n:detacidni\nsdoirep\neht\n,03\nenuJ\ndednE\nsraeY\neht\nroF\n2202\n3202\n4202\n-egrahc\nteN\n-egrahc\nteN\n-egrahc\nteN\na\nsa\nsffo\na\nsa\nsffo\na\nsa\nsffo\nfo\ntnecrep\negarevA\nteN\nfo\ntnecrep\negarevA\nteN\nfo\ntnecrep\negarevA\nteN\nsnaol\negareva\nsnaol\nsffo-egrahc\nsnaol\negareva\nsnaol\nsffo-egrahc\nsnaol\negareva\nsnaol\nsffo-egrahc\ngnidnatstuo\ngnidnatstuo\n)seirevocer(\ngnidnatstuo\ngnidnatstuo\n)seirevocer(\ngnidnatstuo\ngnidnatstuo\n)seirevocer(\n)sdnasuohT\nni\nsralloD(\n% 90.0\n595,650,2\n$\n698,1\n$\n%\n20.0\n824,817,2\n$\n394\n$\n% 10.0\n924,576,2\n$\n893\n$\negagtrom\nylimaf-itluM\n% 81.0\n502,630,1\n438,1\n%\n00.0\n349,500,1\n93\n% 16.0\n521,359\n558,5\negagtrom\nlaitnedisernoN\n% 20.0\n320,091\n33\n%\n81.0\n497,881\n533\n% 53.2\n065,361\n448,3\nssenisub\nlaicremmoC\n% 00.0\n590,501\n—\n%\n00.0\n581,671\n—\n% 00.0\n111,802\n—\nnoitcurtsnoC\n% )10.0(\n802,784,1\n)741(\n%\n00.0\n929,386,1\n)2(\n% 00.0\n759,407,1\n)67(\negagtrom\nlaitnediser\nylimaf-ruof\not\n-enO\n% )40.0(\n948,76\n)72(\n%\n00.0\n974,66\n—\n% 00.0\n763,36\n—\nsnaol\nytiuqe\nemoH\n% 00.0\n399,2\n—\n%\n)69.1(\n508,2\n)55(\n% 00.0\n008,2\n—\nremusnoc\nrehtO\n% 00.0\n)865,32(\n—\n%\n00.0\n)044,51(\n—\n% 00.0\n)358,81(\n—\nstnemtsujda\ndleiy\ndeterccanU\n% 70.0\n004,229,4\n$\n985,3\n$\n%\n10.0\n321,728,5\n$\n018\n$\n% 71.0\n694,257,5\n$\n120,01\n$\nlatoT\neht rof\netar\n%10.0\neht\nmorf\nstniop\nsisab\n61\nfo\nesaercni\nna\n,4202\n,03\nenuJ\ndedne\nraey\neht\nrof\n%71.0\nfo\netar\nffo-egrahc\nten\ndezilaunna\nna\ndecneirepxe\noiloftrop\nnaol\nruO\n.3202\n,03\nenuJ\ndedne\nraey\n12\nAllocation of Allowance for Credit Losses on Loans. The following table sets forth the allowance for credit losses\n(“ACL”) allocated by loan category and the percent of loans in each category to total loans receivable at the dates indicated. The\nACL allocated to each category is the estimated amount considered necessary to cover lifetime expected credit losses inherent in\nany particular category as of the balance sheet date and does not restrict the use of the allowance to absorb losses in other\ncategories.\nAt June 30,\n2024 2023\nPercent of Loans Percent of Loans\nAmount to Total Loans Amount to Total Loans\n(Dollars In Thousands)\nMulti-family mortgage $ 24,125 46.02 % $ 26,362 47.21 %\nNonresidential mortgage 6,125 16.49 8,953 16.56\nCommercial business 1,573 2.48 1,440 2.51\nConstruction 1,230 3.64 1,336 3.87\nOne- to four-family residential mortgage 11,461 30.55 10,237 29.07\nHome equity loans 349 0.77 338 0.74\nOther consumer 76 0.05 68 0.04\nTotal $ 44,939 100.00 % $ 48,734 100.00 %\nAt June 30, 2024, the ACL totaled $44.9 million, or 0.78% of total loans, reflecting a decrease of $3.8 million from\n$48.7 million, or 0.83% of total loans, at June 30, 2023. The decrease was largely attributable to a reduction in reserves for\nindividually evaluated loans, primarily driven by the charge-offs of three related non-performing commercial real estate loans\ntransferred to held-for-sale and sold during the year ended June 30, 2024.\nThe ACL at June 30, 2024 is maintained at a level that is management’s best estimate of lifetime expected credit losses\ninherent in loans at the balance sheet date. The ACL is subject to estimates and assumptions that are susceptible to significant\nrevisions as more information becomes available and as events or conditions effecting individual borrowers and the marketplace\nas a whole change over time. Additions to the ACL may be necessary if the future economic environment deteriorates from\nforecasted conditions. In addition, the banking regulators, as an integral part of their examination process, periodically review our\nloan and foreclosed real estate portfolios, related ACL and valuation allowance for foreclosed real estate. The regulators may\nrequire the ACL to be increased based on their review of information available at the time of the examination, which may\nnegatively affect our earnings.\nAdditional information about the ACL at June 30, 2024 and 2023 is presented in Note 5 to the audited consolidated\nfinancial statements.\nInvestment Securities\nAt June 30, 2024, our investment securities portfolio totaled $1.21 billion and comprised 15.7% of our total assets. By\ncomparison, at June 30, 2023, our securities portfolio totaled $1.37 billion and comprised 17.0% of our total assets. Additional\ninformation about our investment securities at June 30, 2024 is presented in Note 3 to the audited consolidated financial\nstatements.\nThe year-over-year net decrease in the securities portfolio totaled $165.6 million which largely reflected repayments and\nsales that were partially offset by purchases. The decrease in the portfolio included a $25.5 million increase in the fair value of the\navailable for sale securities portfolio to an unrealized loss of $130.7 million at June 30, 2024 from an unrealized loss of $156.1\nmillion at June 30, 2023.\nOur investment policy, which is approved by the Board of Directors, is designed to foster earnings and manage cash\nflows within prudent interest rate risk and credit risk guidelines, taking into consideration our liquidity needs, asset/liability\nmanagement goals, and performance objectives. Our Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, Chief Risk Officer and\nTreasurer/Chief Investment Officer are the senior management members of our Capital Markets Committee that are designated by\nthe Board of Directors as the officers primarily responsible for securities portfolio management and all transactions require the\napproval of at least two of these designated officers.\nThe investments authorized for purchase under the investment policy approved by our Board of Directors include U.S.\ngovernment and agency mortgage-backed securities, U.S. government agency debentures, municipal obligations, corporate bonds,\nasset-backed securities, collateralized loan obligations and subordinated debt.\n13\nThe carrying value of our mortgage-backed securities totaled $593.9 million at June 30, 2024 and comprised 49.1% of\ntotal investments and 7.7% of total assets as of that date. We generally invest in mortgage-backed securities issued by U.S.\ngovernment agencies or government-sponsored entities. Mortgage-backed securities issued or sponsored by U.S. government\nagencies and government-sponsored entities are guaranteed as to the payment of principal and interest to investors.\nThe carrying value of our securities representing obligations of state and political subdivisions totaled $12.9 million at\nJune 30, 2024 and comprised 1.1% of total investments and less than 1.0% of total assets as of that date. Such securities primarily\nincluded highly-rated, fixed-rate bank-qualified securities representing general obligations of municipalities located within the\nU.S. or the obligations of their related entities such as boards of education or school districts. Each of our municipal obligations\nwere consistently rated by Moody’s and S&P well above the thresholds that generally support our investment grade assessment\nwith such ratings equaling A- or higher by S&P or A2 or higher by Moody’s, where rated by those agencies. In the absence of, or\nas a complement to, such ratings, we rely upon our own internal analysis of the issuer’s financial condition to validate its\ninvestment grade assessment.\nThe carrying value of our asset-backed securities totaled $80.4 million at June 30, 2024 and comprised 6.7% of total\ninvestments and 1.0% of total assets as of that date. This category of securities is comprised entirely of structured, floating-rate\nsecurities representing securitized federal education loans with 97% U.S. government guarantees. Our securities represent the\nhighest credit-quality tranches within the overall structures with each being rated AA+ or higher by S&P or Aa1 or higher by\nMoody’s, where rated by those agencies.\nThe outstanding balance of our collateralized loan obligations totaled $389.5 million at June 30, 2024 and comprised\n32.2% of total investments and 5.1% of total assets as of that date. This category of securities is comprised entirely of structured,\nfloating-rate securities representing securitized commercial loans to large, U.S. corporations. At June 30, 2024, each of our\ncollateralized loan obligations were consistently rated by Moody’s and/or S&P well above the thresholds that generally support\nour investment grade assessment with such ratings equaling AAA by S&P or Aaa by Moody’s, where rated by those agencies.\nThe carrying value of our corporate bonds totaled $131.8 million at June 30, 2024 and comprised 10.9% of total\ninvestments and 1.7% of total assets as of that date. This category of securities is comprised of two floating-rate corporate debt\nobligations issued by large financial institutions and subordinated debt representing, small- to mid-sized community banks located\nmainly in the mid-Atlantic region of the U.S. At June 30, 2024, corporate bonds issued by large financial institutions were\nconsistently rated by Moody’s and S&P well above the thresholds that generally support our investment grade assessment with\nsuch ratings equaling BBB- or higher by S&P or Baa3 or higher by Moody’s, where rated by those agencies.\nCurrent accounting standards require that debt securities be categorized as held to maturity or available for sale, based on\nmanagement’s intent as to the ultimate disposition of each security. These standards allow debt securities to be classified as held\nto maturity and reported in financial statements at amortized cost only if the reporting entity has the positive intent and ability to\nhold these securities to maturity. Securities that might be sold in response to changes in market interest rates, changes in the\nsecurity’s prepayment risk, increases in loan demand, or other similar factors cannot be classified as held to maturity.\nWe do not currently use or maintain a trading account. Securities not classified as held to maturity are classified as\navailable for sale. These securities are reported at fair value and unrealized gains and losses on the securities are excluded from\nearnings and reported, net of deferred taxes, as adjustments to accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), a separate\ncomponent of equity. As of June 30, 2024, our available for sale securities portfolio had a carrying value of $1.07 billion or\n88.8% of our total securities with the remaining $135.7 million or 11.2% of securities were classified as held to maturity.\nOther than securities issued or guaranteed by the U.S. government or its agencies, we did not hold securities of any one\nissuer having an aggregate book value in excess of 10% of our equity at June 30, 2024. All of our securities carry market risk\ninsofar as increases in market interest rates have caused, and may continue to cause, a decrease in their market value. We believe\nthat unrealized and unrecognized losses on securities held at June 30, 2024, are a function of changes in market interest rates and\ncredit spreads, not changes in credit quality. Therefore, no allowance for credit losses was recorded at that time.\nDuring the year ended June 30, 2024, proceeds from sales of securities available for sale totaled $104.1 million and\nresulted in no gross gains and gross losses of $18.1 million. During the year ended June 30, 2023, proceeds from sales of\nsecurities available for sale totaled $105.2 million and resulted in no gross gains and gross losses of $15.2 million.

Retail deposits are our primary source of funds for lending and other investment purposes. In addition, we\nderive funds from principal repayments of loan and investment securities. Loan and securities payments are a relatively stable\nsource of funds, while deposit inflows are significantly influenced by general interest rates and money market conditions.\nWholesale funding sources including, but not limited to, borrowings from the Federal Home Loan Bank of New York (“FHLB”),\nwholesale deposits and other short-term borrowings are also used to supplement the funding for loans and investments.\nDeposits. Our current deposit products include interest-bearing and non-interest-bearing checking accounts, money\nmarket deposit accounts, savings accounts and certificates of deposit accounts ranging in terms from 30 days to five years.\nCertificates of deposit with terms ranging from six months to five years are available for individual retirement account plans.\nDeposit account terms, such as interest rate earned, applicability of certain fees and service charges and funds accessibility, will\nvary based upon several factors including, but not limited to, minimum balance, term to maturity, and transaction frequency and\nform requirements.\nDeposits are obtained primarily from within New Jersey and New York through the Bank’s network of retail branches,\nbusiness relationship officers, treasury management officers and digital banking channels. We maintain a robust suite of\ncommercial deposit products designed to appeal to small and mid-size businesses, non-profit organizations and government\nentities. Our team of experienced and dedicated business relationship officers serve as the primary points of contact for these\ncommercial clients and act as both new business originators and relationship managers.\nThe determination of interest rates on retail deposits is based upon a number of factors, including: (1) our need for funds\nbased on loan demand, current maturities of deposits and other cash flow needs; (2) a current survey of a selected group of\ncompetitors’ rates for similar products; (3) our current cost of funds, yield on assets and asset/liability position; and (4) the\nalternate cost of funds on a wholesale basis. Interest rates are reviewed by senior management on a regular basis, with deposit\nproduct and pricing updated, as appropriate, during recurring and ad-hoc senior management meetings.\nOur liquidity could be reduced if a significant amount of certificates of deposit maturing within a short period were not\nrenewed. At June 30, 2024 and 2023, certificates of deposit maturing within one year were $1.49 billion and $1.90 billion,\nrespectively. Historically, a significant portion of the certificates of deposit remain with us after they mature.\nAt June 30, 2024, $1.10 billion or 68.2% of our certificates of deposit were certificates of $100,000 or more compared to\n$1.42 billion or 70.6% at June 30, 2023. Excluding brokered certificates of deposit, $688.3 million or 57.4% of our certificates of\ndeposit were certificates of $100,000 or more at June 30, 2024. The general level of market interest rates and money market\nconditions significantly influence deposit inflows and outflows. The effects of these factors are particularly pronounced on deposit\naccounts with larger balances. In particular, certificates of deposit with balances of $100,000 or greater are traditionally viewed as\nbeing a more volatile source of funding than comparatively lower balance certificates of deposit or non-maturity transaction\naccounts. In order to retain certificates of deposit with balances of $100,000 or more, we may have to pay a premium rate,\nresulting in an increase in our cost of funds. To the extent that such deposits do not remain with us, they may need to be replaced\nwith wholesale funding.\nOur sources of wholesale funding included brokered certificates of deposit whose balances totaled approximately $408.2\nmillion, or 7.9% of total deposits, at June 30, 2024. We utilize brokered certificates of deposit and as an alternative to other forms\nof wholesale funding, including borrowings, when interest rates and market conditions favor the use of such deposits. For a\nportion of our short-term brokered certificates of deposit we utilized interest rate contracts to effectively extend their duration and\nto fix their cost.\n17\nThe following table sets forth the distribution of average deposits for the periods indicated and the weighted average\nnominal interest rates for each period on each category of deposits presented:\nFor the Years Ended June 30,\n2024 2023 2022\nWeighted Weighted Weighted\nPercent Average Percent Average Percent Average\nAverage of Total Nominal Average of Total Nominal Average of Total Nominal\nBalance Deposits Rate Balance Deposits Rate Balance Deposits Rate\n(Dollars In Thousands)\nNon-interest-bearing\ndeposits $ 595,266 11.14 % — % $ 644,543 10.79 % — % $ 624,666 11.37 % — %\nInterest-bearing demand 2,308,893 43.19 2.91 2,349,802 39.33 1.73 2,067,200 37.64 0.25\nSavings 662,981 12.40 0.50 896,651 15.00 0.37 1,088,971 19.83 0.11\nCertificates of deposit 1,778,682 33.27 2.92 2,083,864 34.88 1.64 1,711,276 31.16 0.52\n.\nTotal average deposits $ 5,345,822 100.00 % 2.29 % $ 5,974,860 100.00 % 1.31 % $ 5,492,113 100.00 % 0.28 %\nAs of June 30, 2024 and 2023, the aggregate amount of certificates of deposit of $250,000 and over was $633.0 million\nand $883.7 million, respectively.

The sources of wholesale funding we utilize include borrowings in the form of advances from the FHLB as\nwell as other forms of borrowings. We generally use wholesale funding to manage our exposure to interest rate risk and liquidity\nrisk in conjunction with our overall asset/liability management process.\nAdvances from the FHLB are typically secured by our FHLB capital stock and certain investment securities as well as\nresidential and commercial mortgage loans that we choose to utilize as collateral for such borrowings. Additional information\nabout our FHLB advances is included under Note 10 to the audited consolidated financial statements.\nAt June 30, 2024, we had $1.54 billion of FHLB advances outstanding, excluding a net fair value adjustment of\n$211,000, at a weighted average interest rate of 5.07%. At June 30, 2023, we had $1.28 billion of FHLB advances outstanding,\nexcluding a net fair value adjustment of $688,000, at a weighted average interest rate of 4.92%.\nOur FHLB advances mature as follows:\nAt June 30,\n2024 2023\n(In Thousands)\nBy remaining period to maturity:\nLess than one year $ 1,328,500 $ 972,500\nOne to two years 6,500 103,500\nTwo to three years — 6,500\nThree to four years 200,000 —\nFour to five years — 200,000\nGreater than five years — —\nTotal advances 1,535,000 1,282,500\nFair value adjustments (211) (688)\nTotal advances, net of fair value adjustments $ 1,534,789 $ 1,281,812\nAt June 30, 2024, we utilized interest rate contracts to effectively extend the duration and fix the cost of our FHLB\nadvances maturing in less than one year.\nBased upon the market value of investment securities and mortgage loans that are posted as collateral for FHLB\nadvances at June 30, 2024, we are eligible to borrow up to an additional $1.06 billion of advances from the FHLB as of that date.\nWe are further authorized to post additional collateral in the form of other unencumbered investments securities and eligible\nmortgage loans that may expand our borrowing capacity with the FHLB up to 30% of our total assets. Additional borrowing\ncapacity up to 50% of our total assets may be authorized with the approval of the FHLB’s Board of Directors or Executive\nCommittee.\nIn addition, we had the capacity to borrow additional funds totaling $789.0 million via unsecured overnight borrowings\nfrom other financial institutions and $381.8 million from the FRB without pledging additional collateral.\nThe balance of borrowings at June 30, 2024 included overnight line of credit borrowings from the FHLB totaling\n$175.0 million. There were no unsecured overnight borrowings from other financial institutions at June 30, 2024.\nInterest Rate Derivatives and Hedging\nWe utilize derivative instruments in the form of interest rate swaps, caps and floors to hedge our exposure to interest rate\nrisk in conjunction with our overall asset/liability management process. In accordance with accounting requirements, we formally\ndesignate all of our hedging relationships as either fair value hedges or cash flow hedges, and document the strategy for\nundertaking the hedge transactions and its method of assessing ongoing effectiveness.\nAt June 30, 2024, our derivative instruments were comprised of interest rate swaps, caps and a floor with a total notional\namount of $2.75 billion. These instruments are intended to manage the interest rate exposure relating to certain wholesale funding\npositions and assets that were outstanding at June 30, 2024.\nAdditional information regarding our use of interest rate derivatives and our hedging activities is presented in Note 1 and\nNote 11 to the audited consolidated financial statements.\n19\nSubsidiary Activity\nAt June 30, 2024, Kearny Bank was the only wholly-owned operating subsidiary of Kearny Financial Corp. As of that\ndate, Kearny Bank had three wholly-owned subsidiaries, CJB Investment Corp., 189-245 Berdan Avenue LLC and Kearny\nWealth Management LLC. CJB Investment Corp. is a New Jersey Investment Company and remained active through the three-\nyear period ended June 30, 2024. 189-245 Berdan Avenue LLC was formed during the year ended June 30, 2023 for the purpose\nof ownership and operation of commercial real estate. In February 2024, the Bank formed the Kearny Wealth Management LLC\nsubsidiary for the purpose of providing wealth management and insurance brokerage services via a third-party service provider.\nHuman Capital Resources\nEmpowering prosperity, connecting community and delivering trust are the essence of who we are at Kearny Bank and\nwhat differentiates us from others. We adhere to these core principles by employing and developing an outstanding team. We\ncultivate premier performance through consistent training, monitoring, and coaching.\nGuided by unwavering principles of ethics and integrity, we serve our clients and shareholders while actively\ncontributing to our communities. Our commitment extends beyond financial transactions; we foster an environment where\nemployees thrive, and customers choose to bank.\nDiversity and Inclusion. We recognize the unique value each individual brings to our organization. As part of our\ncommitment to diversity, equity, and inclusion, we appointed a Senior Vice President Director of Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion\nin the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2023. This role serves as a bridge between business lines and management, promoting diversity\nacross various aspects of our operations. The Director of DEI has established various programs to help grow our culture of\ninclusivity to be used as platforms to celebrate our diversity of thought and backgrounds across the organization.\nAdditionally, the Kearny Bank ChangeMakers initiative, which was launched in 2023 in partnership with Rutgers\nUniversity, has expanded with 35 employees now having successfully completed the program. This initiative focuses on gender\nand leadership training, engaging in meaningful dialogue and teaching transferable skills to local women owned businesses in our\ncommunities.\nEmployee Profile. As of June 30, 2024, we employed 552 employees, approximately 60% identifying as female. We\ncontinue to collaborate with diversity recruitment solutions to enhance our overall recruitment efforts.\nTalent Development and Engagement. We invest in our employees’ personal and professional growth by providing\ncareer advancement opportunities. Our commitment to promoting from within allows us to leverage employee expertise and\norganizational knowledge. Furthermore, we offer educational initiatives and support for certifications to enhance our employees’\nprofessional development.\nEmployee Benefits.

Additionally, the Company operates in a hybrid work environment, where applicable, one which promotes a\nwork-life balance and allows for certain flexibility while maintaining productivity and efficiency.\n20\nSupervision and Regulation\nKearny Bank and Kearny Financial operate in a highly regulated industry. This regulation establishes a comprehensive\nframework of activities in which a savings and loan holding company and New Jersey savings bank may engage and is intended\nprimarily for the protection of the deposit insurance fund and depositors. Set forth below is a brief description of certain laws that\nrelate to the regulation of Kearny Bank and Kearny Financial. The description does not purport to be complete and is qualified in\nits entirety by reference to applicable laws and regulations.\nRegulatory authorities have extensive discretion in connection with their supervisory and enforcement activities and\nexamination policies, including the imposition of restrictions on the operation of an institution and its holding company, the\nclassification of assets by the institution and the adequacy of an institution’s allowance for credit losses. Any change in such\nregulation and oversight, whether in the form of regulatory policy, regulations, or legislation, including changes in the regulations\ngoverning savings and loan holding companies, could have a material adverse impact on Kearny Financial, Kearny Bank and their\noperations. The adoption of regulations or the enactment of laws that restrict the operations of Kearny Bank and/or Kearny\nFinancial or impose burdensome requirements upon one or both of them could reduce their profitability and could impair the\nvalue of Kearny Bank’s franchise, resulting in negative effects on the trading price of our common stock.\nRegulation of Kearny Bank\nGeneral. As a nonmember New Jersey savings bank with federally insured deposits, Kearny Bank is subject to extensive\nregulation by the NJDBI and the FDIC. The activities of New Jersey savings banks are subject to extensive regulation including\nrestrictions or requirements with respect to loans to one borrower, dividends, permissible investments and lending activities,\nliquidity, transactions with affiliates and community reinvestment. Both state and federal law regulate a savings bank’s\nrelationship with its depositors and borrowers, especially in such matters as the ownership of savings accounts and the form and\ncontent of Kearny Bank’s mortgage documents.\nKearny Bank must file reports with the NJDBI and FDIC concerning its activities and financial condition and obtain\nregulatory approvals prior to entering into certain transactions such as establishing new branches and mergers with or acquisitions\nof other depository institutions. The NJDBI and FDIC regularly examine Kearny Bank and prepare reports to Kearny Bank’s\nBoard of Directors on any deficiencies found in its operations. The agencies have substantial discretion to take enforcement action\nwith respect to an institution that fails to comply with applicable regulatory requirements or engages in violations of law or unsafe\nand unsound practices. Such actions can include, among others, the issuance of a cease and desist order, assessment of civil\nmoney penalties, removal of officers and directors and appointment of a receiver or conservator.\nActivities and Powers. Kearny Bank derives its lending, investment and other powers primarily from the applicable\nprovisions of the New Jersey Banking Act and the related regulations. Under these laws and regulations, New Jersey savings\nbanks, including Kearny Bank, generally may invest in real estate mortgages; consumer and commercial loans; specific types of\ndebt securities, including certain corporate debt securities and obligations of federal, state and local governments and agencies;\ncertain types of corporate equity securities and other specified assets.\nA savings bank may also invest pursuant to a leeway power that permits investments not otherwise permitted by the New\nJersey Banking Act. Leeway investments must comply with a number of limitations on individual and aggregate amounts of\ninvestments. New Jersey savings banks may also exercise those powers, rights, benefits or privileges authorized for national\nbanks, federal savings banks or federal savings associations, or either directly or through a subsidiary. New Jersey savings banks\nmay exercise powers, rights, benefits and privileges of out-of-state banks, savings banks and savings associations, or either\ndirectly or through a subsidiary, provided that prior approval by the NJDBI is required before exercising any such power, right,\nbenefit or privilege. The exercise of these lending, investment and activity powers is further limited by federal law and the related\nregulations. See “—Activity Restrictions on State-Chartered Banks” below.\nActivity Restrictions on State-Chartered Banks. Federal law and FDIC regulations generally limit the activities as\nprincipal and equity investments of state-chartered FDIC insured banks and their subsidiaries to those permissible for national\nbanks and their subsidiaries, except such activities and investments that are specifically exempted by law or regulation, or\napproved by the FDIC.\nBefore engaging as principal in a new activity that is not permissible for a national bank, or otherwise permissible under\nfederal law or FDIC regulations, an insured bank must seek approval from the FDIC, subject to certain specified exceptions. The\nFDIC will not approve the activity unless the bank meets its minimum capital requirements and the FDIC determines that the\nactivity does not present a significant risk to the FDIC’s Deposit Insurance Fund. Certain activities of subsidiaries that are\nengaged in activities permitted for national banks only through a financial subsidiary are subject to additional requirements.\n21\nAdditionally, New Jersey parity provisions authorize New Jersey savings banks, subject to certain limitations, to exercise the\npowers, rights, benefits and privileges authorized for national or out-of-state banks, or federal or out-of-state savings banks or\nsavings associations\nFederal Deposit Insurance. Kearny Bank’s deposits are insured to applicable limits by the FDIC. The general maximum\ndeposit insurance amount is $250,000 per depositor.\nThe FDIC assesses insured depository institutions to maintain the Deposit Insurance Fund (“DIF”). Under the FDIC’s\nrisk-based assessment system, institutions deemed less risky pay lower assessments. Assessments for institutions of less than $10\nbillion of assets, such as Kearny Bank, are based on financial measures and supervisory ratings derived from statistical modeling\nestimating the probability of an institution’s failure within three years. Effective January 1, 2023, the assessment range for insured\ninstitutions of less than $10 billion of total assets is 2.5 to 32 basis points of total assets less tangible equity.\nThe FDIC has authority to increase insurance assessments. Any significant increases would have an adverse effect on the\noperating expenses and results of operations of Kearny Bank. Management cannot predict what assessment rates will be in the\nfuture.\nInsurance of deposits may be terminated by the FDIC upon a finding that an institution has engaged in unsafe or unsound\npractices, is in an unsafe or unsound condition to continue operations or has violated any applicable law, regulation, rule, order or\ncondition imposed by the FDIC. We do not currently know of any practice, condition or violation that may lead to termination of\nour deposit insurance.\nRegulatory Capital Requirements. FDIC regulations require nonmember banks to meet several minimum capital\nstandards: a common equity Tier 1 capital to risk-based assets ratio of 4.5%, a Tier 1 capital to risk-based assets ratio of 6.0%, a\ntotal capital to risk-based assets of 8.0%, and a 4.0% Tier 1 capital to total assets leverage ratio. The current requirements\nimplement recommendations of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision and certain requirements of federal law.\nFor purposes of the regulatory capital standards, common equity Tier 1 capital is generally defined as common\nstockholders’ equity and retained earnings. Tier 1 capital is generally defined as common equity Tier 1 capital and additional Tier\n1 capital. Additional Tier 1 capital includes certain noncumulative perpetual preferred stock and related surplus and minority\ninterests in equity accounts of consolidated subsidiaries. Total capital includes Tier 1 capital (common equity Tier 1 capital plus\nadditional Tier 1 capital) and Tier 2 capital. Tier 2 capital is comprised of capital instruments and related surplus, meeting\nspecified requirements, and may include cumulative preferred stock and long-term perpetual preferred stock, mandatory\nconvertible securities, intermediate preferred stock and subordinated debt.\nAlso included in Tier 2 capital is the allowance for credit losses limited to a maximum of 1.25% of risk-weighted assets\nand, for institutions that have exercised an opt-out election regarding the treatment of Accumulated Other Comprehensive\nIncome, up to 45% of net unrealized gains on available-for-sale equity securities with readily determinable fair market values.\nCalculation of all types of regulatory capital is subject to deductions and adjustments specified in the regulations. At June 30,\n2024, Kearny Bank has exercised the opt-out election regarding the treatment of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income.\nIn determining the amount of risk-weighted assets for purposes of calculating risk-based capital ratios, all assets,\nincluding certain off-balance sheet assets, are multiplied by a risk weight factor assigned by the regulations based on the risks\nbelieved inherent in the type of asset. Higher levels of capital are required for asset categories believed to present greater risk. For\nexample, a risk weight of 0% is assigned to cash and U.S. government securities, a risk weight of 50% is generally assigned to\nprudently underwritten first lien one- to four-family residential mortgages, a risk weight of 100% is assigned to commercial and\nconsumer loans, a risk weight of 150% is assigned to certain past due loans and a risk weight of between 0% to 600% is assigned\nto equity interests depending on certain specified factors.\nIn addition to establishing the minimum regulatory capital requirements, the regulations limit capital distributions and\ncertain discretionary bonus payments to management if the institution does not hold a capital conservation buffer consisting of\n2.5% of common equity Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets above the amount necessary to meet its minimum risk-based capital\nrequirements. At June 30, 2024, Kearny Bank exceeded all regulatory capital requirements.\nIn assessing an institution’s capital adequacy, the FDIC takes into consideration, not only these numeric factors, but also\nqualitative factors. The FDIC has the authority to establish higher capital requirements for individual institutions where deemed\nnecessary.\n22\nDepository institutions and their holding companies that have less than $10 billion in total consolidated assets and meet\nother qualifying criteria may elect to use the optional community bank leverage ratio framework, which requires maintaining a\nleverage ratio of greater than 9.0%, to satisfy the regulatory capital requirements, including the risk-based requirements. A\nqualifying institution may opt in and out of the community bank leverage ratio framework on its quarterly call report. Kearny\nBank did not opt into the community bank leverage ratio framework as of June 30, 2024.\nRegulations issued by the NJDBI establish generally similar regulatory capital standards for New Jersey-chartered\nsavings banks such as Kearny Bank.\nPrompt Corrective Regulatory Action. Federal law requires that federal bank regulatory authorities take prompt\ncorrective action with respect to institutions that do not meet minimum capital requirements. For these purposes, the law\nestablishes five capital categories: “well capitalized,” “adequately capitalized,” “undercapitalized,” “significantly\nundercapitalized” and “critically undercapitalized.” Qualifying banks that elect and comply with the community bank leverage\nratio (as established by the regulatory agencies) are considered well-capitalized under the prompt corrective action regulations\nThe FDIC has adopted regulations to implement the prompt corrective action legislation. An institution is deemed to be\nwell capitalized if it has a total risk-based capital ratio of 10.0% or greater, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 8.0% or greater, a\nleverage ratio of 5.0% or greater and a common equity Tier 1 ratio of 6.5% or greater. Further, the institution must not be subject\nto any written agreement, order or capital directive, or prompt corrective action directive issued by the FDIC to meet and maintain\na specific capital level for any capital measure. An institution is adequately capitalized if it has a total risk-based capital ratio of\n8.0% or greater, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 6.0% or greater, a leverage ratio of 4.0% or greater and a common equity Tier\n1 ratio of 4.5% or greater.\nAn institution is undercapitalized if it has a total risk-based capital ratio of less than 8.0%, a Tier 1 risk-based capital\nratio of less than 6.0%, a leverage ratio of less than 4.0% or a common equity Tier 1 ratio of less than 4.5%. An institution is\ncategorized as significantly undercapitalized if it has a total risk-based capital ratio of less than 6.0%, a Tier 1 risk-based capital\nratio of less than 4.0%, a leverage ratio of less than 3.0% or a common equity Tier 1 ratio of less than 3.0%. Critically\nundercapitalized status is triggered if an institution has a ratio of tangible equity (as defined in the regulations) to total assets that\nis equal to or less than 2.0%.\nUndercapitalized banks must adhere to growth, capital distribution (including dividend) and other limitations and are\nrequired to submit a capital restoration plan. A bank’s compliance with such a plan must be guaranteed by any company that\ncontrols the undercapitalized institution in an amount equal to the lesser of 5.0% of the institution’s total assets when deemed\nundercapitalized or the amount necessary to achieve the adequately capitalized status. If an undercapitalized bank fails to submit\nan acceptable plan, it is treated as if it is significantly undercapitalized. Significantly undercapitalized banks must comply with\none or more of a number of additional measures including, but not limited to, a required sale of sufficient voting stock to become\nadequately capitalized, a requirement to reduce total assets, cessation of taking deposits from correspondent banks, the dismissal\nof directors or officers and restrictions on interest rates paid on deposits, compensation of executive officers and capital\ndistributions by the parent holding company. Critically undercapitalized institutions are subject to additional measures including,\nsubject to a narrow exception, the appointment of a receiver or conservator within 270 days after such status is triggered. These\nactions are in addition to other discretionary supervisory or enforcement actions that the FDIC may take.\nAs of June 30, 2024, Kearny Bank was well capitalized.\nDividend Limitations. Federal regulations impose various restrictions or requirements on Kearny Bank to pay dividends\nto Kearny Financial. An institution that is a subsidiary of a savings and loan holding company, such as Kearny Bank, must file\nnotice with the Federal Reserve Board at least thirty days before paying a dividend. The Federal Reserve Board may disapprove a\nnotice if: (i) the savings institution would be undercapitalized following the capital distribution; (ii) the proposed capital\ndistribution raises safety and soundness concerns; or (iii) the capital distribution would violate a prohibition contained in any\nstatute, regulation, enforcement action or agreement or condition imposed in connection with an application.\nNew Jersey law specifies that no dividend may be paid if the dividend would impair the capital stock of the savings\nbank. In addition, no dividend may be paid unless the savings bank would, after payment of the dividend, have a surplus of at\nleast 50% of its capital stock (or if the payment of dividend would not reduce surplus).\n23\nTransactions with Related Parties. Transactions between a depository institution (and, generally, its subsidiaries) and its\nrelated parties or affiliates are limited by Sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act. An affiliate of an institution is any\ncompany or entity that controls, is controlled by or is under common control with the institution. In a holding company context,\nthe parent holding company and any companies that are controlled by such parent holding company are affiliates of the\ninstitution. Generally, Section 23A of the Federal Reserve Act limits the extent to which the institution or its subsidiaries may\nengage in covered transactions with any one affiliate to 10% of such institution’s capital stock and surplus and contain an\naggregate limit on all such transactions with all affiliates to an amount equal to 20% of such institution’s capital stock and surplus.\nThe term “covered transaction” includes an extension of credit, purchase of assets, issuance of a guarantee or letter of credit and\nsimilar transactions. In addition, loans or other extensions of credit by the institution to the affiliate are required to be\ncollateralized in accordance with specified requirements.\nThe law also requires that affiliate transactions generally be on terms and conditions that are substantially the same as, or\nat least as favorable to the institution as, those provided to non-affiliates.\nKearny Bank’s authority to extend credit to its directors, executive officers and 10% stockholders, as well as to entities\ncontrolled by such persons, is governed by the requirements of Sections 22(g) and 22(h) of the Federal Reserve Act and\nRegulation O of the Federal Reserve Board. Among other things, subject to certain exceptions, these provisions generally require\nthat extensions of credit to insiders:\n• be made on terms that are substantially the same as, and follow credit underwriting procedures that are not less\nstringent than, those prevailing for comparable transactions with unaffiliated persons and that do not involve\nmore than the normal risk of repayment or present other unfavorable features; and\n• not exceed certain limitations on the amount of credit extended to such persons, individually and in the\naggregate, which limits are based, in part, on the amount of Kearny Bank’s regulatory capital.\nIn addition, extensions of credit in excess of certain limits must be approved by Kearny Bank’s Board of Directors.\nExtensions of credit to executive officers are subject to additional limits based on the type of extension involved.\nCommunity Reinvestment Act. Under the Community Reinvestment Act (the “CRA”), every insured depository\ninstitution, including Kearny Bank, has a continuing and affirmative obligation consistent with its safe and sound operation to\nhelp meet the credit needs of its entire community, including low and moderate income neighborhoods. The CRA does not\nestablish specific lending requirements or programs for financial institutions nor does it limit an institution’s discretion to develop\nthe types of products and services that it believes are best suited to its particular community. The CRA requires the FDIC to assess\nthe depository institution’s record of meeting the credit needs of its community and consider that record in its consideration of\ncertain applications by the institution, such as for a merger or the establishment of a branch office. The FDIC may use an\nunsatisfactory CRA examination rating as the basis for denying such an application. Kearny Bank received a satisfactory CRA\nrating from the FDIC in its most recent CRA evaluation.\nOn October 24, 2023, the FDIC, the Federal Reserve Board and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency issued a\nfinal rule to “strengthen and modernize” the CRA regulations and the related regulatory framework. Under the final rule, banks\nwith assets of at least $2 billion as of December 31 for each of the prior two calendar years, such as Kearny Bank, are classified as\na large bank. The federal agencies will evaluate large banks under four performance tests, the Retail Lending Test. Although the\neffective date of the final rule is April 2, 2024, the applicability date for the majority of the provisions in the new CRA regulations\nis January 1, 2026, and additional requirements will be applicable on January 1, 2027.\nCommercial Real Estate Lending Concentrations. The federal banking agencies have issued guidance on sound risk\nmanagement practices for concentrations in commercial real estate lending. The particular focus is on exposure to commercial\nreal estate loans that are dependent on the cash flow from the real estate held as collateral and that are likely to be sensitive to\nconditions in the commercial real estate market (as opposed to real estate collateral held as a secondary source of repayment or as\nan abundance of caution). The purpose of the guidance is not to limit a bank’s commercial real estate lending but to guide banks\nin developing risk management practices and capital levels commensurate with the level and nature of real estate concentrations.\nThe guidance directs the FDIC and other federal bank regulatory agencies to focus their supervisory resources on institutions that\nmay have significant commercial real estate loan concentration risk. A bank that has experienced rapid growth in commercial real\nestate lending, has notable exposure to a specific type of commercial real estate loan, or is approaching or exceeding the following\nsupervisory criteria may be identified for further supervisory analysis with respect to real estate concentration risk:\n• Total reported loans for construction, land development and other land represent 100% or more of the bank’s\ncapital; or\n24\n• Total commercial real estate loans (as defined in the guidance) represent 300% or more of the bank’s total\ncapital or the outstanding balance of the bank’s commercial real estate loan portfolio has increased 50% or more\nduring the prior 36 months.\nThe guidance provides that the strength of an institution’s lending and risk management practices with respect to such\nconcentrations will be taken into account in supervisory guidance on evaluation of capital adequacy.\nFederal Home Loan Bank System. Kearny Bank is a member of the FHLB of New York, which is one of eleven\nregional Federal Home Loan Banks. Each FHLB serves as a reserve or central bank for its members within its assigned region. It\nis funded primarily from funds deposited by financial institutions and proceeds derived from the sale of consolidated obligations\nof the FHLB System. It makes loans to members pursuant to policies and procedures established by the Board of Directors of the\nFHLB.\nAs a member, Kearny Bank is required to purchase and maintain stock in the FHLB of New York in specified amounts.\nThe FHLB imposes various limitations on advances such as limiting the amount of certain types of real estate related collateral\nand limiting total advances to a member.\nThe FHLB of New York may pay periodic dividends to members. These dividends are affected by factors such as the\nFHLB’s operating results and statutory responsibilities that may be imposed such as providing certain funding for affordable\nhousing and interest subsidies on advances targeted for low- and moderate-income housing projects. The payment dividends, or\nany particular amount of dividend, cannot be assumed.\nOther Laws and Regulations\nInterest and other charges collected or contracted for by Kearny Bank are subject to state usury laws and federal laws\nconcerning interest rates. Kearny Bank’s operations are also subject to federal laws (and their implementing regulations)\napplicable to credit transactions, such as the:\n• Truth-In-Lending Act, governing disclosures of credit terms to consumer borrowers;\n• Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act, requiring that borrowers for mortgage loans for one- to four-family\nresidential real estate receive various disclosures, including good faith estimates of settlement costs, lender\nservicing and escrow account practices, and prohibiting certain practices that increase the cost of settlement\nservices;\n• Home Mortgage Disclosure Act, requiring financial institutions to provide information to enable the public and\npublic officials to determine whether a financial institution is fulfilling its obligation to help meet the housing\nneeds of the community it serves;\n• Equal Credit Opportunity Act, prohibiting discrimination on the basis of race, creed or other prohibited factors\nin extending credit;\n• Fair Credit Reporting Act, governing the use and provision of information to credit reporting agencies;\n• Fair Debt Collection Act, governing the manner in which consumer debts may be collected by collection\nagencies; and\n• Truth in Savings Act, prescribing disclosure and advertising requirements with respect to deposit accounts.\nThe operations of Kearny Bank also are subject to the:\n• Right to Financial Privacy Act, which imposes a duty to maintain confidentiality of consumer financial records\nand prescribes procedures for complying with administrative subpoenas of financial records;\n• Electronic Funds Transfer Act, and Regulation E promulgated thereunder, governing automatic deposits to and\nwithdrawals from deposit accounts and customers’ rights and liabilities arising from the use of automated teller\nmachines and other electronic banking services;\n• Check Clearing for the 21st Century Act (also known as “Check 21”), which gives substitute checks, such as\ndigital check images and copies made from that image, the same legal standing as the original paper check;\n• USA PATRIOT Act, which requires institutions operating to, among other things, establish broadened anti-\nmoney laundering compliance programs, due diligence policies and controls to ensure the detection and\nreporting of money laundering. Such required compliance programs are intended to supplement existing\n25\ncompliance requirements, also applicable to financial institutions, under the Bank Secrecy Act and the Office of\nForeign Assets Control regulations;\n• Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, which places limitations on the sharing of consumer financial information by\nfinancial institutions with unaffiliated third parties. Specifically, the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act requires all\nfinancial institutions offering financial products or services to retail customers to provide such customers with\nthe financial institution’s privacy policy and provide such customers the opportunity to opt out of the sharing of\ncertain personal financial information with unaffiliated third parties; and\n• Regulations requiring banking organizations to notify their primary federal regulator as soon as possible and no\nlater than 36 hours of determining that a “computer-security incident” that arises to the level of a “notification\nincident” has occurred. A notification incident is a “computer-security incident” that has materially disrupted or\ndegraded, or is reasonably likely to materially disrupt or degrade, the banking organization’s ability to deliver\nservices to a material portion of its customer base, jeopardize the viability of key operations of the banking\norganization, or impact the stability of the financial sector. Bank service providers are also required to notify\nany affected bank to or on behalf of which the service provider provides services “as soon as possible” after\ndetermining that it has experienced an incident that materially disrupts or degrades, or is reasonably likely to\nmaterially disrupt or degrade, covered services provided to such bank for four or more hours.\nRegulation of Kearny Financial\nGeneral. Kearny Financial is a savings and loan holding company within the meaning of federal law. Kearny Financial\nmaintained its savings and loan holding company status (rather than becoming a bank holding company), notwithstanding the\nJune 2017 conversion of Kearny Bank to a New Jersey savings bank charter, through Kearny Bank exercising an election\navailable to it under federal law. Kearny Financial is required to file reports with, and is subject to regulation and examination by,\nthe Federal Reserve Board. Kearny Financial must also obtain regulatory approval from the Federal Reserve Board before\nengaging in certain transactions, such as mergers with or acquisitions of other depository institutions.\nIn addition, the Federal Reserve Board has enforcement authority over Kearny Financial and any non-depository\nsubsidiaries. That permits the Federal Reserve Board to restrict or prohibit activities that are determined to pose a serious risk to\nKearny Bank. This regulatory structure is intended primarily for protection of Kearny Bank’s depositors and not for the benefit of\nstockholders of Kearny Financial.\nThe Federal Reserve Board has indicated that, to the greatest extent possible taking into account any unique\ncharacteristics of savings and loan holding companies and the requirements of federal law, its approach is to apply to savings and\nloan holding companies the supervisory principles applicable to the supervision of bank holding companies. The stated objective\nof the Federal Reserve Board is to ensure the savings and loan holding company and its non-depository subsidiaries are\neffectively supervised, can serve as a source of strength for and do not threaten the safety and soundness of, the subsidiary\ndepository institution.\nNonbanking Activities. As a savings and loan holding company, Kearny Financial is permitted to engage in those\nactivities permissible under federal law for financial holding companies (if certain criteria are met and an election is submitted)\nand for multiple savings and loan holding companies. A financial holding company may engage in activities that are financial in\nnature, including underwriting equity securities and insurance, as well as activities that are incidental to financial activities or\ncomplementary to a financial activity. A multiple savings and loan holding company is generally limited to activities permissible\nfor bank holding companies under Section 4(c)(8) of the Bank Holding Company Act and certain additional activities authorized\nby federal regulations, subject to the approval of the Federal Reserve Board.\nMergers and Acquisitions. Kearny Financial must generally obtain approval from the Federal Reserve Board before\nacquiring, directly or indirectly, more than 5% of the voting stock of another savings institution or savings and loan holding\ncompany or acquiring such an institution or holding company by merger, consolidation, or purchase of its assets. Federal law also\nprohibits a savings and loan holding company from acquiring more than 5% of a company engaged in activities other than those\nauthorized for savings and loan holding companies by federal law or acquiring or retaining control of a depository institution that\nis not insured by the FDIC. In evaluating an application for Kearny Financial to acquire control of a savings institution, the\nFederal Reserve Board considers factors such as the financial and managerial resources and future prospects of Kearny Financial\nand the target institution, the effect of the acquisition on the risk to the deposit insurance fund, the convenience and the needs of\nthe community served and competitive factors. A merger of another depository institution into Kearny Bank requires the prior\napproval of the NJDBI and FDIC, based on similar considerations.\n26\nConsolidated Capital Requirements. Consolidated regulatory capital requirements identical to those applicable to the\nsubsidiary depository institutions (including the community bank leverage ratio alternative) apply to savings and loan holding\ncompanies with $3 billion or more of consolidated assets, including Kearny Financial. Kearny Financial was in compliance with\nthe holding company capital requirements and the capital conservation buffer as of June 30, 2024.\nSource of Strength Doctrine; Dividends. Federal law extended the source of strength doctrine, which has long applied to\nbank holding companies, to savings and loan holding companies. The Federal Reserve Board has promulgated regulations\nimplementing the source of strength policy, which requires holding companies to act as a source of strength to their subsidiary\ndepository institutions by providing capital, liquidity and other support in times of financial distress. Further, the Federal Reserve\nBoard has issued a policy statement regarding the payment of dividends by bank holding companies that it has also applied to\nsavings and loan holding companies. In general, the policy provides that dividends should be paid only out of current earnings and\nonly if the prospective rate of earnings retention by the holding company appears consistent with the organization’s capital needs,\nasset quality and overall financial condition. Regulatory guidance provides for prior consultation with Federal Reserve\nsupervisory staff as to dividends in certain circumstances, such as when the dividend is not covered by earnings for the period for\nwhich it is being paid, when net income for the past four quarters, net of dividends previously paid over that period, is insufficient\nto fully fund the dividend or when the prospective rate of earnings retention by the holding company is inconsistent with its\ncapital needs and overall financial condition. The ability of a holding company to pay dividends may be restricted if a subsidiary\ndepository institution becomes undercapitalized. In addition, a subsidiary institution of a savings and loan holding company must\nfile prior notice with the Federal Reserve Board, and receive its non-objection, before paying a dividend to the parent savings and\nloan holding company. Federal Reserve Board guidance also provides for regulatory review of certain stock redemption and\nrepurchase proposals by holding companies. These regulatory policies could affect the ability of Kearny Financial to pay\ndividends, engage in stock redemptions or repurchases or otherwise engage in capital distributions.\nQualified Thrift Lender Test. In order for Kearny Financial to be regulated by the Federal Reserve Board as a savings\nand loan holding company (rather than as a bank holding company), Kearny Bank must remain a qualified thrift lender under\napplicable law or satisfy the domestic building and loan association test under the Internal Revenue Code. Under the qualified\nthrift lender test, an institution is generally required to maintain at least 65% of its portfolio assets (total assets less: (i) specified\nliquid assets up to 20% of total assets; (ii) intangible assets, including goodwill; and (iii) the value of property used to conduct\nbusiness) in certain qualified thrift investments (primarily residential mortgages and related investments, including certain\nmortgage-backed and related securities) in at least nine months out of each 12 month period. As of June 30, 2024, Kearny Bank\nmet the qualified thrift lender test.\nAcquisition of Control. Under the federal Change in Bank Control Act, a notice must be submitted to the Federal\nReserve Board if any person (including a company), or group acting in concert, seeks to acquire control of a savings and loan\nholding company. An acquisition of control can occur upon the acquisition of 10% or more of a class of voting stock of a savings\nand loan holding company or as otherwise defined by the Federal Reserve Board. Under the Change in Bank Control Act, the\nFederal Reserve Board has 60 days from the filing of a complete notice to act, taking into consideration certain factors, including\nthe financial condition of the acquirer, and future prospects of the proposed acquirer, the competence and integrity of the proposed\nacquirer and the effects of the acquisition on competition. Any company that seeks to acquire “control” of Kearny Financial or\nKearny Bank, within the meaning of the Savings and Loan Holding Company Act, must file an application, and receive the\nFederal Reserve Board’s prior approval under that statute. The Company would then be subject to regulation as a savings and loan\nholding company.\nThe prior approval of the NJDBI would also be necessary for the acquisition of 25% of a class of the Company’s voting\nstock, or “control” as otherwise defined under New Jersey law.\nIncentive Compensation. In October 2022, the SEC adopted a final rule implementing the incentive-based compensation\nrecovery (“clawback”) provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act. The final rule directs national securities exchanges and associations,\nincluding NASDAQ, to require listed companies to develop and implement clawback policies to recover erroneously awarded\nincentive-based compensation from current or former executive officers in the event of a required accounting restatement due to\nmaterial noncompliance with any financial reporting requirement under the securities laws, and to disclose their clawback policies\nand any actions taken under these policies. On June 9, 2023, the SEC approved the NASDAQ proposed clawback listing\nstandards, including the amendments that delay the effective date of the rules to October 2, 2023. The Board of Directors of\nKearny Financial approved the adoption of a clawback policy in October 2023, pursuant to the NASDAQ clawback listing\nstandards. A copy of the Company’s clawback policy is included as an exhibit to this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n27\nItem 1A. Risk Factors\nAn investment in our securities is subject to risks inherent in our business and the industry in which we operate. Before\nmaking an investment decision, you should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below and all other\ninformation included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The risks described below may adversely affect our business, financial\ncondition and operating results. In addition to these risks and any other risks or uncertainties described in “Item 1. Business—\nForward-Looking Statements” and “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of\nOperations,” there may be additional risks and uncertainties that are not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be\nimmaterial that could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition or operating results. The value or market\nprice of our securities could decline due to any of these identified or other risks. Past financial performance may not be a reliable\nindicator of future performance, and historical trends should not be used to anticipate results or trends in future periods.\nInterest Rate\nOur business and financial performance are impacted by market interest rates and movements in those rates.\nWe derive our income mainly from the difference or spread between the interest earned on loans, securities and other\ninterest-earning assets and interest paid on deposits, borrowings and other interest-bearing liabilities. In general, the larger the\nspread, the more we earn. When market rates of interest change, the interest we receive on our assets and the interest we pay on\nour liabilities will fluctuate. This can cause decreases in our spread and can adversely affect our income.\nBeginning in March 2022, in response to rising inflation, the Federal Reserve Board’s Federal Open Market Committee\nsystemically increased the target rate from 0.00% – 0.25% to 5.25% – 5.50% in July 2023. In addition, at June 30, 2024, the yield\ncurve has remained inverted as short-term rates remain higher than long-term rates. Our net interest spread and net interest margin\nhave been and may in the future be reduced by potential increases in our cost of funds that may outpace any increases in our yield\non interest-earnings assets.\nIn addition, it may take longer for our assets to reprice to adjust to a new rate environment because fixed rate loans do\nnot fluctuate with interest rate changes and adjustable rate loans often have a specified initial fixed rate period before reset. As a\nresult, a flattening or an inversion of the yield curve is likely to have a negative impact on our net interest income.\nInterest rates also affect how much money we lend. For example, when interest rates rise, the cost of borrowing increases\nand loan originations tend to decrease. In addition, changes in interest rates can affect the average life of loans and securities. For\nexample, a reduction in interest rates generally results in increased prepayments of loans and mortgage-backed securities, as\nborrowers refinance their debt in order to reduce their borrowing cost. Changes in market interest rates also impact the value of\nour interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities as well as the value of our derivatives portfolios. In particular, the\nunrealized gains and losses on securities available for sale and changes in the fair value of interest rate derivatives serving as cash\nflows hedges are reported, net of tax, in accumulated other comprehensive income which is a component of stockholders’ equity.\nConsequently, declines in the fair value of these instruments resulting from changes in market interest rates have, and may\ncontinue to, adversely affect stockholders’ equity.\nA significant portion of our assets consists of investment securities, which generally have lower yields than loans, and we\nclassify a significant portion of our investment securities as available for sale, which creates potential volatility in our\nequity and may have an adverse impact on our net income.\nAs of June 30, 2024, our securities portfolio totaled $1.21 billion, or 15.7% of our total assets. Investment securities\ntypically have lower yields than loans. For the year ended June 30, 2024, the weighted average yield of our investment securities\nportfolio was 4.38%, as compared to 4.45% for our loan portfolio.\nAccordingly, our net interest margin is lower than it would have been if a higher proportion of our interest-earning assets\nconsisted of loans. Additionally, at June 30, 2024, $1.07 billion, or 88.8% of our investment securities, are classified as available\nfor sale and reported at fair value with unrealized gains or losses excluded from earnings and reported in other comprehensive\nincome, which affects our reported equity. Accordingly, given the significant size of the investment securities portfolio classified\nas available for sale and due to possible mark-to-market adjustments of that portion of the portfolio resulting from market\nconditions, we may experience greater volatility in the value of reported equity. Moreover, given that we actively manage our\ninvestment securities portfolio classified as available for sale, we may sell securities which could result in a realized loss, thereby\nreducing our net income.\n28\nAsset Quality\nIf our allowance for credit losses is not sufficient to cover actual loan losses, our earnings will decrease.\nWe make various assumptions and judgments about the collectability of our loan portfolio, including the\ncreditworthiness of our borrowers and the value of the real estate and other assets serving as collateral for the repayment of many\nof our loans. In determining the required amount of the allowance for credit losses, we evaluate loans individually and establish\ncredit loss allowances for specifically identified impairments. For loans not individually analyzed, we estimate losses and\nestablish reserves based on reasonable and supportable forecasts and adjustments for qualitative factors. If the assumptions used\nin our calculation methodology are incorrect, our allowance for credit losses may not be sufficient to cover losses inherent in our\nloan portfolio, resulting in further additions to our allowance. Our allowance for credit losses on loans was 0.78% of total loans at\nJune 30, 2024 and significant additions to our allowance could materially decrease our net income.\nIn addition, bank regulators periodically review our allowance for credit losses and may require us to increase our\nprovision for credit losses or recognize further loan charge-offs. Any increase in our allowance for credit losses or loan charge-\noffs as required by these regulatory authorities might have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of\noperations.\nOur commercial lending exposes us to additional risk.\nOver the past several years, we have increased our focus on commercial lending. Our increased commercial lending,\nhowever, exposes us to greater risks than one- to four-family residential lending. Unlike single-family, owner-occupied residential\nmortgage loans, which generally are made on the basis of the borrower’s ability to make repayment from employment and other\nincome sources, and are secured by real property whose value tends to be more easily ascertainable and realizable, the repayment\nof commercial loans typically is dependent on the successful operation and income stream of the borrower, which can be\nsignificantly affected by economic conditions, and are secured, if at all, by collateral that is more difficult to value or sell or by\ncollateral which may depreciate in value. In addition, commercial loans generally carry larger balances to single borrowers or\nrelated groups of borrowers than one- to four-family mortgage loans, which increases the financial impact of a borrower’s default.\nThe risk exposure from our increased commercial lending is also a function of the markets in which we operate. Our\ncommercial lending activity is generally focused on borrowers domiciled, and real estate located, within the states of New Jersey\nand New York. Regional risk factors and changes to local laws and regulations, including changes to rent regulations or\nforeclosure laws, may present greater risk than a more geographically diversified portfolio.\nOur increased commercial business and construction loan originations exposes us to increased credit risk.\nWe have increased our originations of commercial business and construction loans, which generally have more risk than\nboth one- to four-family residential and commercial mortgage loans. Since repayment of commercial business and construction\nloans may depend on the successful operation of the borrower’s business or the successful completion of a construction project,\nrepayment of such loans can be affected by adverse conditions in the real estate market or the local economy. If we continue to\nincrease our originations of these loans, it may be necessary to increase the level of our allowance for credit losses because of the\nincreased risk characteristics associated with these types of loans. Any such increase to our allowance for credit losses would\nadversely affect our earnings.\nWe have a significant concentration in commercial real estate loans. If our regulators were to curtail our commercial real\nestate lending activities, our earnings and/or dividend paying capacity could be adversely affected.\nIn 2006, the FDIC, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve\nSystem issued joint guidance entitled “Concentrations in Commercial Real Estate Lending, Sound Risk Management\nPractices” (the “Guidance”). The Guidance provides that a bank’s commercial real estate lending exposure may receive increased\nsupervisory scrutiny when total non-owner occupied commercial real estate loans, including loans secured by multi-family\nproperty, non-owner occupied commercial real estate and construction loans, represent 300% or more of an institution’s total risk-\nbased capital and the outstanding balance of the commercial real estate loan portfolio has increased by 50% or more during the\npreceding 36 months. Our level of non-owner occupied commercial real estate equaled 537% of Bank total risk-based capital at\nJune 30, 2024, however our commercial real estate loan portfolio increased by only 19% during the preceding 36 months.\nIncome from secondary mortgage market operations is volatile, and we may incur losses with respect to our secondary\nmortgage market operations that could negatively affect our earnings.\nA component of our business strategy is to sell a portion of residential mortgage loans originated into the secondary\nmarket, earning non-interest income in the form of gains on sale. For the year ended June 30, 2024, gains attributable to the sale\nof residential mortgage loans totaled $602,000, a decline of $158,000 from $760,000 for the year ended June 30, 2023. When\ninterest rates rise, as they have in the current environment, the demand for mortgage loans tends to fall and may reduce the\n29\nnumber of loans we can originate for sale. Weak or deteriorating economic conditions also tend to reduce loan demand. If the\nresidential mortgage loan demand decreases or we are unable to sell such loans for an adequate profit, then our non-interest\nincome will likely decline which would adversely affect our earnings.\nWe may be required to record impairment charges with respect to our investment securities portfolio.\nWe review our securities portfolio at the end of each quarter to determine whether the fair value is below the current\ncarrying value. When the fair value of any of our investment securities has declined below its carrying value, we are required to\nassess whether we intend to sell, or it is more than likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovery of its\namortized cost basis. If this assessment indicates that a credit loss exists, we would be required to record an impairment charge.\nWe elected the practical expedient of zero loss estimates for securities issued by U.S. government entities and agencies.\nA possible future downgrade of the sovereign credit ratings of the U.S. government and a decline in the perceived\ncreditworthiness of U.S. government-related obligations could adversely impact the value of our investment securities portfolio.\nWe cannot predict if, when or how any changes to the credit ratings or perceived creditworthiness of these organizations will\naffect economic conditions. A downgrade of the sovereign credit ratings of the U.S. government or the credit ratings of related\ninstitutions, agencies or instruments would significantly exacerbate the other risks to which we are subject and any related adverse\neffects on the business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAt June 30, 2024, we had investment securities with fair values of approximately $1.19 billion on which we had\napproximately $150.1 million in gross unrealized losses and $2.9 million of gross unrealized gains. The valuation and liquidity of\nour securities could be adversely impacted by reduced market liquidity, increased normal bid-asked spreads and increased\nuncertainty of market participants, which could reduce the market value of our securities, including those with no apparent credit\nexposure. The valuation of our securities requires judgment and as market conditions change security values may also change.\nSignificant negative changes to valuations could result in impairments in the value of our securities portfolio, which could have an\nadverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.\nOur investments in corporate and municipal debt securities, subordinated debt securities and collateralized loan\nobligations expose us to additional credit risks.\nThe composition and allocation of our investment portfolio has historically emphasized U.S. agency mortgage-backed\nsecurities and U.S. agency debentures. While such assets remain a significant component of our investment portfolio at June 30,\n2024, prior enhancements to our investment policies, strategies and infrastructure have enabled us to diversify the composition\nand allocation of our securities portfolio. Such diversification has included investing in corporate debt, municipal obligations,\nsubordinated debt securities issued by financial institutions and collateralized loan obligations. With the exception of\ncollateralized loan obligations, these securities are generally backed only by the credit of their issuers while investments in\ncollateralized loan obligations generally rely on the structural characteristics of an individual tranche within a larger investment\nvehicle to protect the investor from credit losses arising from borrowers defaulting on the underlying securitized loans.\nWhile we have invested primarily in investment grade securities, these securities are not backed by the federal\ngovernment and expose us to a greater degree of credit risk than U.S. agency securities. Any decline in the credit quality of these\nsecurities exposes us to the risk that the market value of the securities could decrease which may require us to write down their\nvalue and could lead to a possible default in payment.\nEconomic and Market Area\nChanges in economic conditions, in particular an economic slowdown in the markets we operate in, could materially and\nnegatively affect our business.\nOur business is directly impacted by factors such as economic, political and market conditions, broad trends in industry\nand finance, legislative and regulatory changes, changes in government monetary and fiscal policies and inflation, all of which are\nbeyond our control. Any deterioration in economic conditions, whether caused by national or local concerns, in particular any\nfurther economic slowdown in the markets we operate in, could result in the following consequences, any of which could hurt our\nbusiness materially: loan delinquencies may increase; problem assets and foreclosures may increase; demand for our products and\nservices may decrease; low cost or non-interest bearing deposits may decrease; and collateral for loans made by us, especially real\nestate, may decline in value, in turn reducing customers’ borrowing power, and reducing the value of assets and collateral\nassociated with our existing loans.\nOur success significantly depends upon the growth in population, income levels, deposits, and housing starts in our\nmarkets. If the communities in which we operate do not grow or if prevailing economic conditions locally or nationally are\nunfavorable, our business may not succeed. An economic downturn or prolonged recession may result in the deterioration of the\n30\nquality of our loan portfolio and reduce our level of deposits, which in turn would hurt its business. If we experience an economic\ndownturn or a prolonged economic recession occurs in the economy as a whole, borrowers will be less likely to repay their loans\nas scheduled. Unlike many larger institutions, we are not able to spread the risks of unfavorable local economic conditions across\na large number of diversified economies. An economic downturn could, therefore, result in losses that materially and adversely\naffect our business.\nInflation has had, and may continue to have a negative effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nInflation rose sharply at the end of 2021 and has remained at an elevated level through the first half of calendar 2024.\nSmall to medium-sized businesses may be impacted more during periods of high inflation as they are not able to leverage\neconomics of scale to mitigate cost pressures compared to larger businesses. Consequently, the ability of our business customers\nto repay their loans may deteriorate, and in some cases this deterioration may occur quickly, which would adversely impact our\nresults of operations and financial condition. Furthermore, a prolonged period of inflation could cause wages and other costs to\nthe Company to increase, which has and could continue to adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nSevere weather could harm our business.\nWeather-related events, including those that may result from climate change, can disrupt our operations, result in damage\nto our properties, reduce or destroy the value of the collateral for our loans and negatively affect the local economies in which we\noperate, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. The occurrence of a\nnatural disaster could result in one or more of the following: (i) an increase in loan delinquencies; (ii) an increase in problem\nassets and foreclosures; (iii) a decrease in the demand for our products and services; or (iv) a decrease in the value of the collateral\nfor loans, especially real estate, in turn reducing clients’ borrowing power, the value of assets associated with problem loans and\ncollateral coverage. Weather-related events may cause significant flooding and other storm-related damage and these outcomes\nmay become more common in the future.\nActs of terrorism, public health issues, and geopolitical and other external events could impact our ability to conduct\nbusiness.\nFinancial institutions have been, and continue to be, targets of terrorist threats aimed at compromising operating and\ncommunication systems. Additionally, the metropolitan New York area and northern New Jersey remain central targets for\npotential acts of terrorism. Such events could cause significant damage, impact the stability of our facilities and result in\nadditional expenses, impair the ability of our borrowers to repay their loans, reduce the value of collateral securing repayment of\nour loans, and result in the loss of revenue. While we have established and regularly test disaster recovery procedures, the\noccurrence of any such event could have a material adverse effect on our business, operations and financial condition.\nAdditionally, global markets may be adversely affected by the emergence of widespread health emergencies or\npandemics, cyber attacks or campaigns, military conflicts, terrorism or other geopolitical events, including the military conflict\nbetween Russia and Ukraine. The impact of global market fluctuations may affect our business liquidity. Also, any sudden or\nprolonged market downturn in the U.S. or abroad as a result of the above factors or otherwise could result in a decline in revenues\nand adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition, including capital and liquidity levels.\nWe face intense competition from other financial services and financial services technology companies, and competitive\npressures could adversely affect our business or financial performance.\nWe face intense competition in all of its markets and geographic regions. We expect competitive pressures to intensify in\nthe future, especially in light of legislative and regulatory initiatives arising out of the recent global economic crisis, technological\ninnovations that alter the barriers to entry, current economic and market conditions, and government monetary and fiscal policies.\nCompetition with financial services technology companies, or technology companies partnering with financial services\ncompanies, may be particularly intense, due to, among other things, differing regulatory environments. Competitive pressures\nmay drive us to take actions that we might otherwise eschew, such as lowering the interest rates or fees on loans or raising the\ninterest rates on deposits in order to keep or attract high-quality clients. These pressures also may accelerate actions that we might\notherwise elect to defer, such as substantial investments in technology or infrastructure. The actions that we take in response to\ncompetition may adversely affect its results of operations and financial condition. These consequences could be exacerbated if we\nare not successful in introducing new products and other services, achieving market acceptance of its products and other services,\ndeveloping and maintaining a strong client base, or prudently managing expenses.\n31\nFunding\nOur reliance on wholesale funding could adversely affect our liquidity and operating results.\nAmong other sources of funds, we rely on wholesale funding, including short- and long-term borrowings and brokered\ndeposits, to provide funds with which to make loans, purchase investment securities and provide for other liquidity needs. On\nJune 30, 2024, wholesale funding totaled $2.12 billion, or approximately 27.6% of total assets.\nIn the future, this funding may not be readily replaced as it matures, or we may have to pay a higher rate of interest to\nmaintain it. Not being able to maintain or replace those funds as they mature would adversely affect our liquidity. Paying higher\ninterest rates to maintain or replace funding would adversely affect our net interest margin and operating results.\nA lack of liquidity could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations and result in regulatory limits\nbeing placed on the Company.\nLiquidity is essential to our business. We rely on our ability to gather deposits, make investments and effectively manage\nthe repayment and maturity schedules of loans to ensure that there is adequate liquidity to fund our operations and pay our\nobligations. An inability to raise funds through deposits, borrowings, the sale and maturities of loans and securities and other\nsources could have a substantial negative effect on liquidity. Our most important source of funds is deposits. Deposit balances can\ndecrease when customers perceive alternative investments as providing a better risk/return tradeoff, which are strongly influenced\nby external factors such as changes in interest rates, local and national economic conditions, the availability and attractiveness of\nalternative investments, and perceptions of the stability of the financial services industry generally and of our institution\nspecifically. Further, the demand for deposits may be reduced due to a variety of factors such as demographic patterns, changes in\ncustomer preferences, reductions in consumers’ disposable income, the monetary policy of the FRB, or regulatory actions that\ndecrease customer access to particular products. If customers move money out of bank deposits and into other investments such as\nmoney market funds, we would lose a relatively low-cost source of funds, which would increase our funding costs and reduce net\ninterest income. Any changes made to the rates offered on deposits to remain competitive with other financial institutions may\nalso adversely affect profitability and liquidity.\nOther primary sources of funds consist of cash flows from operations, maturities and sales of investment securities and\nborrowings from the FHLB. We have the capacity to borrow additional funds from the FHLB as well as from the FRB without\npledging additional collateral, and via unsecured overnight borrowings from other financial institutions. Our access to funding\nsources in amounts adequate to finance or capitalize our activities, or on terms that are acceptable, could be impaired by factors\nthat affect us directly or the financial services industry or economy in general, such as disruptions in the financial markets,\nchanges in the value of investment securities, negative views and expectations about the prospects for the financial services\nindustry, a decrease in our business activity as a result of a downturn in markets, or adverse regulatory actions against us.\nAny decline in available funding could adversely impact our ability to originate loans, invest in securities, meet\nexpenses, or to fulfill obligations such as repaying borrowings or meeting deposit withdrawal demands, any of which could have a\nmaterial adverse impact on our liquidity, business, financial condition and results of operations.\nA lack of liquidity could also attract increased regulatory scrutiny and potential restraints imposed on us by regulators.\nDepending on the capitalization status and regulatory treatment of depository institutions, including whether an institution is\nsubject to a supervisory prompt corrective action directive, certain additional regulatory restrictions and prohibitions may apply,\nincluding restrictions on growth, restrictions on interest rates paid on deposits, restrictions or prohibitions on payment of\ndividends and restrictions on the acceptance of brokered deposits.\nPublic funds deposits are a notable source of funds for us and a reduced level of those deposits may hurt our profits and\nliquidity position.\nPublic funds deposits are a notable source of funds for our lending and investment activities. At June 30, 2024,\n$531.5 million, or 10.3% of our total deposits, consisted of public funds deposits from local government entities in the state of\nNew Jersey, such as townships, counties, school districts and charter schools. These deposits are collateralized by letters of credit\nfrom the FHLB or through the pledge of eligible investment securities. Given our reliance on these typically high-average balance\npublic funds deposits as a source of funds, our inability to retain such funds could adversely affect our liquidity. Further, our\npublic funds deposits are primarily floating rate interest-bearing demand deposit accounts and therefore their pricing is more\nsensitive to changes in interest rates. If we are forced to pay higher rates on our public funds accounts to retain those funds, or if\nwe are unable to retain such funds and we are forced to rely on other sources of funds for our lending and investment activities,\nsuch as borrowings from the FHLB, the interest expense associated with these other funding sources may be higher than the rates\nwe are currently paying on our public funds deposits, which would adversely affect our net interest income.\n32\nInformation Security\nRisks associated with system failures, service interruptions or other performance exceptions could negatively affect our\nearnings.\nInformation technology systems are critical to our business. We use various technology systems to manage our client\nrelationships, general ledger, securities investments, deposits, and loans. We have established policies and procedures to prevent\nor limit the effect of system failures, service interruptions or other performance exceptions, but such events may still occur or may\nnot be adequately addressed if they do occur. In addition, performance failures or other exceptions of our client-facing\ntechnologies could deter clients from using our products and services.\nWe rely on certain external vendors to provide products and services necessary to maintain our day-to-day operations.\nThese third party vendors are sources of operational and informational security risk to us, including risks associated with\noperational errors, information system interruptions or breaches and unauthorized disclosures of sensitive or confidential client or\ncustomer information. If these vendors encounter any of these issues, or if we have difficulty communicating with them, we could\nbe exposed to disruption of operations, loss of service or connectivity to customers, reputational damage, and litigation risk that\ncould have a material adverse effect on our business and, in turn, our financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks associated with cyber-security could negatively affect our earnings.\nThe financial services industry has experienced an increase in both the number and severity of reported cyber-attacks\naimed at gaining unauthorized access to bank systems as a way to misappropriate assets and sensitive information, corrupt and\ndestroy data, or cause operational disruptions. We have established policies and procedures to prevent or limit the impact of\nsecurity breaches, but such events may still occur or may not be adequately addressed if they do occur. Although we rely on\nsecurity safeguards to secure our data, these safeguards may not fully protect our systems from compromises or breaches. We also\nrely on the integrity and security of a variety of third party processors, payment, clearing and settlement systems, as well as the\nvarious participants involved in these systems, many of which have no direct relationship with us. Failure by these participants or\ntheir systems to protect our clients' transaction data may put us at risk for possible losses due to fraud or operational disruption.\nOur clients are also the target of cyber-attacks and identity theft. Large scale identity theft could result in clients'\naccounts being compromised and fraudulent activities being performed in their name. We have implemented certain safeguards\nagainst these types of activities but they may not fully protect us from fraudulent financial losses. The occurrence of a breach of\nsecurity involving our clients' information, regardless of its origin, could damage our reputation and result in a loss of clients and\nbusiness and subject us to additional regulatory scrutiny, and could expose us to litigation and possible financial liability. Any of\nthese events could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nWhile our Board of Directors takes an active role in cybersecurity risk tolerance, we rely to a large degree on management\nand outside consultants in overseeing cybersecurity risk management.\nOur Board of Directors takes an active role in the cybersecurity risk tolerance of the Company and all members receive\ncybersecurity training annually. The Board reviews the annual risk assessments and approves information technology policies,\nwhich include cybersecurity. Furthermore, our Audit Committee is responsible for reviewing all audit findings related to\ninformation technology general controls, internal and external vulnerability, and penetration testing. The Board receives an annual\ninformation security report and the Enterprise Risk Management Committee receives an annual presentation from our Information\nSecurity Officer as it relates to cybersecurity and related issues. We also engage outside consultants to support our cybersecurity\nefforts. However, our directors do not have significant experience in cybersecurity risk management outside of the Company and\ntherefore, its ability to fulfill its oversight function remains dependent on the input it receives from management and outside\nconsultants.\nRegulatory Matters\nWe operate in a highly regulated environment and may be adversely affected by changes in federal and state laws and\nregulations.\nThe financial services industry is extensively regulated. Federal and state banking regulations are designed primarily to\nprotect the deposit insurance funds and consumers, not to benefit a company’s shareholders. These regulations may sometimes\nimpose significant limitations on operations. The significant federal and state banking regulations that affect us are described\nunder the heading “Item 1. Business—Regulation.” These regulations, along with the currently existing tax, accounting,\nsecurities, insurance, and monetary laws, regulations, rules, standards, policies, and interpretations control the methods by which\nfinancial institutions conduct business, implement strategic initiatives and tax compliance, and govern financial reporting and\ndisclosures. New proposals for legislation continue to be introduced in the U.S. Congress that could further alter the regulation of\nthe bank and non-bank financial services industries and the manner in which companies within the industry conduct business.\n33\nIn addition, federal and state regulatory agencies also frequently adopt changes to their regulations or change the manner\nin which existing regulations are applied. Future changes in federal policy and at regulatory agencies may occur over time through\npolicy and personnel changes, which could lead to changes involving the level of oversight and focus on the financial services\nindustry. These changes may require us to invest significant management attention and resources to make any necessary changes\nto operations to comply and could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe performance of our multi-family loans could be adversely impacted by regulation.\nMulti-family loans generally involve risk of legislation and government regulations involving rent control and rent\nstabilization, which are outside the control of the borrower or the Company, and could impair the value of the collateral for the\nloan or the future cash flows of such properties. As a result of these restrictions, it is possible that rental income on certain rent-\nregulated properties might not rise sufficiently over time to satisfy increases in the loan rate at repricing or increases in overhead\nexpenses (e.g., utilities, taxes, etc.).\nChanges to tax laws and regulations could adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations.\nChanges in tax laws and/or regulatory requirements could be enacted. These changes in the law may be retroactive to\nprevious periods and as a result could negatively affect our current and future financial performance. An increase in our corporate\ntax rate could have an unfavorable impact on our earnings and capital generation abilities. Similarly, the Bank’s clients could\nexperience varying effects from changes in tax laws and such effects, whether positive or negative, may have a corresponding\nimpact on our business and the economy as a whole. In addition, changes to regulatory requirements could increase our costs of\nregulatory compliance and may significantly affect the markets in which we do business, the markets for and value of our loans\nand investments, and our ongoing operations, costs and profitability.\nBusiness Issues\nWe hold certain intangible assets, including goodwill, which have been partially impaired and could become further\nimpaired in the future. If these assets are further or fully impaired in the future, our earnings would decrease.\nAt June 30, 2024, we had approximately $115.5 million in intangible assets on our balance sheet, comprised of $113.5\nmillion of goodwill and $1.9 million of core deposit intangibles. We are required to periodically test our goodwill and identifiable\nintangible assets for impairment. The impairment testing process considers a variety of factors, including the current market price\nof our common stock, the estimated net present value of our assets and liabilities, and information concerning the terminal\nvaluation of similarly situated insured depository institutions. If an impairment determination is made in a future reporting period,\nour earnings and the book value of these intangible assets will be reduced by the amount of the impairment. If an impairment loss\nis recorded, it will have little or no impact on the tangible book value of our common stock or our regulatory capital levels, but\nrecognition of such an impairment loss could significantly restrict Kearny Bank’s ability to make dividend payments to Kearny\nFinancial and therefore adversely impact our ability to pay dividends to stockholders.\nWe cannot guarantee that our allocation of capital to various alternatives will enhance long-term stockholder value.\nOur business plan calls for us to execute a variety of strategies to allocate and deploy any excess capital including, but\nnot limited to, continued organic balance sheet growth and diversification, and payment of regular cash dividends. Additionally,\nwe will carefully consider acquisition opportunities to further deploy capital when we expect such opportunities to significantly\nenhance long-term shareholder value. If we are unable to effectively and timely deploy capital through these strategies, it may\nconstrain growth in earnings and return on equity and thereby diminish potential growth in stockholder value.\nOur acquisitions and the integration of acquired businesses, subject us to various risks and may not result in all of the cost\nsavings and benefits anticipated, which could adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations.\nWe have in the past, and may in the future, seek to grow our business by acquiring other businesses. There is risk that\nour acquisitions may not have the anticipated positive results, including results relating to: correctly assessing the asset quality of\nthe assets being acquired; the total cost and time required to complete the integration successfully; being able to profitably deploy\nfunds acquired in an acquisition; or the overall performance of the combined entity.\nAcquisitions may also result in business disruptions that could cause clients to remove their accounts from us and move\ntheir business to competing financial institutions. It is possible that the integration process related to acquisitions could result in\nthe disruption of our ongoing businesses or inconsistencies in standards, controls, procedures and policies that could adversely\naffect our ability to maintain relationships with clients and employees. The loss of key employees in connection with an\nacquisition could adversely affect our ability to successfully conduct our business. Acquisition and integration efforts could divert\nmanagement attention and resources, which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nAdditionally, the operation of the acquired branches may adversely affect our existing profitability, and we may not be able to\n34\nachieve results in the future similar to those achieved by the existing banking business or manage growth resulting from the\nacquisition effectively.\nBecause the nature of the financial services business involves a high volume of transactions, we face significant operational\nrisks.\nWe operate in diverse markets and rely on the ability of our employees and systems to process a high number of\ntransactions. Operational risk is the risk of loss resulting from our operations, including but not limited to, the risk of fraud by\nemployees or persons outside the Company, the execution of unauthorized transactions by employees, errors relating to\ntransaction processing and technology, breaches of the internal control system and compliance requirements, and business\ncontinuation and disaster recovery. Insurance coverage may not be available for such losses, or where available, such losses may\nexceed insurance limits. This risk of loss also includes the potential legal actions that could arise as a result of an operational\ndeficiency or as a result of noncompliance with applicable regulatory standards, adverse business decisions or their\nimplementation, and client attrition due to potential negative publicity. In the event of a breakdown in the internal control system,\nimproper operation of systems or improper employee actions, we could suffer financial loss, face regulatory action, and suffer\ndamage to our reputation.\nOur risk management framework may not be effective in mitigating risk and reducing the potential for significant losses.\nOur risk management framework is designed to effectively manage and mitigate risk while minimizing exposure to\npotential losses. We seek to identify, measure, monitor, report and control our exposure to risk, including strategic, market,\nliquidity, compliance and operational risks. While we use a broad and diversified set of risk monitoring and mitigation techniques,\nthese techniques are inherently limited because they cannot anticipate the existence or future development of currently\nunanticipated or unknown risks. Recent economic conditions and heightened legislative and regulatory scrutiny of the financial\nservices industry, among other developments, have increased our level of risk. Accordingly, we could suffer losses as a result of\nour failure to properly anticipate and manage these risks.\nWe could be adversely affected by failure in our internal controls.\nA failure in our internal controls could have a significant negative impact not only on our earnings, but also on the\nperception that clients, regulators and investors may have of us. We continue to devote a significant amount of effort, time and\nresources to continually strengthening our controls and ensuring compliance with complex accounting standards and banking\nregulations.\nThe inability to attract and retain key personnel could adversely affect our business.\nThe successful execution of our business strategy is partially dependent on our ability to attract and retain experienced\nand qualified personnel. Failure to do so could adversely affect our strategy, client relationships and internal operations.\nItem 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments\nNot applicable.\nItem 1C. Cybersecurity\nRisk Management and Strategy\nWe structure our information security program around the Federal Financial Institutions Examinations Council (FFIEC)\nInformation Security program guidance, including the FFIEC Cybersecurity Assessment Toolkit, regulatory guidance, and other\nindustry standards. We leverage industry and government associations, third-party benchmarking, audits and threat intelligence\nfeeds to promote program effectiveness. Our Chief Technology and Innovation Officer (\"CTIO\"), along with key members of\ntheir team, regularly collaborate with peer banks, industry groups, and policymakers.\nWe employ an in-depth, layered, defensive strategy with respect to our products, services and technology. We leverage\npeople, processes and technology to manage and maintain cybersecurity controls. We employ a variety of preventative and\ndetective tools designed to monitor, block, and provide alerts regarding suspicious activity, as well as to report on any suspected\nadvanced persistent threats.\nWe have established processes and systems to mitigate cyber risk, including regular education and training, preparedness\nsimulations and tabletop exercises, and recovery and resilience tests. Our processes, systems and controls are reviewed\nperiodically by internal and external auditors, Federal and State bank examiners, and independent external partners to assess\ndesign and operating effectiveness. We also maintain information security risk insurance coverage.\nWe engage third party security experts to supplement our internal Information Security team as well as for assessments,\npenetration tests and program enhancements, including vulnerability assessments, security framework maturity assessments and\n35\nidentification of areas for continued focus and improvement. In addition, our third-party experts work with us to conduct\ncybersecurity tabletop exercises and internal phishing awareness campaigns. We use the findings of these exercises to improve\nour practices, procedures, and technologies. We also engage third party security experts to support our cybersecurity threat and\nincident response management and maintain information security risk insurance coverage.\nWe engage with a range of external experts, including cybersecurity assessors, consultants, auditors, and legal counsel in\nevaluating and testing our risk management systems. This enables us to leverage specialized knowledge and insights, ensuring our\ncybersecurity strategies and processes remain current.\nIn the past three years, we have not experienced any material computer data security breaches as a result of a\ncompromise of our information systems and we are not aware and have not had a significant cybersecurity breach or attack that\nhad a material impact on our business or operating results to date.\nGovernance\nOur Board is actively engaged in the oversight of our cybersecurity program. Specifically, the Risk Committee is\nresponsible for overseeing our information security program, including management’s actions to identify, assess, mitigate, and\nremediate material cyber issues and risks. Our CTIO provides quarterly reports to the Risk Committee regarding information\nsecurity programs, key enterprise cyber initiatives, and significant cybersecurity and privacy incidents.\nOur CTIO is part of the risk management function, reporting directly to our Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”). Various\nmanagement committees provide oversight of the information security and technology programs. These committees generally\nmeet quarterly and summaries of key issues discussed and actions taken are provided to the Risk Committee.\nItem 2. Properties\nThe Company and the Bank conduct business from their corporate headquarters at 120 Passaic Avenue in Fairfield, New\nJersey and from administrative offices located in Fairfield, Clifton and Oakhurst, New Jersey.\nAt June 30, 2024, the Company operated 43 branch offices located in Bergen, Essex, Hudson, Middlesex, Monmouth,\nMorris, Ocean, Passaic, Somerset and Union counties, New Jersey and Kings and Richmond counties, New York. At June 30,\n2024, 18 of our branch offices are leased with remaining terms between seven months and nine years. At June 30, 2024, our net\ninvestment in property and equipment totaled $44.9 million.\nAdditional information regarding our properties as of June 30, 2024, is presented in Note 7 to the audited consolidated\nfinancial statements.\nItem 3. Legal Proceedings\nWe are, from time to time, party to routine litigation, which arises in the normal course of business, such as claims to\nenforce liens, condemnation proceedings on properties in which we hold security interests, claims involving the making and\nservicing of real property loans and other issues incident to our business. At June 30, 2024, there were no lawsuits pending or\nknown to be contemplated against us that would be expected to have a material effect on operations or income.\nItem 4. Mine Safety Disclosures\nNot applicable.\n36\nPART II\nItem 5. Market for Registrant’s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities\n(a) Market Information. The Company’s common stock trades on The NASDAQ Global Select Market under the symbol\n“KRNY.”\nDeclarations of dividends by the Board of Directors depend on a number of factors, including investment opportunities,\ngrowth objectives, financial condition, profitability, tax considerations, minimum capital requirements, regulatory limitations,\nstock market characteristics and general economic conditions. The timing, frequency and amount of dividends are determined by\nthe Board of Directors.\nThe Company’s ability to pay dividends may also depend on the receipt of dividends from the Bank, which is subject to\na variety of limitations under federal banking regulations regarding the payment of dividends. For discussion of corporate and\nregulatory limitations applicable to the payment of dividends, see “Item 1. Business-Regulation.”\nAs of August 19, 2024, there were 4,040 registered holders of record of the Company’s common stock. Certain shares of\nthe Company are held in “street” name and accordingly, the number of beneficial owners of such shares is not known or included\nin the foregoing number.\n(b) Use of Proceeds.

[Reserved]\n38\nItem 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nGeneral\nThis discussion and analysis reflects Kearny Financial Corp.’s consolidated financial statements and other relevant\nstatistical data, and is intended to enhance your understanding of our financial condition and results of operations. You should\nread the information in this section in conjunction with the business and financial information regarding Kearny Financial Corp.\nand the audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nOur accounting policies are integral to understanding the results reported. We describe them in detail in Note 1 to our\naudited consolidated financial statements. In preparing the audited consolidated financial statements, management is required to\nmake estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the dates of the Consolidated\nStatements of Financial Condition and revenues and expenses for the periods then ended. Actual results could differ significantly\nfrom those estimates. Material estimates that are particularly susceptible to significant changes relate to the determination of the\nallowance for credit losses and goodwill.\nAllowance for Credit Losses. The determination of our allowance for credit losses on loans (“ACL”) is considered a\ncritical accounting estimate by management because of the high degree of judgment involved in determining qualitative loss\nfactors, the subjectivity of the assumptions used, and the potential for changes in the forecasted economic environment that could\nresult in changes to the amount of the recorded ACL. See Note 1 to our audited consolidated financial statements for a detailed\ndiscussion of our accounting policies and methodologies for establishing the ACL.\nManagement believes the following information may enable investors to better understand the changes in our ACL. Our\nACL totaled $44.9 million and $48.7 million at June 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The $3.8 million decrease in our ACL was\nlargely attributable to a reduction in reserves for individually evaluated loans, primarily driven by the charge-off on three related\nnon-performing commercial real estate loans transferred to held-for-sale and sold during the year ended June 30, 2024. The\nquantitative component of our ACL, which is largely based on the national unemployment rate forecast, increased $4.0 million,\nwhich largely resulted from slower prepayment speeds. The qualitative component of our ACL, which is largely based on\nmanagement’s judgment of qualitative loss factors, decreased $5.3 million.\nOur ACL totaled $44.9 million at June 30, 2024 and the amount allocated to our collectively evaluated multi-family and\nnonresidential mortgage loans was $29.7 million, of which $19.7 million was attributable to qualitative loss factors. Changes in\nmanagements’ judgement of qualitative loss factors could result in a significant change to the ACL. As described in Note 1,\nqualitative loss factors are applied to each portfolio segment with the amounts judgmentally determined by the relative risk to the\nmost severe loss periods identified in the historical loan charge-offs of a peer group of similar-sized regional banks. At June 30,\n2024, the most severe historical loss rate for multi-family and nonresidential mortgages loans was 1.69%.\nManagement performed a hypothetical sensitivity analysis to understand the impact of a change in a key input on our\nACL. At June 30, 2024, if the four-quarter national unemployment rate forecast had been 9% rather than an average of\napproximately 4.0%, our ACL as a percent of total loans would have increased 37 basis points from 0.78% to 1.15%. This\nsensitivity analysis includes the impact to both the quantitative and qualitative components of our ACL. Changes in quantitative\ninputs and qualitative loss factors may not occur in the same direction or magnitude across all segments of our loan portfolio and\ndeterioration in some quantitative inputs and qualitative loss factors may offset improvement in others. This sensitivity analysis\ndoes not represent a change to our expectations of the economic environment but provides a hypothetical result to assess the\nsensitivity of the ACL to a change in a key input. This sensitivity analysis does not incorporate changes to management’s\njudgment of qualitative loss factors.\nOur ACL on individually analyzed loans is determined on an individual basis using the present value of expected cash\nflows discounted using the loan’s effective interest rate or, for collateral-dependent loans, the fair value of the collateral, less\nestimated selling costs, as applicable. Our ACL on individually analyzed loans decreased $2.6 million during the year ended\nJune 30, 2024.\n39\nGoodwill. Goodwill arises from business combinations and is generally determined as the excess of the fair value of the\nconsideration transferred, plus the fair value of any noncontrolling interests in the acquiree, over the fair value of the net assets\nacquired and liabilities assumed as of the acquisition date. Goodwill is not amortized, but is tested for impairment at least\nannually or more frequently if events and circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a\nreporting unit below its carrying amount.\nIn assessing impairment, we have the option to perform a qualitative analysis to determine whether the existence of\nevents or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more-likely-than-not that the fair value of our single reporting unit is\nless than its carrying amount. Due to the continued impact of higher interest rates and a sustained decline in the banking industry\nshare prices, including our own, we performed a quantitative goodwill impairment during the fourth quarter of the year ended\nJune 30, 2024. The quantitative goodwill impairment test compares the estimated fair value of the reporting unit with its carrying\namount, including goodwill. If the estimated fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, goodwill of the reporting\nunit is considered not impaired. However, if the carrying amount of the reporting unit were to exceed its estimated fair value, and\nimpairment loss would be recorded.\nThe quantitative assessment of goodwill for our single reporting unit was performed utilizing a discounted cash flow\nanalysis (“income approach”) and estimates of selected market information (“market approaches”). The result of the income\napproach was weighted at 50% and the results of the market approaches comprised the remaining 50% in determining the fair\nvalue of our single reporting unit. The carrying value of our single reporting unit exceeded its respective fair value, resulting in\nthe recognition of a non-cash, pre-tax goodwill impairment of $97.4 million for the year ended June 30, 2024. As a result, the\nCompany’s goodwill decreased from $210.9 million at June 30, 2023 to $113.5 million at June 30, 2024. Determining fair value\nof our single reporting unit is subject to uncertainty as it is reliant on projected future cash flows, discount rate assumption, and\nmarket estimates. In the future, changes in projected future cash flows, discount rate assumption, or market estimates may result\nin further impairment of goodwill.\n40\nFinancial Overview\nThe following financial information and other data in this section are derived from our audited consolidated financial\nstatements and should be read together therewith:\nAt June 30,\n2024 2023 2022\n(In Thousands)\nBalance Sheet Data:\nCash and equivalents $ 63,864 $ 70,515 $ 101,615\nAssets 7,683,461 8,064,815 7,719,883\nNet loans receivable 5,687,848 5,780,687 5,370,787\nInvestment securities available for sale 1,072,833 1,227,729 1,344,093\nInvestment securities held to maturity 135,742 146,465 118,291\nGoodwill 113,525 210,895 210,895\nDeposits 5,158,123 5,629,183 5,862,256\nBorrowings 1,709,789 1,506,812 901,337\nStockholders' equity 753,571 869,284 894,000\nFor the Years Ended June 30,\n2024 2023 2022\n(Dollars in Thousands, Except Per Share\nAmounts)\nSummary of Operations:\nInterest income $ 328,868 $ 293,724 $ 226,272\nInterest expense 186,274 117,859 29,669\nNet interest income 142,594 175,865 196,603\nProvision for (reversal of) credit losses 6,226 2,486 (7,518)\nNet interest income after provision for (reversal of) credit losses 136,368 173,379 204,121\nNon-interest income (1,993) 2,751 13,934\nNon-interest expenses 215,151 123,751 125,708\n(Loss) income before taxes (80,776) 52,379 92,347\nIncome tax expense 5,891 11,568 24,800\nNet (loss) income $ (86,667) $ 40,811 $ 67,547\nPer Share Data:\nNet (loss) income per share - Basic and diluted $ (1.39) $ 0.63 $ 0.95\nWeighted average number of common shares outstanding (in thousands):\nBasic 62,444 64,804 70,911\nDiluted 62,444 64,804 70,933\nCash dividends per share $ 0.44 $ 0.44 $ 0.43\nDividend payout ratio(1) (31.9) % 70.2 % 45.1 %\n________________________________________\n(1) Represents cash dividends declared divided by net income.\n41\nAt or For the Years Ended June 30,\n2024 2023 2022\nPerformance Ratios:\nReturn on average assets (ratio of net income to average total assets) (1.10) % 0.51 % 0.93 %\nReturn on average equity (ratio of net income to average total equity) (10.51) % 4.66 % 6.86 %\nReturn on average tangible equity (ratio of net income to average tangible equity)(1) (13.64) % 6.17 % 8.77 %\nNet interest rate spread 1.57 % 2.09 % 2.86 %\nNet interest margin 1.94 % 2.34 % 2.94 %\nAverage interest-earning assets to average interest-bearing liabilities 114.73 % 115.66 % 118.93 %\nEfficiency ratio(2) 153.02 % 69.28 % 59.71 %\nNon-interest expense to average assets 2.73 % 1.53 % 1.73 %\nAsset Quality Ratios:\nNon-performing loans to total loans 0.70 % 0.73 % 1.30 %\nNon-performing assets to total assets 0.52 % 0.69 % 1.19 %\nNet charge-offs to average loans outstanding 0.17 % 0.01 % 0.07 %\nAllowance for credit losses to total loans 0.78 % 0.83 % 0.87 %\nAllowance for credit losses to non-performing loans 112.68 % 114.33 % 66.92 %\nCapital Ratios:\nAverage equity to average assets 10.46 % 10.85 % 13.52 %\nEquity to assets at period end 9.81 % 10.78 % 11.58 %\nTangible equity to tangible assets at period end(3) 8.43 % 8.35 % 9.06 %\n________________________________________\n(1) Average tangible equity equals average total stockholders’ equity reduced by average goodwill and average core deposit intangible assets.\n(2) Efficiency ratio equals non-interest expense divided by the sum of net interest income and non-interest income.\n(3) Tangible equity equals total stockholders’ equity reduced by goodwill and core deposit intangible assets.\nComparison of Financial Condition at June 30, 2024 and June 30, 2023\nExecutive Summary. Total assets decreased by $381.4 million, or 4.7%, to $7.68 billion at June 30, 2024 from $8.06\nbillion at June 30, 2023. The decrease primarily reflected decreases in investment securities, net loans receivable and goodwill.\nInvestment Securities. Investment securities available for sale decreased by $154.9 million to $1.07 billion at June 30,\n2024 from $1.23 billion at June 30, 2023. This decrease was largely the result of principal repayments of $133.0 million and sales\nof $122.2 million, partially offset by purchases of $74.0 million and a $25.5 million increase in the fair value of the portfolio to a\nnet unrealized loss of $130.7 million.\nInvestment securities held to maturity decreased by $10.7 million to $135.7 million at June 30, 2024 from $146.5 million\nat June 30, 2023. The decrease was largely the result of principal repayments of $10.9 million, partially offset by purchases of\n$300,000.\nAdditional information regarding investment securities at June 30, 2024 is presented under “Item 1. Business” of this\nAnnual Report on Form 10-K, as well as in Note 3 to the audited consolidated financial statements.\nLoans Held-for-Sale. Loans held-for-sale totaled $6.0 million at June 30, 2024 as compared to $9.6 million at June 30,\n2023 and are reported separately from the balance of net loans receivable. Loans held-for-sale consisted of residential mortgage\nloans of $6.0 million at June 30, 2024 as compared to residential mortgage loans of $9.6 million at June 30, 2023. During the year\nended June 30, 2024, we sold $79.1 million of residential mortgage loans, resulting in a net gain on sale of $602,000, and\n$10.8 million of commercial mortgage loans, resulting in a net loss on sale of $884,000.\n42\nNet Loans Receivable. Net loans receivable decreased by $92.8 million, or 1.6%, to $5.69 billion at June 30, 2024 from\n$5.78 billion at June 30, 2023. Detail regarding the change in the loan portfolio is presented below:\nJune 30, June 30, Increase/\n2024 2023 (Decrease)\n(In Thousands)\nCommercial loans:\nMulti-family mortgage $ 2,645,851 $ 2,761,775 $ (115,924)\nNonresidential mortgage 948,075 968,574 (20,499)\nCommercial business 142,747 146,861 (4,114)\nConstruction 209,237 226,609 (17,372)\nTotal commercial loans 3,945,910 4,103,819 (157,909)\nOne- to four-family residential mortgage 1,756,051 1,700,559 55,492\nConsumer loans:\nHome equity loans 44,104 43,549 555\nOther consumer 2,685 2,549 136\nTotal consumer loans 46,789 46,098 691\nTotal loans 5,748,750 5,850,476 (101,726)\nUnaccreted yield adjustments (15,963) (21,055) 5,092\nAllowance for credit losses (44,939) (48,734) 3,795\nNet loans receivable $ 5,687,848 $ 5,780,687 $ (92,839)\nCommercial loan origination volume for the year ended June 30, 2024 totaled $287.8 million, comprised of $103.7\nmillion of commercial mortgage loan originations, $98.5 million of commercial business loan originations and construction loan\ndisbursements of $85.6 million.\nOne- to four-family residential mortgage loan origination volume, excluding loans held-for-sale, totaled $131.5 million\nfor the year ended June 30, 2024 and was supplemented with loan purchases totaling $60.3 million. Home equity loan and line of\ncredit origination volume for the same period totaled $18.0 million.\nAdditional information about our loans at June 30, 2024 is presented under “Item 1. Business” of this Annual Report on\nForm 10-K, as well as in Note 4 to the audited consolidated financial statements.\nNonperforming loans. Nonperforming loans decreased by $2.7 million to $39.9 million, or 0.70% of total loans, at\nJune 30, 2024 from $42.6 million, or 0.73% of total loans, at June 30, 2023. The decrease in nonperforming loans was largely\nattributable to a decrease of $6.7 million in nonperforming nonresidential mortgage loans, partially offset by an increase of\n$3.5 million in nonperforming multi-family mortgage loans.\nAdditional information about nonperforming loans and reportable loan modifications at June 30, 2024 is presented under\n“Item 1. Business” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, as well as in Note 4 to the audited consolidated financial statements.\nAllowance for Credit Losses. At June 30, 2024, the ACL totaled $44.9 million, or 0.78% of total loans, reflecting a\ndecrease of $3.8 million from $48.7 million, or 0.83% of total loans, at June 30, 2023. The decrease was largely attributable to a\nprovision for credit losses of $6.2 million, primarily driven by an increase in the provision for individually evaluated loans.\nPartially offsetting the provision for credit losses were net charge-offs of $10.0 million, of which $3.4 million had been\nindividually reserved for within the ACL at June 30, 2023.\nAdditional information about the allowance for credit losses at June 30, 2024 is presented under “Item 1. Business” of\nthis Annual Report on Form 10-K, as well as in Note 1 and Note 5 to the audited consolidated financial statements.\n43\nOther Assets. The aggregate balance of other assets, including premises and equipment, FHLB stock, interest receivable,\ngoodwill, core deposit intangibles, bank owned life insurance, deferred income taxes, OREO and other assets, decreased by\n$112.7 million to $717.1 million at June 30, 2024 from $829.8 million at June 30, 2023. The decrease in other assets largely\nreflected the recognition of a non-cash, pre-tax goodwill impairment of $97.4 million and a $13.0 million decrease in OREO. The\ndecrease in OREO was a result of the sale of our sole OREO asset in January 2024. The remaining change generally reflected\nnormal operating fluctuations within these line items.\nDeposits. Total deposits decreased by $471.1 million, or 8.4%, to $5.16 billion at June 30, 2024 from $5.63 billion at\nJune 30, 2023. Included in total deposits are brokered and listing service time deposits of $408.2 million and $640.5 million at\nJune 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The following table sets forth the distribution of, and changes in, deposits, by type, at the\ndates indicated:\nJune 30, June 30, Increase/\n2024 2023 (Decrease)\n(In Thousands)\nNon-interest-bearing deposits $ 598,366 $ 609,999 $ (11,633)\nInterest-bearing deposits:\nInterest-bearing demand 2,308,915 2,252,912 56,003\nSavings 643,481 748,721 (105,240)\nCertificates of deposit (retail) 1,199,127 1,377,028 (177,901)\nCertificates of deposit (brokered and listing service) 408,234 640,523 (232,289)\nInterest-bearing deposits 4,559,757 5,019,184 (459,427)\nTotal deposits $ 5,158,123 $ 5,629,183 $ (471,060)\nUninsured deposits totaled $1.77 billion as of June 30, 2024, unchanged from June 30, 2023. Excluding collateralized\ndeposits of state and local governments, and deposits of the Bank’s wholly-owned subsidiary and holding company, uninsured\ndeposits totaled $764.4 million, or 14.8% of total deposits, at June 30, 2024 compared to $710.4 million, or 12.6% of total\ndeposits, at June 30, 2023.\nAdditional information about our deposits at June 30, 2024 is presented under “Item 1. Business” of this Annual Report\non Form 10-K, as well as in Note 9 to the audited consolidated financial statements.\nBorrowings. The balance of borrowings increased by $203.0 million, or 13.5%, to $1.71 billion at June 30, 2024 from\n$1.51 billion at June 30, 2023 which included overnight borrowings totaling $175.0 million and $225.0 million at June 30, 2024\nand 2023, respectively. The increase was primarily driven by a net increase in advances from the FHLB and the Federal Reserve\nBank of New York (“FRBNY”). FRBNY advances consisted of $100.0 million in borrowings under the Bank Term Funding\nProgram (“BTFP”) which included favorable terms and conditions as compared to FHLB advances and brokered deposits.\nAdditional information about our borrowings at June 30, 2024 is presented under “Item 1. Business” of this Annual\nReport on Form 10-K, as well as in Note 10 to the audited consolidated financial statements.\nOther Liabilities. The balance of other liabilities, including advance payments by borrowers for taxes and other\nmiscellaneous liabilities, increased by $2.4 million to $62.0 million at June 30, 2024 from $59.5 million at June 30, 2023. The\nchange in the balance of other liabilities generally reflected normal operating fluctuations within these line items.\nStockholders’ Equity. Stockholders’ equity decreased by $115.7 million to $753.6 million at June 30, 2024 from $869.3\nmillion at June 30, 2023. The decrease in stockholders’ equity during the year ended June 30, 2024 reflected a net loss of $86.7\nmillion, primarily driven by a non-cash, after-tax, goodwill impairment of $95.3 million, dividends totaling $27.6 million, and\nshare repurchases totaling $11.2 million, partially offset by other comprehensive income, net of tax, of $6.3 million. Other\ncomprehensive income during the year ended June 30, 2024 reflected the reclassification of a net realized loss on the sale of\nsecurities available for sale out of accumulated other comprehensive loss due to an investment securities repositioning and an\nincrease in the fair value of our available for sale securities, partially offset by a decrease in the fair value of our derivatives\nportfolio.\nBook value per share decreased by $1.50 to $11.70 at June 30, 2024 while tangible book value per share decreased by\n$0.06 to $9.90 at June 30, 2024.\n44\nDuring the year ended June 30, 2024, we repurchased 1,504,747 shares of common stock at a cost of $11.2 million, or\n$7.40 per share. On November 7, 2023, we announced the completion of our ninth repurchase plan which authorized the\nrepurchase of 4,000,000 shares. Such shares were repurchased at a cost of $34.9 million, or $8.74 per share.\nComparison of Operating Results for the Years Ended June 30, 2024 and June 30, 2023\nNet (Loss) Income. Net loss for the year ended June 30, 2024 was $86.7 million, or $1.39 per diluted share, a decrease of\n$127.5 million from net income of $40.8 million, or $0.63 per diluted share for the year ended June 30, 2023. The net loss was\nprimarily attributable to a non-cash, after tax, goodwill impairment charge of $95.3 million. The net loss also reflected a decrease\nin net interest income, a decrease in non-interest income and an increase in the provision for credit losses, partially offset by a\ndecrease in non-interest expense, excluding goodwill impairment, and a decrease in income tax expense. Results for the years\nended June 30, 2024 and June 30, 2023 were impacted by various non-recurring items, as described in further detail below.\nNet Interest Income. Net interest income decreased by $33.3 million to $142.6 million for the year ended June 30, 2024.\nThe decrease between the comparative periods resulted from an increase of $68.4 million in interest expense, partially offset by an\nincrease of $35.1 million in interest income. Included in net interest income for the years ended June 30, 2024 and 2023,\nrespectively, was purchase accounting accretion of $2.6 million and $5.3 million and loan prepayment penalty income of\n$879,000 and $895,000.\nNet interest margin decreased 40 basis points to 1.94% for the year ended June 30, 2024, from 2.34% for the year ended\nJune 30, 2023. The decrease reflected increases in the cost of interest-bearing liabilities, increases in the average balances of\ninterest-bearing borrowings and decreases in the average balances of interest-earning assets, partially offset by higher yields on\ninterest-earning assets and decreases in the average balances of interest-bearing deposits.\n45\nDetails surrounding the composition of, and changes to, net interest income are presented in the table below which\nreflects the components of the average balance sheet and of net interest income for the periods indicated. We derived the average\nyields and costs by dividing income or expense by the average balance of assets or liabilities, respectively, for the periods\npresented with daily balances used to derive average balances. No tax equivalent adjustments have been made to yield or costs.\nNon-accrual loans were included in the calculation of average balances, however interest receivable on these loans has been fully\nreserved for and therefore not included in interest income. The yields and costs set forth below include the effect of deferred fees,\ndiscounts and premiums that are amortized or accreted to interest income or expense and exclude the impact of prepayment\npenalties, which are recorded to non-interest income.\nFor the Years Ended June 30,\n2024 2023 2022\nAverage Average Average\nAverage Yield/ Average Yield/ Average Yield/\nBalance Interest Cost Balance Interest Cost Balance Interest Cost\n(Dollars in Thousands)\nInterest-earning assets:\nLoans receivable (1) $ 5,752,496 $ 256,007 4.45 % $ 5,827,123 $ 233,147 4.00 % $ 4,922,400 $ 190,520 3.87 %\nTaxable investment securities(2) 1,438,200 63,313 4.40 1,532,961 54,855 3.58 1,622,475 32,746 2.02\nTax-exempt securities (2) 14,718 336 2.28 30,332 694 2.29 55,981 1,273 2.27\nOther interest-earning assets(3) 131,019 9,212 7.03 115,390 5,028 4.36 82,802 1,733 2.09\nTotal interest-earning assets 7,336,433 328,868 4.48 7,505,806 293,724 3.91 6,683,658 226,272 3.39\nNon-interest-earning assets 541,859 563,131 598,712\nTotal assets $ 7,878,292 $ 8,068,937 $ 7,282,370\nInterest-bearing liabilities:\nInterest-bearing demand $ 2,308,893 $ 67,183 2.91 $ 2,349,802 $ 40,650 1.73 $ 2,067,200 $ 5,123 0.25\nSavings 662,981 3,293 0.50 896,651 3,351 0.37 1,088,971 1,190 0.11\nCertificates of deposit 1,778,682 51,938 2.92 2,083,864 34,162 1.64 1,711,276 8,895 0.52\nTotal interest-bearing deposits 4,750,556 122,414 2.58 5,330,317 78,163 1.47 4,867,447 15,208 0.31\nFHLB advances 1,458,941 53,948 3.70 1,101,658 37,734 3.43 679,388 14,067 2.07\nOther borrowings 184,768 9,912 5.36 57,468 1,962 3.41 72,841 394 0.54\nTotal borrowings 1,643,709 63,860 3.89 1,159,126 39,696 3.42 752,229 14,461 1.92\nTotal interest-bearing liabilities 6,394,265 186,274 2.91 6,489,443 117,859 1.82 5,619,676 29,669 0.53\nNon-interest-bearing liabilities(4) 659,710 704,136 678,143\nTotal liabilities 7,053,975 7,193,579 6,297,819\nStockholders' equity 824,317 875,358 984,551\nTotal liabilities and\nstockholders' equity $ 7,878,292 $ 8,068,937 $ 7,282,370\nNet interest income $ 142,594 $ 175,865 $ 196,603\nInterest rate spread(5) 1.57 % 2.09 % 2.86 %\nNet interest margin(6) 1.94 % 2.34 % 2.94 %\nRatio of interest-earning assets to\ninterest-bearing liabilities 1.15 1.16 1.19\n________________________________________\n(1) Loans held-for-sale and non-accruing loans have been included in loans receivable and the effect of such inclusion was not material.\nAllowance for credit losses has been included in non-interest-earning assets.\n(2) Fair value adjustments have been excluded in the balances of interest-earning assets.\n(3) Includes interest-bearing deposits at other banks and FHLB of New York capital stock.\n(4) Includes average balances of non-interest-bearing deposits of $595.3 million, $644.5 million and $624.7 million for the years ended\nJune 30, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\n(5) Interest rate spread represents the difference between the yield on interest-earning assets and the cost of interest-bearing liabilities.\n(6) Net interest margin represents net interest income as a percentage of average interest-earning assets.\n46\nThe following table reflects the dollar amount of changes in interest income and interest expense to changes in volume\nand in prevailing interest rates during the periods indicated.

The provision for credit losses increased by $3.7 million to a provision for credit losses of\n$6.2 million for the year ended June 30, 2024, compared to provision for credit losses of $2.5 million for the year ended June 30,\n2023. The provision for credit losses for the year ended June 30, 2024 was largely attributable to charge-offs of three related\ncommercial real estate loans and the charge-off of one non-performing commercial and industrial loan relationship. The provision\nfor credit losses for the year ended June 30, 2023 was largely attributable to loan growth, partially offset by a reduction in the\nexpected life of the loan portfolio.\nAdditional information regarding the allowance for credit losses and the associated provision recognized during the year\nended June 30, 2024 is presented under “Item 1, Business” on this Annual Report on Form 10-K as well as in Note 1 and Note 5\nto the audited consolidated financial statements as well as the Comparison of Financial Condition at June 30, 2024.\nNon-Interest Income. Non-interest income decreased by $4.7 million to $2.0 million for the year ended June 30, 2024.\nLoss on sale and call of securities was $18.1 million during the year ended June 30, 2024 compared to a loss of $15.2\nmillion recorded during the earlier comparative period. The current year loss was the result of our securities portfolio\nrepositioning that involved the sale of $122.2 million of available for sale securities in December 2023. Proceeds of the sale were\nutilized to retire higher-cost wholesale funding and to reinvest in loans yielding approximately 7.0%.\nLoss on sale of loans was $282,000 for the year ended June 30, 2024 compared to a loss of $1.6 million during the earlier\ncomparative period. The decrease in loan sale losses was largely attributable to a loss of $2.4 million on the sale of a non-\nperforming commercial mortgage loan held-for-sale in the prior comparative period. The loss in the current period was primarily\nthe result of the sale of three related nonperforming commercial real estate loans held-for-sale resulting in a net loss on sale of\n$884,000.\nWe recognized a non-recurring loss of $974,000 attributable to the write-down of one other real estate owned (“OREO”)\nproperty during the quarter ended December 31, 2023, while there were no such losses recorded in the prior period. This OREO\nasset was subsequently sold during the quarter ended March 31, 2024.\n47\nIncome from bank owned life insurance (“BOLI”) increased $431,000 to $9.1 million for the year ended June 30, 2024.\nThe increase primarily reflected improved income as a result of the BOLI restructure initiated in December 2023, partially offset\nby a decrease of $551,000 in payouts on life insurance policies compared to the prior year period and non-recurring exchange\ncharges of $965,000 in the current year period related to the BOLI restructure.\nOther non-interest income decreased $2.9 million to $3.4 million for the year ended June 30, 2024. The decrease was\nprimarily attributable to a non-recurring gain of $2.9 million from the sale of a former branch location in the earlier comparative\nperiod.\nElectronic banking fees and charges increased $598,000 to $2.4 million for the year ended June 30, 2024. The increase\nwas primarily driven by a non-recurring contract renewal bonus of $750,000 recorded in the current period related to a licensing\nagreement with a third-party vendor.\nThe remaining changes in the other components of non-interest income between comparative periods generally reflected\nnormal operating fluctuations within those line items.\nNon-Interest Expense. Non-interest expense increased by $91.4 million to $215.2 million for the year ended June 30,\n2024 from $123.8 million for the year ended June 30, 2023, driven by a pre-tax, non-cash goodwill impairment of $97.4 million\nrecognized in the current year period. Excluding the goodwill impairment, non-interest expense decreased $6.0 million compared\nto the prior year period.\nSalaries and employee benefits expense decreased by $6.4 million to $69.2 million for the year ended June 30, 2024\nreflecting lower average headcount and a decrease in incentive payments tied to origination volume, partially offset by annual\nmerit increases. Included in salaries and employee benefits for the year ended June 30, 2023 was $757,000 of severance expense\nfrom a workforce realignment.\nNet occupancy expense of premises decreased by $1.0 million to $11.0 million for the year ended June 30, 2024. This\ndecrease was primarily due to decreases in rent expense, depreciation expense, and building repairs and maintenance expense.\nThese decreases are a result of the consolidation of two branch locations during the quarter ended June 30, 2023.\nAdvertising and marketing expense decreased $726,000 to $1.4 million for the year ended June 30, 2024. This decrease\nin advertising expense resulted from the adoption of lower cost in-house digital campaigns supporting our loan and deposit\ngrowth initiatives.\nFDIC insurance premiums increased $847,000 to $6.0 million for the year ended June 30, 2024. This increase was\nlargely attributable to an updated assessment rate from the FDIC.\nFor the year ended June 30, 2023, the Company recorded $800,000 in branch consolidation expense, of which $250,000\nwas recorded in occupancy expense and $550,000 was recorded in other expense. No such expenses were recorded during the\nyear ended June 30, 2024.\nThe remaining changes in the other components of non-interest expense between comparative periods generally reflected\nnormal operating fluctuations within those line items.\nProvision for Income Taxes. Provision for income taxes decreased by $5.7 million to $5.9 million for the year ended\nJune 30, 2024, from $11.6 million for the year ended June 30, 2023. The decrease in income tax expense was due to lower pre-tax\nincome, partially offset by $5.7 million of tax expense related to the surrender of BOLI policies during the year ended June 30,\n2024.\nComparison of Operating Results for the Years Ended June 30, 2023 and June 30, 2022\nA comparison of our operating results for the years ended June 30, 2023 and June 30, 2022 can be found in our Annual\nReport on Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2023, filed with the SEC on August 25, 2023.\n48\nLiquidity and Commitments\nLiquidity, represented by cash and cash equivalents, is a product of operating, investing and financing activities. Our\nprimary sources of funds are deposits, borrowings, cash flows from investment securities and loans receivable and funds provided\nfrom operations. While scheduled payments from the amortization and maturity of loans and investment securities are relatively\npredictable sources of funds, general interest rates, economic conditions and competition greatly influence deposit flows and\nprepayments on loans and securities.\nLiquidity, at June 30, 2024, included $63.9 million of short-term cash and equivalents and $1.07 billion of investment\nsecurities available for sale which can readily be sold or pledged as collateral, if necessary. In addition, we have the capacity to\nborrow additional funds from the FHLB, FRB or via unsecured overnight borrowings. As of June 30, 2024, we had the capacity to\nborrow additional funds totaling $1.06 billion and $381.8 million from the FHLB and FRB, respectively, without pledging\nadditional collateral. We had the ability to pledge additional securities to borrow an additional $381.4 million at June 30, 2024. As\nof that same date, we also had access to unsecured overnight borrowings with other financial institutions totaling $789.0 million,\nof which none was outstanding.\nDeposits decreased $471.1 million to $5.16 billion at June 30, 2024 from $5.63 billion at June 30, 2023. The decrease in\ndeposit balances reflected a $459.4 million decrease in interest-bearing deposits coupled with a $11.6 million decrease in non-\ninterest-bearing deposits. Borrowings from the FHLB and other sources are generally available to supplement our liquidity\nposition or to replace maturing deposits. As of June 30, 2024, our outstanding balance of FHLB advances, excluding fair value\nadjustments, totaled $1.54 billion. As of the same date, we had $175.0 million outstanding via our overnight line of credit with the\nFHLB.\nThe following table sets forth information concerning balances and interest rates on our short-term borrowings at and for\nthe periods shown:\nAt or For the Years Ended June 30,\n2024 2023 2022\n(Dollars in Thousands)\nBalance at end of year $ 1,400,000 $ 1,175,000 $ 625,000\nAverage balance during year $ 1,314,686 $ 900,997 $ 476,142\nMaximum outstanding at any month end $ 1,490,000 $ 1,280,000 $ 684,000\nWeighted average interest rate at end of year 5.47 % 5.42 % 1.72 %\nWeighted average interest rate during year 5.52 % 4.49 % 0.58 %\nThe following table discloses our contractual obligations and commitments as of June 30, 2024:\nJune 30, 2024\nOver Three\nLess than One to Years to Over Five\nOne Year Three Years Five Years Years Total\n(In Thousands)\nContractual obligations\nOperating lease obligations $ 3,390 $ 6,622 $ 3,994 $ 2,847 $ 16,853\nCertificates of deposit 1,487,483 106,362 8,126 5,390 1,607,361\nFederal Home Loan Bank Advances 1,328,500 6,500 200,000 — 1,535,000\nTotal contractual obligations $ 2,819,373 $ 119,484 $ 212,120 $ 8,237 $ 3,159,214\nCommitments\nUndisbursed funds from approved lines of credit(1) $ 74,822 $ 21,380 $ 3,626 $ 57,474 $ 157,302\nConstruction loans in process(1) 75,672 — — — 75,672\nOther commitments to extend credit(1) 47,946 — — — 47,946\nTotal commitments $ 198,440 $ 21,380 $ 3,626 $ 57,474 $ 280,920\n________________________________________\n(1) Represents amounts committed to customers.\n49\nIn addition to the loan commitments noted above, the pipeline of loans held for sale included $16.0 million of in process\nloans whose terms included interest rate locks to borrowers that were paired with a best-efforts commitment to sell the loan to a\nbuyer at a fixed price and within a predetermined timeframe after the sale commitment is established.\nIn addition to the commitments noted above, we are party to standby letters of credit totaling approximately $160,000 at\nJune 30, 2024 through which we guarantee certain specific business obligations of our commercial customers.\nCommitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a customer as long as there is no violation of any condition\nestablished in the contract. Commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require\npayment of a fee by the customer. Our exposure to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the other party to the financial\ninstrument for commitments to extend credit is represented by the contractual notional amount of those instruments. We use the\nsame credit policies in making commitments and conditional obligations as we do for on-balance-sheet instruments. Since many\nof the commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon, the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent\nfuture cash requirements.\nAt June 30, 2024, outstanding loan commitments relating to loans held in portfolio totaled $280.9 million compared to\n$251.2 million at June 30, 2023. Since some of the commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon, the total\ncommitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements. For additional information regarding our outstanding\nlending commitments at June 30, 2024, see Note 16 to the audited consolidated financial statements.\nCapital\nConsistent with our goals to operate as a sound and profitable financial organization, Kearny Financial and Kearny Bank\nactively seek to maintain our well capitalized status in accordance with regulatory standards. As of June 30, 2024, Kearny\nFinancial and Kearny Bank exceeded all capital requirements of the federal banking regulators and were considered well\ncapitalized.\nThe following table presents information regarding the Bank’s regulatory capital levels at June 30, 2024:\nJune 30, 2024\nTo Be Well Capitalized\nUnder Prompt\nFor Capital Corrective Action\nActual Adequacy Purposes Provisions\nAmount Ratio Amount Ratio Amount Ratio\n(Dollars in Thousands)\nTotal capital (to risk-weighted assets) $ 688,597 14.42 % $ 382,034 8.00 % $ 477,542 10.00 %\nTier 1 capital (to risk-weighted assets) 651,620 13.65 % 286,525 6.00 % 382,034 8.00 %\nCommon equity tier 1 capital (to risk-weighted assets) 651,620 13.65 % 214,894 4.50 % 310,402 6.50 %\nTier 1 capital (to adjusted total assets) 651,620 8.44 % 308,656 4.00 % 385,820 5.00 %\nThe following table presents information regarding the consolidated Company’s regulatory capital levels at June 30,\n2024:\nJune 30, 2024\nFor Capital\nActual Adequacy Purposes\nAmount Ratio Amount Ratio\n(Dollars in Thousands)\nTotal capital (to risk-weighted assets) $ 743,741 15.57 % $ 382,247 8.00 %\nTier 1 capital (to risk-weighted assets) 706,764 14.79 % 286,685 6.00 %\nCommon equity tier 1 capital (to risk-weighted assets) 706,764 14.79 % 215,014 4.50 %\nTier 1 capital (to adjusted total assets) 706,764 9.15 % 309,031 4.00 %\nFor additional information regarding regulatory capital at June 30, 2024, see Note 14 to the audited consolidated\nfinancial statements.\n50\nImpact of Inflation\nThe financial statements included in this document have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles\ngenerally accepted in the United States of America. These principles require the measurement of financial position and operating\nresults in terms of historical dollars, without considering changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to\ninflation.\nOur primary assets and liabilities are monetary in nature. As a result, interest rates have a more significant impact on our\nperformance than the effects of general levels of inflation. Interest rates, however, do not necessarily move in the same direction\nor with the same magnitude as the price of goods and services, since such prices are affected by inflation. In a period of rapidly\nrising interest rates, the liquidity and maturities of our assets and liabilities are critical to the maintenance of acceptable\nperformance levels.\nThe principal effect of inflation on earnings, as distinct from levels of interest rates, is in the area of non-interest expense.\nExpense items such as employee compensation, employee benefits and occupancy and equipment costs may be subject to\nincreases as a result of inflation. An additional effect of inflation is the possible increase in the dollar value of the collateral\nsecuring loans that we have made. We are unable to determine the extent, if any, to which properties securing our loans have\nappreciated in dollar value due to inflation.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nFor a discussion of the expected impact of recently issued accounting pronouncements that have yet to be adopted by us,\nplease refer to Note 2 to the audited consolidated financial statements.\nItem 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\nManagement of Interest Rate Risk and Market Risk\nThe majority of our assets and liabilities are sensitive to changes in interest rates and as such, interest rate risk is a\nsignificant form of market risk that we must manage. Interest rate risk is generally defined in regulatory nomenclature as the risk\nto earnings or capital arising from the movement of interest rates and arises from several risk factors including re-pricing risk,\nbasis risk, yield curve risk and option risk.\nWe maintain an Asset/Liability Management (“ALM”) program in order to manage our interest rate risk. The program is\noverseen by the Board of Directors through its Interest Rate Risk Management Committee, which has assigned the responsibility\nfor the operational aspects of the ALM program to our Asset/Liability Management Committee (“ALCO”), which is comprised of\nvarious members of the senior and executive management team.\nThe quantitative analysis that we conduct measures interest rate risk from both a capital and earnings perspective. With\nregard to earnings, movements in interest rates and the shape of the yield curve significantly influence the amount of net interest\nincome (“NII”) that we recognize. Movements in market interest rates, and the effect of such movements on the risk factors noted\nabove, significantly influence the spread between the interest earned on our interest-earning assets and the interest paid on our\ninterest-bearing liabilities. Our internal interest rate risk analysis calculates the sensitivity of our projected NII over a one year\nperiod utilizing a static balance sheet assumption through which incoming and outgoing asset and liability cash flows are\nreinvested into similar instruments. Product pricing and earning asset prepayment speeds are appropriately adjusted for each rate\nscenario.\nWith regard to capital, our internal interest rate risk analysis calculates the sensitivity of our Economic Value of Equity\n(“EVE”) to movements in interest rates. EVE represents the present value of the expected cash flows from our assets less the\npresent value of the expected cash flows arising from our liabilities adjusted for the value of off-balance sheet instruments. EVE\nattempts to quantify our economic value using a discounted cash flow methodology. The degree to which our EVE changes for\nany hypothetical interest rate scenario from its base case measurement is a reflection of an institution’s sensitivity to interest rate\nrisk.\nFor both earnings and capital at risk our interest rate risk analysis calculates a base case scenario that assumes no change\nin interest rates. The model then measures changes throughout a series of interest rate scenarios representing immediate and\npermanent, parallel shifts in the yield curve up and down 100, 200 and 300 basis points with additional scenarios modeled where\nappropriate. The model requires that interest rates remain positive for all points along the yield curve for each rate scenario which\nmay preclude the modeling of certain falling rate scenarios during periods of lower market interest rates.\n51\nThe following tables present the results of our internal EVE and NII analyses as of June 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively:\nJune 30, 2024\n1 to 12 Months 13 to 24 Months\nChange in $ Amount % Change $ Amount % Change $ Amount % Change\nInterest Rates of EVE in EVE of NII in NII of NII in NII\n(Dollars in Thousands)\n+300 bps 331,842 (41.07) % 127,382 (8.51) % 135,753 (10.66) %\n+200 bps 400,548 (28.87) % 131,003 (5.91) % 140,351 (7.64) %\n+100 bps 483,724 (14.10) % 135,289 (2.83) % 146,594 (3.53) %\n0 bps 563,098 — 139,236 — 151,955 —\n-100 bps 640,024 13.66 % 144,991 4.13 % 157,821 3.86 %\n-200 bps 693,495 23.16 % 148,189 6.43 % 159,928 5.25 %\n-300 bps 767,451 36.29 % 150,478 8.07 % 160,093 5.36 %\nJune 30, 2023\n1 to 12 Months 13 to 24 Months\nChange in $ Amount % Change $ Amount % Change $ Amount % Change\nInterest Rates of EVE in EVE of NII in NII of NII in NII\n(Dollars in Thousands)\n+300 bps 507,998 (32.36) % 154,552 (5.26) % 168,366 (3.87) %\n+200 bps 571,129 (23.95) % 156,274 (4.20) % 167,683 (4.26) %\n+100 bps 673,314 (10.35) % 160,344 (1.71) % 173,170 (1.13) %\n0 bps 751,040 — 163,132 — 175,143 —\n-100 bps 799,675 6.48 % 163,455 0.20 % 173,319 (1.04) %\n-200 bps 814,293 8.42 % 161,284 (1.13) % 166,473 (4.95) %\n-300 bps 849,208 13.07 % 158,526 (2.82) % 156,507 (10.64) %\nThere are numerous internal and external factors that may contribute to changes in our EVE and its sensitivity. Changes\nin the composition and allocation of our balance sheet, or utilization of off-balance sheet instruments such as derivatives, can\nsignificantly alter the exposure to interest rate risk as quantified by the changes in the EVE sensitivity measures. Changes to\ncertain external factors, most notably changes in the level of market interest rates and overall shape of the yield curve, can also\nalter the projected cash flows of our interest-earning assets and interest-costing liabilities and the associated present values\nthereof.\nNotwithstanding the rate change scenarios presented in the EVE and NII-based analyses above, future interest rates and\ntheir effect on net interest income are not predictable. Computations of prospective effects of hypothetical interest rate changes\nare based on numerous assumptions, including relative levels of market interest rates, prepayments and deposit run-offs and\nshould not be relied upon as indicative of actual results. Certain shortcomings are inherent in this type of computation. Although\ncertain assets and liabilities may have similar maturities or periods of re-pricing, they may react at different times and in different\ndegrees to changes in market interest rates. The interest rate on certain types of assets and liabilities, such as demand deposits and\nsavings accounts, may fluctuate in advance of changes in market interest rates, while rates on other types of assets and liabilities\nmay lag behind changes in market interest rates. Certain assets, such as adjustable-rate mortgages, generally have features which\nrestrict changes in interest rates on a short-term basis and over the life of the asset. In the event of a change in interest rates,\nprepayments and early withdrawal levels could deviate significantly from those assumed in the analyses set forth above.\nAdditionally, an increase in credit risk may result as the ability of borrowers to service their debt may decrease in the event of an\ninterest rate increase.\nItem 8.

The Company’s internal control system is a process designed\nto provide reasonable assurance to the management and board of directors regarding the preparation and fair presentation of\npublished consolidated financial statements.\nThe Company’s internal control over financial reporting includes policies and procedures that pertain to the maintenance of\nrecords that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect transactions and dispositions of assets; provide reasonable\nassurances that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of consolidated financial statements in accordance\nwith U.S. generally accepted accounting principles and that receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with\nauthorizations of management and the directors of the Company; and provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely\ndetection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Company’s assets that could have a material effect on our\nconsolidated financial statements.\nAll internal control systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations. Therefore, even those systems\ndetermined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to consolidated financial statement preparation and\npresentation. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become\ninadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nThe Company’s management assessed the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2024. In\nmaking this assessment, management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway\nCommission in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013). Based on its assessment, management believes that, as of June 30,\n2024, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting is effective based on those criteria.\nThe Company’s independent registered public accounting firm that audited the consolidated financial statements has issued\nan audit report on the effective operation of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2024, a copy of\nwhich is included in this annual report.\n/s/ Craig L. Montanaro /s/ Sean Byrnes\nCraig L. Montanaro Sean Byrnes\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer\nF-1\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nStockholders and the Board of Directors of\nKearny Financial Corp. and Subsidiaries\nFairfield, New Jersey\nOpinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated statements of financial condition of Kearny Financial Corp. and\nSubsidiaries (the “Company”) as of June 30, 2024 and 2023, the related consolidated statements of income (loss), comprehensive\nincome (loss), changes in stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended June 30, 2024,\nand the related notes (collectively referred to as the “financial statements”). We also have audited the Company’s internal control\nover financial reporting as of June 30, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework: (2013)\nissued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).\nIn our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of\nthe Company as of June 30, 2024 and 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the three-\nyear period ended June 30, 2024 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\nAlso in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of June\n30, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework: (2013) issued by COSO.\nBasis for Opinions\nThe Company’s management is responsible for these financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over\nfinancial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the\naccompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on\nthe Company’s financial statements and an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our\naudits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States)\n(“PCAOB”) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws\nand the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and\nperform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement,\nwhether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material\nrespects.\nOur audits of the financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the\nfinancial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures\nincluded examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also\nincluded evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the\noverall presentation of the financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an\nunderstanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and\nevaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included\nperforming such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a\nreasonable basis for our opinions.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding\nthe reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally\naccepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that\n(1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of\nthe assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of\nfinancial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the\ncompany are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide\nreasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s\nassets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nF-2\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.\nAlso, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate\nbecause of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nCritical Audit Matters\nThe critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial\nstatements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or\ndisclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involve our especially challenging, subjective, or complex\njudgments. The communication of the critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements,\ntaken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing a separate opinion on the critical\naudit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.\nAllowance for Credit Losses – Qualitative Factors: As described in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the\nCompany accounts for credit losses under ASC 326, Financial Instruments – Credit Losses. ASC 326 requires the measurement of\nexpected lifetime credit losses for financial assets measured at amortized cost at the reporting date. As of June 30, 2024, the\nbalance of the allowance for credit losses on loans was $44.9 million.\nManagement employs a process and methodology to estimate the allowance for credit losses (“ACL”) on loans that\nevaluates both quantitative and qualitative factors. The methodology for evaluating quantitative factors involves pooling loans\ninto portfolio segments for loans that share similar risk characteristics. Pooled loan portfolio segments include multi-family,\nnonresidential mortgage, commercial business, construction, one-to-four family residential mortgage, home equity and consumer\nloans.\nFor pooled loans, the Company primarily utilizes a discounted cash flow (“DCF”) methodology to estimate credit losses\nover the expected life of the loan. The DCF methodology combines the probability of default, the loss given default, remaining\nlife of the loan and prepayment and curtailment speed assumptions to estimate a reserve for each loan. The loss rates are adjusted\nby current and forecasted macroeconomic assumptions and return to the mean after the forecasted periods. These quantitative\nfactors are supplemented by qualitative factors reflecting management’s view of how losses may vary from those represented by\nquantitative loss rates. Qualitative factors are applied to each portfolio segment with the amounts determined by correlation of\ncredit stress to the maximum loss factors of a peer group’s historical charge-offs. Changes in these assumptions could have a\nmaterial effect on the Company’s financial results.\nWe identified auditing the qualitative component of the ACL on pooled loans in the multi-family, nonresidential\nmortgage, and one-to-four family residential mortgage loan segments as a critical audit matter because the methodology to\ndetermine the estimate of credit losses uses subjective judgments by management and is subject to material variability.\nPerforming audit procedures to evaluate the qualitative factors on the multi-family, nonresidential mortgage, and one-to-four\nfamily residential mortgage loan segments involved a high degree of auditor judgment and required significant effort, including\nthe need to involve more experienced audit personnel including the use of internal specialists.\nThe primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter included:\n• Testing the effectiveness of controls over the evaluation of the ACL on pooled loans, including controls\naddressing:\n◦ Methodology and accounting policies.\n◦ Data inputs, judgments and calculations used to determine the qualitative factors.\n◦ Information technology general controls and application controls.\n◦ Management’s review of the qualitative factors.\n• Substantively testing management’s process, including evaluating their judgments and assumptions, for\ndeveloping the ACL on loans collectively evaluated for impairment, which included:\n◦ Evaluation of the appropriateness of the Company’s methodology and accounting policies involved in\nthe application of ASC 326.\n◦ Testing the mathematical accuracy of the calculation.\n◦ Testing the completeness and accuracy of data used in the calculation including utilizing internal\nspecialists to assist in testing the accuracy of the underlying peer data used to develop the maximum\nloss factors.\nF-3\n◦ Evaluation of the reasonableness of management’s judgments related to qualitative factors to determine\nif they are calculated to conform with management’s policies and were consistently applied period over\nperiod. Our evaluation considered evidence from internal and external sources and loan portfolio\ncomposition and performance.\nGoodwill Impairment: As described in Notes 1 and 8 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company’s\nconsolidated goodwill balance was $113.5 million as of June 30, 2024, which is allocated to the Company’s single reporting unit.\nGoodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level at least annually, or more frequently if events or circumstances\nchange that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount. The Company\nperformed its annual quantitative assessment of goodwill during the fourth quarter of its fiscal year ended June 30, 2024. The\nannual quantitative assessment of goodwill for the Company’s single reporting unit was performed utilizing a discounted cash\nflow analysis (“income approach”) and estimates of selected market information (“market approaches”). The result of the income\napproach was weighted at 50% and the results of the market approaches comprised the remaining 50% in determining the fair\nvalue of the Company’s single reporting unit. The fair value of the Company’s single reporting unit was below the reporting unit’s\ncarrying value, resulting in a pre-tax goodwill impairment charge of $97.4 million for the year ended June 30, 2024.\nThe goodwill impairment assessment involves significant estimates and subjective assumptions which require a high\ndegree of management judgment.\nWe identified the goodwill impairment assessment of the Company as a critical audit matter. The principal\nconsiderations for this determination were the degree of auditor judgment in performing procedures over the key assumptions,\nwhich include discount rate, cost savings rate, expected future cash flows, control premium and weighting allocation to valuation\nmethodologies.\nThe primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter included:\n• Testing the effectiveness of controls over the valuation methodologies, assumptions and data used to estimate\nthe fair value of the Company, including controls addressing:\n◦ Management’s review of the reasonableness and accuracy of the Company’s expected future cash\nflows used in the income approach.\n◦ Management’s evaluation of assumptions and inputs used, including discount rate, cost savings rate,\ncontrol premium, comparable companies data, and allocated weightings incorporated into the\nmethodologies used to determine fair value.\n◦ Completeness and accuracy of key financial data used in the assessment.\n• Substantively testing management’s estimate, for estimating the fair value of the Company, which included:\n◦ Testing of key financial data for completeness and accuracy.\n◦ Evaluation of management’s ability to reasonably forecast cash flows.\n◦ Utilization of an internal specialist to evaluate appropriateness of valuation methodologies, the\ndiscount rate assumption, cost savings rate, comparable companies data, and overall reasonableness of\nthe fair value.\n◦ Evaluation of management’s weighting allocation to each valuation methodology.\n/s/ Crowe LLP\nWe have served as the Company's auditor since 2017.\nLivingston, New Jersey\nAugust 23, 2024\nF-4\nKEARNY FINANCIAL CORP.

AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nNote 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\nBasis of Consolidated Financial Statement Presentation\nThe consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Kearny Financial Corp. (the “Company”), its wholly-\nowned subsidiary, Kearny Bank (the “Bank”) and the Bank’s wholly-owned subsidiaries, CJB Investment Corp.,\n189-245 Berdan Avenue LLC and Kearny Wealth Management LLC. The Company conducts its business principally\nthrough the Bank. Management prepared the consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles\ngenerally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”), including the elimination of all significant inter-company\naccounts and transactions during consolidation.\nIn preparing the consolidated financial statements, management is required to make estimates and assumptions that affect\nthe reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the dates of the Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition and\nrevenues and expenses for the periods then ended. Actual results could differ significantly from those estimates.\nBusiness of the Company and Subsidiaries\nThe Company’s primary business is the ownership and operation of the Bank. The Bank is principally engaged in the\nbusiness of attracting deposits from the general public and using those deposits, together with other funds, to originate or\npurchase loans for its portfolio and invest in securities. Loans originated or purchased by the Bank generally include\nloans collateralized by residential and commercial real estate augmented by secured and unsecured loans to businesses\nand consumers. The investment securities purchased by the Bank generally include U.S. agency mortgage-backed\nsecurities, U.S. government and agency debentures, obligations of state and political subdivisions, corporate bonds,\nasset-backed securities, collateralized loan obligations and subordinated debt.\nAt June 30, 2024, the Bank had three wholly-owned subsidiaries, CJB Investment Corp., 189-245 Berdan Avenue LLC\nand Kearny Wealth Management LLC. CJB Investment Corp. was organized under New Jersey law as a New Jersey\nInvestment Company and remained active through the three-year period ended June 30, 2024. 189-245 Berdan Avenue\nLLC was formed during the year ended June 30, 2023 for the purpose of ownership and operation of commercial real\nestate. In February 2024, the Bank formed the Kearny Wealth Management LLC subsidiary for the purpose of providing\nwealth management and insurance brokerage services via a third-party service provider.\nSubsequent Events\nThe Company has evaluated events and transactions occurring subsequent to the statement of financial condition date of\nJune 30, 2024, for items that should potentially be recognized or disclosed in these consolidated financial statements.\nThe evaluation was conducted through the date this document was filed.\nOn July 25, 2024, the Company declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.11 per share, payable on August 26, 2024 to\nstockholders of record as of August 12, 2024.\nCash and Cash Equivalents\nCash and cash equivalents include cash, deposits with other financial institutions with maturities fewer than 90 days, and\nfederal funds sold. Net cash flows are reported for customer loan and deposit transactions, interest bearing deposits in\nother financial institutions and borrowings with original maturities fewer than 90 days.\nSecurities\nThe Company classifies its investment securities as either available for sale or held to maturity. The Company does not\nuse or maintain a trading account. Investment securities that management has the positive intent and ability to hold to\nmaturity are classified as held to maturity and reported at amortized cost. Investment securities not classified as held to\nmaturity are classified as available for sale and reported at fair value, with unrealized holding gains or losses, net of\ndeferred income taxes, reported in the accumulated other comprehensive income (“OCI”) component of stockholders’\nequity.\nPremiums on callable securities are amortized to the earliest call date whereas discounts on such securities are accreted to\nthe maturity date utilizing the level-yield method. Premiums and discounts on all other securities are generally amortized\nor accreted to the maturity date utilizing the level-yield method taking into consideration the impact of principal\nF-12\nKEARNY FINANCIAL CORP. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nNote 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (continued)\namortization and prepayments, as applicable. Gain or loss on sales of securities is based on the specific identification\nmethod.\nPursuant to the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) Topic\n326, for available for sale securities in an unrealized loss position, the Company first assesses whether it intends to sell,\nor it is more than likely than not that it will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis. If\neither of the criteria regarding intent or requirement to sell is met, the security’s amortized cost basis is written down to\nfair value through income. For securities available for sale that do not meet the above criteria, the Company evaluates\nwhether the decline in fair value has resulted from credit losses or other factors. In making this assessment, the Company\nconsiders the extent to which fair value is less than amortized cost, any changes to the rating by a rating agency, and\nadverse conditions related to the security, among other factors. If this assessment indicates that a credit loss exists, the\npresent value of cash flows expected to be collected from the security are compared to the amortized cost basis of the\nsecurity. If the present value of the cash flows expected to be collected is less than the amortized cost basis, a credit loss\nexists and an allowance for credit losses is recorded for the credit loss, limited by the amount that the fair value is less\nthan the amortized cost. Any impairment that has not been recorded through an allowance for credit losses is recognized\nin other comprehensive income, net of tax. The Company elected the practical expedient of zero loss estimates for\nsecurities issued by U.S. government entities and agencies. These securities are either explicitly or implicitly guaranteed\nby the U.S. government, are highly rated by major agencies and have a long history of no credit losses.\nUnder ASC 326, changes in the allowance for credit losses are recorded as provision for, or reversal of, credit loss\nexpense. Losses are charged against the allowance when management believes the uncollectibility of an available for sale\nsecurity is confirmed or when either of the criteria regarding intent or requirement to sell is met.\nConcentration of Risk\nFinancial instruments which potentially subject the Company and its subsidiaries to concentrations of credit risk consist\nof cash and cash equivalents, investment securities and loans receivable. Cash and cash equivalents include deposits\nplaced in other financial institutions.\nSecurities include concentrations of investments backed by U.S. government agencies and U.S. government sponsored\nenterprises (“GSEs”), including the Federal National Mortgage Association (“Fannie Mae”), the Federal Home Loan\nMortgage Corporation (“Freddie Mac”) and the Government National Mortgage Association (“Ginnie Mae”). Additional\nconcentration risk exists in the Company’s municipal and corporate obligations, asset-backed securities and\ncollateralized loan obligations.\nThe Company’s lending activity is primarily concentrated in loans collateralized by real estate in the states of New Jersey\nand New York. As a result, credit risk is broadly dependent on the real estate market and general economic conditions in\nthese states. Additionally, the Company’s lending policies limit the amount of credit extended to any single borrower and\ntheir related interests thereby limiting the concentration of credit risk to any single borrower.\nLoans Receivable\nLoans receivable that management has the intent and ability to hold for the foreseeable future or until maturity or payoff\nare reported at unpaid principal balances, net of deferred loan origination fees and costs, purchase discounts and\npremiums, purchase accounting fair value adjustments and the allowance for credit losses. Interest income is accrued on\nthe unpaid principal balance. Certain direct loan origination costs, net of loan origination fees, are deferred and\namortized, using the level-yield method, as an adjustment of yield over the contractual lives of the related loans.\nUnearned premiums and discounts are amortized or accreted utilizing the level-yield method over the contractual lives of\nthe related loans.\nLoans Held-for-Sale\nLoans held-for-sale are carried at the lower of cost or estimated fair value, as determined on an aggregate basis. Net\nunrealized losses, if any, are recognized in a valuation allowance through a charge to earnings. Premiums and discounts\nand origination fees and costs on loans held-for-sale are deferred and recognized as a component of the gain or loss on\nsale. Gains and losses on sales of loans held-for-sale are recognized on settlement dates and are determined by the\ndifference between the sale proceeds and the carrying value of the loans. These transactions are accounted for as sales\nF-13\nKEARNY FINANCIAL CORP. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nNote 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (continued)\nbased on satisfaction of the criteria for such accounting which provide that, as transferor, control over the loans have\nbeen surrendered.\nPast Due Loans\nA loan’s past due status is generally determined based upon its principal and interest (“P&I”) payment delinquency status\nin conjunction with its past maturity status, where applicable. A loan’s P&I payment delinquency status is based upon\nthe number of calendar days between the date of the earliest P&I payment due and the as of measurement date. A loan’s\npast maturity status, where applicable, is based upon the number of calendar days between a loan’s contractual maturity\ndate and the as of measurement date. Based upon the larger of these criteria, loans are categorized into the following past\ndue tiers for financial statement reporting and disclosure purposes: Current (including 1-29 days), 30-59 days, 60-89\ndays and 90 or more days.\nNonaccrual Loans\nLoans are generally placed on nonaccrual status when contractual payments become 90 or more days past due or when\nthe Company does not expect to receive all P&I payments owed substantially in accordance with the terms of the loan\nagreement, regardless of past due status. Loans that become 90 day past due, but are well secured and in the process of\ncollection, may remain on accrual status. Nonaccrual loans are generally returned to accrual status when all payments\ndue are brought current and the Company expects to receive all remaining P&I payments owed substantially in\naccordance with the terms of the loan agreement.\nPayments received in cash on nonaccrual loans, including both the principal and interest portions of those payments, are\ngenerally applied to reduce the carrying value of the loan.\nClassification of Assets\nIn compliance with the regulatory guidelines, the Company’s loan review system includes an evaluation process through\nwhich certain loans exhibiting adverse credit quality characteristics are classified as Special Mention, Substandard,\nDoubtful or Loss.\nAn asset is classified as Substandard if it is inadequately protected by the paying capacity and net worth of the obligor or\nthe collateral pledged, if any. Substandard assets include those characterized by the distinct possibility that the insured\ninstitution will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected. Assets classified as Doubtful have all of the\nweaknesses inherent in those classified as Substandard, with the added characteristic that the weaknesses present make\ncollection or liquidation in full highly questionable and improbable, on the basis of currently existing facts, conditions\nand values. Assets, or portions thereof, classified as Loss are considered uncollectible or of so little value that their\ncontinuance as assets is not warranted.\nAssets which do not currently expose the Company to a sufficient degree of risk to warrant an adverse classification but\nhave some credit deficiencies or other potential weaknesses are designated as Special Mention by management.\nAdversely classified assets together with those rated as Special Mention, are generally referred to as Classified Assets.\nNon-classified assets are internally rated within one of four Pass categories or as Watch with the latter denoting a\npotential deficiency or concern that warrants increased oversight or tracking by management until remediated.\nManagement generally performs a classification of assets review, including the regulatory classification of assets, on an\nongoing basis. The results of the classification of assets review are validated by the Company’s third party loan review\nfirm during their quarterly independent review. In the event of a difference in rating or classification between those\nassigned by the internal and external resources, the Company will generally utilize the more critical or conservative\nrating or classification. Final loan ratings and regulatory classifications are presented monthly to the Board of Directors\nand are reviewed by regulators during the examination process.\nF-14\nKEARNY FINANCIAL CORP. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nNote 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (continued)\nAllowance for Credit Losses\nPursuant to ASC 326, the allowance for credit losses represents the estimated amount considered necessary to cover\nlifetime expected credit losses inherent in financial assets at the balance sheet date. The measurement of expected credit\nlosses is applicable to loans receivable and securities measured at amortized cost. It also applies to off-balance sheet\ncredit exposures such as loan commitments and unused lines of credit. The allowance is established through a provision\nfor credit losses that is charged against income. The methodology for determining the allowance for credit losses is\nconsidered a critical accounting policy by management because of the high degree of judgment involved, the subjectivity\nof the assumptions used, and the potential for changes in the forecasted economic environment that could result in\nchanges to the amount of the recorded allowance for credit losses.\nThe allowance for credit losses is reported separately as a contra-asset on the Consolidated Statements of Financial\nCondition. The expected credit losses for unfunded lending commitments and unfunded loan commitments is reported on\nthe Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition in other liabilities while the provision for credit losses related to\nunfunded commitments is reported in other non-interest expense.\nAllowance for Credit Losses on Loans Receivable\nThe allowance for credit losses on loans is deducted from the amortized cost basis of the loan to present the net amount\nexpected to be collected. Expected losses are evaluated and calculated on a collective, or pooled, basis for those loans\nwhich share similar risk characteristics. At each reporting period, the Company evaluates whether loans within a pool\ncontinue to exhibit similar risk characteristics. If the risk characteristics of a loan change, such that they are no longer\nsimilar to other loans in the pool, the Company will evaluate the loan with a different pool of loans that share similar risk\ncharacteristics. If the loan does not share risk characteristics with other loans, the Company will evaluate the loan on an\nindividual basis. The Company evaluates the pooling methodology at least annually. Loans are charged off against the\nallowance for credit losses when the Company believes the balances to be uncollectible. Expected recoveries do not\nexceed the aggregate of amounts previously charged off or expected to be charged off.\nThe Company has chosen to segment its portfolio consistent with the manner in which it manages credit risk. Such\nsegments include multi-family mortgage, nonresidential mortgage, commercial business, construction, one- to four-\nfamily residential mortgage, home equity and consumer. For most segments the Company calculates estimated credit\nlosses using a probability of default and loss given default methodology, the results of which are applied to the\naggregated discounted cash flow of each individual loan within the segment. The point in time probability of default and\nloss given default are then conditioned by macroeconomic scenarios to incorporate reasonable and supportable forecasts\nthat affect the collectability of the reported amount.\nThe Company estimates the allowance for credit losses on loans via a quantitative analysis which considers relevant\navailable information from internal and external sources related to past events and current conditions, as well as the\nincorporation of reasonable and supportable forecasts. The Company evaluates a variety of factors including third party\neconomic forecasts, industry trends and other available published economic information in arriving at its forecasts. After\nthe reasonable and supportable forecast period, the Company reverts, on a straight-line basis, to the historical average\neconomic variables. Expected credit losses are estimated over the contractual term of the loans, adjusted for expected\nprepayments when appropriate. The contractual term excludes expected extensions, renewals, and modifications.\nAlso included in the allowance for credit losses on loans are qualitative reserves to cover losses that are expected but, in\nthe Company’s assessment, may not be adequately represented in the quantitative analysis or the forecasts described\nabove. Factors that the Company considers include changes in lending policies and procedures, business conditions, the\nnature and size of the portfolio, portfolio concentrations, the volume and severity of past due loans and non-accrual\nloans, the effect of external factors such as competition, legal and regulatory requirements, among others. Qualitative\nloss factors are applied to each portfolio segment with the amounts judgmentally determined by the relative risk to the\nmost severe loss periods identified in the historical loan charge-offs of a peer group of similar-sized regional banks.\nIndividually Evaluated Loans\nOn a case-by-case basis, the Company may conclude that a loan should be evaluated on an individual basis based on its\ndisparate risk characteristics. When the Company determines that a loan no longer shares similar risk characteristics with\nother loans in the portfolio, the allowance will be determined on an individual basis using the present value of expected\nF-15\nKEARNY FINANCIAL CORP. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nNote 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (continued)\ncash flows or, for collateral-dependent loans, the fair value of the collateral as of the reporting date, less estimated selling\ncosts, as applicable. If the fair value of the collateral is less than the amortized cost basis of the loan, the Company will\ncharge off the difference between the fair value of the collateral, less costs to sell at the reporting date and the amortized\ncost basis of the loan.\nAcquired Loans\nAcquired loans are included in the Company's calculation of the allowance for credit losses. How the allowance on an\nacquired loan is recorded depends on whether or not it has been classified as a Purchased Credit Deteriorated (“PCD”)\nloan. PCD loans are loans acquired at a discount that is due, in part, to credit quality. PCD loans are accounted for in\naccordance with ASC Subtopic 326-20 and are initially recorded at fair value as determined by the sum of the present\nvalue of expected future cash flows and an allowance for credit losses at acquisition.\nThe allowance for PCD loans is recorded through a gross-up effect, while the allowance for acquired non-PCD loans is\nrecorded through provision expense, consistent with originated loans. Thus, the determination of which loans are PCD\nand non-PCD can have a significant impact on the accounting for these loans. Subsequent to acquisition, the allowance\nfor PCD loans will generally follow the same estimation, provision and charge-off process as non-PCD acquired and\noriginated loans.\nAllowance for Credit Losses on Off-Balance Sheet Commitments\nThe Company is required to include unfunded commitments that are expected to be funded in the future within the\nallowance calculation, other than those that are unconditionally cancelable. To arrive at that reserve, the reserve\npercentage for each applicable segment is applied to the unused portion of the expected commitment balance and is\nmultiplied by the expected funding rate. To determine the expected funding rate, the Company uses a historical\nutilization rate for each segment. As noted above, the allowance for credit losses on unfunded loan commitments is\nincluded in other liabilities on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition and the related credit expense is\nrecorded in other non-interest expense in the Consolidated Statements of Income.\nLoan Modifications\nPrior to July 1, 2023, a troubled debt restructuring (“TDR”) occurred when the terms of a loan were modified because of\ndeterioration in the financial condition of the borrower. TDRs could include, but were not limited to, the modification of\nloan terms such as the reduction of the loan’s stated interest rate, extension of the maturity date and/or reduction or\ndeferral of amounts owed under the terms of the loan agreement. In measuring the impairment associated with\nrestructured loans that qualified as TDRs, the Company compared the present value of the cash flows that were expected\nto be received in accordance with the loan’s modified terms, discounted at the loan’s original contractual interest rate,\nwith the pre-modification carrying value to measure impairment.\nEffective July 1, 2023, the Company adopted ASU 2022-02, Financial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326): Troubled\nDebt Restructurings and Vintage Disclosures (“ASU 2022-02”), which replaced the accounting and recognition of\nTDRs. ASU 2022-02 eliminated the accounting guidance on troubled debt restructurings for creditors in ASC 310-40 and\namends the guidance on \"vintage disclosures\" to require disclosure of current-period gross write-offs by year of\norigination. ASU 2022-02 also updates the requirements related to accounting for credit losses under ASC 326 and adds\nenhanced disclosures for creditors with respect to loan refinancings and restructurings for borrowers experiencing\nfinancial difficulty.\nUnder ASU 2022-02, the Company assesses all loan modifications to determine whether one is granted to a borrower\nexperiencing financial difficulty, regardless of whether the modified loan terms include a concession. Modifications\ngranted to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty may be in the form of an interest rate reduction, an other-than-\ninsignificant payment delay, a term extension, principal forgiveness or a combination thereof.\nAll modified loans to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty are placed on nonaccrual status for a period of no less\nthan six months after modification. Modified loans may be returned to accrual status and a non-adverse classification if\n(1) the borrower has paid timely P&I payments in accordance with the terms of the modified loan agreement for no less\nthan six consecutive months after modification due to a borrower experiencing financial difficulty, and (2) the Company\nexpects to receive all P&I payments owed substantially in accordance with the terms of the modified loan agreement.\nF-16\nKEARNY FINANCIAL CORP. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nNote 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (continued)\nPremises and Equipment\nLand is carried at cost. Office buildings, leasehold improvements and furniture, fixtures and equipment are carried at\ncost, less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Office buildings and furniture, fixtures and equipment are\ndepreciated using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives of the respective assets. Leasehold\nimprovements are amortized using the straight-line method over the terms of the respective leases or lives of the assets,\nwhichever is shorter.\nConstruction in progress primarily represents facilities under construction for future use in our business and includes all\ncosts to acquire land and construct buildings, as well as capitalized interest during the construction period. Interest is\ncapitalized at the Company’s average cost of interest-bearing liabilities.\nOther Real Estate Owned and Other Repossessed Assets\nProperties and other assets acquired through foreclosure, deed in lieu of foreclosure or repossession are carried at\nestimated fair value, less estimated selling costs. The estimated fair value of real estate property and other repossessed\nassets is generally based on independent appraisals. When an asset is acquired, the excess of the loan balance over fair\nvalue, less estimated selling costs, is charged to the allowance for credit losses. Thereafter, decreases in the properties’\nestimated fair value are charged to income along with any additional property maintenance and protection expenses\nincurred in owning the properties.\nFederal Home Loan Bank Stock\nFederal law requires a member institution of the FHLB system to hold restricted stock of its district FHLB according to a\npredetermined formula. The restricted stock is carried at cost, less any applicable impairment. Both cash and stock\ndividends are reported as income.\nGoodwill and Other Intangible Assets\nGoodwill arises from business combinations and is generally determined as the excess of the fair value of the\nconsideration transferred, plus the fair value of any noncontrolling interests in the acquiree, over the fair value of the net\nassets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the acquisition date. Goodwill and intangible assets acquired in a purchase\nbusiness combination and determined to have an indefinite useful life are not amortized, but tested for impairment at\nleast annually or more frequently if events and circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair\nvalue of a reporting unit below its carrying amount. The Company performed its annual impairment test during the fourth\nquarter of its fiscal year ended June 30, 2024. Intangible assets with definite useful lives are amortized over their\nestimated useful lives to their estimated residual values. Goodwill is the only intangible asset with an indefinite life on\nour audited Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition.\nIn assessing impairment, the Company has the option to perform a qualitative analysis to determine whether the\nexistence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more-likely-than-not that the fair value of the\nreporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If, after assessing the totality of such events or circumstances, the\nCompany determines it is not more-likely-than-not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount,\nthen the Company would not be required to perform a quantitative impairment test.\nFor the year ended June 30, 2024, the annual quantitative assessment of goodwill for our single reporting unit was\nperformed utilizing a discounted cash flow analysis (“income approach”) and estimates of selected market information\n(“market approaches”). The income approach measures the fair value of an interest in a business by discounting expected\nfuture cash flows to present value. The market approaches take into consideration fair values of comparable companies\noperating in similar lines of business that are potentially subject to similar economic and environmental factors and could\nbe considered reasonable investment alternatives. The result of the income approach was weighted at 50% and the results\nof the market approaches comprised the remaining 50% in determining the fair value of our single reporting unit. The\nresults of the annual quantitative impairment analysis indicated that the fair value did not exceed the carrying value for\nour single reporting unit.\nA pre-tax goodwill impairment of $97.4 million was required to be recorded as a non-cash expense in the Consolidated\nStatements of Income (Loss) for the year ended June 30, 2024. No impairment charges were required to be recorded in\nthe years ended June 30, 2023 or 2022. (See Note 8, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, for additional information).\nThe balance of other intangible assets at June 30, 2024 and 2023 totaled $1.9 million and $2.5 million, respectively,\nrepresenting the remaining unamortized balance of the core deposit intangibles ascribed to the value of deposits acquired\nby the Bank through the acquisition of Clifton Bancorp Inc. in April 2018 and MSB Financial Corp. in July 2020.\nF-17\nTable of Contents\nKEARNY FINANCIAL CORP. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nNote 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (continued)\nBank Owned Life Insurance\nBank owned life insurance is accounted for using the cash surrender value method and is recorded at its net realizable\nvalue. The change in the net asset value is recorded as a component of non-interest income. A deferred liability has been\nrecorded for the estimated cost of postretirement life insurance benefits accruing to applicable employees and directors\ncovered by an endorsement split-dollar life insurance arrangement.\nTransfers of Financial Assets\nTransfers of financial assets are accounted for as sales, when control over the assets has been surrendered. Control over\ntransferred assets is deemed to be surrendered when (1) the assets have been isolated from the Company - put\npresumptively beyond the reach of the transferor and its creditors, even in bankruptcy or other receivership, (2) the\ntransferee obtains the right (free of conditions that constrain it from taking advantage of that right) to pledge or exchange\nthe transferred assets, and (3) the Company does not maintain effective control over the transferred assets through an\nagreement to repurchase them before their maturity or the ability to unilaterally cause the holder to return specific assets.\nIncome Taxes\nThe Company and its subsidiaries file consolidated federal income tax returns. Federal income taxes are allocated to each\nentity based on their respective contributions to the taxable income of the consolidated income tax returns. Separate state\nincome tax returns are filed for the Company and its subsidiaries on either a consolidated or unconsolidated basis as\nrequired by the jurisdiction. The federal income tax rate of 21% was applicable for the years ended June 30, 2024, 2023\nand 2022.\nFederal and state income taxes have been provided on the basis of the Company’s income or loss as reported in\naccordance with GAAP. The amounts reflected on the Company’s state and federal income tax returns differ from these\nprovisions due principally to temporary differences in the reporting of certain items for financial statement reporting and\nincome tax reporting purposes. The tax effect of these temporary differences is accounted for as deferred taxes applicable\nto future periods. Deferred income tax expense or benefit is determined by recognizing deferred tax assets and liabilities\nfor the estimated future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of\nexisting assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted\ntax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be\nrecovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in earnings in\nthe period that includes the enactment date. The realization of deferred tax assets is assessed and a valuation allowance\nprovided for the full amount which is not more likely than not to be realized.\nThe Company identified no significant income tax uncertainties through the evaluation of its income tax positions as of\nJune 30, 2024 and 2023. Therefore, the Company has no unrecognized income tax benefits as of those dates. Our policy\nis to recognize interest and penalties on unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense in the Consolidated Statements\nof Income (Loss). The Company recognized no material interest and penalties during the years ended June 30, 2024,\n2023 or 2022. The tax years subject to examination by the taxing authorities are the years ended June 30, 2023, 2022 and\n2021.\nRetirement Plans\nPension expense is the net of service and interest cost, return on plan assets and amortization of gains and losses not\nimmediately recognized. Employee 401(k) and profit sharing plan expense is the amount of matching contributions.\nDeferred compensation plan expense allocates the benefits over years of service.\nEmployee Stock Ownership Plan\nThe cost of shares issued to the Employee Stock Ownership Plan (the “ESOP”), but not yet allocated to participants, is\nshown as a reduction of shareholders’ equity. Compensation expense is based on the market price of shares as they are\ncommitted to be released to participant accounts. Dividends on allocated and unallocated ESOP shares either reduce\nretained earnings or reduce debt and accrued interest as determined by the ESOP Plan Administrator.\nF-18\nTable of Contents\nKEARNY FINANCIAL CORP. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nNote 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (continued)\nComprehensive Income\nComprehensive income is comprised of net income and other comprehensive income (loss). Other comprehensive\nincome (loss) includes items recorded in equity, such as unrealized gains and losses on securities available for sale,\nunrealized gains and losses on derivatives and amortization related to post-retirement obligations. Comprehensive\nincome is presented in a separate Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income (Loss).\nLoss Contingencies\nLoss contingencies, including claims and legal actions arising in the ordinary course of business, are recorded as\nliabilities when the likelihood of loss is probable and an amount or range of loss can be reasonably estimated.\nManagement does not believe there now are such matters that will have a material effect on the financial statements.\nLoan Commitments and Related Financial Instruments\nFinancial instruments include off-balance sheet credit instruments, such as commitments to make loans and commercial\nletters of credit, issued to meet customer financing needs. The face amount for these items represents the exposure to\nloss, before considering customer collateral or ability to repay. Such financial instruments are recorded when they are\nfunded. (See Note 16, Commitments, for additional information).\nDerivatives and Hedging\nThe Company utilizes derivative instruments in the form of interest rate swaps, caps and floors to hedge its exposure to\ninterest rate risk in conjunction with its overall asset/liability management process. In accordance with accounting\nrequirements, the Company formally designates all of its hedging relationships as either fair value hedges, intended to\noffset the changes in the value of certain financial instruments due to movements in interest rates, or cash flow hedges,\nintended to offset changes in the cash flows of certain financial instruments due to movement in interest rates, and\ndocuments the strategy for undertaking the hedge transactions, and its method of assessing ongoing effectiveness. The\nCompany does not use derivative instruments for speculative purposes.\nAll derivatives are recognized as either assets or liabilities in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition at their\nfair values. For a derivative designated as a cash flow hedge, the gain or loss on the derivative is recorded in other\ncomprehensive income and subsequently reclassified into interest expense in the same period during which the hedged\ntransaction affects earnings. For a derivative designated as a fair value hedge, the gain or loss on the derivative as well as\nthe offsetting loss or gain on the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk are recognized in current earnings.\nDerivative instruments qualify for hedge accounting treatment only if they are designated as such on the date on which\nthe derivative contract is entered and are expected to be, and are, effective in substantially reducing interest rate risk\narising from the assets and liabilities identified as exposing the Company to risk. Those derivative financial instruments\nthat do not meet the hedging criteria discussed below would be classified as undesignated derivatives and would be\nrecorded at fair value with changes in fair value recorded in income.\nThe Company discontinues hedge accounting when (a) it determines that a derivative is no longer effective in offsetting\nchanges in cash flows of a hedged item; (b) the derivative expires or is sold, terminated or exercised; (c) probability\nexists that the forecasted transaction will no longer occur; or (d) management determines that designating the derivative\nas a hedging instrument is no longer appropriate. In all cases in which hedge accounting is discontinued and a derivative\nremains outstanding, the Company will carry the derivative at fair value in the Consolidated Financial Statements,\nrecognizing changes in fair value in current period income in the Consolidated Statements of Income.\nIn accordance with the applicable accounting guidance, the Company takes into account the impact of collateral and\nmaster netting agreements that allow it to settle all derivative contracts held with a single counterparty on a net basis, and\nto offset the net derivative position with the related collateral when recognizing derivative assets and liabilities. As a\nresult, the Company’s Statements of Financial Condition could reflect derivative contracts with negative fair values\nincluded in derivative assets, and contracts with positive fair values included in derivative liabilities.\nF-19\nTable of Contents\nKEARNY FINANCIAL CORP. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nNote 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (continued)\nThe Company’s interest rate derivatives are comprised of interest rate swaps and caps hedging variable rate wholesale\nfunding and accounted for as cash flow hedges. The carrying value of interest rate derivatives is included in the balance\nof other assets or other liabilities and comprises the remaining unamortized cost of interest rate caps and the cumulative\nchanges in the fair value of interest rate derivatives. Such changes in fair value are offset against accumulated other\ncomprehensive income, net of deferred income tax.\nIn general, the cash flows received and/or exchanged with counterparties for those derivatives qualifying as interest rate\nhedges are generally classified in the financial statements in the same category as the cash flows of the items being\nhedged.\nInterest differentials paid or received under the swap agreements are reflected as adjustments to interest expense. The\nnotional amounts of the interest rate swaps are not exchanged and do not represent exposure to credit loss. In the event of\ndefault by a counter party, the risk in these transactions is the cost of replacing the agreements at current market rates.\nNet Income per Common Share (“EPS”)\nBasic EPS is based on the weighted average number of common shares actually outstanding adjusted for the ESOP\nshares not yet committed to be released. Diluted EPS reflects the potential dilution that could occur if securities or other\ncontracts to issue common stock, such as outstanding stock options or restricted stock units, were exercised or converted\ninto common stock or resulted in the issuance of common stock that then shared in the earnings of the Company. Diluted\nEPS is calculated by adjusting the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding to include the effect\nof contracts or securities exercisable or which could be converted into common stock, if dilutive, using the treasury stock\nmethod. Shares issued and reacquired during any period are weighted for the portion of the period they were outstanding.\nFair Value of Financial Instruments\nFair values of financial instruments are estimated using relevant market information and other assumptions, as more fully\ndisclosed in Note 17, Fair Value of Financial Instruments. Fair value estimates involve uncertainties and matters of\nsignificant judgment regarding interest rates, credit risk, prepayments, and other factors, especially in the absence of\nbroad markets for particular items. Changes in assumptions or in market conditions could significantly affect these\nestimates.\nOperating Segments\nPublic companies are required to report certain financial information about significant revenue-producing segments of\nthe business for which such information is available and utilized by the chief operating decision makers. Substantially all\nof the Company’s operations occur through the Bank and involve the delivery of loan and deposit products to customers.\nManagement makes operating decisions and assesses performance based on an ongoing review of its banking operation,\nwhich constitutes the Company’s only operating segment for financial reporting purposes.\nStock Compensation Plans\nCompensation expense related to stock options, non-vested stock awards and non-vested stock units is based on the fair\nvalue of the award on the measurement date with expense recognized on a straight-line basis over the service period of\nthe award. The fair value of stock options is estimated using the Black-Scholes valuation model. The fair value of non-\nvested stock awards and stock units is generally the closing market price of the Company’s common stock on the date of\ngrant. The Company accounts for forfeitures as they occur.\nAdvertising and Marketing Expenses\nThe Company expenses advertising and marketing costs as incurred.\nNote 2 – Recent Accounting Pronouncements\nIn November 2023, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2023-07, Segment Reporting - Improvements to\nReportable Segment Disclosures (Topic 280), to improve reportable segment disclosures by requiring public entities to disclose\nsignificant expense categories and amounts for each reportable segment, where significant expense categories are defined as those\nthat are regularly reported to an entity’s chief operating decision-maker and included in a segment’s reported measures of profit or\nloss.

For public companies, the requirements will become effective for fiscal years beginning\nafter December 15, 2024, with early adoption permitted. The Company does not expect this ASU to have a material effect on the\nCompany’s consolidated financial statements.\nAdoption of New Accounting Standards\nIn March 2022, the FASB issued ASU 2022-02, Financial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326): Troubled Debt Restructurings\nand Vintage Disclosures (“ASU 2022-02”) to improve the usefulness of information provided to investors about certain loan\nrefinancings, restructurings and writeoffs. ASU 2022-02 eliminates the accounting guidance for troubled debt restructurings by\ncreditors and enhances disclosure requirements for certain modifications made to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty. In\naddition, ASU 2022-02 requires public business entities to disclose current-period gross writeoffs for financing receivables and\nnet investments in leases by year of origination in the vintage disclosures. For entities that have adopted ASU 2016-13, the\namendments in ASU 2022-02 are effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after\nDecember 15, 2022.\nEffective July 1, 2023, the Company adopted ASU 2022-02. Under ASU 2022-02, the Company assesses all loan modifications to\ndetermine whether one is granted to a borrower experiencing financial difficulty, regardless of whether the modified loan terms\ninclude a concession. Modifications granted to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty may be in the form of an interest rate\nreduction, an other-than-insignificant payment delay, a term extension, principal forgiveness or a combination thereof.\nThe Company adopted ASU 2022-02 on a prospective basis. The adoption of this ASU did not have a material effect on the\nCompany’s consolidated financial statements.\nPrior to the adoption of ASU 2022-02, a TDR occurred when the terms of a loan were modified because of deterioration in the\nfinancial condition of the borrower. Modifications could include extension of the repayment terms of the loan, reduced interest\nrates, or forgiveness of accrued interest and/or principal.\nF-21\nKEARNY FINANCIAL CORP.

During the year ended June 30, 2023,\nthere were two TDR defaults totaling $649,000.\nLoan modifications generally involve a reduction in interest rates and/or extension of maturity dates and also may include step up\ninterest rates in their modified terms which will impact their weighted average yield in the future. The loans which were modified\ndue to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty during the year ended June 30, 2024, and loans restructured under the previous\nTDR guidelines, capitalized prior past due amounts, reduced the interest rate or modified the repayment terms.\nIndividually Analyzed Loans\nIndividually analyzed loans include loans which do not share similar risk characteristics with other loans. As of June 30, 2024, the\ncarrying value of individually analyzed loans, including loans acquired with deteriorated credit quality that were individually\nanalyzed, totaled $39.9 million, of which $32.6 million were considered collateral dependent.\nFor collateral dependent loans where management has determined that foreclosure of the collateral is probable, or where the\nborrower is experiencing financial difficulty and repayment of the loan is to be provided substantially through the operation or\nsale of the collateral, the allowance for credit losses is measured based on the difference between the fair value of the collateral,\nF-31\nKEARNY FINANCIAL CORP.

The Company analyzes loans individually to classify the loans as to credit risk. The\nCompany uses the following definitions for risk ratings:\nPass – Loans that are well protected by the current net worth and paying capacity of the obligor (or guarantors, if any) or\nby the fair value, less cost to acquire and sell, of any underlying collateral in a timely manner.\nSpecial Mention – Loans which do not currently expose the Company to a sufficient degree of risk to warrant an\nadverse classification but have some credit deficiencies or other potential weaknesses.\nSubstandard – Loans which are inadequately protected by the paying capacity and net worth of the obligor or the\ncollateral pledged, if any. Substandard assets include those characterized by the distinct possibility that the Company will\nsustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected.\nDoubtful – Loans which have all of the weaknesses inherent in those classified as Substandard, with the added\ncharacteristic that the weaknesses present make collection or liquidation in full highly questionable and improbable, on\nthe basis of currently existing facts, conditions and values.\nLoss – Loans which considered uncollectible or of so little value that their continuance as assets is not warranted.\nThe following table presents the risk category of loans as of June 30, 2024 by loan segment and vintage year:\nF-32\nKEARNY FINANCIAL CORP.

Non-PCD loans are acquired loans that have experienced no or insignificant deterioration in credit\nquality since origination. To distinguish between the two types of acquired loans, the Company evaluates risk characteristics that\nhave been determined to be indicators of deteriorated credit quality. The determining criteria may involve loan specific\ncharacteristics such as payment status, debt service coverage or other changes in creditworthiness since the loan was originated,\nwhile others are relevant to recent economic conditions, such as borrowers in industries impacted by the pandemic.\nAs of June 30, 2024, the carrying amount of PCD loans was $15.7 million and a related allowance for credit losses of $141,000.\nAs of June 30, 2023, the carrying amount of PCD loans was $18.9 million and a related allowance for credit losses of $215,000.\nResidential Mortgage Loans in Foreclosure\nThe Company may obtain physical possession of one- to four-family real estate collateralizing a residential mortgage loan or\nnonresidential real estate collateralizing a nonresidential mortgage loan via foreclosure or through an in-substance repossession.\nAs of June 30, 2024, the Company held no nonresidential property in other real estate owned that was acquired through\nforeclosure on a nonresidential mortgage loan.

The\nCompany’s derivative financial instruments are used to manage differences in the amount, timing, and duration of the Company’s\nknown or expected cash receipts and its known or expected cash payments principally related to specific wholesale funding\npositions and assets.\nFair Values of Derivative Instruments on the Statement of Financial Condition\nThe tables below present the fair value of the Company’s derivative financial instruments as well as their classification on the\nStatement of Financial Condition as of June 30, 2024 and 2023:\nJune 30, 2024\nAsset Derivatives Liability Derivatives\nLocation Fair Value Location Fair Value\n(In Thousands)\nDerivatives designated as hedging instruments:\nInterest rate contracts Other assets $ 54,362 Other liabilities $ —\nTotal $ 54,362 $ —\nJune 30, 2023\nAsset Derivatives Liability Derivatives\nLocation Fair Value Location Fair Value\n(In Thousands)\nDerivatives designated as hedging instruments:\nInterest rate contracts Other assets $ 71,624 Other liabilities $ —\nTotal $ 71,624 $ —\nCash Flow Hedges of Interest Rate Risk\nThe Company uses derivatives to add stability to interest expense and to manage its exposure to interest rate movements. To\naccomplish this objective, the Company has entered into interest rate swaps, interest rate caps and an interest rate floor as part of\nits interest rate risk management strategy. These interest rate products are designated as cash flow hedges. As of June 30, 2024,\nthe Company had a total of 12 interest rate swaps and caps with a total notional amount of $1.43 billion hedging specific\nwholesale funding positions and six interest rate floor with a notional amount of $600.0 million hedging floating-rate available for\nsale securities.\nFor derivatives designated as cash flow hedges, the gain or loss on the derivatives is recorded in other comprehensive income\n(loss), net of tax, and subsequently reclassified into interest expense in the same period during which the hedged transaction\naffects earnings.\nFor cash flow hedges on the Company's wholesale funding positions, amounts reported in accumulated other comprehensive\nincome (loss) related to derivatives will be reclassified to interest expense as interest payments are made on the Company’s\nhedged variable rate wholesale funding positions. During the year ended June 30, 2024, the Company reclassified $37.2 million as\nF-43\nKEARNY FINANCIAL CORP. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nNote 11 – Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities (continued)\na reduction in interest expense. During the next 12 months, the Company estimates that $28.2 million will be reclassified as a\nreduction in interest expense.\nFor cash flow hedges on the Company’s assets, amounts reported in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) related to\nderivatives will be reclassified to interest income as interest payments are received on the Company’s hedged variable rate assets.\nDuring the year ended June 30, 2024, the Company reclassified $248,000 as a reduction in interest income. During the next\ntwelve months, the Company estimates that $725,000 will be reclassified as a reduction in interest income.\nThe table below presents the pre-tax effects of the Company’s derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges on the\nConsolidated Statements of Income for the years ended June 30, 2024, 2023 and 2022:\nYear Ended June 30,\n2024 2023 2022\n(In Thousands)\nAmount of gain recognized in other comprehensive income $ 20,197 $ 39,002 $ 35,844\nAmount of gain (loss) reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income to\ninterest expense $ 37,186 $ 20,393 $ (4,273)\nAmount of loss reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income to interest\nincome $ (248) $ — $ —\nFair Value Hedges of Interest Rate Risk\nThe Company is exposed to changes in the fair value of certain of its fixed-rate assets due to changes in benchmark interest rates.\nThe Company uses interest rate swaps to manage its exposure to changes in fair value on these instruments attributable to changes\nin the designated benchmark interest rate. Interest rate swaps designated as fair value hedges involve the payment of fixed-rate\namounts to a counterparty in exchange for the Company receiving variable-rate payments over the life of the agreements without\nthe exchange of the underlying notional amount. Such derivatives are used to hedge the changes in fair value of certain of its\npools of fixed rate assets. As of June 30, 2024, the Company had five interest rate swaps with a notional amount of $725.0 million\nhedging fixed-rate residential mortgage loans.\nFor derivatives designated and that qualify as fair value hedges, the gain or loss on the derivatives as well as the offsetting loss or\ngain on the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk are recognized in interest income.\nThe table below presents the effects of the Company’s derivative instruments designated as fair value hedges on the Consolidated\nStatements of Income for the years ended June 30, 2024 and 2023:\nYear Ended June 30,\n2024 2023\n(In Thousands)\nGain (loss) on hedged items recorded in interest income on loans $ 2,117 $ (11,437)\nGain on hedges recorded in interest income on loans $ 8,684 $ 14,563\nAs of June 30, 2024 and 2023, the following amounts were recorded on the Statement of Financial Condition related to\ncumulative basis adjustment for fair value hedges:\nJune 30, 2024 June 30, 2023\nLoans receivable: (In Thousands)\nCarrying amount of the hedged assets $ 715,680 $ 663,563\nFair value hedging adjustment included in the carrying amount of the hedged assets $ (9,320) $ (11,437)\n________________________________________\n(1) This amount includes the amortized cost basis of the closed portfolios of loans receivable used to designate hedging relationships in which\nthe hedged item is the stated amount of assets in the closed portfolios anticipated to be outstanding for the designated hedge period.

Under\ncapital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action, the Bank and consolidated Company must\nmeet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of their respective assets, liabilities, and certain off-balance-\nsheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting practices. The Bank’s and consolidated Company’s capital amounts and\nclassification are also subject to qualitative judgments by the regulators about components, risk weighting, and other factors.\nThe minimum capital level requirements applicable to both the Bank and the consolidated Company include: (i) a common equity\nTier 1 capital ratio of 4.5%; (ii) a Tier 1 capital ratio of 6%; (iii) a total capital ratio of 8%; and (iv) a Tier 1 leverage ratio of 4%\nfor all institutions. The Bank and the consolidated Company are also required to maintain a “capital conservation buffer” of 2.5%\nabove the regulatory minimum capital ratios which results in the following minimum ratios: (i) a common equity Tier 1 capital\nratio of 7.0%; (ii) a Tier 1 capital ratio of 8.5%; and (iii) a total capital ratio of 10.5%. An institution will be subject to limitations\non paying dividends, engaging in share repurchases, and paying discretionary bonuses if its capital level falls below the buffer\namount. These limitations will establish a maximum percentage of eligible retained income that could be utilized for such actions.\nAt June 30, 2024 and 2023, the regulatory capital ratios, of both the Company and the Bank were in excess of the levels required\nby federal banking regulators to be classified as “well-capitalized” under regulatory guidelines.\nThe following tables present information regarding the Bank’s regulatory capital levels at June 30, 2024 and 2023:\nAt June 30, 2024\nTo Be Well Capitalized\nUnder Prompt\nFor Capital Corrective Action\nActual Adequacy Purposes Provisions\nAmount Ratio Amount Ratio Amount Ratio\n(Dollars in Thousands)\nTotal capital (to risk-weighted assets) $ 688,597 14.42 % $ 382,034 8.00 % $ 477,542 10.00 %\nTier 1 capital (to risk-weighted assets) 651,620 13.65 % 286,525 6.00 % 382,034 8.00 %\nCommon equity tier 1 capital (to risk-weighted assets) 651,620 13.65 % 214,894 4.50 % 310,402 6.50 %\nTier 1 capital (to adjusted total assets) 651,620 8.44 % 308,656 4.00 % 385,820 5.00 %\nAt June 30, 2023\nTo Be Well Capitalized\nUnder Prompt\nFor Capital Corrective Action\nActual Adequacy Purposes Provisions\nAmount Ratio Amount Ratio Amount Ratio\n(Dollars in Thousands)\nTotal capital (to risk-weighted assets) $ 695,417 13.31 % $ 417,853 8.00 % $ 522,316 10.00 %\nTier 1 capital (to risk-weighted assets) 659,783 12.63 % 313,389 6.00 % 417,853 8.00 %\nCommon equity tier 1 capital (to risk-weighted assets) 659,783 12.63 % 235,042 4.50 % 339,505 6.50 %\nTier 1 capital (to adjusted total assets) 659,783 8.15 % 323,922 4.00 % 404,902 5.00 %\nF-58\nKEARNY FINANCIAL CORP.

A savings institution that is a subsidiary of a savings and loan holding company, such as\nthe Bank, must file an application or a notice with federal banking regulators at least 30 days before making a capital distribution.\nA savings institution must file an application for prior approval of a capital distribution if: (i) it is not eligible for expedited\ntreatment under the applications processing rules of federal banking regulators; (ii) the total amount of all capital distributions,\nincluding the proposed capital distribution, for the applicable calendar year would exceed an amount equal to the savings\ninstitution’s net income for that year to date plus the institution’s retained net income for the preceding two years; (iii) it would\nnot adequately be capitalized after the capital distribution; or (iv) the distribution would violate an agreement with federal banking\nregulators or applicable regulations. Federal banking regulators may disapprove a notice or deny an application for a capital\ndistribution if: (i) the savings institution would be undercapitalized following the capital distribution; (ii) the proposed capital\ndistribution raises safety and soundness concerns; or (iii) the capital distribution would violate a prohibition contained in any\nstatute, regulation or agreement.\nDuring the fiscal year ended June 30, 2024, an application for quarterly capital distributions from the Bank to the Company was\napproved by federal banking regulators.

AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nNote 15 – Income Taxes (continued)\nthan 50 percent likelihood of being realized upon settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant\ninformation. The determination of whether or not a tax position has met the more likely than not recognition threshold considers\nthe facts, circumstances, and information available at the reporting date and is subject to management’s judgment.\nRealization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income or the existence of sufficient taxable\nincome within the carryover period. A valuation allowance is provided when it is more likely than not that some portion of the\ndeferred tax assets will not be realized. In assessing the need for a valuation allowance, management considers the scheduled\nreversal of the deferred tax liabilities, the level of historical taxable income, and the projected future taxable income over the\nperiods in which the temporary differences comprising the deferred tax assets will be deductible. Based on its assessments as of\nJune 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company determined it is more likely than not that all deferred tax assets will be realized.\nThe tax effects of existing temporary differences that give rise to deferred income tax assets and liabilities are as follows:\nJune 30,\n2024 2023\n(In Thousands)\nDeferred income tax assets:\nPurchase accounting $ 3,543 $ 4,098\nAccumulated other comprehensive income:\nUnrealized loss on securities available for sale 37,683 45,018\nAllowance for credit losses 12,786 14,211\nBenefit plans 2,605 2,603\nCompensation 1,303 1,440\nStock-based compensation 2,923 3,161\nUncollected interest 1,177 1,313\nDepreciation 2,309 2,335\nNet operating loss carryover 889 2\nCapital loss carryforward 614 191\nOther items 780 839\n66,612 75,211\nDeferred income tax liabilities:\nDeferred loan fees and costs 1,690 1,710\nAccumulated other comprehensive income:\nDerivatives 12,085 16,940\nDefined benefit plans 98 78\nGoodwill 2,400 4,510\n16,273 23,238\nNet deferred income tax asset $ 50,339 $ 51,973\nThe Company has various state and local NOL carryforwards which will begin to expire in the year ending June 30, 2025.\nThe Company and its subsidiaries are subject to U.S. federal income tax, as well as income tax of the state of New Jersey and\nvarious other states. The Company is generally no longer subject to examination by federal, state and local taxing authorities for\ntax years prior to June 30, 2021.\nF-61\nKEARNY FINANCIAL CORP. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nNote 16 – Commitments\nThe Bank is a party to financial instruments with off-balance-sheet risk in the normal course of business to meet the financing\nneeds of its customers. These financial instruments include commitments to extend credit. These transactions involve elements of\ncredit and interest rate risk in excess of the amounts recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition. The\nBank's exposure to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the other party to the financial instrument for commitments to\nextend credit is represented by the contractual notional amount of those instruments. The Bank uses the same credit policies in\nmaking commitments and conditional obligations as it does for on-balance-sheet instruments.\nCommitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a customer as long as there is no violation of any condition established in\nthe contract. Commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee.\nSince many of the commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon, the total commitment amounts do not\nnecessarily represent future cash requirements. The Bank evaluates each customer’s creditworthiness on a case-by-case basis. The\namount of collateral obtained if deemed necessary by the Bank upon extension of credit is based on management’s credit\nevaluation of the borrower. At June 30, 2024 and 2023, the Bank had $280.9 million and $251.2 million in commitments to\noriginate loans, including unused lines of credit.\nThe Bank is party to standby letters of credit through which it guarantees certain specific business obligations of its commercial\ncustomers. The balance of standby letters of credit at June 30, 2024 and 2023 were approximately $160,000 and $115,000,\nrespectively.\nIn addition to the commitments noted above, at June 30, 2024, the Company’s pipeline of loans held for sale included $16.0\nmillion of in-process loans whose terms included interest rate locks to borrowers that were paired with a best-efforts commitment\nto sell the loan to a buyer at a fixed price within a predetermined timeframe after the sale commitment is established.\nThe Company and subsidiaries are also party to litigation which arises primarily in the ordinary course of business. In the opinion\nof management, the ultimate disposition of such litigation should not have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial\nposition of the Company.\nNote 17 – Fair Value of Financial Instruments\nFair value is the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (exit price) in the principal or\nmost advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date.\nThere are three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair values:\nLevel 1: Quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in active markets that the entity has the ability to access\nas of the measurement date.\nLevel 2: Inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or\nindirectly. These might include quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for\nidentical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active, inputs other than quoted prices that are\nobservable for the asset or liability or inputs that are derived principally from, or corroborated by, market data by\ncorrelation or other means.\nLevel 3: Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of\nthe assets or liabilities. Level 3 assets and liabilities include financial instruments whose value is determined using\npricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies, or similar techniques, as well as instruments for which the\ndetermination of fair value requires significant management judgment or estimation.\nF-62\nKEARNY FINANCIAL CORP. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nNote 17 – Fair Value of Financial Instruments (continued)\nAssets Measured on a Recurring Basis:\nThe following methods and significant assumptions were used to estimate the fair values of the Company’s assets measured at fair\nvalue on a recurring basis at June 30, 2024 and 2023:\nInvestment Securities Available for Sale\nThe Company’s available for sale investment securities are reported at fair value utilizing Level 2 inputs. For these securities, the\nCompany obtains fair value measurements from an independent pricing service. The fair value measurements consider observable\ndata that may include dealer quotes, market spreads, cash flows, the U.S. Treasury yield curve, live trading levels, trade execution\ndata, market consensus prepayment speeds, credit information and the securities’ terms and conditions, among other things. From\ntime to time, the Company validates prices supplied by the independent pricing service by comparison to prices obtained from\nthird-party sources or derived using internal models.\nDerivatives\nThe Company has contracted with a third party vendor to provide periodic valuations for its interest rate derivatives to determine\nthe fair value of its interest rate caps and swaps. The vendor utilizes standard valuation methodologies applicable to interest rate\nderivatives such as discounted cash flow analysis and extensions of the Black-Scholes model. Such valuations are based upon\nreadily observable market data and are therefore considered Level 2 valuations by the Company.\nThose assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis are summarized below:\nJune 30, 2024\nQuoted\nPrices\nin Active Significant\nMarkets for Other Significant\nIdentical Observable Unobservable\nAssets Inputs Inputs\n(Level 1) (Level 2) (Level 3) Total\n(In Thousands)\nAssets:\nDebt securities available for sale:\nAsset-backed securities $ — $ 80,440 $ — $ 80,440\nCollateralized loan obligations — 389,543 — 389,543\nCorporate bonds — 131,797 — 131,797\nTotal debt securities — 601,780 — 601,780\nMortgage-backed securities available for sale:\nResidential pass-through securities — 337,264 — 337,264\nCommercial pass-through securities — 133,789 — 133,789\nTotal mortgage-backed securities — 471,053 — 471,053\nTotal securities available for sale $ — $ 1,072,833 $ — $ 1,072,833\nInterest rate contracts $ — $ 54,362 $ — $ 54,362\nTotal assets $ — $ 1,127,195 $ — $ 1,127,195\nF-63\nKEARNY FINANCIAL CORP.

Such collateral primarily consists of real estate and, to a lesser extent, other business\nassets. Management may also adjust appraised values to reflect estimated changes in market values or apply other adjustments to\nappraised values resulting from its knowledge of the collateral. Internal valuations may be utilized to determine the fair value of\nother business assets. For non-collateral-dependent loans, management estimates fair value using discounted cash flows based on\ninputs that are largely unobservable and instead reflect management’s own estimates of the assumptions as a market participant\nwould in pricing such loans. Individually analyzed collateral dependent loans are considered a Level 3 valuation by the Company.\nOther Real Estate Owned\nOther real estate owned is recorded at estimated fair value, less estimated selling costs when acquired, thus establishing a new\ncost basis. Fair value is generally based on independent appraisals. These appraisals include adjustments to comparable assets\nbased on the appraisers’ market knowledge and experience. When an asset is acquired, the excess of the loan balance over fair\nvalue, less estimated selling costs, is charged to the allowance for credit losses. If further declines in the estimated fair value of the\nasset occur, a write-down is recorded through expense. The valuation of foreclosed assets is subjective in nature and may be\nadjusted in the future because of changes in economic conditions.\nF-64\nKEARNY FINANCIAL CORP.

By comparison, at June 30, 2023,\ncollateral dependent loans valued using Level 3 inputs comprised loans with principal balance totaling $21.0 million and\nvaluation allowances of $3.3 million reflecting an aggregate fair value of $17.7 million.\nOnce a loan is foreclosed, the fair value of the other real estate owned continues to be evaluated based upon the fair value of the\nrepossessed real estate originally securing the loan. At June 30, 2024, the Company had no other real estate owned assets.

The fair value of commitments to fund credit lines and originate or participate in loans held in portfolio or loans\nheld for sale is estimated using fees currently charged to enter into similar agreements taking into account the remaining terms of\nthe agreements and the present creditworthiness of the counterparties. For fixed rate loan commitments, including those relating to\nloans held for sale that are considered derivative instruments for financial statement reporting purposes, the fair value also\nconsiders the difference between current levels of interest and the committed rates. The carrying value, represented by the net\ndeferred fee arising from the unrecognized commitment, and the fair value, determined by discounting the remaining contractual\nfee over the term of the commitment using fees currently charged to enter into similar agreements with similar credit risk, is not\nconsidered material for disclosure.\nLimitations. Fair value estimates are made at a specific point in time based on relevant market information and information about\nthe financial instruments. These estimates do not reflect any premium or discount that could result from offering for sale at one\ntime the entire holdings of a particular financial instrument. Because no fair value exists for a significant portion of the financial\ninstruments, fair value estimates are based on judgments regarding future expected loss experience, current economic conditions,\nrisk characteristics of various financial instruments and other factors. These estimates are subjective in nature, involve\nuncertainties and matters of judgment and, therefore, cannot be determined with precision. Changes in assumptions could\nsignificantly affect the estimates.\nThe fair value estimates are based on existing on-and-off balance sheet financial instruments without attempting to value\nanticipated future business and the value of assets and liabilities that are not considered financial instruments. Other significant\nassets and liabilities that are not considered financial assets and liabilities include premises and equipment, and advances from\nborrowers for taxes and insurance. In addition, the ramifications related to the realization of the unrealized gains and losses can\nhave a significant effect on fair value estimates and have not been considered in any of the estimates.\nFinally, reasonable comparability between financial institutions may not be likely due to the wide range of permitted valuation\ntechniques and numerous estimates which must be made given the absence of active secondary markets for many of the financial\ninstruments. This lack of uniform valuation methodologies introduces a greater degree of subjectivity to these estimated fair\nvalues.\nF-68\nKEARNY FINANCIAL CORP.

Account\nmaintenance fees, which relate primarily to monthly maintenance, are earned over the course of a month, representing the period\nover which the Company satisfies the performance obligation. Overdraft fees are recognized at the point in time that the overdraft\noccurs. Service charges on deposits are withdrawn from the customer’s account balance.\nGains/Losses on Sales of OREO\nThe Company records a gain or loss from the sale of OREO when control of the property transfers to the buyer, which generally\noccurs at the time of an executed deed. Gain/Losses on the sales of OREO falls within the scope of ASC 606, if the Company\nfinances the transaction. Under ASC 606, if the Company finances the sale of OREO to the buyer, the Company is required to\nassess whether the buyer is committed to perform their obligations under the contract and whether the collectability of the\ntransaction price is probable. Once these criteria are met, the OREO asset is derecognized and the gain or loss on sale is recorded\nupon the transfer of control of the property to the buyer. In determining the gain or loss on the sale, the Company adjusts the\ntransaction price and related (loss) gain on sale if a significant financing component is present.\nInterchange Income\nThe Company earns interchange fees from debit and credit card holder transactions conducted through various payment networks.\nInterchange fees from cardholder transactions are recognized daily, concurrently with the transaction processing services provided\nby an outsourced technology solution.\nF-70\nKEARNY FINANCIAL CORP.

AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nNote 21 – Net (Loss) Income per Common Share (EPS)\nBasic EPS is based on the weighted average number of common shares actually outstanding, including both vested and unvested\nrestricted stock awards, adjusted for ESOP shares not yet committed to be released. Diluted EPS reflects the potential dilution that\ncould occur if securities or other contracts to issue common stock, such as outstanding stock options or unvested RSUs, were\nexercised or converted into common stock or resulted in the issuance of common stock that then shared in the earnings of the\nCompany. Diluted EPS is calculated by adjusting the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding to include\nthe effect of contracts or securities exercisable or which could be converted into common stock, if dilutive, using the treasury\nstock method. Shares issued and reacquired during any period are weighted for the portion of the period they were outstanding.\nThe following schedule shows the Company’s earnings per share calculations for the periods presented:\nFor the Year Ended June 30,\n2024 2023 2022\n(In Thousands, Except Per Share Data)\nNet (loss) income $ (86,667) $ 40,811 $ 67,547\nWeighted average number of common shares outstanding - basic 62,444 64,804 70,911\nEffect of dilutive securities — — 22\nWeighted average number of common shares outstanding- diluted 62,444 64,804 70,933\nBasic earnings per share $ (1.39) $ 0.63 $ 0.95\nDiluted earnings per share $ (1.39) $ 0.63 $ 0.95\nStock options for 2,751,902, 2,983,530 and 3,115,000 shares of common stock were not considered in computing diluted earnings\nper share at June 30, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively, because they were considered anti-dilutive. In addition, 689,252 and\n497,664 RSUs were not considered in computing diluted earnings per share at June 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, because they\nwere considered anti-dilutive.\nF-73\nSIGNATURES\nPursuant to the requirements of Section 13 or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Registrant has duly\ncaused this Report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned, thereunto duly authorized.\nKEARNY FINANCIAL CORP.\nDated: August 23, 2024 /s/ Craig L.
