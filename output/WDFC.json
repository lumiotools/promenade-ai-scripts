WD-40 Multi-Use Product, the core of our business, grew revenue 11 percent year over year, and we saw a significant year over year margin recovery of 240 basis points. Our performance demonstrates the strength of our brand and the effectiveness of our strategy. \n\n\"Our Four-by-Four Strategic Framework is working. We're turning up the heat on our Must-Win Battles, from geographic expansion to digital commerce. The success we've seen in Brazil and Mexico gives us confidence that we can unlock further game-changing opportunities in emerging markets. As part of our overall commitment to focus on WD-40’s core business, we’ve announced our intention to divest our homecare and cleaning products portfolio. This strategic move will allow us to concentrate our resources on innovating and extending the reach of our higher-growth, higher-margin maintenance products. \n\n\"We've also recently introduced our new mantra, 'few things, many places, bigger impact.' This focused approach is already driving efficiencies and better returns on our investments globally, in areas such as product innovation and systems implementation. It's helping us leverage our global presence to drive faster growth and operational excellence. Throughout this growth journey, our strategy remains simple: make our products available in more places and put more cans in the hands of our target end users around the world. \n\n“Looking ahead to fiscal year 2025, we’re well positioned to continue our growth trajectory. Our focus remains on executing our strategy, expanding in high-potential markets across the globe, and driving operational efficiencies. With our strong brand, clear strategy, and engaged workforce, we are confident in our ability to continue delivering long-term value to our stockholders,” concluded Brass. \n\n**Net Sales by Segment (in thousands):**\n\n**Three Months Ended August 31,** |  **Fiscal Year Ended August 31,**  \n---|---  \n**2024** |  **2023** |  **Dollars** |  **Change** |  **2024** |  **2023** |  **Dollars** |  **Change**  \nAmericas (2) |  $  |  79,198  |  $  |  74,738  |  $  |  4,460  |  6  |  %  |  $  |  281,883  |  $  |  266,772  |  $  |  15,111  |  6  |  %   \nEIMEA (3) |  58,579  |  50,713  |  7,866  |  16  |  %  |  221,045  |  190,818  |  30,227  |  16  |  %   \nAsia-Pacific (4) |  18,214  |  15,001  |  3,213  |  21  |  %  |  87,629  |  79,665  |  7,964  |  10  |  %   \nTotal  |  $  |  155,991  |  $  |  140,452  |  $  |  15,539  |  11  |  %  |  $  |  590,557  |  $  |  537,255  |  $  |  53,302  |  10  |  %   \n  \n**Fourth Quarter Highlights by Segment:**\n\n**Americas**\n\n  * The Americas segment represented 51 percent of total net sales in the fourth quarter. \n  * Net sales in the Americas increased $4.5 million or 6 percent in the fourth quarter compared to the prior year fiscal quarter. The increase was due primarily to an increase in net sales of WD-40® Multi-Use Product of $4.2 million or 7 percent compared to the prior year fiscal quarter. WD-40® Multi-Use Product sales increased most significantly in Latin America, which were up $5.9 million, and were partially offset by lower sales in the United States of $1.7 million. \n  * Net sales of WD-40 Specialist® increased $0.6 million or 6 percent in the fourth quarter due primarily to strong sales in Latin America and Canada. \n\n\n\n**EIMEA**\n\n  * The EIMEA segment represented 37 percent of total net sales in the fourth quarter. \n  * Net sales in EIMEA increased $7.9 million or 16 percent in the fourth quarter compared to the prior year fiscal quarter. The increase was due primarily to an increase in net sales of WD-40® Multi-Use Product of $6.2 million or 16 percent. WD-40® Multi-Use Product sales increased most significantly in the EIMEA distributor markets which were up $4.8 million. WD-40® Multi-Use Product sales also increased in France and the DACH(5) region, which were up $1.0 million and $0.6 million, respectively. \n  * Net sales of WD-40 Specialist® increased $0.9 million or 13 percent due primarily to the combined impact of higher sales volume and the favorable impact of price increases across the regions. \n  * Translation of the Company’s foreign subsidiaries’ results from their functional currencies to U.S. dollars had a favorable impact on sales in EIMEA for the current quarter. On a non-GAAP constant currency basis, net sales in EIMEA would have been $58.1 million for the fourth quarter.(1)\n\n\n\n**Asia-Pacific**\n\n  * The Asia-Pacific segment represented 12 percent of total net sales in the fourth quarter. \n  * Net sales in Asia-Pacific increased $3.2 million or 21 percent in the fourth quarter compared to the prior year fiscal quarter. This increase was due primarily to an increase in sales of WD-40® Multi-Use Product of $2.9 million or 26 percent. WD-40® Multi-Use Product sales increased most significantly in the Asia distributor markets, which were up $2.9 million due to successful brand building programs in certain regions and the timing of customer orders. \n  * Net sales of WD-40 Specialist® increased $0.4 million or 24 percent due primarily to successful brand building in certain regions and the timing of customer orders. \n  * Translation of the Company’s foreign subsidiaries’ results from their functional currencies to U.S. dollars did not have a significant impact on sales in Asia-Pacific for the current quarter. \n\n\n\n**Net Sales by Product Group (in thousands):**\n\n**Three Months Ended August 31,** |  **Fiscal Year Ended August 31,**  \n---|---  \n**2024** |  **2023** |  **Dollars** |  **Change** |  **2024** |  **2023** |  **Dollars** |  **Change**  \nWD-40 Multi-Use Product  |  118,961  |  $  |  105,672  |  $  |  13,289  |  13  |  %  |  $  |  452,925  |  $  |  407,672  |  $  |  45,253  |  11  |  %   \nWD-40 Specialist  |  20,055  |  18,148  |  1,907  |  11  |  %  |  73,938  |  66,714  |  7,224  |  11  |  %   \nOther maintenance products (6) |  8,474  |  7,997  |  477  |  6  |  %  |  31,173  |  29,172  |  2,001  |  7  |  %   \nTotal maintenance products  |  147,490  |  131,817  |  15,673  |  12  |  %  |  558,036  |  503,558  |  54,478  |  11  |  %   \nHCCP (7) |  8,501  |  8,635  |  (134  |  )  |  (2  |  )%  |  32,521  |  33,697  |  (1,176  |  )  |  (3  |  )%   \nTotal  |  $  |  155,991  |  $  |  140,452  |  $  |  15,539  |  11  |  %  |  $  |  590,557  |  $  |  537,255  |  $  |  53,302  |  10  |  %   \n  \n  * Net sales of maintenance products increased 13 percent in the fourth quarter when compared to the prior year fiscal quarter primarily due to increased sales of WD-40® Multi-Use Product in EIMEA, Latin America, and the Asia distributor markets from period to period. Maintenance products are considered the primary strategic focus for the Company. \n  * Net sales of homecare and cleaning products decreased 2 percent in the fourth quarter compared to the prior year fiscal quarter. The homecare and cleaning products, particularly those in the Americas, are considered harvest brands providing consistent profit returns to the Company and are becoming a smaller part of the business as net sales of maintenance products grow in alignment with the Company’s Four-by-Four Strategic Framework. The Company has previously disclosed its intent to actively pursue the sale of its homecare and cleaning product portfolios in the Americas and the United Kingdom. \n\n\n\n**Dividend and Share Repurchase Update**\n\n  * On October 4, 2024, the Company’s board of directors declared a regular quarterly dividend of $0.88 per share payable on October 31, 2024 to stockholders of record at the close of business on October 18, 2024. \n  * On June 19, 2023, the Company’s board approved a share repurchase plan that became effective on September 1, 2023. Under the plan, the Company is authorized to acquire up to $50.0 million of its outstanding shares through August 31, 2025. \n  * During fiscal year 2024, the Company repurchased 34,250 shares at a total cost of $8.1 million under this $50.0 million plan. \n  * The timing and amount of repurchases under the plan are based on terms and conditions as may be acceptable to the Company’s chief executive officer and chief financial officer, subject to present loan covenants, and in compliance with all laws and regulations applicable thereto. \n\n\n\n**Fiscal Year 2025 Guidance**\n\nThe Company is providing the following fiscal year guidance on a pro forma basis, excluding the full fiscal year financial impact of the homecare and cleaning product portfolios the Company expects to divest in fiscal year 2025: \n\n  * Net sales growth from the 2024 pro forma results is projected to be between 6 and 11 percent with net sales expected to be between $600 million and $630 million on a non-GAAP constant currency basis. \n  * Gross margin for the full year is expected to be between 54 and 55 percent. \n  * Advertising and promotion investments are projected to be around 6 percent of net sales. \n  * Operating income is projected to be between $95 million and $100 million. This range reflects anticipated growth of between 6 to 12 percent compared to 2024 pro forma results. \n  * The provision for income tax is expected to be around 24 percent. \n  * Diluted earnings per share is expected to be between $5.20 and $5.45 based on an estimated 13.5 million weighted average shares outstanding. This range reflects anticipated growth of between 9 to 14 percent compared to 2024 pro forma results. \n\n\n\n“Our fiscal year 2024 performance demonstrates the power of the WD-40 Company business model, with strong performance across all trading blocs and the successful implementation of several strategic initiatives,” said Sara Hyzer, WD-40 Company's vice president, finance and chief financial officer. “Our gross margin has improved substantially, exceeding our guidance range and moving us closer to our 55 percent target. This improvement was primarily driven by favorable sales mix, lower input costs, and enhanced operational efficiencies across our global supply chain. \n\n“Consistent with our increased focus, we continue to make progress on the divestiture of our Americas and United Kingdom homecare and cleaning product portfolios and we expect to complete this transaction in the first half of fiscal year 2025. Looking ahead, we’re guiding for net sales growth of between 6 and 11 percent on a pro forma basis in fiscal year 2025, excluding the financial impact of the homecare and cleaning brands we expect to divest this fiscal year.” \n\nThis guidance is expressed in good faith and is based on management’s current view of anticipated results on a pro forma basis. Unanticipated inflationary headwinds and other unforeseen events may further affect the Company’s financial results. Net sales guidance presented on a non-GAAP constant currency basis use weighted average fiscal year 2024 foreign currency exchange rates. In the event the Company is unsuccessful in the divestiture of its homecare and cleaning products in the Americas and United Kingdom, its guidance would be positively impacted by approximately $23 million in net sales, approximately $6 million in operating income, and approximately $0.33 in diluted EPS for the full fiscal year. \n\n**Webcast Information**\n\nAs previously announced, WD-40 Company management will host a live webcast at approximately 2:00 p.m. PDT today to discuss these results.

Constant currency disclosures represent the translation of our current fiscal year revenues, expenses and net income from the functional currencies of our subsidiaries to U.S. dollars using the exchange rates in effect for the corresponding period of the prior fiscal year. Results on a constant currency basis are not in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“non-GAAP”) and should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, results prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. We use results on a constant currency basis as one of the measures to understand our operating results and evaluate our performance in comparison to prior periods in order to enhance the visibility of the underlying business trends, excluding the impact of translation arising from foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. Management believes this non-GAAP financial measure provides investors with additional financial information that should be considered when assessing our underlying business performance and trends. However, reference to constant currency basis should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for other financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP.   \n---|---

Brass\nCEO, President & Director\nThank you, Wendy, and thanks to all of you for joining us this afternoon. Fiscal year '24 has been a year\nof exceptional strength, resilience and strategic progress. We've navigated challenges, capitalize on\nopportunities and continue to build on the strong foundation that has made WD-40 Company a success for\nover 7 decades.\nToday, I'll provide you an overview of our sales results for the full fiscal quarter of 2024 and the progress\nwe've made against our Four-by-Four Strategic Framework. After that, Sara will provide you a brief update\non the divestiture of our home care and cleaning business and update on our business model and outlook\nfor fiscal year 2025. We will then take your questions.\nI'm pleased to announce that our fourth quarter was our second consecutive record-breaking sales\nquarter. Today, we reported fourth quarter net sales of $156 million, representing an increase of over 11%\nand sales and maintenance products experiencing double-digit growth during both the fourth quarter and\nthe full fiscal year.\nBy the close of fiscal year '24, sales of our signature product, WD-40 Multi-Use Product, reached $453\nmillion, an 11% increase over prior year and a new annual record for our core brand. In addition, I'm\nvery happy to report that gross margin continues to improve and is moving closer to our target of 55%.\nCopyright © 2024 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.\nspglobal.com/marketintelligence 3\nWD-40 COMPANY FQ4 2024 EARNINGS CALL OCT 17, 2024\nIn the fourth quarter, we reported gross margin of 54.1%, which is an improvement of 100 basis points\nsequentially from the third quarter and 270 basis points compared to the fourth quarter of last fiscal year.\nNow let me discuss fourth quarter sales results by segment. Unless otherwise noted, I will discuss sales\non a reported basis compared to the fourth quarter of last fiscal year. This quarter, sales in the Americas,\nwhich includes the United States, Latin America and Canada, grew approximately 6% over the prior year\nto $79 million. The bulk of this growth was driven by higher sales volumes of WD-40 Multi-Use Product,\nwhich increased 7% compared to the prior year. Much of this growth came from strong sales in Latin\nAmerica, which increased by 63% over the prior period. These increased sales were partially offset by\nlower sales in the United States and Canada.\nOur Latin America market is comprised of our direct markets in Mexico and Brazil and all remaining Latin\nAmerican countries, most of which are served by our marketing distributor partners in the region. Sales\nof WD-40 Multi-Use Product in Latin America was favorably impacted by our transition to a direct market\nmodel in Brazil. In the third quarter of fiscal year '24, we acquired our Brazilian distributor and shifted\nfrom an indirect distribution model to one where we sell directly to retail customers. This distribution\nmodel shift favorably impacted net sales in Brazil by nearly $7 million for the full fiscal year.\nWe also continue to experience positive momentum in our direct market in Mexico from the shift we made\nin 2020 from a distributor model. Sales in Mexico and other Latin American markets increased 24% and\n9%, respectively, due to the timing of customer orders, successful brand building programs, increased\ndistribution and expanded availability of WD-40 Smart Straw.\nAs I shared with you last quarter, our plan for fiscal year '24 in the Americas was always driven primarily\nby strong Latin American growth, and that has played out. In the United States, sales of WD-40 Multi-Use\nproduct decreased by 4% compared to the prior period. The United States experienced solid point-of-sale\ndemand in the fourth quarter. However, compared to the same period last year, sales were down. We are\ncomparing against an exceptionally strong performance in the fourth quarter of last year, when we saw\ndouble-digit increases in both volume and sales in the United States.\nIn Canada, sales of WD-40 Multi-Use Product decreased 3% compared to the prior period. Sales in Canada\nwere negatively impacted period-over-period due to phasing associated with the discontinuation of our\nclassic can delivery system and the implementation and conversion of Smart Straw Next Generation in\nCanada. The good news is that we're seeing positive trends at distribution points where we have fully\nconverted our customers to Smart Straw Next Generation and expect this conversion to drive significant\nlong-term gains as we fully leverage our premium formats.\nIn the Americas, sales of WD-40 Specialist increased across most regions and were up 6% compared to\nthe prior year period, primarily due to strong sales in Canada and Latin America. In total, our maintenance\nproducts increased 7% in the Americas this quarter. The growth in maintenance products was partly offset\nby a decline of 12% in home care and cleaning product brands.\nFor the full fiscal year, maintenance product sales in the Americas totaled $267 million, reflecting a 7%\nincrease compared to the prior year. This growth aligns with our long-term target for the region, which\nprojects annual growth between 5% and 8%. In total, our Americas segment made up 51% of our global\nbusiness in the fourth quarter.\nNow turning to our sales in EIMEA. This quarter, sales in the EIMEA, which includes Europe, India, the\nMiddle East and Africa grew approximately 16% over the prior period to $59 million. Currency fluctuations\nhad a minimal impact on our sales in EIMEA and on a constant currency basis, sales would have increased\n15%. The strong growth in EIMEA was driven by higher volume sales of WD-40 Multi-Use Product, which\nincreased 16% compared to the prior period. This growth is primarily attributable to increased sales in our\nEIMEA distributor markets, which are up 41% compared to the prior year. This quarter, we saw double-\ndigit growth in many of our EIMEA distributor markets with particularly strong growth in Northern Europe\nand India, which increased 52% and 206%, respectively.\nIn our EIMEA direct markets, sales of WD-40 Multi-Use Product were also very strong in many markets,\nprimarily due to improved volume as many of our customers have adjusted to the impact of price\nCopyright © 2024 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.\nspglobal.com/marketintelligence 4\nWD-40 COMPANY FQ4 2024 EARNINGS CALL OCT 17, 2024\nincreases implemented last fiscal year. Sales increased 5% compared to the prior period, most significantly\nin France and the DACH region, where they were up 18% and 12%, respectively. The DACH region\ncomprises Germany, Austria and Switzerland.\nSales of WD-40 Specialist increased across most regions of EIMEA and were up 13% compared to the prior\nperiod due to the combined impact of higher sales volume due to increased distribution and stronger levels\nof demand after customers adjusted to price increases. In total, our maintenance products increased 15%\nin EIMEA in the fourth fiscal quarter. In addition, sales of home care and cleaning product brands sold in\nthe U.K. increased 25% in the fourth quarter.\nFor the full fiscal year, maintenance product sales in EIMEA totaled $212 million, reflecting a 17% increase\ncompared to the prior year. This growth surpasses our long-term growth target for the region which\nprojects annual growth between 8% and 11%. In total, our EIMEA segment made up 37% of our global\nbusiness in the fourth quarter.\nNow turning to Asia Pacific. Sales in Asia Pacific, which includes Australia, China and other countries in the\nAsia region, were approximately 21% over the prior year to $18 million. The growth was driven primarily\nby higher sales of WD-40 Multi-Use Product, which were up 26% compared to the prior period. This\ngrowth was driven in large part by higher sales and maintenance products in our Asia-Pacific distributor\nmarkets which are up 51% compared to the prior period due to successful brand building programs in\ncertain regions and the timing of customer orders.\nIn China, sales of maintenance products were up 10% compared to the prior period, due to successful\nbrand building programs and the timing of customer orders. China continues to see strong growth in both\nthe WD-40 Multi-Use Product and WD-40 Specialist with full fiscal year sales and maintenance products up\n14% compared to the prior year.\nIn Australia, sales were flat compared to the prior period. Sales of no vac carpet cleaning product\ndecreased 6% compared to the prior period due to the timing of promotional activities. However, this sales\ndecline was almost entirely offset by higher sales of WD-40 Specialist, which increased 15% compared to\nthe prior period, primarily due to successful brand building and promotional programs.\nFor the full fiscal year, maintenance product sales in Asia Pacific totaled $79 million, reflecting a 10%\nincrease compared to the prior year. This growth in line with our long-term growth target for the region,\nwhich projects annual growth between 10% and 13%. In total, our Asia Pacific segment went up 12% of\nour global business in the fourth quarter.\nNow let me discuss the progress we've made against our Four-by-Four Strategic Framework, which, as\nyou will recall, is comprised of our 4 Must-Win Battles and our 4 strategic enablers. Our Must-Win Battles\nfocus on what we do to increase sales and profitability. We look at these as long-term growth drivers, and\ntherefore, we will focus our discussion on the full fiscal year results of those battles.\nStarting with Must-Win Battle number one, lead geographic expansion. Global sales of WD-40 Multi-Use\nProduct in fiscal year '24 were $453 million, representing growth of 11% over prior year. We experienced\nstrong sales of our signature Multi-Use Product brand in all 3 trade blocks with 18% growth in EIMEA, 7%\ngrowth in the Americas and 9% growth in Asia Pacific.\nPeople often ask Sara and I what we believe investors misunderstand about WD-40 Company as an\ninvestment. I tell them that investors sometimes overlook the significant global expansion opportunities\nstill available even after 71 years for the blue and yellow can with the little red top. We've made excellent\nprogress this fiscal year in many key markets with strong sales growth of 40% in Latin America, 13% in\nour Asia distributor markets, 25% in France and 21% in India. But what I want to emphasize today is that\nwe have so much further to go.\nAs I look around the world, all I see is opportunity. We estimate the global benchmark sales opportunity\nfor WD-40 Multi-Use Product to be approximately $1.6 billion. We calculate that benchmark sales\nopportunity by using macroeconomic data from World Bank market data and combining that data with an\ninternally developed algorithm. We've used these data sources combined with our algorithm for close to 30\nyears and have proven to be remarkably accurate. The data show that after 71 years, we've achieved only\nCopyright © 2024 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.\nspglobal.com/marketintelligence 5\nWD-40 COMPANY FQ4 2024 EARNINGS CALL OCT 17, 2024\napproximately 28% of the benchmark sales opportunity for WD-40 Multi-Use Product. Therefore, there\nremains approximately $1.2 billion of land and expand growth opportunity across the globe. Our strategy\nremains simple, yet effective to reach this goal to make our product available to buy in more places and\nput more cans in the hands of our target end users around the world.\nThe success of our geographic expansion strategy is perhaps best exemplified by our progress in Brazil.\nFollowing our acquisition of our Brazilian distributor, we achieved sales growth of nearly $7 million in the\nfirst 6 months of direct operations, exceeding our initial expectations. This success, coupled with our\nexperience in growing markets all around the world, gives us confidence in our ability to unlock further\ngame-changing opportunities in emerging markets and move the needle ever closer to the significant\ngrowth opportunity in front of us.\nNext is Must-Win Battle number two, accelerating premiumization. Global sales of WD-40 Smart Straw and\nEZ Reach in fiscal year 2024 when combined, grew 11% or approximately $20 million over the prior year.\nOur premiumization strategy was developed with our end users in mind, our premiumized products delight\nour end users and lead them with positive lasting memories. In addition, premiumization continues to be a\nmajor contributor to our revenue growth and gross margin expansion.\nOver the last 5 years, we've achieved a compound annual growth rate for net sales of premium products\nof 10.7%. On a go-forward basis, we'll be targeting a compound annual growth rate for net sales of\npremium product formats of greater than 10%.\nOur third Must-Win Battle is to drive WD-40 Specialist growth. Global sales of WD-40 Specialist products\nin fiscal year '24 were nearly $74 million, up 11% or $7 million over the prior year. Through our WD-40\nSpecialist product line, we aspire to achieve category leadership and increase our market share by\nleveraging our core brand equity. Once again, we saw growth at WD-40 Specialist products across all\n3 trade blocks with growth of 6% in the Americas, 14% in EIMEA and 17% in Asia Pacific. In China,\nwe continue to experience spectacular growth of WD-40 Specialist. Our sales grew over $1.4 million or\n45% due to expanded distribution, new WD-40 Specialist product introduction to the region as well as\nsuccessful brand building programs.\nWe estimate the benchmark sales opportunity for WD-40 Specialist globally to be approximately $605\nmillion. And to date, we've achieved only 12% of our benchmark growth opportunity. Over the last 5\nyears, we've achieved a compound annual growth rate for net sales of WD-40 Specialist of 14%. On a go-\nforward basis, we will be targeting a compound annual growth rate for net sales of WD-40 Specialist at\ngreater than 15%.\nOur fourth and final Must-Win Battle is to accelerate digital commerce. Global sales within the pure-play\ne-commerce channel in fiscal year '24 were up 12% compared to the prior year. The strategy associated\nwith this battle is not just about driving online sales. It's about accelerating all our other Must-Win Battles.\nDigital commerce intersects with all our Must-Win Battles much like the central overlap in Venn diagram.\nAs part of our digital commerce strategy in 2024, we continued our global online marketing campaign,\nthe repair challenge. We are now in the third year of this promotional effort, which motivates millions of\ndoers, makers, fixers and builders across more than 40 countries to extend the lifespan of their tools and\nequipment.\nIn FY '24, our Repair Challenge websites attracted over 2 million visitors with more than 10,000 projects\nsubmitted. These projects aim to prolong the life of tools, worn down equipment, bicycles, cars and just\nabout anything else, helping to keep them in circulation longer.\nTurning to the second element of our Four-By-Four Strategic Framework or Strategic Enablers. Our\nStrategic Enablers focus on operational excellence and they collectively underpin and drive the success of\nour Must-Win Battles. Strategic enabler number one, ensuring a people-first mindset. At WD-40 Company,\nour most powerful competitive advantage is a commitment of our 644 employees spread across 16\ncountries to our purpose, values and strategy.\nWe strive to be an employer of choice where all employees can bring their best selves to work. Our\npeople-first mindset is intended to create programs that inspire, motivate and reward employees for\nCopyright © 2024 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.\nspglobal.com/marketintelligence 6\nWD-40 COMPANY FQ4 2024 EARNINGS CALL OCT 17, 2024\ncontribution that are aligned with our Four-by-Four Strategic Framework, while maintaining a strong focus\non growth and profitability. I'm very proud of our 93% employee engagement rate in FY '24, a testament\nto our strong culture and the opportunities we provide for our people to learn, grow and succeed.\nThis year, we made significant strides and beginning to transform WD-40 Company into a world-class\nglobal learning organization. To gain insights into our progress, we conducted a voluntary learning survey,\nwhich received an impressive 82% response rate. The results show that 90% of our employees believe\nthat continuous learning is key to driving the company's success among other valuable findings.\nThis brings us to strategic enabler number two, build a sustainable business for the future. We define\nsustainability as the ability of a business to exist indefinitely. We are committed to operating our business\nin a manner that will have positive environmental and societal impacts, which will create value for all our\nstakeholders. Over the last 12 to 18 months, we've taken significant steps to embed sustainability into our\nbusiness strategy, steps we believe will provide us with a competitive advantage in the global marketplace.\nOur efforts have been considerable. Some of the highlights include adding 3 dedicated ESG positions,\ncompleting an environmental assessment of our Tier 1 suppliers implementing a carbon accounting\nsystem, refining our sustainability lens of future innovation and developing a science-based environmental\nimpact road map with a priority to reduce GHG emissions. We will be publishing our 2024 ESG Report next\nmonth. In this report, we detailed our ESG-related objectives, targets and progress made during the last\n2-year period, and we established objectives and targets for the future.\nStrategic enabler number three is achieving operational excellence in supply chain. Through this strategic\nenabler, we continue to pursue operational excellence. This year, we adopted a truly global approach\nto our supply chain strategy for the first time recognizing its pivotal role in driving economic value and\nadvancing sustainability. We've undertaken several key initiatives that support this approach. In-depth\nanalysis revealed significant opportunities for cost reduction and efficiency gains. By strengthening global\npartnerships with key suppliers, we've driven efficiency as it translates into cost savings.\nAdditionally, we completed an environmental audit of our top suppliers and published an updated supplier\ncode of conduct. In fiscal year 2025, we'll publish a new responsible sourcing policy to more clearly\ncommunicate how the supply chain can positively impact environmental and social responsibility. Notably,\nwe reduced our inventory by approximately $7 million and maintained an average on-time and full delivery\nrate of 95% for fiscal year 2024. Our employees achieved all of this while simultaneously rolling out the\nfirst phase of our new ERP implementation across a substantial portion of our business.\nAnd finally, strategic enabler number four is to drive productivity via enhanced systems. We've been laser-\nfocused on identifying and implementing systems that streamline operations, deliver actionable insights\nand drive value. By leveraging automation and AI, we aim to optimize our processes, reduce manual labor\nand ultimately enhance our bottom line. A key milestone this year was the successful rollout of our new\nERP system across 50% of our business.\nWhile we encountered some initial challenges, we've swiftly adapted and learn from the experience, which\nwe expect will result in smoother implementations going forward. While the milestones this past fiscal\nyear include standardization and processes like project and portfolio management along with streamlined\napproaches to solution-driven decision-making.\nLastly, we've established the foundation to move with more intent towards productivity improvement by\nestablishing global centers of excellence along key areas of IT to bring once disparate teams together to\nharness their collective skills and capacity to focus on our long-term growth objectives.\nWith that, I'll now turn the call over to Sara.\nSara Hyzer\nVP of Finance, Treasurer, CFO & Principal Accounting Officer\nThanks, Steve, for that overview of our sales results and strategic framework. I'm pleased to announce\nthat we delivered a strong performance in the fourth quarter, leading to a solid fiscal year 2024. Let's start\nwith a discussion about how we performed since our most recently issued fiscal year 2024 guidance.\nCopyright © 2024 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.\nspglobal.com/marketintelligence 7\nWD-40 COMPANY FQ4 2024 EARNINGS CALL OCT 17, 2024\nWe expected net sales growth to be between 6% and 12% and with net sales of between $570 million\nand $600 million on a non-GAAP constant currency basis. Today, we reported fiscal year revenue of $583\nmillion, up 8% compared to last fiscal year on a non-GAAP constant currency basis and in line with our\nexpectations. We expected gross margin to be between 51.5% to 53%. Today, we reported a gross margin\nof 53.4%, slightly above our guidance expectations.\nWe expected our global advertising and promotion investment to be between 5% and 6% of net sales.\nToday, we reported an A&P investment of 5.7%. We expected net income to be between $67.7 million and\n$71.8 million and a diluted EPS of between $5 and $5.30. Today, we reported net income of $69.6 million\nand diluted EPS of $5.11, in line with our expectations.\nTo better understand what is driving these results, let's begin with a review of our fourth quarter results\nagainst our 55/30/25 business model. I will then provide an update on our financial results, an update\non the divestiture of the home care and cleaning brands in the Americas and the U.K. and finish with\nproviding a view towards fiscal year 2025. Our asset-light and dynamic business model has helped the\ncompany maintain a healthy financial position and generate strong returns for our stockholders for many\nyears, and it continues to be our guiding light.\nOur 55/30/25 business model has been a long-term beacon for us that we aspire to over time. Recently,\nwe have been thinking about each critical component of the model in a range. As we've mentioned\npreviously, if we successfully divest the home care and cleaning brands in the Americas and the U.K., we\nexpect that progress on certain aspects of our business model will be temporarily impacted as we digest\nthe impacts. However, in the longer term, we anticipate significant benefits as we shift our focus and\ninvestments towards our higher-growth, higher-margin maintenance products. I'll share more details on\nour outlook when we provide guidance for fiscal year 2025.\nLet's look at our fourth quarter gross margin performance. We target a range of 50% to 55% for gross\nmargin, and we have made significant progress this fiscal year to perform well within this range. In\nthe fourth quarter, our gross margin was 54.1% compared to 51.4% last year. This represents an\nimprovement of 270 basis points and was most significantly impacted by the following factors: gross\nmargin benefited 100 basis points from lower cost of our cans, 70 basis points from favorable sales mix\nand other miscellaneous mix and 60 basis points from lower warehousing, distribution and freight costs.\nWe are pleased to see that the inflationary environment has stabilized for now, and our gross margin has\nsteadily improved throughout the fiscal year. This marks the third consecutive quarter of sequential gross\nmargin growth. We are also happy to share with you that this quarter gross margin improved across all\n3 trade blocks. Within the Americas, gross margin improved 350 basis points over prior period to 52.5%.\nEIMEA continues to expand gross margin, improving 190 basis points over the prior period to 55.5%. And\nAsia Pacific improved gross margin 70 basis points over the prior period to 56.4%.\nI am delighted to report that 2 of our trading blocks are already above our 55% gross margin target for\nthe fourth quarter. Despite some of the headwinds we anticipate to the business model from divesting of\nthe home care and cleaning brands in the Americas and the U.K., the divestiture will have an immediate\npositive impact on our gross margin. We forecast an annual boost to gross margin of approximately 60\nbasis points post divestiture. This strengthens our confidence in reaching our target of 55% gross margin.\nConsidering our current trajectory, the current cost environment and macroeconomic factors, we\ncontinue to target achieving a gross margin of 55% by the end of fiscal year 2026 at the latest. However,\ndepending on the cost landscape, we may achieve this goal even sooner, potentially by the end of fiscal\nyear 2025 following the divestiture. In fiscal year 2025, gross margin recovery is a central focus for senior\nleadership who will be incentivized to recover gross margin to 55% and beyond.\nNow turning to our cost of doing business, which we define as total operating expenses less adjustments\nfor certain noncash expenses and is primarily comprised of investments in our employees, investments\nin our brands, freight expense to get our products to our customers and investments in information\ntechnologies. As we continue to grow our top line, we remain committed to operating efficiently and\nmaintaining the company's financial health, while also investing in areas to drive both future growth and\nfuture operating efficiencies.\nCopyright © 2024 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.\nspglobal.com/marketintelligence 8\nWD-40 COMPANY FQ4 2024 EARNINGS CALL OCT 17, 2024\nWith increased operational leverage after we have time to digest the anticipated impacts of the divestiture,\nwe expect that our cost of doing business will align with our targeted range of 30% to 35% over time. This\nquarter, our cost of doing business was 38% compared to 34% in the prior year. For the full fiscal year, our\ncost of doing business was 36% compared to 33% in the prior year. Both increases were primarily driven\nby higher employee-related costs, including the impact of accruing higher earned incentive compensation.\nIn fiscal years '22 and '23, we had to navigate a dynamic macroeconomic landscape, marked by supply\nchain disruptions and higher than normal inflation levels. Our earned incentive program was developed to\nprotect our bottom line during difficult financial times and reward our employees during better financial\ntimes. Therefore, as the business has recovered, so has our incentive compensation program.\nFiscal year 2022, when the business was challenged with high inflation, our incentive program paid out\napproximately $3 million, and we were able to rebuild that to about $8 million by fiscal year 2023 and now\n$16.5 million for this fiscal year. This is an improvement of over $13 million over the course of 2 years.\nOur incentive plan applies to every employee at every level of the organization, and we couldn't be more\npleased to reward their outstanding individual and collective efforts this fiscal year.\nFor the full year, the increase in our accrued incentive compensation program was $8.8 million. And in the\nfourth quarter, the increase was $4.6 million. We exceeded our fourth quarter forecast and therefore, the\ntiming of our accrued incentive compensation was larger in the fourth quarter than the previous 3 quarters\nthis year.\nIn addition to higher employee-related costs, we have also been making strategic investments in the areas\nof information technologies, ESG and innovation and supply chain, which have led to some elevated SG&A\nexpenses and, therefore, higher cost of doing business.\nTurning now to adjusted EBITDA margin. All these investments have put some pressure on our adjusted\nEBITDA margin. For both the full fiscal year and fourth quarter, our adjusted EBITDA margin was 17% and\nremained relatively constant compared to the prior period. However, on a dollar basis, we grew EBITDA\nfor the full fiscal year by 8% over the prior year, even after absorbing these increased costs. As we've\nmentioned previously, if we successfully divest the home care and cleaning brands we are actively selling,\nwe know that we will need some time to digest the impact. However, we continue to believe we can move\nadjusted EBITDA margin back to our target range of 20% to 22% over the medium term.\nNow let's discuss net income and EPS for the fourth quarter. Net income of $16.8 million this quarter\nimproved slightly by about 1% compared to the prior period. For the full year, which adjusts for the\nlumpiness of our incentive compensation program accrual this year, our net income grew by $3.6 million\nor about 6% over the prior year. On a constant currency basis, net income for the full year would have\nincreased 3% compared to the prior year.\nDiluted earnings per common share for the fourth quarter were $1.23 compared to $1.21 in the prior\nperiod. For the full year, diluted EPS grew $0.28 per share or 6% over the prior year. Diluted EPS reflects\n13.6 million weighted average shares outstanding this quarter, which was essentially flat compared to the\nprior year.\nNext, we'll discuss a word about our balance sheet and capital allocation strategy. The company maintains\na solid financial position and strong liquidity. Our capital allocation strategy takes a balanced approach,\nprioritizing long-term organic growth investments while delivering robust returns to our stockholders. We\ncontinue to return capital to our stockholders through regular dividends and buybacks. Annual dividends\nwill continue to be our priority and are targeted at greater than 50% of earnings. On October 4, our Board\nof Directors approved a quarterly cash dividend of $0.88 per share.\nWe have continued to manage our inventory levels, which were impacted due to the investments we made\nto stabilize our U.S. supply chain in prior years. Our inventory levels peaked in the first quarter of fiscal\nyear 2023. And since then, we have reduced inventory by nearly $40 million or 34%. At this point in\ntime, our inventory levels are stable with what we believe is the right balance from a risk management\nperspective. We continue to hold certain levels of componentry and cans, which have benefited us recently\nand will continue to do so into the foreseeable future. Furthermore, divesting from our household brands\nCopyright © 2024 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.\nspglobal.com/marketintelligence 9\nWD-40 COMPANY FQ4 2024 EARNINGS CALL OCT 17, 2024\nwould positively impact our working capital and inventory levels as these brands typically require us to\nmaintain higher inventory levels.\nOur cash flow from operations for fiscal year 2024 was approximately $92 million, and we elected to\nuse approximately $25 million of that cash to pay down a portion of our short-term higher interest rate\nborrowings. Our intent is to continue to pay down our higher interest rate borrowings under the current\ninterest rate environment. This activity will likely be wrapping up in the first half of 2025. In fiscal year\n2024, our return on invested capital was 25.5%, improving from 23.7% last fiscal year and in line with our\ntarget of 25%.\nNow a brief update on changes we're making that will affect foreign currency impacts in fiscal year 2025.\nThe functional currency for our U.K. subsidiary, which consolidates the results for the EIMEA trade block\nhas long been the pound sterling. We reassess this on an annual basis. As we look out to fiscal year 2025\nand beyond, the shift in the operating landscape within the EIMEA region, along with certain strategic\nactions we are taking, require a change in our functional currency.\nA few key factors influenced our decision, including a growing dependence on euro-denominated inventory\nwithin our supply chain and an increase in sales and operational expenses tied to the euro. As a result,\nbeginning September 1, 2024, we will change the functional currency of our U.K. subsidiary from pound\nsterling to euro with the change being applied prospectively.\nNow a quick update on HCCP. We continue to make progress on the sale of our Americas and U.K. home\ncare and cleaning product brands. Sales of home care and cleaning products in the Americas and U.K.\nthis fiscal year 2024 were approximately $24 million, representing 4% of our global business. As I shared\nwith you last quarter, we have engaged an investment bank, and they are currently in discussions with\npotential suitors on our behalf. While there are no certainties on identifying a buyer when going to the\nmarket, our expectation is that we will likely complete the divestiture of these brands during the first half\nof fiscal year 2025. We will provide further updates on the divestiture process as appropriate.\nGiven the expectation that these brands will soon be divested, we are providing this year's guidance on\na pro forma basis, excluding the financial impact of the home care and cleaning brands in the Americas\nand the U.K. We're also offering a pro forma view of what fiscal year 2024 would have looked like without\nthese brands to assist with modeling and comparing the business period-over-period. Fiscal year 2024 pro\nforma net sales would have been approximately $567 million. Fiscal year 2024 pro forma gross margin\nwould have been approximately 53.9%. Fiscal year 2024 pro forma operating income would have been\napproximately $89.3 million. And fiscal year 2024 pro forma EPS would have been approximately $4.76.\nNow with that backdrop, let's take a closer look at our guidance for fiscal year 2025. We are excited\nfor what is ahead for us in fiscal year 2025. We are committed to delivering long-term value to all our\nstakeholders, which requires balancing short-term results with strategic investments to drive long-term\ngrowth and enhance business efficiency. As I have mentioned before, this year's guidance excludes the\nfinancial impact of the home care and cleaning brands currently classified as assets held for sale as of\nSeptember 1, 2024.\nWhile the exact timing of the transaction's closing remains uncertain, we believe this approach will provide\ninvestors with clarity on the direction of the core business and help minimize the noise surrounding the\ntransaction. This year, we've also made a change by removing net income from our guidance and replacing\nit with operating income. We believe this provides a better measure for offering more insight into the\nbusiness' operating performance.\nFor fiscal year 2025, we are estimating net sales growth from the pro forma 2024 results is projected to\nbe between 6% and 11%, with net sales between $600 million and $630 million in constant currency.\nGross margin is expected to be between 54% to 55%. Advertising and promotion investment is projected\nto be around 6% of net sales. Operating income is expected to be between $95 million and $100 million,\nrepresenting growth of between 6% to 12% over the pro forma 2024 results. The provision for income tax\nis expected to be around 24%. And diluted earnings per share is expected to be between $5.20 and $5.45,\nwhich is based on an estimated 13.5 million weighted average shares outstanding. This range represents\ngrowth of between 9% and 14% over the pro forma 2024 results.\nCopyright © 2024 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.\nspglobal.com/marketintelligence 10\nWD-40 COMPANY FQ4 2024 EARNINGS CALL OCT 17, 2024\nThis guidance assumes no major changes to the current economic environment, unanticipated inflationary\nheadwinds and other unforeseen events may affect our view of fiscal year 2025. In the event, we are\nunsuccessful in the divestiture of our home care and cleaning brands in the Americas and the United\nKingdom, our guidance would be positively impacted by approximately $23 million in net sales, $6 million\nin operating income and $0.33 in diluted EPS on a full year basis.\nThat completes the financial overview. Now I would like to turn the call back to Steve.\nSteven A. Brass\nCEO, President & Director\nThank you, Sara, for that update. Our focus for fiscal year 2025 and beyond is clear. Stay true to our Four-\nby-Four Strategic Framework, continue to unlock value in high potential markets and take care of our\npeople who drive our success. The key theme throughout this journey for the WD-40 Company will be a\nfew things, many places, bigger impact. This approach will help us leverage global synergies and become\nmore efficient as we expand.\nIn summary, what did you hear from us on this call? You heard that for the fourth quarter, we reported\nconsolidated net sales of $156 million, an increase of over 11% over the prior year and the second\nconsecutive record quarter for the company. You heard that all 3 of our trade blocks reported revenue\ngrowth that aligns with or exceeds our long-term growth targets for each region, both in the fourth\nquarter and the full fiscal year.\nYou heard that our newest direct market in Brazil continues to do well and that we believe the acquisition\nof the Brazil market was a game-changing opportunity for us. You heard that we estimate the benchmark\nsales opportunity for WD-40 Multi-Use Product to be approximately $1.6 billion and that we have\nachieved only 28% of that benchmarked opportunity. You heard that we estimate the benchmark sales\nopportunity for WD-40 Specialist to be approximately $605 million and that we've achieved only 12% of\nthat benchmark opportunity.\nYou heard that we're making good progress on the sale of our Americas and U.K. home care and cleaning\nproduct brands. You heard the gross margin continue to improve and is moving closer to our long-term\ntarget of 55%. And you heard that we're issuing guidance for fiscal year 2025 on a pro forma basis,\nexcluding the brands we expect to divest this year.\nThank you for joining our call today. We'd now be pleased to answer your questions.\nCopyright © 2024 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc.

I was just\nwondering what that was, if that's just promotional activity or if it's something else?\nSara Hyzer\nVP of Finance, Treasurer, CFO & Principal Accounting Officer\nDaniel, it's Sara. So yes, there was a little bit of swing in the back half of the year. Most of that is going to\nbe mix. It's hard right now for us to break out mix from that metric. And so there's no -- there's nothing\nsignificant on pricing that went backwards. It's going to all be mix related.\nDaniel Rizzo\nJefferies LLC, Research Division\nOkay. And then with -- I mean, with the ongoing rollout of the ERP with everything that's going on\nwith the divestiture, I would imagine that SG&A expenses are going to remain relatively elevated for at\nleast the next couple of quarters. And I'm just trying to -- modeling it out, is that something we should\nprobably expect?\nSara Hyzer\nVP of Finance, Treasurer, CFO & Principal Accounting Officer\nYes. I think we are obviously continuing to invest in the ERP, and we also are inheriting Brazil expenses in\naddition to that. So if you're looking at the upcoming year, we're not growing at the pace that we grew out\nlast year, especially because we've rebuilt that GRP that I mentioned on the call. So it won't be as large of\nan increase as last year, but it will continue to be more elevated than it has been in the past.\nDaniel Rizzo\nJefferies LLC, Research Division\nOkay. And then one final question. Then you've had good success with moving to a direct business model\nin Brazil, Mexico and elsewhere. I was wondering where the other opportunities to do that are. And if we\nexpect more announcements like that within, I don't know, the next year or so, how should we think about\nit?\nSteven A. Brass\nCEO, President & Director\nDaniel, it's Steve. Thanks for the question. So yes, we're really delighted with the progress. Mexico\ncontinued to grow, grew by another 25% in last fiscal year. Brazil actually beat our expectations in terms\nof delivering overall $8 million or $7 million of growth almost over prior year. And we expect for this next\nfiscal year for that to continue to grow and deliver a further $7 million to $9 million on top of that base of\n$8 million for the first year.\nSo yes, these are game-changing opportunities. And so as we look around the world, we are absolutely\nlaser focused on those top 20 growth opportunities that we have. And I look back at the last year, China\nlocal currency, 17% growth; India, 21% growth; Indonesia, 17% growth; Turkey, 66% growth on top of\nphenomenal growth across -- just about everywhere in Europe and Latin America. So phenomenal focus,\nI think, is delivering these really exceptional results. And yes, you're going to see more of that. We have\nno announcements that are imminent in terms of planned kind of direct markets. A lot of our growth\nCopyright © 2024 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc.

Davidson.\nLinda Ann Bolton-Weiser\nD.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division\nCongratulations on a really strong quarter and year. So just to make sure I understand this. Your guidance\nfor the next fiscal -- the dollar figure amounts like operating profit of $95 million to $100 million. Does\nthat assume that the Household Cleaning business is not in for any of the year. Is that correct?\nSara Hyzer\nVP of Finance, Treasurer, CFO & Principal Accounting Officer\nYou have that, yes, Linda, that's correct. We've excluded it for the full year just given the uncertainty of\nthe timing and then provided you with some information of what the difference would be if it was included\nfor the full year. So you have a kind of both with and without.\nLinda Ann Bolton-Weiser\nD.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division\nYes. But in reality, it's not going to be sold like it could be towards the end of the first half. So in reality,\nthe numbers will probably be a little towards the higher end of these ranges that you've given. Am I\nunderstanding that correctly?\nSara Hyzer\nVP of Finance, Treasurer, CFO & Principal Accounting Officer\nSo on a GAAP basis, yes, we will also be presenting the business on a non-GAAP basis starting in Q1 so\nthat you can have apples -- or how we're measuring ourselves for the full year against that guidance that\nwe've provided.\nLinda Ann Bolton-Weiser\nD.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division\nOkay. Okay. Great. And then I guess then with that -- I mean, your gross margin in 2024 was 53.4%. So\nI guess I'm wondering about the guidance of 54% to 55%. If you're getting a list of 60 basis points from\nthe divestiture, why wouldn't that guidance be like higher? I guess I'm trying to understand that.\nSara Hyzer\nVP of Finance, Treasurer, CFO & Principal Accounting Officer\nWell, most of the move that we've had in the last couple of years has come from price with\npremiumization and supply chain initiative being lesser of an impact. We are starting to now see the\nefforts of some of those supply chain initiatives that we've implemented both this year and then also plan\nto implement next year. those just have a smaller immediate impact to the margin. So we do intend to\nmake improvement to the margin. It's just going to be at a lesser scale than it was for this year.\nLinda Ann Bolton-Weiser\nD.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division\nOkay. And then -- so usually, you have a -- like an oil price assumption that's baked in. Can you give what\nyou're including in the guidance for oil price assumption?\nSara Hyzer\nVP of Finance, Treasurer, CFO & Principal Accounting Officer\nSure. The range right now we have is between $70 and $90.\nCopyright © 2024 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.\nspglobal.com/marketintelligence 13\nWD-40 COMPANY FQ4 2024 EARNINGS CALL OCT 17, 2024\nLinda Ann Bolton-Weiser\nD.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division\nOkay. And then I guess I was wondering about just the cadence of your pro forma sales growth in the\nnext fiscal. I mean first quarter, in particular, has a pretty hard comparison in the first quarter '24. Is there\nanything we should be cognizant of in terms of growth rates and how that will kind of go through the year\non a pro forma basis for sales growth?\nSara Hyzer\nVP of Finance, Treasurer, CFO & Principal Accounting Officer\nYes. It's a good question, Linda. We obviously, as you know, don't guide to the quarter, but I will comment\nthat similar to last year, if you looked at the growth of the business, it was weighted towards the back half\nof the year. And as we're forecasting out this year, I would say it's going to be a similar balance between\nthat Q1 to -- Q1, Q2 compared to Q3 to Q4, kind of that first half to second half balancing. You can look\nat last year as a guide and maybe it might just be a little bit spread, a little bit wider than that, but not by\nmuch.\nSteven A. Brass\nCEO, President & Director\nIf I could just add to that, Linda, as well. There's a little bit of phasing in Asia Pacific. The first quarter\nwas so strong last year that, that's going to be a challenge to exceed that in Asia Pacific. So Asia Pacific\nin terms of growth, we'll probably have a slower start and build up in the year. And then Brazil, obviously,\nthe impact of Brazil will mainly be felt in the first 6 months of the year. So that $7 million to $9 million of\ngrowth, a substantial part of that will be in the first half of the year.\nLinda Ann Bolton-Weiser\nD.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division\nYou mean in terms of the incremental growth versus prior year?\nSteven A. Brass\nCEO, President & Director\nExactly. Correct. Yes, correct.\nLinda Ann Bolton-Weiser\nD.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division\nOkay. And just let me ask a little bit about China. I mean I can't quite remember what you said it was in\nthe quarter. It seemed like it was pretty strong. And I think you said 17% for the year. So are you -- the\neconomy there is just so weak, and that's all we hear about every day, but it doesn't seem to be affecting\nyour business. Is it just that you have so much growth opportunity that you're immune from the macro?\nOr maybe could you give a little more color?\nSteven A. Brass\nCEO, President & Director\nYes. We just continue to do our thing right. And so we talk often about our China sampling program, which\nis very successful multiyear program where we're putting out, I believe, last year, we sampled 33,000\nfactories and converted a substantial amount of those to WD-40 users. And so that happens year in, year\nout. And so we're always bringing new users into the brand. Combined with that, we were very successful\nlast year also in expanding our distribution and making our product more available to buy with several\nhundred new points of distribution opened across the country.\nAnd so it's a very simple formula that just works, and the Chinese team are doing a great job of turning\nup the heat even further. So it's 17% local currency growth last year, 13.5% in U.S. dollars, with\nspectacular growth also on WD-40 Specialist of around 45% in U.S. dollars.\nOperator\nCopyright © 2024 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc.
