Reports Third Quarter 2024 Results\n\nNovember 6, 2024 at 4:05 PM EST\n\n[PDF Version](/node/12931/pdf)\n\nPHOENIX, Nov. 6, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- ** _Grand Canyon Education, Inc._** (NASDAQ: LOPE), (\"GCE\" or the \"Company\"), is a publicly traded education services company that currently provides services to 22 university partners. GCE provides a full array of support services in the post-secondary education sector and has developed significant technological solutions, infrastructure and operational processes to provide superior services in these areas on a large scale. GCE today announced financial results for the quarter ended September 30, 2024. \n\n[ ![www.gce.com \\(PRNewsfoto/Grand Canyon Education, Inc.\\)](https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/799628/GCE_Logo.jpg) ](https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/799628/GCE_Logo.html)\n\n**Grand Canyon Education, Inc. Reports Third Quarter 2024 Results**\n\nFor the three months ended September 30, 2024:\n\n  * Service revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was $238.3 million, an increase of $16.4 million, or 7.4%, as compared to service revenue of $221.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase year over year in service revenue was primarily due to an increase in enrollments at Grand Canyon University, our largest university partner (\"GCU\") to 123,002 at September 30, 2024, an increase of 4.0% over enrollments at September 30, 2023, an increase in university partner enrollments at our off-campus classroom and laboratory sites to 5,888 at September 30, 2024, an increase of 8.1% over enrollments at September 30, 2023, which includes 913 and 510 GCU students at September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and an increase in revenue per student year over year. The increase in revenue per student between years is primarily due to service revenue per student for Accelerated Bachelor of Science in Nursing (\"ABSN\") students at off-campus classroom and laboratory sites generating a significantly higher revenue per student than we earn under our agreement with GCU, as these agreements generally provide us with a higher revenue share percentage, the partners have higher tuition rates than GCU and the majority of their students take more credits on average per semester. The increase in revenue per student in the three months ended September 30, 2024 was also due to the timing of the Fall semester for the ground traditional campus. The Fall semester started two days earlier in 2024 than in 2023, which had the effect of shifting $2.2 million in service revenue from the fourth quarter of 2024 to the third quarter of 2024 in comparison to the prior year. Contract modifications for some of our university partners in which the revenue share percentage was reduced in exchange for us no longer reimbursing the partner for certain faculty costs and the termination of one university partner contract at the end of the Spring 2024 semester had the effect of reducing revenue per student. \n  * Partner enrollments totaled 127,977 at September 30, 2024 as compared to 123,165 at September 30, 2023. University partner enrollments at our off-campus classroom and laboratory sites were 5,888, an increase of 8.1% over enrollments at September 30, 2023, which includes 913 and 510 GCU students at September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. We opened five sites in the year ended December 31, 2023, seven sites in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and closed one site, increasing the total number of these sites to 46 at September 30, 2024, which has also positively impacted the enrollment growth. Enrollments for GCU ground students were 24,657 at September 30, 2024, down from 25,232 at September 30, 2023, due to a small decline in traditional ground students year over year and the continued decline in professional studies students (working adults attending the university's traditional campus at night), partially offset by an increase in ABSN students between years. GCU online enrollments were 98,345 at September 30, 2024, up from 92,995 at September 30, 2023, an increase of 5.8% between years. \n  * Operating income for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was $48.2 million, an increase of $6.7 million as compared to $41.5 million for the same period in 2023. The operating margin for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was 20.2% and 18.7%, respectively. The third quarter operating margin was positively impacted on a year over year basis by the timing difference between years in the start of the Fall semester for GCU's ground traditional campus. \n  * Income tax expense for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was $10.9 million, an increase of $2.4 million, or 27.2%, as compared to income tax expense of $8.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Our effective tax rate was 20.8% during the third quarter of 2024 compared to 19.3% during the third quarter of 2023. The effective tax rate increased year over year due to higher state income taxes. \n  * Net income increased 16.0% to $41.5 million for the third quarter of 2024, compared to $35.7 million for the same period in 2023. As adjusted net income was $43.2 million and $37.8 million for the third quarters of 2024 and 2023, respectively. \n  * Diluted net income per share was $1.42 and $1.19 for the third quarters of 2024 and 2023, respectively. As adjusted diluted net income per share was $1.48 and $1.26 for the third quarters of 2024 and 2023, respectively. \n  * Adjusted EBITDA increased 16.4% to $66.3 million for the third quarter of 2024, compared to $57.0 million for the same period in 2023.\n\n\n\nFor the nine months ended September 30, 2024:\n\n  * Service revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was $740.4 million, an increase of $57.8 million, or 8.5%, as compared to service revenue of $682.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase year over year in service revenue was primarily due to an increase in GCU enrollments to 123,002 at September 30, 2024, an increase of 4.0% over enrollments at September 30, 2023, an increase in university partner enrollments at our off-campus classroom and laboratory sites to 5,888 at September 30, 2024, an increase of 8.1% over enrollments at September 30, 2023, which includes 913 and 510 GCU students at September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and an increase in revenue per student year over year. The increase in revenue per student between years is primarily due to the service revenue per student for ABSN students at off-campus classroom and laboratory sites generating a significantly higher revenue per student than we earn under our agreement with GCU, as these agreements generally provide us with a higher revenue share percentage, the partners have higher tuition rates than GCU and the majority of their students take more credits on average per semester. The increase in revenue per student in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was also due to the timing of the Fall semester for the ground traditional campus. The Fall semester started two days earlier in 2024 than in 2023, which had the effect of shifting $2.2 million in service revenue from the fourth quarter of 2024 to the third quarter of 2024 in comparison to the prior year. The additional day for leap year in 2024 added additional service revenue of $1.5 million as compared to the prior year. Contract modifications for some of our university partners in which the revenue share percentage was reduced in exchange for us no longer reimbursing the partner for certain faculty costs and the termination of one university partner contract at the end of the Spring 2024 semester had the effect of reducing revenue per student. \n  * Operating income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was $175.4 million, an increase of $23.9 million as compared to $151.5 million for the same period in 2023. The operating margin for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was 23.7% and 22.2%, respectively. The nine months ended September 30, 2024 operating margin was positively impacted on a year over year basis by the timing of the Fall semester start by two days, an extra day in 2024 for leap year and was negatively impacted by $1.1 million recorded in the second quarter related to an executive that resigned effective June 30, 2024. \n  * Income tax expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was $43.0 million, an increase of $8.4 million, or 24.2%, as compared to income tax expense of $34.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Our effective tax rate was 23.0% during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 21.8% during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Although the effective tax rate was favorably impacted in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 by excess tax benefits of $1.5 million as compared to $0.9 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2023, the effective tax rate increased year over year due to higher state income taxes. \n  * Net income increased 16.2% to $144.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to $124.3 million for the same period in 2023. As adjusted net income was $150.1 million and $129.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. \n  * Diluted net income per share was $4.91 and $4.10 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. As adjusted diluted net income per share was $5.11 and $4.28 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. \n  * Adjusted EBITDA increased 16.8% to $223.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to $191.4 million for the same period in 2023.\n\n\n\n**Liquidity and Capital Resources**\n\nOur liquidity position, as measured by cash and cash equivalents and investments increased by $19.1 million between December 31, 2023 and September 30, 2024, which was largely attributable to cash flows from operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 exceeding share repurchases, changes in our investment balances and capital expenditures during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Our unrestricted cash and cash equivalents and investments were $263.6 million and $244.5 million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively.\n\n**Grand Canyon Education, Inc. Reports Third Quarter 2024 Results and Full Year Outlook 2024**\n\n**2024 Outlook**\n\n**Q4 2024:**\n\n  * Service revenue of between $289.0 million and $290.0 million;\n  * Operating margin of between 35.2% and 35.4%;\n  * Effective tax rate of 21.2%;\n  * Diluted EPS of between $2.86 and $2.89; and\n  * 28.9 million diluted shares.\n\n\n\nThe diluted EPS guidance includes non-cash amortization of intangible assets net of taxes of $1.7 million, which equates to a $0.06 impact on diluted EPS.

(ii) share-based compensation, and (iii) unusual charges or gains, such as litigation and regulatory reserves, impairment charges and asset write-offs, severance costs, and exit or lease termination costs. We present Adjusted EBITDA because we consider it to be an important supplemental measure of our operating performance. We also make certain compensation decisions based, in part, on our operating performance, as measured by Adjusted EBITDA. All of the adjustments made in our calculation of Adjusted EBITDA are adjustments to items that management does not consider to be reflective of our core operating performance. Management considers our core operating performance to be that which can be affected by our managers in any particular period through their management of the resources that affect our underlying revenue and profit generating operations during that period and does not consider the items for which we make adjustments (as listed above) to be reflective of our core performance.\n\nWe believe Adjusted EBITDA allows us to compare our current operating results with corresponding historical periods and with the operational performance of other companies in our industry because it does not give effect to potential differences caused by variations in capital structures (affecting relative interest expense, including the impact of write-offs of deferred financing costs when companies refinance their indebtedness), tax positions (such as the impact on periods or companies of changes in effective tax rates or net operating losses), the book amortization of intangibles (affecting relative amortization expense), and other items that we do not consider reflective of underlying operating performance. We also present Adjusted EBITDA because we believe it is frequently used by securities analysts, investors, and other interested parties as a measure of performance.\n\nIn evaluating Adjusted EBITDA, investors should be aware that in the future we may incur expenses similar to the adjustments described above. Our presentation of Adjusted EBITDA should not be construed as an inference that our future results will be unaffected by expenses that are unusual, non-routine, or non-recurring. Adjusted EBITDA has limitations as an analytical tool in that, among other things it does not reflect:\n\n  * cash expenditures for capital expenditures or contractual commitments; \n  * changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital requirements; \n  * interest expense, or the cash required to replace assets that are being depreciated or amortized; and \n  * the impact on our reported results of earnings or charges resulting from the items for which we make adjustments to our EBITDA, as described above and set forth in the table below.\n\n\n\nIn addition, other companies, including other companies in our industry, may calculate these measures differently than we do, limiting the usefulness of Adjusted EBITDA as a comparative measure. Because of these limitations, Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered as a substitute for net income, operating income, or any other performance measure derived in accordance with and reported under GAAP, or as an alternative to cash flow from operating activities or as a measure of our liquidity. We compensate for these limitations by relying primarily on our GAAP results and only use Adjusted EBITDA as a supplemental performance measure.\n\nThe following table provides a reconciliation of net income to Adjusted EBITDA, which is a non-GAAP measure for the periods indicated:\n\n**Three Months Ended**| **Nine Months Ended**  \n---|---  \n**September 30 , **| **September 30 , **  \n**2024**| **2023**| **2024**| **2023**  \n**(Unaudited, in thousands)**| **(Unaudited, in thousands)**  \nNet income| $| 41,467| $| 35,739| $| 144,355| $| 124,276  \nPlus: interest expense| —| 1| 4| 27  \nLess: investment interest and other| (4,154)| (2,739)| (11,995)| (7,482)  \nPlus: income tax expense| 10,862| 8,537| 43,008| 34,636  \nPlus: amortization of intangible assets| 2,105| 2,105| 6,315| 6,315  \nPlus: depreciation and amortization| 7,126| 6,055| 20,707| 16,994  \nEBITDA| 57,406| 49,698| 202,394| 174,766  \nPlus: contributions in lieu of state income taxes| 4,500| 3,500| 4,500| 3,500  \nPlus: loss on fixed asset disposal| 27| 440| 71| 575  \nPlus: litigation and regulatory reserves| 1,017| 24| 4,488| 2,571  \nPlus: severance costs| —| —| 1,133| —  \nPlus: share-based compensation| 3,375| 3,336| 10,855| 9,958  \nAdjusted EBITDA| $| 66,325| $| 56,998| $| 223,441| $| 191,370  \n  \n**Non-GAAP Net Income and Non-GAAP Diluted Income Per Share**\n\nThe Company believes the presentation of non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP diluted income per share information that excludes amortization of intangible assets, loss on disposal of fixed assets and severance costs allows investors to develop a more meaningful understanding of the Company's performance over time. Accordingly, for the nine-months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the table below provides reconciliations of these non-GAAP items to GAAP net income and GAAP diluted income per share, respectively:\n\n**Three Months Ended**| **Nine Months Ended**  \n---|---  \n**September 30 , **| **September 30 , **  \n**2024**| **2023**| **2024**| **2023**  \n**(Unaudited, in thousands except per share data)**  \nGAAP Net income| $| 41,467| $| 35,739| $| 144,355| $| 124,276  \nAmortization of intangible assets| 2,105| 2,105| 6,315| 6,315  \nLoss on disposal of fixed assets| 27| 440| 71| 575  \nSeverance costs| —| —| 1,133| —  \nIncome tax effects of adjustments(1)| (443)| (491)| (1,726)| (1,502)  \nAs Adjusted, Non-GAAP Net income| $| 43,156| $| 37,793| $| 150,148| $| 129,664  \nGAAP Diluted income per share| $| 1.42| $| 1.19| $| 4.91| $| 4.10  \nAmortization of intangible assets (2)| 0.06| 0.06| 0.17| 0.16  \nLoss on disposal of fixed assets (3)| 0.00| 0.01| 0.00| 0.02  \nSeverance costs (4)| —| —| 0.03| —  \nAs Adjusted, Non-GAAP Diluted income per share| $| 1.48| $| 1.26| $| 5.11| $| 4.28  \n  \n(1)| The income tax effects of adjustments are based on the effective income tax rate applicable to adjusted (non-GAAP) results.   \n---|---  \n(2)| The amortization of acquired intangible assets per diluted share is net of an income tax benefit of $0.01 for both of the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, and net of an income tax benefit of $0.05 for both of the ninemonths ended September 30, 2024 and 2023.  \n(3)| The loss on disposal of fixed assets per diluted share is net of an income tax benefit of nil for both of the three monthsended September 30, 2024 and 2023, and net of an income tax benefit of nil for both of the nine months endedSeptember 30, 2024 and 2023.  \n(4)| The severance costs per diluted share is net of an income tax benefit of $0.01 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024.  \n  \n**Investor Relations Contact:** Daniel E.

GCE provides a full array of support services in the post-secondary education sector and has developed significant technological solutions, infrastructure and operational processes to provide superior services in these areas on a large scale. GCE today announced financial results for the quarter ended June 30, 2024. \n\n[ ![www.gce.com \\(PRNewsfoto/Grand Canyon Education, Inc.\\)](https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/799628/GCE_Logo.jpg) ](https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/799628/GCE_Logo.html)\n\n**Grand Canyon Education, Inc. Reports Second Quarter 2024 Results**\n\nFor the three months ended June 30, 2024:\n\n  * Service revenue for the three months ended June 30, 2024 was $227.5 million, an increase of $16.9 million, or 8.0%, as compared to service revenue of $210.6 million for the three months ended June 30, 2023. The increase year over year in service revenue was primarily due to an increase in GCU enrollments to 102,676 at June 30, 2024, an increase of 7.0% over enrollments at June 30, 2023, an increase in university partner enrollments at our off-campus classroom and laboratory sites to 4,377 at June 30, 2024, an increase of 12.1% over enrollments at June 30, 2023, which includes 746 and 350 GCU students at June 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and an increase in revenue per student year over year. The increase in revenue per student between years is primarily due to the service revenue impact of the increased room, board and other ancillary revenues at GCU in the second quarter of 2024 as compared to the prior year period. In addition, service revenue per student for Accelerated Bachelor of Science in Nursing (\"ABSN\") students at off-campus classroom and laboratory sites generates a significantly higher revenue per student than we earn under our agreement with GCU, as these agreements generally provide us with a higher revenue share percentage, the partners have higher tuition rates than GCU and the majority of their students take more credits on average per semester. The increase in revenue per student in the three months ended June 30, 2024 was lessened somewhat by the timing of the Spring semester for the ground traditional campus. The Spring semester started one day earlier in 2024 than in 2023, which had the effect of shifting $2.1 million in service revenue from the second quarter of 2024 to the first quarter of 2024 in comparison to the prior year. In addition, contract modifications for some of our university partners in which the revenue share percentage was reduced in exchange for us no longer reimbursing the partner for certain faculty costs and the termination of one university partner contract at the end of the Spring 2024 semester had the effect of reducing revenue per student. \n  * Partner enrollments totaled 106,307 at June 30, 2024 as compared to 99,526 at June 30, 2023. University partner enrollments at our off-campus classroom and laboratory sites were 4,377, an increase of 12.1% over enrollments at June 30, 2023, which includes 746 and 350 GCU students at June 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. We opened five new off-campus classroom and laboratory sites in the year ended December 31, 2023 and four sites in the three months ended June 30, 2024, increasing the total number of these sites to 43 at June 30, 2024. Enrollments for GCU ground students were 7,397 at June 30, 2024 up from 7,327 at June 30, 2023. GCU online enrollments were 95,279 at June 30, 2024, up from 88,645 at June 30, 2023, an increase of 7.5% between years. GCU enrollment declines between March 31 and June 30 of each year as ground enrollment at GCU at June 30 of each year only includes traditional-aged students taking summer school classes, which is a small percentage of GCU's traditional-aged student body. The Spring semester for GCU's traditional-aged student body ends near the end of April each year. \n  * Operating income for the three months ended June 30, 2024 was $42.7 million, an increase of $7.3 million as compared to $35.4 million for the same period in 2023. The operating margin for the three months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023 was 18.8% and 16.8%, respectively. The second quarter operating margin was negatively impacted on a year over year basis by the timing difference between years in the start of the Spring semester for GCU's ground traditional campus and $1.1 million in severance costs recorded in the quarter related to an executive that resigned effective June 30, 2024. \n  * Income tax expense for the three months ended June 30, 2024 was $12.0 million, an increase of $2.9 million, or 32.0%, as compared to income tax expense of $9.1 million for the three months ended June 30, 2023. Our effective tax rate was 25.5% during the second quarter of 2024 compared to 23.8% during the second quarter of 2023. The effective tax rate increased year over year due to higher state income taxes. \n  * Net income increased 20.4% to $34.9 million for the second quarter of 2024, compared to $29.0 million for the same period in 2023. As adjusted net income was $37.3 million and $30.6 million for the second quarters of 2024 and 2023, respectively. \n  * Diluted net income per share was $1.19 and $0.96 for the second quarters of 2024 and 2023, respectively. As adjusted diluted net income per share was $1.27 and $1.01 for the second quarters of 2024 and 2023, respectively. \n  * Adjusted EBITDA increased 22.6% to $58.5 million for the second quarter of 2024, compared to $47.7 million for the same period in 2023.\n\n\n\nFor the six months ended June 30, 2024:\n\n  * Service revenue for the six months ended June 30, 2024 was $502.1 million, an increase of $41.4 million, or 9.0%, as compared to service revenue of $460.7 million for the six months ended June 30, 2023. The increase year over year in service revenue was primarily due to an increase in GCU enrollments to 102,676 at June 30, 2024, an increase of 7.0% over enrollments at June 30, 2023, an increase in university partner enrollments at our off-campus classroom and laboratory sites to 4,377 at June 30, 2024, an increase of 12.1% over enrollments at June 30, 2023, which includes 746 and 350 GCU students at June 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and an increase in revenue per student year over year. The increase in revenue per student between years is primarily due to the service revenue impact of the increased room, board and other ancillary revenues at GCU in the six months ended June 30, 2024 as compared to the prior year period. In addition, service revenue per student for ABSN students at off-campus classroom and laboratory sites generates a significantly higher revenue per student than we earn under our agreement with GCU, as these agreements generally provide us with a higher revenue share percentage, the partners have higher tuition rates than GCU and the majority of their students take more credits on average per semester. The additional day for leap year in 2024 added additional service revenue of $1.5 million as compared to the prior year. Contract modifications for some of our university partners in which the revenue share percentage was reduced in exchange for us no longer reimbursing the partner for certain faculty costs and the termination of one university partner contract at the end of the Spring 2024 semester had the effect of reducing revenue per student. \n  * Operating income for the six months ended June 30, 2024 was $127.2 million, an increase of $17.3 million as compared to $109.9 million for the same period in 2023. The operating margin for the six months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023 was 25.3% and 23.9%, respectively. The six months ended June 30, 2024 operating margin was positively impacted on a year over year basis by an extra day in 2024 for leap year and was negatively impacted by $1.1 million recorded in the second quarter related to an executive that resigned effective June 30, 2024. \n  * Income tax expense for the six months ended June 30, 2024 was $32.1 million, an increase of $6.0 million, or 23.2%, as compared to income tax expense of $26.1 million for the six months ended June 30, 2023. Our effective tax rate was 23.8% during the six months ended June 30, 2024 compared to 22.8% during the six months ended June 30, 2023. Although the effective tax rate was favorably impacted in the six months ended June 30, 2024 by excess tax benefits of $1.5 million as compared to $0.9 million in the six months ended June 30, 2023, the effective tax rate increased year over year due to higher state income taxes. \n  * Net income increased 16.2% to $102.9 million for the six months ended June 30, 2024, compared to $88.5 million for the same period in 2023. As adjusted net income was $107.0 million and $91.9 million for the six months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. \n  * Diluted net income per share was $3.48 and $2.91 for the six months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. As adjusted diluted net income per share was $3.62 and $3.02 for the six months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. \n  * Adjusted EBITDA increased 16.9% to $157.1 million for the six months ended June 30, 2024, compared to $134.4 million for the same period in 2023.\n\n\n\n**Liquidity and Capital Resources**\n\nOur liquidity position, as measured by cash and cash equivalents and investments increased by $97.3 million between December 31, 2023 and June 30, 2024, which was largely attributable to cash flows from operations for the six months ended June 30, 2024 exceeding share repurchases, changes in our investment balances and capital expenditures during the six months ended June 30, 2024. Our unrestricted cash and cash equivalents and investments were $341.8 million and $244.5 million at June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively.\n\n**Grand Canyon Education, Inc.

(ii) share-based compensation, and (iii) unusual charges or gains, such as litigation and regulatory reserves, impairment charges and asset write-offs, severance costs, and exit or lease termination costs. We present Adjusted EBITDA because we consider it to be an important supplemental measure of our operating performance. We also make certain compensation decisions based, in part, on our operating performance, as measured by Adjusted EBITDA. All of the adjustments made in our calculation of Adjusted EBITDA are adjustments to items that management does not consider to be reflective of our core operating performance. Management considers our core operating performance to be that which can be affected by our managers in any particular period through their management of the resources that affect our underlying revenue and profit generating operations during that period and does not consider the items for which we make adjustments (as listed above) to be reflective of our core performance.\n\nWe believe Adjusted EBITDA allows us to compare our current operating results with corresponding historical periods and with the operational performance of other companies in our industry because it does not give effect to potential differences caused by variations in capital structures (affecting relative interest expense, including the impact of write-offs of deferred financing costs when companies refinance their indebtedness), tax positions (such as the impact on periods or companies of changes in effective tax rates or net operating losses), the book amortization of intangibles (affecting relative amortization expense), and other items that we do not consider reflective of underlying operating performance. We also present Adjusted EBITDA because we believe it is frequently used by securities analysts, investors, and other interested parties as a measure of performance.\n\nIn evaluating Adjusted EBITDA, investors should be aware that in the future we may incur expenses similar to the adjustments described above. Our presentation of Adjusted EBITDA should not be construed as an inference that our future results will be unaffected by expenses that are unusual, non-routine, or non-recurring. Adjusted EBITDA has limitations as an analytical tool in that, among other things it does not reflect:\n\n  * cash expenditures for capital expenditures or contractual commitments;\n  * changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital requirements;\n  * interest expense, or the cash required to replace assets that are being depreciated or amortized; and\n  * the impact on our reported results of earnings or charges resulting from the items for which we make adjustments to our EBITDA, as described above and set forth in the table below.\n\n\n\nIn addition, other companies, including other companies in our industry, may calculate these measures differently than we do, limiting the usefulness of Adjusted EBITDA as a comparative measure. Because of these limitations, Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered as a substitute for net income, operating income, or any other performance measure derived in accordance with and reported under GAAP, or as an alternative to cash flow from operating activities or as a measure of our liquidity. We compensate for these limitations by relying primarily on our GAAP results and only use Adjusted EBITDA as a supplemental performance measure.\n\nThe following table provides a reconciliation of net income to Adjusted EBITDA, which is a non-GAAP measure for the periods indicated:\n\n**Three Months Ended** |  **Six Months Ended**  \n---|---  \n**June 30 , ** |  **June 30 , **  \n**2024** |  **2023** |  **2024** |  **2023**  \n**(Unaudited, in thousands)** |  **(Unaudited, in thousands)**  \nNet income |  $ |  34,878 |  $ |  28,973 |  $ |  102,888 |  $ |  88,537  \nPlus: interest expense |  2 |  7 |  4 |  26  \nLess: investment interest and other |  (4,112) |  (2,590) |  (7,841) |  (4,743)  \nPlus: income tax expense |  11,951 |  9,052 |  32,146 |  26,099  \nPlus: amortization of intangible assets |  2,105 |  2,105 |  4,210 |  4,210  \nPlus: depreciation and amortization |  6,928 |  5,402 |  13,581 |  10,939  \nEBITDA |  51,752 |  42,949 |  144,988 |  125,068  \nPlus: loss on fixed asset disposal |  44 |  54 |  44 |  135  \nPlus: litigation and regulatory reserves |  1,601 |  1,474 |  3,471 |  2,547  \nPlus: severance costs |  1,133 |  — |  1,133 |  —  \nPlus: share-based compensation |  3,996 |  3,253 |  7,479 |  6,622  \nAdjusted EBITDA |  $ |  58,526 |  $ |  47,730 |  $ |  157,115 |  $ |  134,372  \n  \n**Non-GAAP Net Income and Non-GAAP Diluted Income Per Share**\n\nThe Company believes the presentation of non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP diluted income per share information that excludes amortization of intangible assets, loss on disposal of fixed assets and severance costs allows investors to develop a more meaningful understanding of the Company's performance over time. Accordingly, for the six-months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023, the table below provides reconciliations of these non-GAAP items to GAAP net income and GAAP diluted income per share, respectively:\n\n**Three Months Ended** |  **Six Months Ended**  \n---|---  \n**June 30 , ** |  **June 30 , **  \n**2024** |  **2023** |  **2024** |  **2023**  \n**(Unaudited, in thousands except per share data)**  \nGAAP Net income |  $ |  34,878 |  $ |  28,973 |  $ |  102,888 |  $ |  88,537  \nAmortization of intangible assets |  2,105 |  2,105 |  4,210 |  4,210  \nLoss on disposal of fixed assets |  44 |  54 |  44 |  135  \nSeverance costs |  1,133 |  — |  1,133 |  —  \nIncome tax effects of adjustments(1) |  (837) |  (515) |  (1,282) |  (989)  \nAs Adjusted, Non-GAAP Net income |  $ |  37,323 |  $ |  30,617 |  $ |  106,993 |  $ |  91,893  \nGAAP Diluted income per share |  $ |  1.19 |  $ |  0.96 |  $ |  3.48 |  $ |  2.91  \nAmortization of intangible assets (2) |  0.05 |  0.05 |  0.11 |  0.11  \nLoss on disposal of fixed assets (3) |  0.00 |  0.00 |  0.00 |  0.00  \nSeverance costs (4) |  0.03 |  — |  0.03 |  —  \nAs Adjusted, Non-GAAP Diluted income per share |  $ |  1.27 |  $ |  1.01 |  $ |  3.62 |  $ |  3.02  \n  \n____________________  \n---  \n(1) |  The income tax effects of adjustments are based on the effective income tax rate applicable to adjusted (non-GAAP) results.   \n(2) |  The amortization of acquired intangible assets per diluted share is net of an income tax benefit of $0.02 for both of the three months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023, and net of an income tax benefit of $0.03 for both of the six months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023.  \n(3) |  The loss on disposal of fixed assets per diluted share is net of an income tax benefit of nil for both of the three months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023, and net of an income tax benefit of nil for both of the six months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023.  \n(4) |  The severance costs per diluted share is net of an income tax benefit of $0.01 for the three months ended June 30, 2024 and net of an income tax benefit of $0.01 for the six months ended June 30, 2024.  \n  \n**Investor Relations Contact:** Daniel E.
