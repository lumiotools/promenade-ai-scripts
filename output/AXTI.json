Announces Third Quarter 2024 Financial Results\n\n10/31/2024\n\nDownload(opens in new window)\n\nFREMONT, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--  AXT, Inc. (NasdaqGS: AXTI), a leading manufacturer of compound semiconductor wafer substrates, today reported financial results for the third quarter, ended September 30, 2024. \n\n**Management Qualitative Comments**\n\n“Q3 came in largely in line with our expectations, coming off a strong quarter in Q2,” said Morris Young, chief executive officer. “By comparison to the year ago quarter Q3 2023, our revenue in Q3 of 2024 increased over 36 percent and we are pleased to see that every product, including raw materials, had double digit year-over-year growth. Data center-related demand remained solid, and we are anticipating new order momentum in indium phosphide substrates for photodetectors in AI applications.” \n\n“This year-over-year revenue improvement benefited our GAAP gross margin significantly, moving from 10.7 percent in Q3 2023 to 24.0 percent in the recent quarter. The impact on the bottom line reduced the GAAP net loss from ($0.14) per share in Q3 2023 to ($0.07) per share in the recent quarter. As we move into 2025, we are optimistic about the growth and expansion of our business. Across our portfolio of products, the signs of recovery are tangible, and we are strongly positioned for success in this highly dynamic technology landscape.” \n\n**Third Quarter 2024 Results**\n\n  * Revenue for the third quarter of 2024 was $23.6 million, compared with $27.9 million for the second quarter of 2024 and $17.4 million for the third quarter of 2023. \n\n\n  * GAAP gross margin was 24.0 percent of revenue for the third quarter of 2024, compared with 27.4 percent of revenue for the second quarter of 2024 and 10.7 percent for the third quarter of 2023. \n\n\n  * Non-GAAP gross margin, after excluding charges for stock-based compensation, was 24.3 percent of revenue for the third quarter of 2024, compared with 27.6 percent of revenue for the second quarter of 2024 and 11.3 percent for the third quarter of 2023. \n\n\n  * GAAP net loss, after minority interests, for the third quarter of 2024 was a net loss of ($2.9) million, or ($0.07) per share, compared with a net loss of ($1.5) million, or ($0.04) per share, for the second quarter of 2024 and a net loss of ($5.8) million, or ($0.14) per share, for the third quarter of 2023. \n\n\n  * Non-GAAP net loss for the third quarter of 2024 was a net loss of ($2.1) million, or ($0.05) per share, compared with a net loss of ($0.8) million, or ($0.02) per share, for the second quarter of 2024 and a net loss of ($4.9) million, or ($0.12) per share, for the third quarter of 2023. \n\n\n\n**STAR Market Listing Update**\n\nOn January 10, 2022, AXT announced that Beijing Tongmei Xtal Technology Co., Ltd. (“Tongmei”), its subsidiary in Beijing, China, submitted to the Shanghai Stock Exchange (the “SSE”) its application to list its shares in an initial public offering (the “IPO”) on the SSE’s Sci-Tech innovAtion boaRd (the “STAR Market”) and the application was accepted for review. Subsequently, Tongmei responded to several rounds of questions received from the SSE. On July 12, 2022, the SSE approved the listing of Tongmei’s shares in an IPO on the STAR Market. On August 1, 2022, the China Securities Regulatory Commission (the “CSRC”) accepted for review Tongmei’s IPO application. The STAR Market IPO remains subject to review and approval by the CSRC and other authorities. The process of going public on the STAR Market includes several periods of review and, therefore, is a lengthy process. Subject to review and approval by the CSRC and other authorities, Tongmei hopes to accomplish this goal in the coming months. AXT has posted a brief summary of the plan and the process on its website at [http://www.axt.com](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.axt.com&esheet=54145625&newsitemid=20241031052316&lan=en-US&anchor=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.axt.com&index=1&md5=d5f33b6b57ece1cbb6e45eeb03a70a07). \n\n**Conference Call**\n\nThe company will host a conference call to discuss these results today at 1:30 p.m. PT. The conference call can be accessed at (800) 715-9871 (passcode 4378083).

The company’s wafer substrates are used when a typical silicon wafer substrate cannot meet the performance requirements of a semiconductor or optoelectronic device. End markets include 5G infrastructure, data center connectivity (silicon photonics), passive optical networks, LED lighting, lasers, sensors, power amplifiers for wireless devices and satellite solar cells. AXT’s worldwide headquarters are in Fremont, California where the company maintains sales, administration and customer service functions. AXT has its Asia headquarters in Beijing, China and manufacturing facilities in three separate locations in China. In addition, as part of its supply chain strategy, the company has partial ownership in more than ten companies in China producing raw materials and consumables for its manufacturing process. For more information, see AXT’s website at [http://www.axt.com](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.axt.com%2F&esheet=54145625&newsitemid=20241031052316&lan=en-US&anchor=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.axt.com&index=4&md5=df3fb8f2a3c886daa81c21e7a203433e). \n\n**Safe Harbor Statement**\n\nThe foregoing paragraphs contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Federal securities laws, including, for example, statements regarding the timing and completion of the proposed listing of shares of Tongmei on the STAR Market. Additional examples of forward-looking statements include statements regarding the market demand for our products, our product mix, our growth prospects and opportunities for continued business expansion, including technology trends, new applications and the ramping of Tier-1 customers, our market opportunity, our ability to lead our industry, our relocation, our expectations with respect to our business prospects and financial results, including our gross margin performance, and our development of larger diameter substrates that we believe will enable the next generation of technology innovation across a number of end-markets. These forward-looking statements are based upon assumptions that are subject to uncertainties and factors relating to the company’s operations and business environment, which could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements contained in the foregoing discussion. These uncertainties and factors include but are not limited to: the requests for redemptions by private equity funds in China of investments in Tongmei, the administrative challenges in satisfying the requirements of various government agencies in China in connection with the listing of shares of Tongmei on the STAR Market, continued open access to companies to list shares on the STAR Market, investor enthusiasm for new listings of shares on the STAR Market and geopolitical tensions between China and the United States. Additional uncertainties and factors include, but are not limited to: the timing and receipt of significant orders; the cancellation of orders and return of product; emerging applications using chips or devices fabricated on our substrates; end-user acceptance of products containing chips or devices fabricated on our substrates; our ability to bring new products to market; product announcements by our competitors; the ability to control costs and improve efficiency; the ability to utilize our manufacturing capacity; product yields and their impact on gross margins; the relocation of manufacturing lines and ramping of production; possible factory shutdowns as a result of air pollution in China or COVID-19; COVID-19 or other outbreaks of a contagious disease; tariffs and other trade war issues; the financial performance of our partially owned supply chain companies; policies and regulations in China; and other factors as set forth in the company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and other filings made with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Each of these factors is difficult to predict and many are beyond the company’s control. The company does not undertake any obligation to update any forward-looking statement, as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. \n\n**AXT, INC.** **CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS

(NasdaqGS: AXTI), a leading manufacturer of compound semiconductor wafer substrates, today reported financial results for the second quarter, ended June 30, 2024. \n\n**Management Qualitative Comments**\n\n“Q2 was another solid quarter of growth, with our revenues up 23 percent sequentially and more than 50 percent year over year,” said Morris Young, chief executive officer. “We are encouraged by the signs of adoption in new applications, such as AI where we expect that indium phosphide will be required in optical transceivers for high-speed data transmission. These applications span longer distances, such as from rack to rack, rack to aggregation point and between cloud and edge data centers. Across the rest of our portfolio of products, the signs of market recovery are tangible, and though we expect some lumpiness quarter to quarter as our end markets come back to normalized seasonality, we are executing well on behalf of our customers and have laid important groundwork for growth within this highly dynamic technology landscape.” \n\n**Second Quarter 2024 Results**\n\n  * Revenue for the second quarter of 2024 was $27.9 million, compared with $22.7 million for the first quarter of 2024 and $18.6 million for the second quarter of 2023. \n\n\n  * GAAP gross margin was 27.4 percent of revenue for the second quarter of 2024, compared with 26.9 percent of revenue for the first quarter of 2024 and 9.2 percent for the second quarter of 2023. \n\n\n  * Non-GAAP gross margin, after excluding charges for stock-based compensation, was 27.6 percent of revenue for the second quarter of 2024, compared with 27.3 percent of revenue for the first quarter of 2024 and 9.8 percent for the second quarter of 2023. \n\n\n  * GAAP operating expenses were $9.5 million for the second quarter of 2024, compared with $9.4 million for the first quarter of 2024 and $8.6 million for the second quarter of 2023. \n\n\n  * Non-GAAP operating expenses were $8.9 million for the second quarter of 2024, compared with $8.7 million for the first quarter of 2024 and $7.8 million for the second quarter of 2023. \n\n\n  * GAAP operating loss for the second quarter of 2024 was an operating loss of ($1.9) million, compared with an operating loss of ($3.3) million for the first quarter of 2024 and an operating loss of ($6.8) million for the second quarter of 2023. \n\n\n  * Non-GAAP operating loss for the second quarter of 2024 was an operating loss of ($1.2) million, compared with an operating loss of ($2.5) million for the first quarter of 2024 and an operating loss of ($5.9) million for the second quarter of 2023. \n\n\n  * Non-operating income and expense, taxes and minority interest for the second quarter of 2024 was a net gain of $0.4 million, compared with a net gain of $1.3 million in the first quarter of 2024 and a net gain of $1.8 million for the second quarter of 2023. \n\n\n  * GAAP net loss, after minority interests, for the second quarter of 2024 was a net loss of ($1.5) million, or ($0.04) per share, compared with a net loss of ($2.1) million, or ($0.05) per share, for the first quarter of 2024 and a net loss of ($5.1) million, or ($0.12) per share, for the second quarter of 2023. \n\n\n  * Non-GAAP net loss for the second quarter of 2024 was a net loss of ($0.8) million, or ($0.02) per share, compared with a net loss of ($1.3) million, or ($0.03) per share, for the first quarter of 2024 and a net loss of ($4.2) million, or ($0.10) per share, for the second quarter of 2023. \n\n\n\n**STAR Market Listing Update**\n\nOn January 10, 2022, AXT announced that Beijing Tongmei Xtal Technology Co., Ltd.

Additional examples of forward-looking statements include statements regarding the market demand for our products, our product mix, our growth prospects and opportunities for continued business expansion, including technology trends, new applications and the ramping of Tier-1 customers, our market opportunity, our ability to lead our industry, our relocation, our expectations with respect to our business prospects and financial results, including our gross margin performance, and our development of larger diameter substrates that we believe will enable the next generation of technology innovation across a number of end-markets. These forward-looking statements are based upon assumptions that are subject to uncertainties and factors relating to the company’s operations and business environment, which could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements contained in the foregoing discussion. These uncertainties and factors include but are not limited to: the requests for redemptions by private equity funds in China of investments in Tongmei, the administrative challenges in satisfying the requirements of various government agencies in China in connection with the listing of shares of Tongmei on the STAR Market, continued open access to companies to list shares on the STAR Market, investor enthusiasm for new listings of shares on the STAR Market and geopolitical tensions between China and the United States. Additional uncertainties and factors include, but are not limited to: the timing and receipt of significant orders; the cancellation of orders and return of product; emerging applications using chips or devices fabricated on our substrates; end-user acceptance of products containing chips or devices fabricated on our substrates; our ability to bring new products to market; product announcements by our competitors; the ability to control costs and improve efficiency; the ability to utilize our manufacturing capacity; product yields and their impact on gross margins; the relocation of manufacturing lines and ramping of production; possible factory shutdowns as a result of air pollution in China or COVID-19; COVID-19 or other outbreaks of a contagious disease; tariffs and other trade war issues; the financial performance of our partially owned supply chain companies; policies and regulations in China; and other factors as set forth in the company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and other filings made with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Each of these factors is difficult to predict and many are beyond the company’s control. The company does not undertake any obligation to update any forward-looking statement, as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. \n\n**AXT, INC.** **CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS
