The closing of the transactions contemplated by the definitive agreement (the “**business combination** ”) is subject to certain conditions, including, without limitation, the approval of the shareholders of Kaival Brands and the approval of the listing of the shares of Pubco on the Nasdaq Stock Market (“**Nasdaq** ”). Delta shareholders will become the majority shareholders of Pubco as further detailed below.\n\nFollowing closing of the transactions, which the parties expect will occur in the fourth quarter of 2024, the combined company would be traded on Nasdaq. The combined company will continue to operate under the Delta management team led by Mudit Paliwal, Chief Executive Officer and Founder; Peter Shaerf, Non-Executive Chairman; and Joseph Nelson, Chief Financial Officer, with Kaival Brands as a wholly owned subsidiary of the Pubco.\n\nMark Thoenes, Interim Chief Executive Officer of Kaival Brands, stated, “This transaction marks an exciting new chapter for Kaival Brands. Delta’s flexible, asset-light business model positions the combined Company to capitalize on high growth areas within the energy and raw materials markets and offers our shareholders a unique opportunity. We are confident that this partnership will deliver substantial value to Kaival Brands shareholders and employees.”\n\n“We are excited about the proposed business combination between Delta and Kaival Brands, given its potential to bring substantial value to the stakeholders of both parties,” stated Mudit Paliwal, Delta’s Chief Executive Officer and Founder. “Since its inception, Delta has established itself as a trusted global logistics leader, serving some of the world’s top natural resource, industrial, and energy companies. This success is a direct result of our unwavering commitment to finding solutions for our customers' complex global supply chains through continuous innovation, all driven by a leadership team with a proven track record of success. We believe the business combination with Kaival will enable us to continue our robust growth in the public markets.”\n\nPeter Shaerf, Delta’s Non-Executive Chairman of the Board of Directors, stated, “This merger marks a pivotal step forward for Delta. KAVL's engaged shareholder base paired with the transparency of a public listing, provide a solid foundation for Delta's growth, accelerating our momentum. This partnership will support our efforts to expand core business lines and extend our geographical reach, positioning Delta for sustained success and long-term value creation.”\n\n**Delta – A Fast-Growing, Asset-Light Third-Party Logistics Company**\n\nDelta is a fully-integrated, global business engaged in logistics, fuel supply and asset management related services, primarily servicing the international supply chains of commodity, energy, and capital goods producers. Delta has been in operation since 2019 and its businesses facilitate the global trade of energy, raw materials, intermediate goods, and agricultural products. Delta is a multinational business with over 400 personnel and has a global footprint through a network of offices in 16 countries throughout Europe, the Middle East, Asia, and Africa.\n\nDelta’s business is asset-light, and it relies on its people, technology, customer relationships and differentiated service offerings to drive its business and its growth. Delta believes its asset-light business model differentiates it from competitors and leads to greater profitability while reducing risk. Delta has leadership positions in niche markets where it has a specialized competitive advantage which allows it to leverage its broad portfolio of service offerings to reduce its customers’ logistics costs while enhancing its profitability.\n\nDelta operates its business through three segments: Bulk Logistics, Energy Logistics and Asset Management. Each segment is headed by proven management teams which share a commitment to the value of client focus and a vision of setting a new standard of excellence within the sectors in which Delta operates. Delta seeks high-growth niche opportunities within its core business offerings or adjacent industries and leverages its diverse service offering to penetrate its markets.\n\n**Key Transaction Terms**\n\nThe business combination will be effectuated through a holding company structure, whereby Kaival Brands and Delta will each become wholly-owned subsidiaries of Pubco. Under the agreement, shareholders of Kaival Brands will receive 1 ordinary share of Pubco for each share of Kaival Brands common stock they own as of the closing of the business combination, and Delta shareholders will exchange their shares of Delta for $270 million in ordinary shares of Pubco, subject to certain adjustments, at an implied value per share of $2.66, as set forth in the definitive agreement (including adjustment as applicable for Nasdaq listing purposes). Immediately prior to the closing of the business combination, the stockholders of Kaival Brands are anticipated to collectively own approximately 10.30% of the outstanding ordinary shares of Pubco, and Delta shareholders immediately following this closing are anticipated to collectively own approximately 89.70% of the outstanding ordinary shares of Pubco.\n\nThe definitive agreement also includes an earnout to existing shareholders of Delta, which, if earned, consists of $30 million of additional ordinary shares of Pubco, which would be issued to Delta shareholders if the Surviving Public Company achieves or exceeds (i) revenues of $700 million and (ii) either (a) Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, and Depreciation and Amortization (“EBITDA”) of $20 million or (b) net income of $10 million, in each case for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2025.\n\nThe definitive agreement contains customary representations, warranties and covenants made by Kaival Brands and Delta, including covenants relating to both parties using their commercially reasonably efforts to cause the transactions contemplated by the agreement to be satisfied, covenants regarding obtaining the requisite approval of Kaival Brands’ shareholders, covenants regarding indemnification of directors and officers, and covenants regarding Kaival Brands’ and Delta’s conduct of their respective businesses between the date of signing of the agreement and the closing. The definitive agreement also contains certain termination rights for both Kaival Brands and Delta, and, in connection with the termination of the agreement under certain circumstances, Kaival Brands and Delta may be required to pay the other party a termination fee.\n\nThe definitive agreement has been unanimously approved by the Board of Directors of Kaival Brands and by the Board of Directors of Delta. The Kaival Brands Board of Directors has also recommended to Kaival Brands’ shareholders that they vote to approve the definitive agreement and the business combination. Kaival Brands also received a fairness opinion in connection with the business combination. The business combination is expected to close in the fourth quarter of 2024, subject to certain conditions set forth in the definitive agreement, including the approvals by the requisite shareholders of Kaival Brands described above, the listing of Pubco ordinary shares on Nasdaq, as applicable, and other customary closing conditions.\n\nA more complete description of the terms of and conditions of the proposed business combination and related matters will be included in a current report on Form 8-K to be filed by Kaival Brands with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“**SEC** ”) on or about September 23, 2024.

Information about the directors and executive officers of Kaival Brands, including their ownership of shares of Kaival Brands common stock, is included in Kaival Brands’ Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended October 31, 2023, which was filed with the SEC on February 14, 2024. Additional information regarding the persons or entities who may be deemed participants in the solicitation of proxies from Kaival Brands shareholders, including a description of their interests in the proposed business combination by security holdings or otherwise, will be included in the proxy statement/prospectus and other relevant documents to be filed with the SEC when they become available.

No offering of securities in connection with the proposed business combination shall be made except by means of a prospectus meeting the requirements of Section 10 of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended.\n\n**Forward-Looking Statements**\n\nThis press release contains certain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws with respect to the proposed business combination between Pubco, Kaival Brands and Delta. All statements other than statements of historical facts contained in this press release, including statements regarding Pubco’s, Kaival Brands’ or Delta’s future results of operations and financial position, Pubco’s, Kaival Brands’ and Delta’s business strategy, prospective costs, timing and likelihood of success, plans and objectives of management for future operations, future results of current and anticipated operations of Pubco, Kaival Brands and Delta, and the expected value of the combined company after the transactions, are forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements generally are identified by the words “believe,” “project,” “expect,” “anticipate,” “estimate,” “intend,” “strategy,” “future,” “opportunity,” “plan,” “may,” “should,” “will,” “would,” “will be,” “will continue,” “will likely result,” and similar expressions. These forward-looking statements are subject to a number of risks, uncertainties and assumptions, including, but not limited to, the following risks relating to the proposed business combination: the risk that the transaction may not be completed in a timely manner or at all, which may adversely affect the price of Kaival Brands’ securities; the occurrence of any event, change or other circumstances that could give rise to the termination of the definitive agreement; the inability to complete the transactions contemplated by the definitive agreement, including due to failure to obtain approval of the shareholders of Kaival Brands or other conditions to closing in the definitive agreement; the inability to obtain or maintain the listing of Pubco ordinary shares on Nasdaq following the business combination; the risk that the transactions contemplated by the business combination disrupt current plans and operations of Kaival Brands as a result of the announcement and consummation of these transactions; the ability to recognize the anticipated benefits of the business combination, which may be affected by, among other things, competition, the ability of the combined company to grow and manage growth economically and hire and retain key employees; costs related to the business combination; changes in applicable laws or regulations; the possibility that Pubco, Delta or Kaival Brands may be adversely affected by other economic, business, and/or competitive factors; and other risks and uncertainties to be identified in the Registration Statement and accompanying proxy statement/prospectus (when available) relating to the transactions, including those under “Risk Factors” therein, and in other filings with the SEC made by Pubco and Kaival Brands. Moreover, Pubco, Delta and Kaival Brands operate in very competitive and rapidly changing environments. Because forward-looking statements are inherently subject to risks and uncertainties, some of which cannot be predicted or quantified and some of which are beyond Pubco’s, Delta’s and Kaival Brands’ control, you should not rely on these forward-looking statements as predictions of future events. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made. None of Pubco, Delta or Kaival Brands gives any assurance that either Delta or Kaival Brands or Pubco will achieve its expectations. Readers are cautioned not to put undue reliance on forward-looking statements, and except as required by law, Pubco, Delta and Kaival Brands assume no obligation and do not intend to update or revise these forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise.\n\n_For further information, contact:_\n\n**Kaival Brands Innovations Group, Inc.** Brett Maas, Managing PartnerHayden IR(646) 536-7331brett@haydenir.com\n\n**Delta Corp Holdings Limited** Joseph NelsonChief Financial OfficerPhone: +44 0203 753 5598Email: ir@wearedelta.com\n\n![](https://www.globenewswire.com/newsroom/ti?nf=OTIzNDgzMiM2NDkwNTE2IzUwMDA2NzIzMw==) ![](https://ml.globenewswire.com/media/MWRiODA5ZjAtOTFmZS00YTRmLThiMjYtYjRkMDk5ZDI2MTEwLTUwMDA2NzIzMw==/tiny/Kaival-Brands-Innovations-Grou.png)\n\n[![Primary Logo](https://ml.globenewswire.com/media/ac68f4e7-06a0-4ad1-b164-a0ad0f8d82ae/small/kaival-logo-png.PNG)](https://www.globenewswire.com/NewsRoom/AttachmentNg/ac68f4e7-06a0-4ad1-b164-a0ad0f8d82ae)\n\nSource: Kaival Brands Innovations Group, Inc.\n\n[View All News](https://ir.kaivalbrands.com/news/default.aspx)\n\n### Contact Us\n\n[+1 833-4-KAIVAL](tel:1 833-452-4825) [+1 833-452-4825](fax:1 833-452-4825) investors@kaivalbrands.com\n\n### Quick Links\n\n  * [SEC Filings](https://ir.kaivalbrands.com/financials/sec-filings/default.aspx)\n  * [Information Request Form](https://ir.kaivalbrands.com/resources/information-request-form/default.aspx)\n\n\n\n### Investor Email Alerts\n\nTo opt-in for investor email alerts, please enter your email address in the field below and select at least one alert option.
