We believe that enduring economic success is inextricably linked to ethical business conduct and responsible corporate citizenship.\n\nWe have adopted a broad corporate governance and compliance program, which includes policies and procedures, training, systems, and tools in a number of key legal areas.\n\nWe are firmly committed to maintaining strong corporate governance and compliance programs informed by best practices and we periodically review our policies and procedures to ensure they are up to date with regulatory requirements.\n\nWe are also committed to maintaining a strong control environment and to making effective controls an integral part of our routine business practices, with checks and balances in place to help us address issues before they become larger problems.\n\nWe require our employees to act in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations and to maintain a high level of ethical conduct in their dealings with customers, suppliers, and other stakeholders.\n\nWe conduct periodic audits or assessments of our programs.\n\nLearn more about our [Corporate Governance Policies](https://www.verint.com/investor-relations/corporate-governance/corporate-governance-policies/).\n\n### Oversight for Ethical Issues\n\n**We take a “tone at the top” approach to the importance of ethics.**\n\nWe understand that a company is only as ethical as its employees. We believe that the most important and effective way to communicate the importance of ethics and compliance to our employees is to set an effective “tone at the top”, starting with our Board and senior management. We seek to accomplish this by:\n\n  * Modeling ethical behavior at the Board and management team level, as well as adopting an open and responsive approach to concerns that are raised by others\n  * Communicating about ethics and compliance issues frequently, seriously, and openly at all levels of the organization\n  * Building and maintaining a strong governance and compliance infrastructure for the company\n\n\n\nWe keep our Board and its committees informed of our compliance objectives several times a year as part of scheduled updates, and more frequently where necessary. The Board and its committees are actively involved in setting compliance priorities, evaluating the company’s assessment of its risk**,** opportunities, and control environment, and overseeing progress on risk mitigation activities.\n\n_We articulate our ethical standards in the Verint Code of Conduct._\n\nAll of our employees, officers, and Board members are required to comply with our Code of Conduct. Our Code of Conduct clearly articulates our core values, describes our policies and procedures, and provides our people with guidance on important ethics and compliance issues, including a framework for making good decisions and instructions for communicating areas of concern.\n\n_We strive to achieve more complete compliance through training and guidance._\n\nVerint has a broad corporate compliance training program. The core program consists of the following five topics: Code of Conduct, Information Security & Data Privacy, Anti-Bribery / Anti-Corruption, Insider Trading, and Global Trade Compliance. We deliver these trainings to thousands of employees around the world each year and we seek to achieve a 100% completion rate for each training cycle. New employees are required to complete Code of Conduct and other training following commencement of their employment or engagement with us. We also offer trainings in other key areas, including Anti-Harassment and Artificial Intelligence.\n\nLearn more about our [Corporate Governance Policies here](https://www.verint.com/investor-relations/corporate-governance/corporate-governance-policies/).\n\n![](https://verint.imgix.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/v-favicon.png?fit=max&auto=format&auto=compress)\n\n##  Search Modal\n\n##  Search\n\nSearch \n\nBegin typing to search, the field will be completed as you type.\n\n##  Results\n\n##  Search Modal\n\n##  Search\n\nSearch \n\nBegin typing to search, the field will be completed as you type.\n\n##  Results\n\n##  Video Modal\n\n[ Download Audio Transcript ]() Watch the audio description version of this video  Watch the standard version of this video \n"

Both from consumer customers concerned about rising costs and ensuring value-for-money and from businesses seeking to profitably meet their needs. \n\nLingering supply chain problems from the COVID-19 pandemic, exacerbated by climate-heating-driven destructive weather, global conflicts and political instability, but also by labor shortages, have contributed to increased product and service prices, low or no availability, and delivery delays. \n\nBut at the same time, consumers have strong expectations for excellent service. And when it doesn’t happen they become annoyed, even angry. Contact center agents hear and read that loud and clear in their tone and choice of words.\n\nContact centers cannot solve the underlying reasons why a product or service is not functioning, the wrong one was shipped, or why, or with service delays. But they can manage the experience customers (customer experience i.e., CX) have with them.\n\nIn such stressful times as these, it has become exceptionally important to assure quality service. And to ensure it is delivered whether the agents are working at home (which has become normalized in the contact center) or on-premise. \n\nTo get a handle on the issues - and on what contact centers can do to provide excellent quality CX - we had virtual conversations with these subject matter experts at several leading suppliers.\n\nDave Hoekstra, Product Evangelist, Calabrio\n\nManisha Powar, Chief Product Officer, Qualtrics Frontline Care\n\nDave Singer, Global Vice President, GTM Strategy, Verint\n\nElizabeth Tobey, Head of Marketing for Digital Solutions, NICE\n\n## Q. What are the top four quality assurance/quality management (QA/QM) challenges and issues that you are hearing from contact centers? What are their drivers?\n\nDave Hoekstra:\n\n**1. Inadequate coaching time.** Business demands are making it difficult if not impossible to spend enough time with agents to coach and develop.\n\n**2. Too-small sample sizes.** There just isn’t enough data to truly understand where the priorities are. \n\n**3. Remote coaching.** QM leaders are being challenged to find ways to effectively coach and develop remote employees. While remote coaching can be effective, it lacks the impact of in-person coaching. \n\n**4. Shifting methodologies.** As analytics tools become increasingly better, the traditional QM process is being less relied upon as a driver towards change, so the traditional QM department is starting to shift methodologies to a more analytics and conversational approach.\n\nManisha Powar:\n\nThe top four QA/QM challenges in contact centers revolve around maintaining quality and avoiding bias while handling high call volumes, adapting rapidly to market changes and customer expectations, ensuring consistency across diverse channels, and managing costs without sacrificing performance. \n\nFor many companies, QA methods in their contact centers are burdensome, time-intensive, and manual. They can also be susceptible to bias. For example, when evaluating call center performance on a random and limited number of calls, performance requirements can leave much up to the subjective interpretation of your auditors. This introduces the potential for human error.\n\nIn fact, a [Qualtrics study](https://www.qualtrics.com/news/new-qualtrics-quality-management-improves-contact-center-performance-and-agent-retention/) found that a third (33%) of customer service agents felt their performance was not fairly evaluated and only 41% said they were incentivized to offer personalized, empathetic experiences. \n\nThese endeavors are also limited by the number of audited calls, hours in a day, and the audit timeframe. The industry is experiencing rapid change as consumer behavior and expectations continue to shift rapidly. And as contact centers grapple with how to best reduce costs to serve customers while implementing a plethora of new AI-powered agent-assist and coaching tools.\n\nDave Singer:\n\nQA and QM programs in the contact center are generally too expensive and manually labor intensive. Companies are spending a lot of money and resources that are producing limited insights due to low evaluation coverage across customer interactions.\n\nWith limited insights, it’s difficult to coach agents and improve performance objectively because people don’t believe in the feedback due to the sampling bias that occurs as a result of manual processes.\n\nAs contact center volumes, engagement channels, and modalities grow exponentially, these manual processes cause contact centers to fall further behind the power curve.\n\nElizabeth Tobey:\n\n**_The first challenge_** is that manual QA doesn’t paint a holistic view of CX operations and employee performance. Manual QA performed by supervisors makes it impossible to view and score every interaction. Therefore, supervisors are only scoring a small percentage of an employees’ work and don’t have a complete understanding of employee performance. \n\nArtificial intelligence (AI) is transforming what’s possible with QA. AI analyzes 100% of interactions in real-time and historically, pinpointing areas for employee improvement. This leads to stronger, targeted coaching opportunities to boost employee performance. Additionally, when AI follows interactions in real-time, it can guide employees with suggested next-best actions, driving in-the-moment QM.\n\n**_The second challenge_** is that employees don’t receive clear, data-backed feedback from manual QA. When supervisors don’t have a holistic view of employee performance across every interaction, they can’t effectively coach their employees. The feedback they do give employees is incomplete and can be perceived negatively by employees due to the greater chance for subjective feedback. \n\nWhen supervisors have access to AI-powered QA technology, they can assess 100% of interactions and give employees data-backed, objective coaching to effectively improve employee performance.\n\n**_The third challenge_** is that manual QA isn’t being done in real-time. This equates to missed opportunities for supervisors to resolve employee performance issues in the moment. This can not only lead to lower CSAT but also lower employee morale as their performance issues increase.\n\nAI enables in-the-moment QA, coaching an employee in real-time with next-best-actions that lead to optimal results. AI can do this because it is trained on the best interactions. Additionally, AI can serve as powerful copilots to supervisors, alerting them in real-time when they need to intervene in interactions. This real-time QA means issues can be resolved faster instead of compounding over time.\n\n**_The fourth challenge_** is that supervisors spend too much time analyzing the data with manual QA instead of coaching employees. Before AI, supervisors would have to sift through and listen to interactions to judge employee performance. This is a time-consuming process that doesn’t generate an accurate picture of employee performance over time. \n\n> “When supervisors have access to AI-powered QA technology, they can assess 100% of interactions...” —Elizabeth Tobey\n\nNow AI automates this process, listening to every interaction for supervisors, tracking employee performance over time and pinpointing areas for improvement. This gives supervisors time back to focus on providing rich, targeted coaching to their employees.\n\n## Q. Conversely, what are the top four opportunities, in best practices, methods, and technologies, that you are seeing to enable superior QA/QM?\n\nDave Hoekstra:\n\n**1. A more targeted approach.** This is based on what the customers are saying. Instead of a random interaction, focusing on the interactions that contain the information needed for improvement has a significantly higher success rate.\n\n**2. Auto-aggregation of topics.** By having conversational topics grouped together and performing analytics on those topics, contact centers can stop guessing and start solving. \n\n**3. Reducing the form for the agents.** QM forms can often get out of control, which impacts everything from agent stress levels to handle times. Reducing the number of variables in a QM form can actually have a positive impact. \n\n**4. More productive use of time.** That means spending less time listening to individual calls and more time looking at the data from the analytics is what top tier contact centers are doing. \n\nManisha Powar:\n\nWe are seeing clients deploy new AI tools for predictive analytics and automated quality checks, robust virtual training modules for skill enhancement, omnichannel contact center platforms that ensure a more uniform CX, and advanced call routing technologies for better issue resolution. Each strategy helps unlock superior QA/QM and all together they can have a transformative impact.\n\n> “...customers still prefer human interaction when it comes to complex issues or emotional engagements that require empathy.” —Manisha Powar\n\nDave Singer:\n\nThe real opportunity for quality programs lies in the scalability of AI and CX automation to achieve comprehensive coverage across all interactions, channels, and modalities. \n\nWhen combined with your company’s proven workflows, methodologies, and best practices, AI and CX automation allow you to embrace the best of what’s new without disrupting the value of your existing programs.\n\nWith the rise in Generative AI (Gen AI), for example, companies think they don’t need anything else to stand up a quality program. However, companies are rapidly discovering that while Gen AI provides insights, the question becomes: \n\n  * What do you do with these insights?\n  * How do you ensure Gen AI will deliver what you need? \n  * How do you test it? \n  * How do you calibrate it? \n  * How do you make sure it stays right? \n\n\n\nUsing Gen AI can only work “right” when it’s coupled with a company’s established quality processes and practices.\n\n## Q. Are you seeing any differences in customers’ views of quality experiences between automated and live agent channels?\n\nDave Hoekstra:\n\nThere is still some distrust in the contact center of auto-quality management, which aims to have AI evaluate every call with human-level accuracy. But as the software evolves, so will the results and with this, trust will increase.\n\nBy shifting the focus from catching the agents doing something wrong to understanding customer trends and pain points, contact centers can actually place the impact of change in the right place: which is customer satisfaction. \n\n> “There is still some distrust in the contact center of auto-quality management...” —Dave Hoekstra\n\nManisha Powar:\n\nThere is a difference in customer perception about quality when it comes to automated and live channels. A [Qualtrics XM Institute study](https://www.xminstitute.com/research/consumer-channel-preferences-2024/) on channel preferences found that consumers still prefer to connect live either over chat or over the phone with agents across a variety of scenarios. These include technical support, resolving an issue with a bill, and booking a service. \n\nWhile automation is appreciated for its efficiency in handling simple queries, customers still prefer human interaction when it comes to complex issues or emotional engagements that require empathy.\n\nDave Singer:\n\nWhen it comes to automated versus live agent channels, consumers generally prefer to interact with a live agent as they don’t believe that chatbots will give them the answers they need. \n\nWhile it’s true that contact center agents can provide a more empathetic and personalized experience, it can take longer for a company to fully realize this level of customer service and consistently provide it across representatives. \n\n> “...there's a significant opportunity to use AI-powered CX automation to grow and enhance the quality of CXs...” —Dave Singer\n\nSo, while consumers might prefer talking to a live agent, there’s a significant opportunity to use AI-powered CX automation to grow and enhance the quality of CXs through automated service channels to delight customers by providing great self-service.\n\nElizabeth Tobey:\n\nAI has advanced to the point where customers are beginning to not be able to discern whether they are speaking with a live agent or chatbot: and this is seen as a positive for both employees and consumers. This is only possible when chatbots are using purpose-built AI for CX. \n\nWhen AI is only trained on industry-specific data, not the open internet, AI-powered agents can understand and respond to needs with the same level of skill as humans: offloading repetitive tasks from agents and decreasing onerous wait times for consumers. \n\nAdditionally, chatbots are becoming more intelligent through dynamic re-skilling where employees are training AI and chatbots on how to act just like live agents. This process is also happening in reverse with AI helping train live agents to be better. This dynamic partnership is improving automated and live agent CX, making every interaction exceptional for customers.\n\n### Feedback Fatigue\n\nCustomers, it appears, are being inundated by surveys at every touchpoint and channel. Are customers suffering from “feedback fatigue” and ignoring or purposely giving incomplete, or worse yet, wrong answers? \n\nDave Hoekstra\n\nYes, customers are feeling the fatigue. Yes, customers are skimming through surveys and not giving quality feedback. Why not spend some time analyzing what they are saying when you don’t ask them? Conversational analytics tools are vastly superior ways to get feedback than surveys. \n\nManisha Powar\n\nWe have found that only a third of consumers give direct feedback every time they have a bad experience with a company. \n\nSince 2021, [the share of consumers](https://www.qualtrics.com/news/qualtrics-announces-top-consumer-experience-trends-for-2024/) providing feedback directly to the companies they buy from following a very bad experience has fallen by 7.2 percentage points. So organizations need to be smart about gathering feedback where customers are giving it, such as in call center conversations, online chat, product reviews, and social media posts, and taking action to address it. \n\nCustomers are often overwhelmed by the excessive number of survey requests they receive without seeing any tangible improvements, so it’s critical to respect their time. \n\nThis is where artificial intelligence (AI) and omnichannel analytics can be incredibly useful. Having insights into what customers are saying or doing outside surveys, like identifying feedback in call analytics, social reviews, or digital behaviors, allows organizations to hone in on more specific survey questions on topics or issues where additional insight is needed. \n\nWhy ask a question to a customer if you already know the answer?\n\nDave Singer\n\nToday’s brands want and need more data to make decisions, which is good. However, it requires companies to keep asking their customers to give them more and more feedback. Ultimately, the goal is to alleviate the survey load on customers while enabling companies to obtain more accurate answers across a broader reach.\n\nA tremendous amount of AI and analytics data is being used today for synthetic feedback scoring. This approach augments insights with customer experience (CX) data analytics tools pre-built into your contact center platform. \n\nIt gathers and analyzes customer data across every customer touchpoint and channel to reach a broader audience while promoting proactive listening and providing real-time actionable insights. \n\nThis proactive approach empowers companies to stay ahead of customer needs and preferences. In addition, feedback analytics train on your AI models for continuous improvement. Not only does this help reduce the amount of customer survey feedback requests, it also automatically performs “lower-level feedback” so companies can keep manual surveys short and to the point to avoid feedback fatigue.\n\n## Q. What are your recommendations for contact centers to ensure high quality QA/QM?\n\nDave Hoekstra:\n\n**1. Listen to your agents.** No one knows their process better than them and incorporate their feedback into the process. If they are frustrated, they will tell you...if you ask. \n\n**2. Make sure your QM form is aligned with the customer experience, not with the agent experience.** If your form says to say the customer’s name three times, the customer is probably annoyed with that. \n\n**3. Develop a “one question” QM process.** What is the one question that needs to be answered for a quality interaction? For example, “Does the customer have to call us back to solve this issue?” is a great starter question and build from there!\n\nManisha Powar:\n\nIt’s essential to involve agents in the QA/QM process so they understand its value, integrate AI and automation for efficiency, invest in regular training programs, and leverage analytics for smart decision making. \n\nContact center leaders need to collect peer feedback and celebrate agents who demonstrate the company values. Ultimately, a focus on both employee satisfaction and CX leads to high-quality QA/QM.\n\nDave Singer:\n\nFor contact centers to ensure superior QA and QM programs, my recommendations are three-fold:\n\n  1. Infuse AI and automation into quality programs to improve the scale of coverage.\n  2. Keep the best practices and methodologies from existing QM programs to ensure a closed-loop process and the right level of escalations and workflows that companies need to stay compliant.\n  3. Utilize AI and automation technologies to coach agents in real-time to drive better outcomes and improve quality by allowing organizations to scale their coaching quickly and easily.\n\n\n\nElizabeth Tobey:\n\nOrganizations looking to improve their QA should invest in purpose-built AI for CX and an interaction-centric platform. \n\nGeneric AI that is trained on the open internet will not transform QA: it does not have the knowledge and the data required to meet the levels required to provide real value. Purpose-built AI for CX, trained on industry-specific data and delivered through a trusted AI vendor, will yield accurate and in-the-moment QA that businesses can trust.\n\nIn addition, when organizations leverage an interaction-centric cloud platform, this provides a rich training ground for AI to learn and deliver more intelligent outputs. An interaction-centric platform, combined with purpose-built AI, improves every aspect of CX operations including knowledge management, workforce management, and employee and customer experience.\n\n[Subscribers Download Article [PDF]](/login)\n\n![Brendan Read](/Portals/0/EasyDNNNews/ProfileImages/839905/85120c494EDNthumbread-brendan-background-flat.jpg)\n\n### Brendan Read\n\nBrendan Read is Editor-in-Chief of [Contact Center Pipeline](https://www.contactcenterpipeline.com/).
