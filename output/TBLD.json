Distributions on common shares are generally paid from net investment income (regular interest and dividends) and may also include capital gains and/or a return of capital. The Trust’s distribution payable on December 20, 2024, does not include a return of capital or a long-term capital gain, but does include a short-term capital gain of $0.01497. The specific tax characteristics of the distributions will be reported to the Trust’s common shareholders on Form 1099 after the end of the 2024 calendar year. The final determination for all distributions paid in 2024 will be made in early 2025 and reported to you on Form 1099-DIV. You should not use this notice as a substitute for your 1099-DIV.\n\nThe Trust’s fiscal year (10/01/2024 through 09/30/2025) cumulative distributions are shown below:\n\n![](https://s40910.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Table-2-12-2-24-900x485.png.webp)\n\nShareholders should not assume that the source of a distribution from the Trust is net income or profit. A distribution comprised in whole or in part by a return of capital does not necessarily reflect the Trust’s investment performance and should not be confused with “yield” or “income.” Future distributions may consist of a return of capital. For further information regarding the Trust’s distributions, please visit www.thornburg.com/tbld-distributions.\n\nThe Trust’s investment objective is to provide current income and additional total return. The Trust seeks to achieve its objective by investing, directly or indirectly, at least 80% of its managed assets in a broad range of income-producing securities. The Trust invests in both equity and debt securities of companies located in the United States and around the globe. The Trust may invest in non-U.S. domiciled companies, including up to 20% of its managed assets at the time of investment in equity and debt securities of emerging market companies.\n\nAs a registered investment company, the Trust is subject to a 4% excise tax that is imposed if the Trust does not distribute to common shareholders by the end of any calendar year at least the sum of (i) 98% of its ordinary income (not taking into account any capital gain or loss) for the calendar year and (ii) 98.2% of its capital gain in excess of its capital loss (adjusted for certain ordinary losses) for a one-year period generally ending on October 31 of the calendar year (unless an election is made to use the Trust’s fiscal year). In certain circumstances, the Trust may elect to retain income or capital gain to the extent that the Board of Trustees, in consultation with Trust management, determines it to be in the interest of shareholders to do so.\n\nThe common share distributions paid by the Trust for any particular period may be more than the amount of net investment income from that period. As a result, all or a portion of a distribution may be a return of capital, which is in effect a partial return of the amount a common shareholder invested in the Trust, up to the amount of the common shareholder’s tax basis in their common shares, which would reduce such tax basis. Although a return of capital may not be taxable, it will generally increase the common shareholder’s potential gain, or reduce the common shareholder’s potential loss, on any subsequent sale or other disposition of common shares.\n\n**About Thornburg**\n\nThornburg Investment Management (Thornburg) is a global investment firm delivering on strategy for institutions, financial professionals and investors worldwide.

My name is Adam Sparkman and I am a client portfolio manager with Thornburg Investment Management. A few housekeeping items before we get started. At this time, all participants are in a listen only mode. However, you can ask questions at any time by submitting them through WebEx or emailing us at questions@thornburg.com\n\nThis webcast is being recorded and a replay will be available in a few days. You can access today’s presentation slides by going to [www.thornburg.com/TIBIX-quarrterly](http://www.thornburg.com/TIBIX-quarrterly), that’s Just to remind you, today’s presentation may contain forward looking statements based on management’s current expectations and are subject to uncertainty and changes in circumstances.\n\nActual results may differ materially from these statements due to a variety of factors, including those described in our SEC filings. For those in the call today who may be less familiar with Thornburg, we are an investment manager based in Santa Fe, New Mexico, overseeing approximately $47 billion of assets across a suite of actively managed equity, fixed income and multi-asset solutions.\n\nI’d like to quickly introduce our speakers today. Brian McMahon, portfolio manager, vice chairman and chief investment strategist for Thornburg, along with portfolio managers Matt Burdett and Christian Hoffmann, our head of equities and fixed income. So, with that, let me turn it over to Brian McMahon, who will kick us off.\n\n**Brian McMahon**\n\nOkay. Thank you, Adam. And thanks to everyone on this call today.\n\nLet’s dive in with the slides to guide the discussion. We have slides at [www.thornburg.com](http://www.thornburg.com). If you haven’t tuned into those yet and I’ll just start with slide number two, which is titled Key Macroeconomic Issues as of October of 2024. And I’ll just start at the end and work backwards. Optimism prevails in financial markets. Equity prices have increased over the last seven quarters, and analysts expect the S&P 500 index earnings to grow 9% this year, calendar 2024 and another 13 plus percent next year.\n\nAnd most non-U.S. equity portfolio’s market portfolios are also expected to grow earnings above average both this year and next year. And in the bond market. We’ve seen spreads, credit spreads come in pretty sharply over the last year, which is indicative, I think, by bond market participants of decreasing fear of any recession materializing this year. And the bond market usually sniffs that out pretty, pretty early.\n\nThe U.S. Fed funds rate has dropped 50 basis points since our last call. So now at 483, down from 5003. And that’s on the back of inflationary pressures that have moderated. So U.S. core PC was two points, 7% in August and pretty similar to that run rate today. I’ll go to the next slide. Slide number three. Just a reminder that Thornburg Investment Income Builder is a solution that seeks to provide attractive income today and our trailing 12-month dividend is a dollar 20.\n\nThe Navy last night 2686. That is a yield of 4.46 which is attractive today continues to be at a premium to the ten year U.S. Treasury yield. As far as growing the dividend over time, we would expect that to lead to long term capital appreciation, which it has. I’ll just remind you that over the very long term, our dividend has grown from $0.53 a share in 2023 to a dollar 21 rate at the moment, and our net asset value has gone from $11.90 at inception to $26.65, so up 164%.\n\nMatt, we’ll get into some some more specific numbers on that. We do this with a investable universe of dividend paying stocks from around the globe and also bonds and hybrid securities. And we continue to be focused on the ability and willingness of the firms that we own to do pay dividends. Good dividends today and hopefully growing over time.\n\nSlide number four. The next slide gives an overview of our equity portfolio allocation shifts. And if you look at the second column from the right in this table, you’ll see the weightings as of September 30, 2024. And the far right column is the difference in allocation to specific sectors over the last year, we’ve highlighted four of these segments, specifically communications services, where we increase the allocation by 6.6% over the trailing 12 months and a little over half of that is due to adding AT&T on weakness around this time last year.\n\nWe also have increased industrials a bit, but that still is a relatively small way and we’ve paid for that fund for those two increases, primarily by cutting the allocations to energy segment and materials segment, as has shown there in that table. The next slide number five is portfolio characteristics. These haven’t really changed a great deal over the last quarter and frankly, over the last year.\n\nMaybe one thing that I’ll point out you’ll see are our trailing one year PE 14.3 times. That’s relatively in line with the longer term averages a bit higher than it was a year ago. At this time, the gap between the trailing one year PE and the forward one year PE estimate would indicate and expectation and these are consensus analysts, consensus estimates, but that would indicate an expectation for very strong earnings growth on a dollar weighted basis for our portfolio securities over the next year.\n\nI’m not sure that will get that. But if we get some reasonable proportion of that, that should be supportive of the valuations that we have today on top of our dividend. I’ll just point out that the PE, the forward one year estimate this time last year was 9.9 times. So we’ve had a little bit of appreciation in the portfolio, but I think we should probably be able to get more The NAV at the end of Q3 23 was 2245, so it’s up $4.20. So that’s 18% over that the period.\n\nThe next two slides have our top ten equity holdings as of September 30. And then the second 10-11 to 20 equity holdings. And maybe just a couple of remarks about that. If you look at those top 20 holdings, seven of them actually had negative share price developments in calendar 2023, and six of these have been six of the seven have been positive this year in 2024.\n\nAnd if you look at Slide six, you’ll see on the on this slide, AT&T and then end group respectively were both down last year. That’s the middle column on the page and there are 31% and 26% year to date respectively. That’s the share price increase. So that’s the kind of thing that we like to take advantage of.\n\nWe’ve we obviously added our capital to both of those names when the prices were down. And if I look at our top 24 of them are negative year to date this year, three of them were pretty positive last year and we’ve added capital to three of those names so far this year. So that takes care of slides number six and seven.\n\nWhich brings us to slides 8 to 17, which gives you some detail on each of our top ten holdings. And I won’t go through I won’t go through all of these, but I will talk about a couple of them and specifically, and I’ll start with the first one, which is Orange, which is our largest holding, and orange is a bit of a plodder, as it says in the shaded box.\n\nThey are a multinational telecom services provider, 246 mobile customers as of June 30 and 21 million terrestrial broadband customers in 26 countries. That mobile customer accounts up 3% for mobile handsets over the trailing year, and the broadband customer base is up 4% over the trailing year. You’ll also see that the dividend yields 7.4%. They grew their dividend by 3% in calendar 2024 and we expect about 4% next year.\n\nAnd that’s based on public disclosure by Orange is management. The other thing that I’ll mention is if you look up on the first text sentence, you see that the market cap is €26.8 billion. We expect free cash flow after CapEx this year to be €3.8 billion and 4 billion next year euros. So that that cash flow yield on 26.8 is very interesting.\n\nNow kind of working its way up into the mid-teens, which is supportive of that ability to pay. And frankly, we’d like to see even more willingness to pay rising dividend in the in the future. But hopefully that gives you some color on what we see in that investment to support the mission of the one big investment income builder.\n\nThe next one that I’ll talk about is Broadcom. And this has obviously been a very, very strong performer for the income builder, as indicated by the fact that it was up 99.6% last year, the share price and up another 54% in the first nine months of this year. The dividend is now 1.2%. But that’s not our yield.\n\nWe bought Broadcom some years ago when it was considerably weaker. And so our yield on the capital that we had invested is is closer to 5% on up on Broadcom. And the other thing that I’ll point out, by the way, their business is doing just fine, as noted in the text, their consensus revenue and earnings estimates for this fiscal year have increased quite a bit, in part due to acquisitions.\n\nBut Broadcom at September 30, 2023, a year ago, was our fourth largest holding. Now it’s our second largest holding and that’s despite the fact that we sold down about 19% of the shares that we owned a year ago and have been able to redeploy that capital into into other high yield investments. So I think these two names are kind of indicative of of the mix that we’re looking for in the income builder portfolio, some maybe more exciting and some less exciting investments in the in the portfolio.\n\nAnd I won’t go through that all ten of these stocks, but now I’ll stick to or skip to slide number 18, which shows the potential to grow the dividend distribution over time. One of the important things that we depend on is that most of our equities grow their dividends over time, and last year 73% of our equity portfolio by weight grew their dividends.\n\nIt should be equal to that or maybe higher this year. So we’ll we’ll see how that goes. We just got some good news today, literally from one of our top 20 holdings, which is Deutsche Telekom, which announced an increase in its dividend of 17% for 2025. So they won’t all increase like that, but that’s off to a good start and much stronger than it has been in recent years.\n\nAnd with that, I’ll turn over to Matt.\n\n**Matt Burdett**\n\nGreat. Thanks, Brian. Hello, everyone. Thanks for joining us. I’ll start on slide 19. So given the debate around where Fed funds is going to go, we thought it’d be interesting to just kind of highlight the performance of the investment income builder versus our blended benchmark and the MSCI World global portfolio at different levels of Fed funds rate.\n\nAnd so what you can see in the table here is we’re showing environments where the Fed funds rate is 3% or higher. There were 19 quarters where that was the case and the investment income builder’s performance versus the blended benchmark was over 400 basis points. Annualized outperformance and 85%, 85 basis points annualized over the MSCI world.\n\nAnd if you look at the one two, 3% range where there was 24 quarters of frequency, those respective outperformance annualized were 95 basis points and 75 basis points. And then when you’re in an environment of less than 1%, which is 44 quarters, so it’s about half of the life of the Investment Income Builder, We managed to eke out a 78 basis points annualized performance versus the blended bench, but an underperformance of 136 basis points versus the MSCI World.\n\nNow if you go back to December 31st, 1982 to today, the average Fed funds rate was 3.75. Right. And a high of 11.6 and a low of course of zero. So if you if you think about an average of 3.75 and we can debate what it will be. But the point is, in an environment, money is not free and somewhat reckless investments can be made because the cost of capital is so low.\n\nI think in a more normal environment we have we have performed much better. So we’ll see. We’ll see what comes with the rates market. But this is here just as a reference for everyone. Moving on to Slide 20, just to run through some selected performance of various portfolios around the world, everyone is pretty familiar with all of these markets.\n\nSo for the year to date, 2024 through September 30, the leader here is the Russell 3000 growth with about a 24% return. The S&P 500 has returned 22% year to date, and of that return, 50%, 50.5%. Contribution to that return is from the top ten stocks in the S&P 500. Our ten stocks were responsible for 50% of that return.\n\nNow, that’s different from the last quarter when we talked about this, where it was almost 70% of the return came from ten stocks. So you are seeing a bit of broadening there. But still, we would argue a fairly concentrated return in the S&P 500. And you can see the other returns there generally speaking, pretty good returns all across the board there.\n\nTurning to Slide 21, looking at the Investment Income Builder performance here, you can see all the numbers there on the tables. I guess what I would highlight is, is the since inception return of the iShares has been 9.5% per annum for about 21 years and the other one I would highlight is the one year return of 25% for the Investment Income Builder, which is pretty respectable given we own 0% of the Magnificent eight stocks.\n\nRight? Because they’re not they’re not income producers. It wouldn’t be appropriate for us to want to buy those stocks. But we’ve managed to find ideas in other places, some of which Brian highlighted to help drive returns that still meet kind of our income mission. Moving to Slide 22, this is just showing you the quarterly returns time and we have completed the 87, 87 quarters of which 64.\n\nWe delivered a positive return. So, a 74% frequency of positive returns on a quarterly basis over time. So, 23 I think this is an important slide. We like to highlight this because it shows the, you know, our philosophy of having a dynamic asset allocation. I think it’s a pretty simple picture, but really it’s the it tells us tells you the philosophy that we have of, you know, we’re not afraid to be different for the right reasons.\n\nRight. And what this slide is showing you in the dark, dark blue line, that is the fixed income and cash allocate and the Investment Income Builder and the two dashed lines are yield to worst blue being US high yield and orange being European High yield. And the picture shows look, we buy bonds when the yields are high and we don’t buy bonds when they yields are low.\n\nRight. Because we’re looking for the best risk adjusted returns we can to provide to help us meet the income mission here. Advancing to slide 24, this is just showing the quarterly distributions. Brian touched on this a little bit earlier. Basically for the quarter and for the trailing 12 month period, the dividends are essentially flat. We’re working hard to grow our dividends over time, but as of as of the third quarter, we’re kind of tracking flat year on year.\n\nSlide 25 highlights the yield of the Investment Income Builder in the in the gray bars and compares it to our blended index in the blue line versus the U.S. corporate bond index in orange and then CPI in the black, the black line. The simple take home here is throughout the 20 plus year period, the yield has always been north of 4%, well ahead of our blended and also ahead of CPI. Other than in 2022 when we had the surge in CPI come in, coming out of the pandemic.\n\nNow on to Slide 26, this is the first report card slide that will I’ll run through here. Many of you, if you’ve listened to this call before, you’ve seen this. So we just updated every quarter. And this first instance, this is a hypothetical $100,000 investment.\n\nThis person has used the Investment Income Builder for cash needs. So they bought it at the inception back it at the end of 2002. And over that period of time, they collected the income. They received a $181,706 of dividends over that time off of their initial $100,000 investment. While the capital appreciated to $238,510. Right? And the trailing 12 month dividend was $10,150.\n\nSo if you’re to do a yield on original cost, which Brian hinted at with the Broadcom example, you of course have a north of 10% yield on your original cost for this for this person who basically, you know, grew their capital base and collected almost two X the initial capital they put in in dividends.\n\nSlide 27 is the same hypothetical investment over the same timeframe, except this is a, you know, perhaps one of your clients who doesn’t need the money and would rather build for wealth here. So they’ve reinvested all of the dividends over time. And the results of doing that are that the total cumulative dividends received are $328,200, which means your shares original shares of 8375 have tripled to 25,256 shares. And over that time the capital appreciated to $345,386. So it’s pretty powerful here you can see letting the dividends do the work for you.\n\nAnd now let’s assume that this person decides, you know what, I want to turn on the income now. So they have their two over 25,000 shares. You multiply that by the dollar 20 dividend that was mentioned earlier on a daily basis. And you’ve got over $30,000, $30,408 or a yield on original cost of 30%. There are not a whole lot of investments out there that do this kind of magic, really.\n\nAnd it’s really just being patient, investing in companies that have that ability and willingness to pay dividends over time. And it ends up generating, you know, what we think is a pretty a pretty compelling return. And the total account value at the end of this period is $673,586. So, so pretty, pretty useful.\n\nSlide 28 Last slide for me, just a reminder to everyone about dividends and the fact that they do matter, although there are periods in time when it feels like they don’t.\n\nSo this table here is showing you the S&P 500 going all the way back to 1871. And what we’ve done here is we’ve segmented out by decade the average price appreciation, the average income component, the sum of the twos, the total return. And then in the far right column, it’s income as a percentage of total return. Right. And what you see two big takeaways or one on average over this long time series, dividends are about half of your total return, right?\n\nSo about half of it. However, as can be seen in the far right column, that percentage varies wildly over different periods. And for example, in the build up of in the dot com era, 1991 to 2000, you had a average price appreciation of almost 15% per annum with a total return of 17 and a half percent per annum, and dividends were only less than 15% of that total return over time.\n\nRight. But the following decade, the price return was on average -50 basis points per annum. Right. And dividends ended up being 136% of your return. So the point here is don’t forget about how dividends can matter to your total return. And the question people should be asking themselves is where are my total returns going to come from? Now?\n\nRight in the future? We’ve started off, you know, the next decade and in the current decade that we’re in with pretty strong price returns of 11.6% for the for what I call the great QE era decade and then 12% for the decade that we’re currently in. So as a reminder, 50% of your return, at least in the S&P 500, has been from dividends.\n\nAnd we think that they matter going forward. So with that, I’ll pass it off to Adam.\n\n**Adam Sparkman**\n\nAll right. Well, thanks, Matt and Brian for the great color on the quarter. We’ve got some time for Q&A here and there. Several questions that have come in from the audience. Feel free to continue posting if you have something you’d like us to hit on in particular, but I think we’ll kick off first with a question about the fixed income portion of the portfolio.\n\nSo I’ll throw this to Christian. Christian. The question is, with the bond portion of the portfolio currently having a duration of roughly four years and a yield to worse of about 8%, and as Bryan highlighted, equities getting a bit more expensive over the past year, although this portfolio remains, we think, very attractively priced now that we are in the cutting phase of the cycle. What are your thoughts on adding duration to the fixed income sleeve?\n\n**Christian Hoffmann**\n\nThanks, Adam. Certainly we’re not opposed to adding duration and certainly a more compelling idea relative to the decade plus where we lived in a zero interest rate world. But for folks newer to the portfolio, I think it is worth pointing out that while this is multi asset and has stocks and bonds, it’s certainly not the S&P 500 plus the AG or, you know, a very boring portfolio of, you know, interest rate sensitive bonds.\n\nYou know, as we’ve said many times, the equities tend to be more bond like and B, the bonds tend to be more equity like that is a bit more higher octane, total return focused. So with that in mind, I’d also highlight the fact that high yield spreads today are to 90, which is incredibly low. I think the last 24 months maybe we hit to 80, but in bad times you blew out to 500, 600,000 spread.\n\nSo the upside downside, taking credit risk right now is pretty finely tuned where you have just very little room for error and very, very little room for outperformance besides just clipping your coupon. So it’s something we can consider. But again, we’re not looking to take a ton of credit risk and certainly not a two kind of credit risk with duration attached to it.\n\nBut those are all those are all things on the table.\n\n**Adam Sparkman**\n\nAll right, Thanks, Christian. Brian, we’ve got a I think a good question here about the dividend growth of the portfolio. Somebody pointed out from our our top 20 slides the question is four of the top 25 companies in the portfolio have negative five year local currency dividend growth rates with another two at less than 1% growth including orange, our top holding in the portfolio sorry, I’m trying to make sure I can read it here.\n\nAre you seeking a certain dividend growth rate within the portfolio over the five years? And despite the negative or low growth rates of some of these holdings, are these companies being held more for capital appreciation opportunities or is there something that you see as a catalyst to growth in a lot of these names over the next five years?\n\n**Brian McMahon**\n\nYeah. Okay. That’s a good question. And thank you for being sharp eyed and reading that and frankly, for asking the question as well. It’s true that that four of the top 20 do have a negative trailing five year dividend growth. Two of them are telcos that have had significant spin offs and significant reductions that in our mind improve the overall business.\n\nSo if you look at AT&T, which everybody knows about, they spun off Warner and they spun off DirectTV, which improves the overall business. And basically they’re investing now in connectivity and specifically upgrading their fiber footprint. So while they while they do show negative trailing five year dividend growth as a result of spinning off those significant businesses, we do think that their focus on connectivity going forward and reducing debt, which they’ve gotten almost all the way to their debt target of two and a half times net debt to Avatar and they the debt that they that they will retain has an average maturity of about 16 years and weighted average cost of a little under 4%. So we don’t even want them to pay that back. We’d just like them to shrink their share base and start to grow the dividend again. So we’re forward looking and forward looking with with Vodafone. But and the other one that’s in that group and Dessa, which is a Iberian electric utility, paid a big special dividend back in 2019.\n\nAnd so while they have been growing their ordinary dividend, if we just if we do a simple numbers look back to 2019, they paid a special dividend there and then maybe we’ll get another special dividend that will come up every five or six years because their business is going pretty well. The last one that had a negative five year dividend growth is Glencore, which also paid a special dividend.\n\nThat’s a diversified miner. And mining business is kind of notoriously volatile. But we do want to have a bit of a claim on some on the economics of some metals and particularly copper, but also some commodities trading that Glencore has been pretty good at. So I think the exciting and the last comments that you specifically mentioned or aren’t, we think they’re going to do a lot better than 2.6% for a year.\n\nI mentioned that next year we’re expecting a dividend to be up 4%. But importantly, what around did the last five years and really longer than the last five years was to to put fiber of optical fiber footprint to cover approximately 80% of the residences in France, which is their largest single country, but also have put down a lot of optical fiber in Spain and in Poland.\n\nAnd they’re pretty much done with that at this point. And so now instead of spending a lot of capital out of your operating earnings and operating cash flow, they’re going to get to harvest some of that seed that they put in the ground. And so we expect on a revenue base of about €40 billion, we expect the CapEx as a percent of revenue to come down by two, three, maybe 4%, maybe even 5% over the next five years.\n\nAnd each of those percents is €400 million. And if you look at that cash flow statistic that I put on the or on slide, you can see 3.8 billion cash flow after CapEx that we expect this year. And if you start adding 400 million to that as a percent of CapEx to revenue coming down, that gives the potential for some very interesting dividend increases.\n\nLooking forward as they kind of harvest the business potential of fiber that should last for decades should have useful life of a half decade. So I hope that explains kind of how we’re looking at things. It’s more than just a doing a thought on numbers we do pay attention to the underlying condition of the business in a number of paying customers they have and how management and the boards of these businesses are allocating capital and how they plan to allocate it and how much is left over for us as shareholders and for our customers.\n\nSo I hope that answers the question.\n\n**Adam Sparkman**\n\nYeah, that’s great, Brian. Thanks for all the detail there. We have another question here highlighting the Morning Star report for Income Builder. Maybe Matt or I’ll kick this one off to you two to take. You know, we had a bit of turnover here recently, a promotion for you to head of equities as well as Christian who’s taken on more responsibility being promoted to head of fixed income changes that we’re excited about with the team.\n\nBut with that we have had a little bit of manager turnover as well. Can you just talk about kind of the status of the team right now, how you guys feel, any changes in lieu of what’s happened over the past few months?\n\n**Matt Burdett**\n\nYeah. I’ll start and then others can chime in. Yeah, but firstly with respect to, to kind of the Morningstar report, I guess I guess I would say, you know, we’re, we’re in the world allocation category, sorry.\n\nAnd I think the analysts there has often viewed, you know, the Investment Income Builder is a bit more on the riskier spectrum because of the high equity allocation. And you know, it’s a fair a fair argument to make when you’re looking at comparing it, you know, income builder to a bunch of 60, 40 portfolios. Right. We have a we have an income mandate.\n\nRight. Which is not what that allocation, that category is. So I think that’s the main driver of why the I think that report is phrased the way it’s phrased now with respect to the turnover. Yes, we’ve had some recent turnover. I would I would say that, you know, there were no stocks that had to be transferred for coverage as a result of that turnover because, you know, those there weren’t any stocks covered by the departing person from Thornburg on the strategy.\n\nSo you know look we have we have a great team here. We have a great culture. We have a mission that we really believe in of providing thoughtful, active management. As I mentioned in my comments, you know, being different can be can feel bad sometimes. But when you’re being different for the right reasons to meet the mission of your goal, then then, you know, we’re doing we’re doing the right thing and that’s how we operate.\n\nSo overall, you know, I think the team, we have had some turnover over the years that happens in this industry. And you know, look, not all turnover is bad, right? And I think the results that we’ve been delivering not only in the investment income builder but other strategies, kind of highlights that, you know, we’ve got a pretty deep and broad bench here, so I’ll stop there.\n\n**Adam Sparkman**\n\nAll right. Thanks. Thanks for that Matt.\n\n**Brian McMahon**\n\nI haven’t turned over.\n\n**Adam Sparkman**\n\nYeah. Brian?\n\n**Brian McMahon**\n\nYeah, Brian is still here since we since we started planning the first prospectus for this fund. So. And I’m still here and I can,\n\nI can advocate that Brian is in the office pretty much all day and open, and we’re excited about the future moving forward.\n\n**Adam Sparkman**\n\nChristian, maybe to come back to you with the question on the fixed income side. We got a CPI reading just today. How much do you think that the Fed should be looking to cut from here kind of given the the most recent data print?\n\n**Christian Hoffmann**\n\nThanks. Item four For an institution that has spent so much time talking about data dependency, you know, they’ve really built a shrine to data dependency and probably the two most important figures that we’re going to have, you know, the jobs number and the CPI this morning, both to me really call into question if we should cut it all at the next meeting.\n\nWe got the Fed minutes yesterday, You know, when we had the decision to cut 50, we had one one dissenter by a governor. It’s been fairly impressive and it in the modern era. But to me, that suggested that there was probably a lot of debate between 25 and 50 that was confirmed in the minutes that we saw yesterday.\n\nAgain, historically, this has been an institution that really liked to build consensus. But there was a lot of folks who I think would have been more comfortable with 25. That was evident in the minutes. So you had perhaps a big move that was in maybe in part a consideration that, you know, maybe should have done 25 previous meetings.\n\nWe could have done 25 today. But let’s continue to monitor the data. The data continues to come out high. There’s been a lot of talk about an hour more focused on the labor market, you know, as opposed to inflation. But the labor market still feels pretty good and inflation does not feel nearly as good as I think we want it to be. The other tricky thing here, besides a big election coming down the pike, is that we have we have hurricanes, we have strikes, we have a lot of things that’s going to make upcoming data because we still have about a month between now and the next, the Fed decision. So the data is going to get sloppier from here.\n\nAnd the data that we probably want to use to make the decision is not really going our way. So we went from a debate in the market between 25 and 50 basis points at the next meeting to some uncertainty. Overall, I think markets are pricing in roughly an 85% chance of a 25% cut at this next meeting. To me, that’s actually too high.\n\nI think it’s probably a coin flip at best, especially considering the data is going to get money from here. So I think, you know, we’ll see that. We’ll see that play out in. It’s actually reminds me of the previous question about, you know, why don’t we have more duration? Interest rates continue to be incredibly volatile. That’s actually paired with a complete lack of volatility in credit spreads or taking risk in credit.\n\nThere’s a slide we’ve been working on which I think is going to come out in our next observations in fixed income, which showed that relationship over time. So you flip from a low interest rate environment with, you know, volatile credit to a low credit volatility environment with, you know, tons of interest rate volatility. So as we also think about, you know, adding duration to the portfolio, you know, that is adding a lot of volatility in the current environment.\n\nAnd while total return and growing the and sustaining the dividend, you know, are of chief importance, we’re also focused on the ride, right? So, you know, whenever you add volatility to a portfolio, there’s an implicit cost in that. So that is another consideration actually, you know, ties in with the previous question that I wanted to touch on.\n\n**Adam Sparkman**\n\nThanks, Christian. Brian, maybe one more here for you. Now that we have entered the easing phase of the rate cycle and we’ll see where we go from here, but are there any particular segments of the market, maybe sectors or industries that the team is finding more or less compelling?\n\n**Brian McMahon**\n\nWell, I think if you look back at the slide that we had on sector allocation, what you see is communication services.\n\nWe had a big increase and that wasn’t specifically because of the Fed at all. It was because of something that I spoke to earlier, which is the amount of capital spending that all of these communication services companies have been doing to put in 5G wireless networks to acquire spectrum, which is kind of digital real estate and to put in fiber optic cable.\n\nAnd that’s been going on for the last decade or more. And what we have now is kind of an upcoming harvest period that we expect to have lower, lower Fed funds and lower money market yields should frankly be make all dividend paying stocks look more attractive. But maybe some of the higher dividend paying stocks, the ones with yields above three or 4%, might look especially attractive if it’s harder to get a positive real yield on your cash.\n\nSo we’re going to we’re going to make our sector allocations based on yeah, we want a diversified portfolio. But we just keep going back to ability to pay a willingness to pay a good dividend today and a growing dividend. A Hopefully tomorrow more than trying to out guess the Fed or interest rates, but, but lower rates should maybe be good for higher multiples on the stocks that we own over time.\n\nAnd we’d be happy to see that the trading multiples on the stocks we own go up and and get a little more in NAV appreciation. So I hope for that.\n\n**Adam Sparkman**\n\nAll right. Thanks, Brian. I think we’ve got time for one more question before we wrap up. Matt I’ll come to you on this one. The recent stimulus measures have driven Chinese stocks higher.\n\nIt’s been a pretty volatile market. I think there’s still remains a lot of uncertainty regarding the Chinese economy overall. China is obviously a major trading partner for Europe in particular. How do you think about a slowdown in China and any potential impact on this portfolio?\n\n**Matt Burdett**\n\nYeah, no, it’s a good question. Look, China has been slowing and has been slow for some time really coming out of the pandemic was a bit of a dud in terms of economic momentum.\n\nAnd certainly the animal spirits in China are pretty caged up right now. So you’ve seen in the last few weeks or month or so, you know, some communication around trying to get those animal spirits out right. And so there’s been various stimulus measures. So Chinese stocks have moved a lot. I think, from a global perspective, you know, what really matters is to get is to get the economy moving, because that would benefit a lot of the multinational companies, some of which we own, but also just a demand driver.\n\nRight. This is a huge you know, it’s the second largest economy in the world, huge commodity demand from China. So it could have big implications across inflation, commodity prices and just overall growth. So there will be a meeting this Saturday. I believe it’s the Ministry of Finance is going to come out with some policies. So that will be closely watched.\n\nYou know, look, like Brian mentioned, we’re not making these macro calls. We’re aware of all these moving pieces. And it’s really more, you know, we we use those moving pieces to help us form the mosaic around individual businesses that have the ability and willingness to pay dividends. Right. And we want to be able to buy those businesses with a comfortable margin of safety and a credible path to success where we have outperformance in the stock.\n\nSo as one variable, the whole China dynamic, but we’ll be watching that. And, you know, look, I hope they’re successful in having some program that brings that brings consumption back and just overall demand higher because that will benefit really the world.\n\n**Adam Sparkman**\n\nAll right. Well, thanks, Matt, and appreciate Brian and Christian, you being here as well. We’ll wrap it up here, but I’d like to thank everybody for joining us on the call today.\n\nWe appreciate the great questions and making it an interactive discussion. As always, please feel free to reach out with that out to us with any follow up questions. We’re happy to make ourselves available. Hop on the phone and continue the conversation about the portfolio. Thank you.\n\nHear the portfolio managers of Thornburg Investment Income Builder Fund share their thoughts about income opportunities during a review of past performance, current positioning, and market outlook.\n\n## **Important Information**\n\nInvestments carry risks, including possible loss of principal.

Portfolios investing in bonds have the same interest rate, inflation, and credit risks that are associated with the underlying bonds. The value of bonds will fluctuate relative to changes in interest rates, decreasing when interest rates rise.

Central bank balance sheets, which have ballooned over the last 15 years, and a long period of near-zero interest rates, have created distortions in asset prices. With a return to more traditional interest rate levels, investors need to adapt to this new paradigm.\n\n### Higher Rates Favors Companies That Are Better Stewards of Capital\n\nOne key opportunity in this environment is dividend-paying stocks. Historically, dividend-paying strategies have not only delivered higher total returns but have also done so with less volatility. For example, over the past 50 years, dividend-paying stocks have returned an average of 9.12% annually, compared to just 4.19% for non-dividend-paying stocks. This demonstrates the long-term benefits of dividends as a cornerstone of total return.\n\n### Companies That Can Grow Their Dividend Have Historically Outperformed\n\n## Dividends as an Inflation Hedge\n\nIn addition to providing income, dividends have historically acted as an inflation hedge. Since the 1940s, dividend growth has typically outpaced inflation, providing investors with inflation-protected income. This is especially relevant today as investors seek protection from the recent surge in inflation.\n\n### Dividends are an Effective Hedge Against Inflation\n\n## The Yield vs. Growth Dynamic\n\nWhen assessing dividend-paying stocks, it’s important to differentiate between yield and dividend growth. While the current dividend yield on the market may be lower than in previous periods, dividends per share have continued to grow rapidly. This means that even if yields appear lower, the actual income investors receive can increase significantly over time, creating a powerful compounding effect.\n\nMoreover, dividend-paying stocks are currently trading at attractive valuation levels, particularly in comparison to growth stocks. Historically, dividend stocks have traded at a 10-20% discount to growth stocks due to their lower growth expectations. However, today that discount has widened to 52%, suggesting significant potential for dividend stocks to appreciate relative to growth stocks.\n\n### Income-Generating Equities Present Attractive Value\n\nSource: Bloomberg as of 30 June 2024.\n\n## The Global Dividend Opportunity\n\nLooking beyond the U.S., international markets present additional opportunities for dividend investors. The U.S. market has one of the lowest dividend yields in the world at just 1.5%, compared to higher yields in regions like Europe, the UK, and Australia. Diversifying globally allows investors to access higher yields and greater diversification, which can enhance the overall resilience of a portfolio.\n\n### Non-U.S. Equity Markets Have Better Opportunities for Income\n\n![Global Dividend Yields by country](https://s40910.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/TH3720_global-div-yield-900x501.png.webp)Global Dividend Yields by country\n\nFurthermore, the past 15 years have seen international markets underperform compared to U.S. markets, largely due to unusual monetary policy. As we transition to a more normalized policy environment, international markets may outperform in the coming years, making them an attractive area for dividend-focused investors.\n\n## The Role of Dividends in Total Return\n\nDividends have historically played a significant role in total return, accounting for nearly 50% of total returns over longer time periods. While the past decade has seen dividends contribute a smaller portion of total return, their long-term significance remains unchanged. For investors seeking a balanced approach to income and capital appreciation, dividends are a crucial component of portfolio strategy.\n\n### Historically, Dividends Have Been Essential to Total Return\n\nIn today’s uncertain environment, dividend-paying strategies offer a compelling combination of income, inflation protection, and long-term growth potential. Investors would be well-served to revisit the role of dividends in their portfolios as they seek to build resilience and capitalize on opportunities in the evolving market landscape.\n\n## **Important Information**\n\nThe views expressed are subject to change and do not necessarily reflect the views of Thornburg Investment Management, Inc.

TBLD seeks to deliver income now from diversified income sources.\n\nThornburg Client Portfolio Manager Adam Sparkman sat down to discuss the Thornburg Income Builder Opportunities Trust (TBLD). In the conversation, Adam highlighted the following:\n\n  * The Fed rate cycle and what that means for closed-end funds.\n  * How the portfolio is currently positioned vs. actual NAV on a price basis\n  * The portfolio’s call writing opportunities and how it positively contributed to performance during the quarter\n  * TBLD historically has offered an attractive level of income with potential capital appreciation. The fund discount may offer an additional opportunity for investors.\n\n\n\nVisit the [TBLD page here](https://www.thornburg.com/product/closed-end-funds/cib/) for current performance and additional information.\n\n## **Important Information**\n\nPlease see our [glossary](https://www.thornburg.com/legal/glossary/) for a definition of terms.\n\nThere are risks inherent in any investment, including the possible loss of principal. There can be no assurance that the trust will achieve its investment objective, and you could lose some or all of your investment. Closed end funds frequently trade at discounts to their net asset value. \n\nPast performance is not guaranteed. Current performance may be lower or higher than the performance data quoted. \n\nThe Trust's common shares are listed on the NASDAQ stock market LLC under the trading or ticker symbol TBLD. The trust is newly organized, and the trust's common shares have little history of public trading. An investment in this trust presents a number of risks and is not suitable for all investors. Investors should carefully review and consider potential risks before investing. These and other risk considerations are described in more detail on the trust's web page@thornburg.com \n\nThornburg Securities LLC, Member FINRA is a wholly owned subsidiary of Thornburg Investment Management Inc.\n\n#### Stay Connected\n\nSubscribe now to stay up-to-date with Thornburg’s news and insights.\n\n[Subscribe](/subscribe/)\n\n#### Related Content\n\n![Young man checks his airline status against his mobile ticket.](https://s40910.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/GettyImages-1438495334.jpg.webp)\n\n[Recession and Reversion to the Mean](https://www.thornburg.com/article/recession-and-reversion-to-the-mean/)\n\n[Can the Fed Bring Prices Down to its 2% Target?](https://www.thornburg.com/article/can-the-fed-bring-prices-down-to-its-2-target/)\n\n[Is Cash the Place to Be?

Are there signs of trouble with the Treasury borrowing the cash needed to keep the government operating? Here we explore three ways to judge auction strength and share whether we see any cause for worry.\n\n## What makes a weak auction? 3 indicators to watch\n\nThe federal budget deficit in fiscal year 2024 is projected to total nearly $2.0 trillion, equal to 7.0% of GDP—significantly higher than the 3.7% average over the past 50 years.[[1]](#_ftn1) As Treasury issuance must fill the gap, auctions have become a focal point for many market participants and observers.\n\n**US Treasury Securities: Gross Issuance $ billions** As of August 31, 2024\n\nSource: TreasuryDirect.gov, as compiled by SIFMA.\n\nTo judge the relative strength of an auction—suggestive of how well the market is absorbing new debt—we focus primarily on three indicators: the bid-to-cover ratio, tail, and primary dealer allocation.\n\n## 1. Bid-to-cover ratio\n\nThe bid-to-cover ratio reflects the total amount of bids received for a given Treasury security (demand) divided by the total amount offered for sale (supply). A high ratio indicates strong demand and a successful auction from the Treasury’s perspective. A ratio below 1.00 would indicate a failed auction in which demand was less than supply.\n\nAs shown below, the bid-to-cover ratio for Treasury coupon note and bond auctions has not dipped below 2.00 in the past 10 years. Recently, the ratio has been relatively range-bound, centered around the 2.50 level. For example, the five-year note auctioned in September 2024 posted a bid-to-cover ratio of 2.38, and the 30-year bond auctioned in June 2024 posted a ratio of 2.49.\n\n### Bid-to-cover ratio: Treasury note and bond auctions\n\nAs of September 26, 2024\n\nSource: TreasuryDirect.gov\n\n## 2. Tail (when-issued yield vs. auction yield)\n\nOnce an auction for a Treasury security is announced, trading begins on a “when issued” basis up until the auction occurs. Analysts compare the yield in when-issued trading right before the auction’s conclusion with the yield determined in the auction. If the auction yield is higher, the auction is said to have “tailed,” which indicates demand was weaker than expected. On the other hand, if the auction yield is lower than seen in when-issued trading, the auction “stopped through” or had a negative tail. Because when-issued trading serves as a price discovery mechanism, many market participants believe large, positive tails indicate unanticipated shifts in auction demand.\n\nAs shown below, 10-year note auctions have tailed on a regular basis over the last several years as the Fed implemented a hiking cycle. Looking at more recent months, the magnitude and frequency of the tails appear within the range of historical norms. For example, the auctions in April and August 2024 tailed by approximately 3 basis points, while the auctions in June, July, and September stopped through by 1-2 basis points.\n\n### US Treasury 10-year note auctions: “Tail” and “Through”\n\nAs of September 30, 2024 Source: Bloomberg.\n\n## 3. Primary dealer allocation\n\nPrimary dealers have a trading relationship with the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and are trading counterparties in its implementation of monetary policy. These 24 dealers are expected to bid on a pro-rata basis in all Treasury auctions at reasonably competitive prices. An auction is considered weak if primary dealers bidding for their own house accounts take an unusually large share, as it implies soft demand from other investors.\n\nAs shown below, primary dealer awards have declined over the past 10 years to settle around 15%. After ticking up in 2023, the percentage shifted back down. For example, primary dealers were allocated 15.64% of the 30-year bond auctioned in September 2024 ($3.44 billion of the $22 billion offered). For the 10-year note auctioned in August 2024, the figure was 17.82% ($7.49 billion of the $42 billion offered).\n\n**Primary dealer allocation: Treasury note and bond auctions** As of September 26, 2024\n\nSource: TreasuryDirect.gov. Excludes two small auctions of $25 million each in which primary dealers took 100% (6/21/2019 and 12/2/2021).\n\n## Is there cause for concern?\n\nWhen considering these three indicators, we do not see major red flags. Recent bid-to-cover ratios remain within the fairly tight historical range. While some auctions have tailed, we aren’t seeing a pattern that would indicate an established trend of surprisingly weak demand. Primary dealer allocations are below the longer-term average. We will continue to monitor auctions to see if normal oscillations develop into persistently problematic progressions.\n\nWhile few fear outright failure of a Treasury auction and we caution investors against extrapolating results from one or two isolated auctions, lackluster demand still carries implications. Dysfunction in the Treasury market ripples out to other markets and fuels volatility. In addition, weak auctions indicate less demand for Treasury securities, which translates to a higher cost of financing the US deficit and feeds uncertainty around interest rates and the macroeconomic outlook.\n\nHowever, history has shown that concerns about the viability of US debt have not translated into higher yields. When the S&P downgraded the US credit rating in August 2011, yields experienced a meaningful fall over the next several weeks, as investors paradoxically preferred to own US Treasury securities as a safe-haven asset. Combined with the US dollar’s status as the world’s reserve currency, we continue to be comfortable holding Treasuries in multisector fixed income portfolios to express both interest rate views and in relative value positioning versus competing fixed income sectors like corporates and mortgages.\n\n[[1]](#_ftnref1) An Update to the Budget and Economic Outlook: 2024 to 2034, Congressional Budget Office, June 18, 2024, <https://www.cbo.gov/publication/60039>\n\n## **Important Information**\n\nThe views expressed are subject to change and do not necessarily reflect the views of Thornburg Investment Management, Inc.

Learn how investors can capitalize on debt restructuring & refinancing.\n\n“Stay alive until ’26!” The current commercial real estate market mantra is popular for good reason. Higher-for-longer interest rates remain a dominant force and have had a significant effect on real estate valuations. At the same time, an estimated $1.5 trillion of commercial real estate debt is maturing over the next two years and more than $3 trillion is maturing through 2029, which could be the catalyst for stress turning into distress.\n\nHow much of this debt will be extended, refinanced, and restructured? Who will invest in it and what are the opportunities?\n\nCRE Mortgage Maturities By Lender Type ($Billions) Year | Total Due | Banks | CMBS | Life Cos | GSE | Other  \n---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \n2024 | $602.60 | $277.60 | $138.30 | $48.20 | $68.90 | $69.50  \n2025 | $598.00 | $286.60 | $112.60 | $50.80 | $82.30 | $65.60  \n2026 | $599.20 | $304.50 | $69.60 | $54.40 | $102.30 | $68.30  \n2027 | $628.70 | $322.10 | $55.50 | $58.30 | $120.60 | $72.10  \n2028 | $620.80 | $320.00 | $56.70 | $60.90 | $114.70 | $68.60  \n2029 | $595.10 | $294.00 | $66.70 | $58.10 | $118.10 | $58.20  \n2025-2029 | $3,041.80 | $1,527.30 | $361.10 | $282.60 | $538.00 | $332.90  \nSource: Trepp Inc., based on Federal Reserve Flow of Funds Data.  \n  \n## General Trends\n\n  * CMBS issuance is increasing. As of August 2024, U.S. private-label CMBS issuance for the year surpassed $69 billion, much higher than the full-year issuance in 2023 of $46 billion. The CMBS distress rate eased 11 basis points (bps) in August from July to 4.98%, but the delinquency rate climbed to 8.36%, an increase of 32 bps.\n  * Spreads on fixed rate CMBS are tight relative to 2022 and 2023, driven by demand for fixed rate bonds from insurance company investors and institutions who view current rates favorably for asset/liability matching and long-term portfolios. Spreads on floating rate debt are wider, and more than half of this year’s SASB CMBS issuance was floating rate.\n  * All-in rates on private senior CMBS are in the 6.40% to 6.85% range while benchmark rates are in the mid-3% range. The SOFR overnight rate currently sits at 4.59%, with the one-year SOFR SWAP rate at 4.32%.\n\n\n\n## Borrowers Seek Relief with Relaxed Terms and Creative Capital Stack Solutions\n\nIf interest rates stay higher for longer, some owners needing to refinance over the next two years may turn the keys over to their lenders. Other sponsors may need to seek creative solutions to plug holes in the capital stack by issuing mezzanine debt or preferred equity. This additional capital is generally most available to owners that operate high-quality properties with good locations and desirable tenants.\n\nIn some cases, lenders are willing to relax original debt covenants (such as loan-to-value ratio), extend loan repayment schedules, assume equity, and participate in restructurings. According to the Mortgage Bankers Association, $270 billion in expected 2023 maturities were pushed back to 2024. However, because many bank lenders are constrained by capital adequacy ratios and overexposure to real estate, we’re finding that many capital stack restructurings involving additional equity, preferred equity, mezzanine financing, and CMBS issuance are becoming more common.\n\n### Preferred Equity and Mezzanine Loans Increasingly Utilized to Close the Gap in Capital Stacks\n\nSource: Thornburg.\n\n## Sample Transactions: Restructuring the Capital Stack\n\nRecent high-profile transactions serve as examples of the restructuring activity happening across certain asset classes and markets.\n\n#### _Office: Liquidity Exists for the Right Assets Despite Significant Market Overhang_\n\nIn its mid-2024 report, Cushman Wakefield predicted negative net absorption of 63 million square feet in the office sector in 2024 and 7 million square feet in 2025. As such, landlords face a long road ahead before the office market reaches stabilization in the latter part of the decade, at which time demand for new office space is expected to stabilize at about 20-25 million square feet per year. This suggests an overhang in the market for the next few years, during which some space will become obsolete, while some higher-tier property will require capital restructuring and refinancing.\n\n_277 Park Avenue Refinancing $600 million refinancing of Manhattan office building at 277 Park Avenue_\n\nThe sponsor had a $750 million CMBS loan on the property that was issued in 2014 and came due in August 2024. The building is nearly fully leased and situated near Grand Central station, a commuter hub. The new debt includes a $379 million A tranche, $109 million B tranche, $74 million C tranche, and $37 million junior bond. Investors insisted that $180 million of the funds go into a leasing reserve and $20 million into a debt service reserve. Additionally, the refinancing required a $250 million equity injection.\n\nImportantly, 47.7% of the net rentable area is leased to a large national financial tenant, with 361,802 square feet expiring in 2026 and 536,319 square feet expiring in 2028. The tenant is not planning to renew its lease, so the fact that the deal got done shows there is still liquidity in the market for the right assets if well-structured.\n\n#### _Lodging: Successful Refinancing Possible for Assets with Durable Demand Drivers_\n\nThe post-COVID travel surge created additional demand for hospitality properties in certain markets. This prompted a wave of new construction that has continued in 2024 with 157,713 hotel rooms in construction, up 5.5% year-over-year, according to CoStar. However, given higher rates and increased labor and supply costs, some projects have run out of capital.\n\nHotel Investment Today notes that loan-to-value (LTV) ratios for new loans are lower, and borrowers that could previously source debt in the 70-85% range are now looking at LTVs in the 50% range. This means that borrowers need to be creative in sourcing the capital required to complete a cash-neutral refinancing. With banks retreating from traditional lending, some private credit and insurance companies are stepping in to fill the void at higher rates, and in many cases new equity needs to step in to fill the gap. Hotel cap rates are higher than they have been in recent years and are expected to stay high for many months.\n\n_Fairmont Hotel, Austin Refinancing_ $430 million refinancing of the luxury Fairmont Hotel, downtown Austin\n\nThe five-year, interest only fixed-rate SASB CMBS loan replaced a $300 million senior loan and $125 million of mezzanine debt. This was an example of a successful refinancing of an asset with durable demand drivers in a very strong market with a prime location near the convention center and downtown.\n\n#### _Multifamily: Sponsors Plug the Gap with Preferred Equity_\n\nMultifamily performance varies by market, with the national vacancy rate sitting at 5.6% and rents increasing by 2% thus far in 2024, helped by lower new starts in 2024 than in 2023. However, the delinquency rate has increased from 1.91% at the beginning of the year to 3.30% in August. Furthermore, a significant amount of new supply is being delivered in 2024 and 2025.\n\nMost multifamily construction loans are floating rate and offer a three-year initial term with optional extensions if the property meets minimum debt service ratio coverage and maximum LTV covenants, which may not be met in the current interest rate and leasing environment. Many of these properties will require an extension from their current lender, a refinance, or a restructuring of the capital stack.\n\n_Multifamily Financing_ Preferred equity plugging the gap in multifamily project capital stacks across the US\n\nIn January 2024, a new multifamily development project in Florida raised approximately $15 million of preferred equity to plug the gap between common equity and the senior construction loan to complete the project. Another sponsor recently raised a preferred equity sleeve totaling 15% of the original mortgage balance to complete the acquisition of a two-property portfolio because loan proceeds and common equity were insufficient. In the Midwest, a multifamily development project tapped the preferred equity market to fund 14% of total project costs to plug the gap created by insufficient debt and common equity proceeds.\n\n## Capitalizing on Commercial Real Estate Market Turbulence\n\nSo, where are the current opportunities in commercial real estate, given high rates, expensive labor and supplies, and lower demand in some sectors? Looking across public and private markets and across all asset classes, we believe there are some interesting opportunities for discerning investors. Many of these are arising out of the need for developers and owners to restructure and refinance their capital stacks or cover shortages of capital needed for business plan completion.\n\nFor investors looking for opportunistic returns, we believe equity-like returns are possible while taking less risk at lower levels of the capital stack. We see compelling opportunities in the preferred equity space, with higher yields than debt and greater downside protection than pure equity. For those looking for consistent income with lower risk appetite, we believe there are interesting opportunities in the senior and mezzanine loan space, with ample opportunities readily available in the CMBS market.\n\n> ### In Our View, Preferred Equity and Mezzanine Loans May Offer Similar Returns to Common Equity, But at Lower Risk in the Current Market Environment\n> \n> ![Preferred Equity and Mezzanine Loans](https://s40910.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/TL0944-chart-4.svg)\n\nSource: Thornburg.\n\nAcross all opportunities, a thorough review of the sponsor, market conditions, and deal structure remain paramount; a thoughtful and disciplined approach can help in navigating this challenging, volatile environment. With pockets of the real estate market beginning to improve and capital stacks continuing to require refinancing or restructuring, the timing is right to take a measured approach towards investment opportunities in the real estate sector across both private and publicly traded markets.\n\n## **Important Information**\n\nThe views expressed are subject to change and do not necessarily reflect the views of Thornburg Investment Management, Inc.

Investors know the “Magnificent Seven” – mega-cap tech stocks that powered recent U.S. market returns. We argue that now is the time to consider their unsung European equivalents, which we dub the Fantastic Five. Like the Mag Seven, the Fantastic Five have delivered robust market-beating returns.\n\nLet’s compare the Fantastic Five and Magnificent Seven (Mag 7) on performance, resilience, growth, and valuation. On most measures, as we’ll see below, the Fantastic Five match or surpass the Magnificent Seven. As such, investors should take the time to familiarize themselves with these impressive companies.\n\n#### **_Magnificent Seven_**\n\n| \n\n#### **_Fantastic Five_**  \n  \n---|---  \nMicrosoft | Novo Nordisk  \nApple | ASML Holding  \nNVIDIA | LVMH  \nAmazon.com | AstraZeneca  \nMeta Platforms | SAP  \nAlphabet  \nTesla  \n  \n### First Dimension: Performance\n\nUnsurprisingly, the European Fantastic Five and U.S. Magnificent Seven have beaten the market as they are leaders within their respective industries, generate excellent returns on capital, and have delivered superior revenue growth. They have earned their stellar reputations. But when compared head-to-head, the European Fantastic Five have delivered better results to investors—with less risk.\n\nWe evaluated the performance of both portfolios from December 2021 through the end of the third quarter of 2024. This period of almost three years includes an aggressive interest rate hiking cycle from both the U.S. Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank beginning in 2022, as well as a rebound in equity markets in 2023 and 2024.\n\nOver that period, the Fantastic Five portfolio returned 30%, and the Magnificent Seven portfolio returned 54%[[1]](#_ftn1). The chart below shows that the Fantastic Five exhibited much better downside protection in the 2022 market correction, highlighting greater diversification and resilience.\n\n##### Fantastic 5 Performance Has Been More Consistent versus the Magnificent 7\n\nLine chart with 2 lines.\n\nView as data table, \n\nThe chart has 1 X axis displaying categories. \n\nThe chart has 1 Y axis displaying Values. Data ranges from 0 to 0.\n\nCreated with Highcharts 11.4.8ValuesSeries 1Series 2\n\nEnd of interactive chart.\n\nSource: Bloomberg as of 30 September 2024.\n\nHow did these leaders compare to their benchmarks? Over the full period, the Fantastic Five beat the MSCI Europe Index by 11%. The Magnificent Seven also beat its benchmark, the MSCI United States Index, by 23%. So while both portfolios outperformed their respective indexes, the Magnificent 7 delivered better overall performance, but with more volatility.\n\n##### Fantastic 5 Has Generally Outperformed Its Benchmark by a Wider Margin than the Magnificent 7\n\n###### European Basket\n\nLine chart with 2 lines.\n\nView as data table, European Basket\n\nThe chart has 1 X axis displaying categories. \n\nThe chart has 1 Y axis displaying Values.

Data ranges from 0 to 0.\n\nCreated with Highcharts 11.4.8ValuesSeries 2Series 1U.S. Basket\n\nEnd of interactive chart.\n\nSource: Bloomberg as of 30 September 2024.\n\nAdditionally, failing to own the Mag 7 was more costly to U.S. investors than failing to own the Fantastic Five for international investors. Why? Because the Mag 7 stocks made up a greater share of the starting index weight. As of December 31, 2021, the seven U.S. stocks represented 25% of the total U.S. index versus the five European stocks, which only comprised 10% of their index. So the Mag 7’s performance contribution effect was more considerable because returns were delivered on a larger starting market weight.\n\nThis mega-cap weighting is one reason why the Mag 7 rose to prominence in the first place when their AI-fueled rally caused investors who did _not_ own them to lick their wounds. Similarly, suppose the Fantastic Five continue to outperform the European markets. In that case, they will grow to be a more significant part of the index, creating a greater headwind for investors who do not own them.\n\n##### Winner for Historical Performance: Magnificent Seven\n\n### Second Dimension: Resilience\n\nLet’s dig into how the Fantastic Five protected capital better than the Magnificent Seven during 2022’s market correction. The Fantastic Five portfolio had a maximum drawdown of 18% versus the Mag 7’s 40% drop. This resilience may result from somewhat lower starting valuations and greater diversification.\n\nDespite being just five names versus seven, the Fantastic Five are a more diverse grouping than the Mag 7, which is concentrated in technology-related industries. The U.S. cluster is heavily tied to the prospects for artificial intelligence (“AI”), which helped power their roaring comeback in 2023 as new AI technology was all the rage. In contrast, the European leaders have diverse sources of growth, which include AI but also GLP-1 drugs, luxury goods, advanced pharmaceuticals, and mission-critical enterprise software.\n\n##### The Fantastic 5 Are a More Diversified Set of Companies and Less Reliant on the Information Technology Sector\n\n###### Chart\n\nBar chart with 4 data series.\n\nView as data table, Chart\n\nThe chart has 1 X axis displaying categories. \n\nThe chart has 1 Y axis displaying Values. Data ranges from 0 to 0.\n\nCreated with Highcharts 11.4.8ValuesSeries 1Series 2Series 3Series 4\n\nEnd of interactive chart.\n\nSource: Bloomberg as of 30 September 2024.\n\nThe resilience of the Fantastic Five is also evident in the geographic composition of revenue. They are less concentrated in the U.S. and have a more globally balanced sales mix than their American peers. The Magnificent Seven, on average, generate about 50% of their revenue in the U.S., their home market. By contrast, the Fantastic Five generate 23% in their home market of Europe, 33% in the U.S., and 44% in other international markets.\n\n##### Winner for Market Resiliency: Fantastic Five\n\n### Third Dimension: Growth\n\nThe Magnificent Seven has historically delivered faster earnings growth, principally driven by NVIDIA’s explosive growth due to AI chip demand. But markets are forward-looking: what matters is the future, not the past. On this basis, the Fantastic Five compare favorably.\n\nThe Fantastic Five are expected to outgrow the Magnificent Seven going forward. Consensus expects the Fantastic Five to grow earnings at 16% per year over the next three years, compared to 15% for the Magnificent Seven. The stronger earnings growth for the Fantastic Five is driven by Novo Nordisk’s first-mover advantage in the fast-growing market for GLP-1 diabetes and obesity drugs, booming demand for ASML’s leading-edge lithography equipment needed to produce AI chips, and accelerating earnings growth as SAP completes a successful cloud transition.\n\n##### Expected Earnings Favor the Fantastic 5 Over the Magnificent 7\n\n###### Chart\n\nBar chart with 2 data series.\n\nView as data table, Chart\n\nThe chart has 1 X axis displaying categories. \n\nThe chart has 1 Y axis displaying Values.

They are marginally cheaper on 2024 consensus estimates, trading at 31x forward earnings versus the Fantastic Five’s 32x. This is only a minor advantage for the U.S. leaders. Because the Fantastic Five have more robust expected earnings growth over the coming years, their P/E multiples fall faster, such that they are trading at parity on 2025 estimates and at a discount beyond[[2]](#_ftn2).\n\n##### Forward P/E Multiples Favor the Magnificent 7 in the Short-Term\n\n###### Chart\n\nBar chart with 2 data series.\n\nView as data table, Chart\n\nThe chart has 1 X axis displaying categories. \n\nThe chart has 1 Y axis displaying Values.

Although less well-known, this phenomenon is not unique to U.S. markets, as Europe has its own crop of companies that have powered the returns of the local index. They will significantly contribute to international market returns if they continue to outperform. American investors who are adding an international allocation for its diversification benefits should consider these global leaders. Dominating their respective markets and with attractive fundamentals, they fully merit the label the “Fantastic Five.”\n\n[[1]](#_ftnref2) Based on prices and consensus earnings estimates at 9/30/24\n\n[[2]](#_ftnref1) Performance based on total returns (including dividends) in local currency terms.

This widening gap—now at almost 50%—could signal a multi-year period of outperformance for value stocks. The environment of near-zero interest rates over the past decade, which fueled growth stocks, is giving way to a period where the cost of capital is more significant, and inflation is likely to remain elevated. These factors could provide a tailwind for value stocks, which typically benefit from higher interest rates and inflationary pressures.\n\nInterestingly, while the broader equity market has performed well in 2023, high-dividend-yielding stocks, as represented by the MSCI World High Dividend Yield Index, have lagged, returning only 3%. This underperformance, coupled with the attractive starting valuations, suggests that now could be an opportune time to consider value and income strategies. Looking ahead, the market-cap-weighted indices may deliver lower returns over the next decade compared to historical averages. For investors, focusing on high-dividend-paying companies could provide a valuable head start in outperforming these indices over time, particularly if broader equity returns settle into a 5% to 6% range.\n\n**The Fed’s Next Move: A Rate Hike that May Not Matter**\n\nAs for the Federal Reserve, the recent decision to keep rates steady was widely anticipated. However, the question remains whether another hike is on the horizon. We expect one more rate hike but it may not significantly impact the market. The Fed’s primary focus remains on bringing inflation back toward its 2% target, even at the expense of growth. Despite some signs of economic softening, particularly in leading indicators for employment, inflation is still running above trend, compelling the Fed to maintain its tightening bias.\n\nInterestingly, the Fed may be willing to tolerate slightly higher inflation, particularly if it results from wage growth among lower-income earners, as this could help compress the wage gap. However, inflation at current levels—around 4%—remains too high for comfort, making it likely that the Fed will opt for at least one more hike before potentially pausing.\n\n**Navigating Fixed Income in a Precarious Environment**\n\nIn the fixed-income space, we believe the focus should be on relative value across the three central balance sheets: government, corporate, and consumer. The consumer balance sheet, once a stronghold, is now deteriorating rapidly, driven by higher mortgage rates and financing costs. Meanwhile, government balance sheets, particularly in developed economies, are also under pressure, although they still offer relative stability.\n\nCorporations present a more mixed picture. While the highest-quality companies have benefited from low interest rates and strong cash positions, the broader corporate landscape faces challenges as refinancing looms in a higher-rate environment. In this context, we recommend a shift from lower-quality credits toward higher-quality, more cyclically resilient opportunities. Additionally, we recommend moving credit exposure to shorter durations while using U.S. Treasuries and agency mortgages as a hedge against interest-rate volatility.\n\n**Conclusion: Positioning for a Complex Market Environment**\n\nThe current market environment presents a unique set of challenges and opportunities. The valuation gap between value and growth stocks, coupled with a potentially prolonged period of higher interest rates, suggest that value and income-oriented strategies could outperform over the long term. Meanwhile, in the fixed-income market, a focus on quality and duration management will be crucial as the Fed navigates its dual mandate.\n\nWhile another Fed hike may be on the horizon, its impact on long-term investment strategies is likely to be minimal. Instead, the focus should be on building resilient portfolios that can weather the uncertainties of a higher-for-longer rate environment, where both equities and fixed income will play essential roles in achieving balanced and sustainable returns.\n\n## **Important Information**\n\nThe views expressed are subject to change and do not necessarily reflect the views of Thornburg Investment Management, Inc.

With interest rates rising and the cost of capital normalizing after years of near-zero rates, these segments offer compelling opportunities for income generation. This article delves into the strategic value of dividends and municipal bonds, highlighting their potential benefits and risks for investors seeking stable income.\n\n## High Dividend-Paying Stocks: A Timely Investment\n\nThe investment landscape has shifted notably from the era of quantitative easing and near-zero interest rates, which lasted from the end of the financial crisis up until 2022. During this prolonged period, growth stocks dominated the market, and the emphasis on income as a component of total return in equities diminished. However, as interest rates rise and capital costs normalize, the outlook for dividend-paying stocks has become particularly favorable.\n\nDividend investing has a long-standing reputation for being a robust strategy. Historically, dividend-paying stocks have provided attractive returns, often surpassing the overall market with less volatility. This makes dividend investing not only a reliable approach but also an appealing one in the current economic climate.\n\nToday, dividend-paying stocks are trading at significant valuation discounts compared to their historical averages and especially relative to high-growth companies. For instance, the global dividend-paying index currently trades at about 12 times earnings and offers a yield of around 4%. More actively managed portfolios can achieve even higher yields, potentially around 5%, with valuations around 10 times earnings.\n\nThe appeal of dividend-paying stocks is further enhanced by their potential for income growth over time. As the population ages and the need for investment income increases, equities that offer dividend income become increasingly valuable. They not only provide a steady income stream but also offer inflation protection, making them a critical component of a diversified investment strategy.\n\n## Municipal Bonds: Navigating Opportunities and Risks\n\nOn the fixed income side, municipal bonds have long been a preferred choice for investors seeking tax-exempt income. As we look at the current market dynamics, there are both opportunities and risks associated with municipal bonds.\n\nMunicipal bonds continue to be an attractive investment due to their tax-exempt status. This feature is particularly valuable as federal and state deficits grow, potentially leading to higher tax rates in the future. Municipal bonds offer a shield against these potential tax increases, providing a stable source of income that remains exempt from federal taxes.\n\n## Current Market Dynamics and Risks\n\nThe municipal bond market is influenced by several factors, including interest rates and fiscal policies. While the Federal Reserve’s stance on rates remains a key risk factor, with the potential for future rate hikes or cuts, the immediate outlook suggests that the Fed is likely to maintain its current policy stance. However, if the Fed acts prematurely with rate cuts, it could reintroduce inflationary pressures and higher rates, which would impact the municipal bond market.\n\nAdditionally, the market for municipal bonds is experiencing some level of complacency. The yield ratios between tax-exempt and taxable bonds have compressed, but the advantages of municipal bonds still persist. Investors should approach the municipal bond market with caution, focusing on high-quality issuers and maintaining a defensive posture while waiting for more favorable opportunities.\n\nFor fixed income investors, it is crucial to build a portfolio that emphasizes durability and stability of income streams. In the municipal bond market, this means prioritizing high-quality issuers and adopting a defensive strategy to mitigate potential risks.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nIn summary, both high dividend-paying stocks and municipal bonds offer valuable opportunities for income generation in the current investment environment. Dividend stocks provide an attractive long-term investment strategy with the potential for income growth and inflation protection. Meanwhile, municipal bonds continue to offer tax-exempt income, though investors must remain vigilant about potential risks related to interest rates and fiscal policies.\n\nFor financial advisors and investors, understanding these dynamics is essential for crafting strategies that effectively balance income needs with market risks. By leveraging the strengths of dividends and municipal bonds, investors can enhance their portfolios and achieve more stable and reliable income streams in an evolving economic landscape.\n\n## **Important Information**\n\nThe views expressed are subject to change and do not necessarily reflect the views of Thornburg Investment Management, Inc.

Despite a series of data points that might suggest otherwise, a recession has not yet materialized. As we look ahead, the question remains not whether a recession will occur, but when.\n\n## Is the Recession Just Delayed?\n\nAs we entered 2023, the consensus among economists and market participants was that a recession seemed almost inevitable. The expectation was that high inflation, rising interest rates, and reduced consumer spending would lead to an economic downturn. Yet, as we near the end of the year, we find ourselves in a peculiar situation: many of the signals that typically precede a recession are present, but the economy has remained resilient.\n\nGDP growth, while modest, has stayed in positive territory, and the labor market continues to add jobs at a steady rate. However, these headline figures mask underlying weaknesses. Consumer confidence has fallen, early-stage delinquencies are rising, and bank lending data shows a significant pullback. These are all signs of a slowing economy, but not necessarily an economy in recession.\n\nOne of the factors that may have delayed a recession is the massive amount of COVID-related stimulus that was injected into the economy. This stimulus disproportionately benefited lower- and middle-income consumers, who have been spending these savings, thereby propping up demand. However, as these savings are depleted and inflation continues to erode purchasing power, the resilience of these consumers is likely to diminish.\n\nAt the corporate level, the story is similar. High-quality, cash-rich companies have benefited from low interest rates in the past and are now earning more on their investments. On the other hand, small and mid-sized companies, which are the backbone of the economy, are feeling the squeeze from higher borrowing costs. As these companies struggle, their ability to hire and invest will diminish, contributing to the broader economic slowdown.\n\n## The Fed’s Inflation Target: Is It Flexible?\n\nThe Federal Reserve’s commitment to its 2% inflation target has been a cornerstone of its policy for over a decade. However, achieving this target has proven to be a formidable challenge. Inflation has only occasionally touched the 2% mark, often remaining below it for extended periods. The recent spike in inflation has flipped this dynamic, and now the Fed finds itself in a position of trying to bring inflation down from significantly higher levels.\n\nThere is speculation that the Fed may be willing to tolerate a higher level of inflation in the short term, particularly if it is driven by wage growth among lower-income workers. This could mean that the Fed might allow inflation to hover around 3% or even 4% if it views the underlying economic conditions as favorable. However, this approach carries risks. Allowing inflation to remain elevated for too long could entrench higher inflation expectations, making it harder to bring it back down in the future.\n\nThe Fed’s dual mandate—balancing price stability with maximum employment—adds another layer of complexity. With the labor market still strong, the Fed may be hesitant to raise rates too aggressively, even if inflation remains above target. This balancing act will be crucial in determining whether the economy can achieve a so-called “soft landing,” or whether the delayed recession will finally materialize.\n\n## The Rising Cost of Federal Debt: A Ticking Time Bomb?\n\nInterest payments on the federal debt have nearly doubled in recent years, reaching $1 trillion in the second quarter of 2023. This surge in debt service costs has raised concerns about the sustainability of the U.S. fiscal position. The recent downgrade of U.S. Treasury debt by Fitch highlighted the risks associated with the growing federal debt burden and the political gridlock that has prevented meaningful fiscal reforms.\n\nDespite these concerns, the impact on the fixed income markets has been relatively muted so far. One reason for this is the strong demand for U.S. Treasuries, which continue to be seen as a safe haven in times of uncertainty. However, if the supply of Treasuries continues to grow and interest rates rise further, this dynamic could change. Higher borrowing costs could lead to a deeper recession, which in turn would likely prompt the Fed to cut rates, potentially stabilizing the situation.\n\nIn conclusion, while the U.S. economy has defied expectations by avoiding a recession so far, the underlying risks remain. The delayed recession may still occur in 2024, driven by a combination of weakening consumer demand, struggling small and mid-sized businesses, and the potential for higher interest rates to exacerbate the federal debt burden. Investors should remain vigilant and prepared for potential market dislocations as these risks continue to evolve.\n\n## **Important Information**\n\nThe views expressed are subject to change and do not necessarily reflect the views of Thornburg Investment Management, Inc.
