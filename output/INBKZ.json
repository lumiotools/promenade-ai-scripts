          "content": "First Internet Bancorp Reports Third Quarter 2024 Results\nFishers, Indiana, October 23, 2024 – First Internet Bancorp (the “Company”) (Nasdaq: INBK), the\nparent company of First Internet Bank (the “Bank”), announced today financial and operational results\nfor the third quarter ended September 30, 2024.\nThird Quarter 2024 Financial Highlights\n\nNet income of $7.0 million, an increase of 21.0% from the second quarter of 2024\n\nDiluted earnings per share of $0.80, an increase of 19.4% from the second quarter of\n2024\n Net interest income of $21.8 million and fully-taxable equivalent net interest income1\nof $22.9 million, increases of 2.1% and 1.8%, respectively, from the second quarter of\n2024\n Net interest margin of 1.62% and fully-taxable equivalent net interest margin1 of\n1.70%, compared to 1.67% and 1.76%, respectively, for the second quarter of 2024\n\nNoninterest income of $12.0 million, a 9.0% increase from the second quarter of 2024\n\nLoan growth of $74.7 million, a 1.9% increase from the second quarter of 2024;\nDeposit growth of $523.8 million, a 12.3% increase from the second quarter of 2024;\nLoans to deposits ratio of 84.1%\n\nNonperforming loans to total loans of 0.56%; net charge-offs to average loans of\n0.15%; allowance for credit losses to total loans of 1.13%\n Tangible common equity to tangible assets ratio1 of 6.54%, and 7.49% ex-AOCI and\nadjusted for normalized cash balances1; CET1 ratio of 9.37%\n Tangible book value per share1 of $43.89, a 3.6% increase from the second quarter of\n2024, and a 10.9% increase from the third quarter of 2023\n“Our third quarter results demonstrated strong performance virtually across the board,” said David\nBecker, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. “Growth in net interest income, driven by higher earning\nasset yields and stable funding costs, along with record gain-on-sale revenue from the continued\nexpansion of our national SBA platform, propelled an increase in operating revenues for the fifth\nconsecutive quarter, resulting in significant positive operating leverage.\n1 This information represents a non-GAAP financial measure. For a discussion of non-GAAP financial measures, see the\nsection below entitled \"Non-GAAP Financial Measures.\"\n“Additionally, robust deposit growth and the ongoing strategic shift in loan mix have increased balance\nsheet flexibility, enhanced our interest rate risk profile, and improved our liquidity position to its\nstrongest level in recent history, as indicated by our loans-to-deposits ratio.\n“Looking ahead, we are well-positioned to deliver increased earnings and profitability by continuing to\nexecute our core strategies of revenue diversification and balance sheet optimization. Our balance\nsheet and capital position are solid, and measures of asset quality remain sound. I want to thank our\nemployees for their dedication and hard work in driving increased value for our stakeholders.”\nNet Interest Income and Net Interest Margin\nNet interest income for the third quarter of 2024 was $21.8 million, compared to $21.3 million for the\nsecond quarter of 2024, and $17.4 million for the third quarter of 2023. On a fully-taxable equivalent\nbasis, net interest income for the third quarter of 2024 was $22.9 million, compared to $22.5 million for\nthe second quarter of 2024, and $18.6 million for the third quarter of 2023.\nTotal interest income for the third quarter of 2024 was $75.0 million, an increase of 5.7% compared to\nthe second quarter of 2024, and an increase of 19.0% compared to the third quarter of 2023. On a fully-\ntaxable equivalent basis, total interest income for the third quarter of 2024 was $76.1 million, an\nincrease of 5.5% compared to the second quarter of 2024, and an increase of 18.4% compared to the\nthird quarter of 2023. The yield on average interest-earning assets for the third quarter of 2024\nincreased to 5.58% from 5.54% for the second quarter of 2024, due to a 7 basis point (“bp”) increase in\nthe yield earned on loans, partially offset by a 7 bp decrease in the yield earned on other earning\nassets and a 1 bp decrease in the yield earned on securities. Compared to the linked quarter, average\nloan balances, including loans held-for-sale, increased $92.6 million, or 2.4%, while the average\nbalance of securities increased $47.9 million, or 6.4%, and the average balance of other earning assets\nincreased $57.3 million, or 12.2%.\nInterest income earned on commercial loans was higher due primarily to increased average balances\nwithin the investor commercial real estate, construction and small business lending portfolios. This was\npartially offset by lower average balances in the commercial and industrial and public finance portfolios,\nboth of which were impacted by early payoffs which resulted in lower interest income compared to the\nprior quarter. The continued shift in the loan mix reflects the Company’s focus on higher-yielding\nvariable rate products, in part, to help improve the interest rate risk profile of the balance sheet.\nIn the consumer loan portfolio, interest income was up due to the combination of higher average\nbalances and continued strong new origination yields in the trailers, RV and other consumer loan\nportfolios.\nThe yield on funded portfolio loan originations was 8.85% in the third quarter of 2024, a decrease of 3\nbps compared to the second quarter of 2024, and a decrease of 7 bps compared to the third quarter of\n2023.\nInterest income earned on securities during the third quarter of 2024 increased $0.5 million, or 7.4%,\ncompared to the second quarter of 2024, driven primarily by new purchases and relatively stable yields\non the portfolio. Interest income earned on other earning asset balances increased $0.8 million, or\n-2-\n12.2%, in the third quarter of 2024 compared to the linked quarter, due primarily to higher average cash\nbalances.\nTotal interest expense for the third quarter of 2024 was $53.2 million, an increase of $3.6 million, or\n7.2%, compared to the linked quarter as short-term rates remained stable throughout most of the\nquarter while average interest-bearing deposits balances increased $211.1 million, or 5.1%. Interest\nexpense related to interest-bearing deposits increased $2.9 million, or 6.6%, driven primarily by higher\nbalances of certificates of deposits (“CDs”), interest-bearing demand deposits, fintech – brokered\ndeposits and brokered deposits. The cost of interest-bearing deposits was relatively stable during the\nquarter at 4.30%, compared to 4.29% for the second quarter of 2024.\nAverage CD balances increased $137.7 million, or 7.7%, compared to the linked quarter, driven by\nstrong consumer demand, while the cost of funds decreased 3 bps. CD pricing reached its inflection\npoint during the third quarter of 2024 as the weighted average cost of new CDs was 4.77%, or 28 bps\nlower than the cost of maturing CDs. As interest rates across the yield curve began falling ahead of the\nexpected cut in the Fed Funds rate in September, the Company lowered CD rates significantly during\nthe second half of the quarter. As a result, the weighted average cost of CD production during the\nmonth of September was 4.48%, or almost 30 bps lower than the average cost of new CDs for the\nquarter, and is 53 bps lower than the rates on CDs maturing in the fourth quarter of 2024.\nThe average balance of interest-bearing demand deposits increased $37.3 million, or 7.9%, due to\ngrowth in fintech partnership deposits, and the cost of funds increased 6 bps. The average balance of\nfintech – brokered deposits increased $33.3 million, or 27.9%, due to higher payments volumes, while\nthe cost of funds remained flat. The average balance of brokered deposits increased $21.3 million, or\n4.1%, compared to the linked quarter, and the cost of funds increased 19 bps.\nInterest expense was also impacted by the cost of other borrowed funds. The average balance of FHLB\nadvances declined during the third quarter of 2024; however, the cost of funds increased as lower-cost\nadvances matured. Additionally, one of the Company’s subordinated debt issuances converted from\nfixed to floating rate early in the third quarter of 2024. As a result, the cost of other borrowed funds\nincreased 56 bps.\nNet interest margin (“NIM”) was 1.62% for the third quarter of 2024, down from 1.67% for the second\nquarter of 2024 and up from 1.39% for the third quarter of 2023. Fully-taxable equivalent NIM (“FTE\nNIM”) was 1.70% for the third quarter of 2024, down from 1.76% for the second quarter of 2024 and up\nfrom 1.49% for the third quarter of 2023. NIM and FTE NIM performance for the third quarter was\naffected by carrying higher cash balances, which are estimated to have had a negative impact of 6 bps.\nFurthermore, the early loan payoff activity discussed above also had a negative impact of 6 bps.\nNoninterest Income\nNoninterest income for the third quarter of 2024 was $12.0 million, compared to $11.0 million for the\nsecond quarter of 2024, and $7.4 million for the third quarter of 2023. Gain on sale of loans totaled $9.9\nmillion in the third quarter of 2024, increasing $1.6 million, or 19.8%, compared to the linked quarter.\nGain on sale revenue consisted almost entirely of sales of U.S. Small Business Administration (“SBA”)\n7(a) guaranteed loans during the third quarter of 2024. Loan sale volume was up 22.1% while net\n-3-\npremiums decreased 65 bps compared to the linked quarter. Other income decreased $0.7 million\nduring the quarter due primarily to lower distributions from fund investments. Net loan servicing revenue\nincreased by $0.1 million due to the growth in the servicing portfolio, partially offset by the fair value\nadjustment to the loan servicing asset.\nNoninterest Expense\nNoninterest expense totaled $22.8 million for the third quarter of 2024, compared to $22.3 million for\nthe second quarter of 2024, and $19.8 million for the third quarter of 2023, representing increases of\n2.1% and 15.4%, respectively. Excluding non-recurring costs of almost $0.6 million recognized in the\nsecond quarter of 2024, noninterest expense increased $1.0 million, or 4.7%, in the third quarter of\n2024 from the linked quarter. The increase was driven mainly by higher salaries and employee benefits\ndue to higher small business lending incentive compensation as well as staff additions in small\nbusiness lending and risk management.\nIncome Taxes\nThe Company recorded income tax expense of $0.6 million and an effective tax rate of 8.1% for the\nthird quarter of 2024, compared to income tax expense of $0.2 million and an effective tax rate of 3.6%\nfor the second quarter of 2024, and an income tax benefit of $0.4 million for the third quarter of 2023.\nLoans and Credit Quality\nTotal loans as of September 30, 2024, were $4.0 billion, an increase of $74.7 million, or 1.9%,\ncompared to June 30, 2024, and an increase of $300.8 million, or 8.1%, compared to September 30,\n2023. Total commercial loan balances were $3.2 billion as of September 30, 2024, an increase of $75.5\nmillion, or 2.4%, compared to June 30, 2024, and an increase of $295.2 million, or 10.2%, compared to\nSeptember 30, 2023. Compared to the linked quarter, the increase in commercial loan balances was\ndriven primarily by growth in investor commercial real estate, small business lending and construction\nbalances. These items were partially offset by decreases in the public finance, healthcare finance and\ncommercial and industrial portfolios. Quarter-end balances in the commercial and industrial and public\nfinance portfolios were impacted by early payoffs. The increase in investor commercial real estate\nbalances included loans with strong variable rate pricing that converted from construction loans upon\nproject completion.\nTotal consumer loan balances were $803.4 million as of September 30, 2024, an increase of $2.9\nmillion, or 0.4%, compared to June 30, 2024, and an increase of $16.9 million, or 2.1%, compared to\nSeptember 30, 2023. The increase compared to the linked quarter was due primarily to a higher\nbalance in the trailers portfolio, partially offset by declines in the residential mortgage and home equity\nportfolios.\nTotal delinquencies 30 days or more past due were 0.75% of total loans as of September 30, 2024,\ncompared to 0.56% at June 30, 2024, and 0.22% as of September 30, 2023. The increase compared to\nthe linked quarter was due primarily to an increase in delinquencies in franchise finance and small\nbusiness lending loans. Nonperforming loans were 0.56% of total loans as of September 30, 2024, up\nfrom 0.33% as of June 30, 2024, and 0.16% as of September 30, 2023. Nonperforming loans totaled\n$22.5 million as of September 30, 2024, up from $13.0 million as of June 30, 2024, and up from $5.9\nmillion as of September 30, 2023. The increase in nonperforming loans at the end of the third quarter of\n-4-\n2024 was due primarily to franchise finance and small business lending loans that were placed on\nnonaccrual during the quarter. At quarter end, there were $10.1 million of specific reserves held against\nthe balance of nonperforming loans.\nThe allowance for credit losses (“ACL”) as a percentage of total loans was 1.13% as of September 30,\n2024, compared to 1.10% as of June 30, 2024, and 0.98% as of September 30, 2023. The increase in\nthe ACL reflects growth and higher coverage ratios in certain loan portfolios, as well as additional\nreserves related to small business lending and franchise finance, partially offset by the positive impact\nof economic data on forecasted loss rates and qualitative factors on other portfolios.\nNet charge-offs of $1.5 million were recognized during the third quarter of 2024, resulting in net charge-\noffs to average loans of 0.15%, compared to $1.4 million, or 0.14%, for the second quarter of 2024, and\n$1.5 million, or 0.16%, for the third quarter of 2023. Net charge-offs in the third quarter of 2024 were\ndriven primarily by small business lending.\nThe provision for credit losses in the third quarter of 2024 was $3.4 million, compared to $4.0 million for\nthe second quarter of 2024 and $1.9 million for the third quarter of 2023. The provision for the third\nquarter of 2024 was driven primarily by growth and changes in the loan composition, net charge-offs\nand an increase in reserves related to franchise finance and small business lending, partially offset by\nthe positive impact of economic forecasts and adjustments to qualitative factors on other portfolios.\nCapital\nAs of September 30, 2024, total shareholders’ equity was $385.1 million, an increase of $13.2 million,\nor 3.5%, compared to June 30, 2024, and an increase of $37.4 million, or 10.8%, compared to\nSeptember 30, 2023. The increase in total shareholders’ equity during the third quarter compared to the\nlinked quarter was due primarily to the net income earned during the quarter and a decrease in\naccumulated other comprehensive loss. Book value per common share increased to $44.43 as of\nSeptember 30, 2024, up from $42.91 as of June 30, 2024, and $40.11 as of September 30, 2023.\nTangible book value per share was $43.89 as of September 30, 2024, up from $42.37 as of June 30,\n2024, and $39.57 as of September 30, 2023.\nThe following table presents the Company’s and the Bank’s regulatory and other capital ratios as of\nSeptember 30, 2024.\nAs of September 30, 2024\nCompany Bank\nTotal shareholders' equity to assets 6.61% 7.95%\nTangible common equity to tangible assets 1 6.54% 7.87%\nTier 1 leverage ratio 2 7.13% 8.53%\nCommon equity tier 1 capital ratio 2 9.37% 11.22%\nTier 1 capital ratio 2 9.37% 11.22%\nTotal risk-based capital ratio 2 12.79% 12.34%\n1 This information represents a non-GAAP financial measure.

i\nANNUAL\nMEETING\nCAUTIONARY NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS\nThe statements included in this proxy statement, including in the section entitled ‘‘EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION----Compensation\nDiscussion and Analysis----Business Highlights’’, regarding future financial performance, results of operations, expectations, plans,\nstrategies, goals, priorities and other statements that are not historical facts are forward-looking statements within the meaning of\nSection 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Forward-\nlooking statements are based upon current beliefs, expectations and assumptions and are subject to significant risks, uncertainties\nand changes in circumstances that could cause actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements. A detailed\ndiscussion of risks, uncertainties and changes in circumstances that could cause actual results and events to differ materially from\nsuch forward-looking statements is included in the section titled ‘‘Risk Factors’’ in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2023.

This proxy statement and the accompanying form of proxy, or a Notice of Internet Availability of\nProxy Materials, are being mailed to our shareholders on or about March 28, 2024.\nImportant Notice Regarding the Availability of Proxy Materials for the\nAnnual Meeting of Shareholders to be Held May 20, 2024\nCopies of the notice of annual meeting of shareholders, this proxy statement and the 2023 annual\nreport are each available at www.firstinternetbancorp.com.\nQUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ABOUT THE ANNUAL MEETING AND VOTING\nWhy are you conducting a virtual annual meeting?\nWe believe the online meeting format provides shareholders who would not otherwise be able to attend the annual meeting the\nopportunity to do so. It also conserves costs both for the Company and its shareholders. As in prior years, our shareholders will\ncontinue to be able to vote and submit questions during the meeting.\nWhat matters will be voted on at the meeting?\nThere are three substantive matters to be voted on at the meeting, as follows:\nBOARD VOTE\nPROPOSAL ADDITIONAL DETAIL\nRECOMMENDATION\nProposal 1: Election of eight directors to serve until the next annual meeting\nFOR each nominee Page 5\nof shareholders\nProposal 2: Advisory vote to approve compensation paid to our named\nFOR Page 36\nexecutive officers, also referred to as a “say-on-pay” vote\nProposal 3: Ratification of the appointment of FORVIS, LLP as our\nFOR Page 38\nindependent registered public accounting firm for 2024\nWhy did shareholders receive a Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials?\nAll of our shareholders will receive a Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials (the “Notice”) containing information on the\navailability of our proxy materials on the Internet, unless they previously requested a printed copy of the proxy materials.\nShareholders will not receive a printed copy of our proxy materials unless they request the materials in the manner described in\nthe Notice. The Notice explains how to access and review this proxy statement and our annual report for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2023, and how you may vote by proxy.\nWhat is a proxy?\nA proxy is your legal designation of another person to vote on your behalf. By voting over the Internet, by telephone or, if you\nreceive a printed copy of the proxy materials, by completing and returning a proxy card, you are giving the persons named,\nDavid B. Becker and Kenneth J. Lovik, the authority to vote your shares in the manner you indicate.\nWho is qualified to vote?\nShareholders of record as of the close of business on March 22, 2024 are entitled to vote at the annual meeting or any\nadjournments thereof. As of March 22, 2024, we had 8,661,354 shares of our common stock outstanding, each of which is entitled\nto one vote for each director nominee and one vote on each other item of business properly brought before the meeting.\n2024 1\nANNUAL\nMEETING\nHow many shares must be present to hold the meeting?\nThe presence in person (including virtually) or by proxy of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares entitled to vote at\nthe annual meeting, or 4,330,678 shares, is necessary to constitute a quorum for the transaction of business.\nWhat is the difference between a “SHAREHOLDER OF RECORD” and a “STREET NAME” holder?\nThese terms describe how your shares are held. You are a “SHAREHOLDER OF RECORD” if your shares are registered directly in\nyour name with our transfer agent, Computershare. You are a “STREET NAME” holder if your shares are held in the name of a\nbrokerage, bank, trust or other nominee as a custodian.\nHow do I vote my shares?\nIf you are a “SHAREHOLDER OF RECORD,” then you have several choices. You can vote your shares by proxy (i) over the Internet;\n(ii) by telephone; or (iii) if you receive a printed copy of the proxy card, by marking, signing, dating and mailing your proxy card.\nYou will need to have the Notice or, if you received a printed copy of the proxy materials, your proxy card, available when voting\nover the Internet or by telephone. Please refer to the specific instructions set forth on the Notice or proxy card. For security\nreasons, our electronic voting system has been designed to authenticate your identity as a shareholder. If you vote over the\nInternet or by telephone, you do not need to return a proxy card. If you hold your shares in “STREET NAME,” then your broker,\nbank, trustee or other nominee will provide you with materials and instructions for voting your shares.\nWhat do I need to do to attend the meeting and how do I vote my shares electronically?\nWe intend to hold our annual meeting virtually via the Internet, which you may access at\nwww.virtualshareholdermeeting.com/INBK2024. Only shareholders who owned our common stock as of the close of business\non March 22, 2024 will be entitled to attend the meeting.\n• If you are a \"SHAREHOLDER OF RECORD,\" you may vote your shares electronically and ask questions at the meeting by\nfollowing the instructions provided on the Notice or, if you received a printed copy of the proxy materials, your proxy card,\nto log into www.virtualshareholdermeeting.com/INBK2024. To participate in the annual meeting, you will need the 16-digit\ncontrol number provided on the Notice or your proxy card.\n• If your shares are held in \"STREET NAME,\" you may receive a voting instruction form with a 16-digit control number that will\nallow you to log into www.virtualshareholdermeeting.com/INBK2024, vote your shares electronically and ask questions. We\nencourage you to confirm the correct process for accessing the meeting with your broker, bank, trustee or other nominee in\nadvance. If you do not receive a 16-digit control number on your voting instruction form, you must request a legal proxy from\nyour broker, bank, trustee or other nominee that holds your shares. Please follow the instructions from your broker, bank,\ntrustee or other nominee or contact your broker, bank, trustee or other nominee to request a proxy form.\nEven if you currently plan to attend the meeting, we recommend that you vote by proxy, either via the Internet, by\ntelephone or by mail, so that your vote will be counted if you later decide not to attend the meeting.\nCan I vote electronically at the meeting?\nIf you are a \"SHAREHOLDER OF RECORD,\" then you may vote your shares electronically at the meeting.\nIf you hold your shares in \"STREET NAME,\" then you must obtain a legal proxy from your broker, bank, trustee or other nominee,\ngiving you the right to vote your shares electronically at the meeting.\nWhat are broker non-votes?\nA broker non-vote occurs when a nominee, such as a broker, holding shares for a beneficial owner does not vote on a particular\nproposal because the nominee does not have discretionary authority to vote on that particular proposal and has not received\ninstructions from the beneficial owner as to how to vote its shares. Proposals 1 and 2 each fall into this category.

The Audit Committee held four meetings during 2023.\nThe Audit Committee operates under a written charter, a copy of which is available at www.firstinternetbancorp.com.\nCompensation Committee\nThe Compensation Committee is responsible for reviewing and approving the compensation of our executive officers and directors\nand overseeing the Company’s overall compensation plans and benefits programs. The Compensation Committee also oversees the\nadministration of our equity plans, including granting awards to employees and directors under such plans, subject to appropriate\ndelegation. In determining the compensation of the executive officers other than our Chief Executive Officer, the Compensation\nCommittee considers the recommendations of the Chief Executive Officer.\nAll members of the Compensation Committee are “independent directors” as such term is defined under the Nasdaq rules; and “non-\nemployee directors” as such term is defined in Rule 16b-3 of the Exchange Act. All of the members also meet the additional\nindependence criteria for compensation committee members set forth in the Nasdaq and SEC rules promulgated under the Exchange\nAct. The Compensation Committee held five meetings during 2023.\nThe Compensation Committee operates under a written charter, a copy of which is available on our website at\nwww.firstinternetbancorp.com.\nCompensation Committee Interlocks and Insider Participation\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2023, no person who served as a member of our Compensation Committee was, during such\nperiod, an officer or employee of the Company, or has ever been one of our officers, and no such person had any transaction with us\nrequired to be disclosed in “Transactions with Related Persons” below. In addition, during the year ended December 31, 2023, (1) none\nof our executive officers served as a member of the compensation committee of another entity, one of whose executive officers\nserved on our Compensation Committee; (2) none of our executive officers served as a director of another entity, one of whose\nexecutive officers served on our Compensation Committee; and (3) none of our executive officers served as a member of the\ncompensation committee of another entity, one of whose executive officers served as one of our directors.\n10FIRST\nINTERNET\nBANCORP\nCORPORATE GOVERNANCE\nNominating and Corporate Governance Committee\nThe Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee assists the Board by identifying individuals qualified to become Board\nmembers, maintains our Corporate Governance Principles and Code of Business Conduct and Ethics, leads the Board in its periodic\nself-evaluations, recommends members and chairs for each standing committee, and determines and evaluates succession plans for\nour Chief Executive Officer and other named executive officers.\nAll members of the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee are “independent directors” as such term is defined under the\nNasdaq rules. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee held four meetings during 2023.\nWhile the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee is responsible for identifying potential Board members, director\ncandidates may be recommended by Board members, a third-party search firm or shareholders.\nIn identifying, evaluating and recommending nominees for the Board, the committee examines, among other things, the following\nqualifications and skills of director candidates: their character; their business or professional experience and length of service; their\nareas of expertise; their independence; their integrity and judgment; their records of public service; their ability to devote sufficient\ntime to the affairs of the Company; the diversity of backgrounds and experience they will bring to the Board; the current size and\ncomposition of the Board and its need for certain skills or experiences; and their understanding of our business. The Nominating and\nCorporate Governance Committee also believes that all nominees should be individuals of substantial accomplishment with\ndemonstrated leadership capabilities.\nAlthough the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee does not assign any particular weighting or priority to any of the\nfactors it considers in evaluating director candidates, the committee has established the following minimum qualifications which\neach nominee to the Board must possess: the highest personal and professional ethics and integrity; proven achievement and\ncompetence in the nominee’s field and the ability to exercise sound business judgment; skills that are complementary to those of the\nexisting Board; and the ability to assist and support management and make significant contributions to the Company’s success.\nThe Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee will consider candidates for director who are recommended by shareholders\nin the same manner as other candidates identified by the committee. A shareholder who wishes to recommend a director candidate\nfor consideration by the committee should send such recommendation to our Chief Financial Officer at 8701 E. 116th Street, Fishers,\nIndiana 46038, who will forward it to the committee. Any such recommendation must include the candidate’s name, home and\nbusiness contact information, detailed biographical data, relevant qualifications, a signed letter from the candidate confirming\nwillingness to serve, information regarding any relationships between the candidate and the Company and evidence of the\nrecommending shareholder’s ownership of Company stock. Such recommendations must also include a statement from the\nrecommending shareholder in support of the candidate, particularly within the context of the criteria for Board membership,\nincluding issues of character, integrity, judgment, diversity, independence, area(s) of expertise, experience, length of service,\npotential conflicts of interest, other commitments and the like and personal references.\nA shareholder who wishes to nominate an individual as a candidate for director without the recommendation of the Nominating and\nCorporate Governance Committee must comply with the advance notice and informational requirements set forth in our Bylaws,\nwhich are more fully explained later in this proxy statement under “Shareholder Proposals for 2025 Annual Meeting.”\nThe Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee operates under a written charter, a copy of which is available at\nwww.firstinternetbancorp.com.\nRisk Committee\nAs of March 18, 2024, the Board, upon recommendation from its Audit and Risk Committee and Nominating and Corporate\nGovernance Committee, divided the responsibilities of the Audit and Risk Committee into two standalone committees. The resulting\nRisk Committee’s primary purposes are to assist the Board in monitoring and overseeing the Company’s risk management\ngovernance structure and risk management framework, including the strategies, policies, and processes established by\nmanagement to identify, assess, measure, and manage the major risks facing the Company.\nThe Risk Committee operates under a written charter, a copy of which is available at www.firstinternetbancorp.com.\nShareholder Communications\nThe Board has implemented a process whereby shareholders may send communications to its attention, which is summarized in the\nCompany’s Corporate Governance Principles, a copy of which is available on our website at www.firstinternetbancorp.com. In cases\nwhere shareholders wish to communicate directly with the independent directors, email messages can be sent to klovik@firstib.com,\nor to First Internet Bancorp, 8701 E. 116th Street, Fishers, Indiana 46038, Attn: Chief Financial Officer. These messages will be\nforwarded to the appropriate committee of the Board or independent director.\n2024 11\nANNUAL\nMEETING\nCORPORATE GOVERNANCE\nCode of Business Conduct and Ethics\nWe have adopted a Code of Business Conduct and Ethics, which applies to all of our directors, officers and employees, including our\nprincipal executive officer, principal financial officer and principal accounting officer. A copy of the Code of Business Conduct and\nEthics is available on our website at www.firstinternetbancorp.com. We will disclose on our website any amendments or updates to\nour Code of Business Conduct and Ethics, or any grant of a waiver from a provision of our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics.\nTransactions with Related Persons\nPolicy for Approval of Related Person Transactions\nWe maintain a written policy for reviewing, approving and monitoring transactions involving the Company and related persons. The\nAudit Committee (formerly the Audit and Risk Committee) is responsible for review and oversight of all related party transactions. The\napplicable committee reviews and the Board must approve any related person transaction in which the Company is a participant\nbefore commencement of the transaction; provided, however, that if a related person transaction is identified after it commences,\nit will be brought to the committee for review and to the Board for possible ratification. The Board will approve or ratify a transaction\nonly if it determines that the transaction is beneficial to the Company and that the terms of the transaction are fair to the Company.\nFor these purposes, a “related person” includes our directors, nominees for director, executive officers, any holder of more than 5%\nof our common stock, and any immediate family member of any of the foregoing persons. A “related person transaction” means any\ntransaction, arrangement or relationship, or any series of similar transactions, arrangements or relationships, in which the Company\n(including any of its subsidiaries) is a participant and in which a related person has a direct or indirect interest, other than the\nfollowing:\n• payment of compensation by us to a related person for service as a director or executive officer;\n• transactions available to all employees or all shareholders on the same terms; and\n• transactions that, when aggregated with the amount of all other transactions between the related person and us, involve in any\nfiscal year the lesser of (i) $120,000 and (ii) one percent of the average of our total assets at year-end for the last two completed\nfiscal years.\nIn determining whether to approve a related person transaction, the Audit Committee and the Board will analyze factors such as\nwhether the transaction is material to the Company, the role the related person has played in arranging the transaction, the structure\nof the transaction and the interests of all related persons in the transaction.\nBased on the results of the Audit Committee’s review, the Board may approve or disapprove any related person transaction.\nApproval of a related person transaction may be conditioned upon the Company and the related person following certain\nprocedures designated in connection with its approval. With regard to any transaction for which ratification is sought, the Audit\nCommittee may require amendment or termination of the transaction under the authority conferred by the policy.\nBanking Transactions with Related Persons\nThe Bank offers loans and banking services to directors, executive officers and employees in the ordinary course of business on\nsubstantially the same terms, including interest rate and collateral, as those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with\nothers not related to the Company, and which do not involve more than the normal risk of collectability or present other unfavorable\nfeatures. Federal banking regulations permit executive officers and directors to participate, subject to certain limits, in loan\nprograms that are available to other employees, so long as the director or executive officer is not given preferential treatment\ncompared to other participating employees.\nAlthough the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the “Sarbanes-Oxley Act”) generally prohibits a public company from extending credit,\narranging for the extension of credit or renewing an extension of credit in the form of a personal loan to an executive officer or\ndirector, there are several exceptions to this general prohibition, including loans made by an FDIC-insured depository institution that\nis subject to the insider lending restrictions of the Federal Reserve Act. All loans to directors and executive officers are designed to\ncomply with the Federal Reserve Act and the Federal Reserve’s Regulation O.\nDuring 2022 and 2023, the Bank engaged in transactions in the ordinary course of business with some of our executive officers,\ndirectors and entities with which they are associated. These transactions involved loans and other banking services that were in the\nordinary course of business and on substantially the same terms, including interest rates and collateral, as those prevailing at the\ntime for comparable transactions with others not related to the Company and did not involve more than the normal risk of\ncollectability or present other unfavorable features. All such loan transactions were performing in accordance with their terms as of\nthe date of this proxy statement.\n12FIRST\nINTERNET\nBANCORP\nCORPORATE GOVERNANCE\nOther Transactions with Related Persons\nThe Audit Committee and the Board approved and/or ratified the following related person transactions pursuant to the Company’s\nrelated person transaction policy during 2022 and 2023:\nThe Company made a $2,000,000 capital contribution in May of 2021 to become a limited partner in the GenOpp Fund owning less\nthan 5.0% of the GenOpp Fund’s outstanding partner interests. Mr. Fenech serves as managing member of the general partner of the\nGenOpp Fund and as the principal owner and Chief Investment Officer of the investment manager for the GenOpp Fund. The Board\nand Audit and Risk Committee received regular reporting on the performance of the GenOpp Fund. After Mr. Fenech was identified\nas a potential director nominee, however, the Audit and Risk Committee conducted further review of the Company’s investment\nunder the Company’s Related Person Transaction Approval Policy, including the terms of the GenOpp Fund, the limited amount at\nissue, and the Company’s compliance with Board-approved policies prior to making the investment in the GenOpp Fund. After review,\nthe Audit and Risk Committee determined that the Company’s investment was made in compliance with Board-approved policies,\nwas on market terms, and on terms that are both fair and beneficial to the Company. The Audit & Risk Committee approved the\ninvestment under the Company’s Related Person Transaction Approval Policy, and the independent members of the Board ratified\nthe Audit & Risk Committee’s determinations. In 2022, GenOpp Capital Management LP received $34,316 in fees that can be\nattributed to the Company’s investment in the GenOpp Fund. In 2023, GenOpp Capital Management LP received $35,000 in fees that\ncan be attributed to the Company’s investment in the GenOpp Fund.\nOn October 20, 2021, SPF15, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Bank, executed a lease and management agreement (the “Lease”)\nwith Monterey Grill Two LLC k/n/a Tiburon LLC (“Tiburon”). The Lease provides for the lease by SPF15, Inc. to Tiburon of\napproximately 7,064 square feet of space on the first floor of SPF15, Inc.’s building located at 8701 East 116th Street, Fishers, IN 46038\n(the “Leased Premises”). The co-owner of Tiburon passed away unexpectedly just as tenant improvement work began on the Leased\nPremises, stalling progress. Thereafter, and understanding that David Becker, Chairman and CEO of the Company, desired to\npurchase an ownership interest in Tiburon and to help it move forward with the tenant improvements required to open in the Leased\nPremises, the Audit and Risk Committee of the Board reviewed the Lease as a potential related person transaction under the\nCompany’s related person transaction policy. After review, the Audit and Risk Committee determined that the Lease had been\nnegotiated and entered into on market terms with the advice and assistance of outside counsel and a real estate broker prior to any\ninvolvement by a related person and that the terms of the Lease are both fair and beneficial to the Company. The Audit & Risk\nCommittee approved the Lease under the Company’s Related Person Transaction Approval Policy, and the independent members of\nthe Board ratified the Audit & Risk Committee’s determinations. Mr. Becker thereafter invested in and became an indirect co-owner\nand an officer of Tiburon. SPF15, Inc. did not receive any payments under the Lease in 2023. SPF15, Inc. expects to receive\napproximately $230,000 in payments from Tiburon under the Lease in 2024.\n2024 13\nANNUAL\nMEETING\nEXECUTIVE COMPENSATION\nCompensation Discussion and Analysis\nThis Compensation Discussion and Analysis (“Compensation Discussion”) describes and explains the material elements of 2023\ncompensation for our Chief Executive Officer and our other named executive officers. Detailed information regarding the\ncompensation of these executive officers, also called ‘‘Named Executive Officers’’ or ‘‘NEOs,” is set forth in the tables comprising this\nCompensation Discussion. We also provide in this Compensation Discussion an overview of our executive compensation philosophy\nand executive compensation program and summarize the Compensation Committee’s process for making pay decisions, including\nits rationale for specific decisions related to the 2023 performance year. The Compensation Committee is referred to as the\n“Committee” for the remainder of the Compensation Discussion.\nOur Named Executive Officers were as follows for 2023:\nNAME TITLES\nDavid B. Becker Chairman and Chief Executive Officer\nNicole S. Lorch President, Chief Operating Officer and Corporate Secretary\nKenneth J. Lovik Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer\nYou should read this section of the proxy statement when determining your vote on the compensation of our NEOs.\n(See Proposal 2: Advisory Vote to Approve Executive Compensation.)\nThis Compensation Discussion contains information that is important to your voting decision.\nConsideration of 2023 Advisory Vote on Compensation\nAt the annual meeting of shareholders held in 2023 (the “2023 Annual Meeting”), of the votes cast for or against the non-binding\nadvisory proposal to approve executive compensation (the “say-on-pay advisory vote”), approximately 75% of the votes were cast\nFOR that proposal. Thereafter, the Company discussed the results of 2023 say-on-pay advisory vote with shareholders by phone and\nat investor meetings. No shareholders voiced concern over the Company’s executive compensation or executive compensation\npolicies or provided any specific feedback. As a result, and because no significant changes had been made to the Company’s\ncompensation program from 2022, when the say-on-pay-advisory vote received more than 95% FOR votes, the Committee did not\nmake significant changes to its executive compensation program in 2023.\nBusiness Highlights\nThe Company is well-positioned to celebrate its twenty-five (25) year anniversary, emerging from 2023 with a record-high $4.1 billion\nin deposits and $5.2 billion in total assets. Unlike the vast majority of the banking industry, the Company again grew book value and\ntangible book value, with increases of $1.71 and $1.69, or 4.2%, respectively, year over year. Over the last ten years, we have grown\ntangible book value at a compounded annual growth rate in excess of 8%. This track record of growth in book value per share is a\ntestament to the strong stewardship of our Board and executive officers, who have maintained focus on a strong credit culture and\nstrategic growth while positioning the Company to capitalize on its unique, digital brand. 2023 highlights included:\n• Continued growth in our loan portfolio, as portfolio balances totaled $3.8 billion at year end, up 10.0% compared to year-\nend 2022\n• Strong growth in deposits, which increased over 18% year-over-year to $4.1 billion\n• We were and remain a top 10 SBA 7(a) program lender, continuing to demonstrate our commitment to the entrepreneurs\nand small businesses that make our country work\n• Asset quality remained strong, with nonperforming assets representing just 20 basis points of total assets at year-end, and\nnonperforming loans representing just 26 basis points of total loans\n• Active share buyback program repurchasing 502,525 common shares at an average price of $18.40 per share during 2023;\n• Book value per common share increased to $41.97, up from $40.26 as of December 31, 2022\n• Tangible book value per share increased to $41.43, up from $39.74 as of December 31, 2022\n• Strong capital and liquidity, with $1.6 billion in cash and unused borrowing capacity as of year-end\n• Uninsured deposits represent only 25% of total deposits, or 19% after excluding Indiana-based public funds and certain\ndeposits under contractual agreements that restrict withdrawals\n• Increased diversification in our loan portfolio and deposit composition, further reducing our reliance on any one line of\nbusiness or customer type\n• Continued repositioning of our loan portfolio, which improves our interest rate risk profile and should generate greater\nrevenue going forward\n• Exited the residential mortgage origination business, which was cyclical and transactional, to remove an element of\nvolatility from future earnings, especially with the steep decline in mortgage volume and negative outlook for the next\nseveral years\n• Managed our Company and balance sheet through the most challenging interest rate cycle in recent memory; we expect\nnet interest margin (“NIM”) to continue to improve throughout 2024\n14 FIRST\nINTERNET\nBANCORP\nEXECUTIVE COMPENSATION\nExecution of our business strategy by our management team has driven these significant achievements, as shown below:\n2024 15\nANNUAL\nMEETING\nEXECUTIVE COMPENSATION\nWe accomplished the foregoing while maintaining an exceptional credit culture with minimal net charge-offs. The following charts\ndetail our track record of exceptional credit quality:\nNONPERFORMING ASSETS / TOTAL ASSETS NONPERFORMING LOANS / TOTAL LOANS\n0.22% 0.22%\n0.20% 0.20% 0.33%\n0.17% 0.26% 0.26%\n0.23% 0.22%\n2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023\nALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES / NONPERFORMING LOANS NET CHARGE-OFFS / AVERAGE LOANS\n422%\n376% 389% 0.31%\n332%\n290%\n0.09%\n0.07% 0.06%\n0.03%\n2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023\nWe believe our exceptional credit quality is due, in part, to the structuring of our compensation program, which is designed to\ndisincentivize excessive risk. Our strong credit culture drives our asset quality.\nCompensation Policies & Practices\nThe goals of our executive compensation program are to grow or create additional shareholder value while motivating and retaining\nexecutives. Our executive compensation program is grounded in the following policies and practices, which promote sound\ncompensation governance, enhance our pay-for-performance philosophy and further align our executives’ interests with those of\nour shareholders:\nWHAT WE DO WHAT WE DO NOT DO\n Significant emphasis on performance-based, “at-risk”  Provide tax gross-ups in our compensation plans.\ncompensation.  Allow unlimited or unrestricted hedging or pledging\n Incentive award metrics that are objective and tied to key transactions by executive officers or directors.\ncompany performance metrics.\n Provide our executives with executive-only perquisites.\n 40% of equity awards vest over three years to promote\nretention.  No dividends paid on unvested equity awards for NEOs.\n 60% of equity awards are performance-based and “cliff\nvest” after three-year performance period to promote\nachievement of long-term performance goals.\n Incentive plans with threshold performance and\nassociated payout levels, below which no incentive\nawards are paid.\n Incentive plans with capped maximum payouts.\n A “claw-back” is required under our Compensation\nRecoupment Policy.\n Share ownership guidelines for executives and directors.\n Consider our ‘‘say-on-pay’’ vote results when making\ncompensation decisions.\n16FIRST\nINTERNET\nBANCORP\nEXECUTIVE COMPENSATION\nCompensation Recoupment Policy\nWe previously maintained compensation recoupment policies covering recovery of bonuses and equity compensation received by\nexecutive officers under certain circumstances. In light of the incentive compensation recovery rules and listing standards that\nbecame effective on October 2, 2023, we timely adopted a Compensation Recoupment Policy pursuant to, and in compliance with,\nSEC regulations and Nasdaq listing standards.\nIn summary, the Compensation Recoupment Policy applies to all incentive-based compensation, which is any compensation that is\ngranted, earned, or vested based wholly or in part upon the attainment of a financial reporting measure, received by Section 16\nofficers of the Company. The Compensation Recoupment Policy provides that, in the event of an accounting restatement, the\nCommittee will determine the amount of the erroneously awarded compensation, which is the excess of the amount of incentive-\nbased compensation received by current and former executive officers during the three completed fiscal years immediately\npreceding the required restatement date over the amount of incentive-based compensation that otherwise would have been\nreceived had it been determined based on the restated amounts. The Company will recover the erroneously awarded compensation\nin a reasonable and prompt manner using any lawful method, subject to limited exceptions as permitted by Nasdaq listing standards.\nIn addition, in the case of an accounting restatement, if the bonuses that should have been paid to the officers who received them\nbased on the financial statements which were restated were greater than the bonus that was actually paid (if any), then the Company\nwill pay to the officer such difference.\nStock Ownership Guidelines\nThe Board has approved stock ownership guidelines for our NEOs and non-employee directors (the “Covered Individuals”). The\nguidelines expect that the Covered Individuals will own at least a specified value of the Company’s common stock within five years\nafter the person becomes a Covered Individual. The securities that count toward satisfaction of the guidelines are shares of common\nstock, owned directly or indirectly through a specified entity, vested shares of restricted stock or stock units, and deferred stock\nrights.\nThe current recommended minimum values are four times annual base salary for Mr. Becker, two times annual base salary for the\nother NEOs, and $100,000 for each non-employee director. As of December 31, 2023, and the date of this proxy statement, all\nCovered Individuals were in compliance with their respective required stock ownership values.\nEmployee, Officer and Director Hedging Prohibition\nEach of our directors, officers, other employees and their designees are prohibited from (i) purchasing financial instruments\n(including prepaid variable forward contracts, equity swaps, collars and exchange funds) that hedge or offset, or are designed to\nhedge of offset, any decrease in the market value of our equity securities and (ii) otherwise engaging in transactions that hedge or\noffset, or are designed to hedge of offset, any decrease in the market value of our equity securities. Notwithstanding the foregoing,\nportfolio diversification transactions and investments in broad-based index funds is generally permitted. The prohibition applies to\nsecurities granted to the covered persons as part of compensation for their service to the Company plus any other Company\nsecurities held by them, whether directly or indirectly. As of December 31, 2023 and the date of this proxy statement, all directors,\nofficers and other employees and their designees were in compliance with this policy.\nOur Stock Trading Policy\nThis policy prohibits executive officers and non-employee directors from holding Company shares in a margin account or otherwise\npledging Company shares as collateral for a loan (with one exception granted in the 2000s that was grandfathered into the newer\nversion of the policy). The policy also prohibits executive officers and non-employee directors from entering into hedging,\nmonetization or similar transactions involving Company shares that are intended to realize the value of, or limit the risks and rewards\nof owning, Company shares. As of December 31, 2023 and the date of this proxy statement, all executive officers and non-employee\ndirectors were in compliance with this policy.\nRegularly Meeting with Outside Investors\nWe strive to ensure peak alignment of Company and executive performance and seek input from the investment community in this\nregard. Our NEOs proactively engage in outreach efforts with our investors, which we believe allows them to more fully understand\nour executive compensation philosophy and program and provide us with an opportunity to respond to their questions regarding our\npublic disclosures. In addition, our executive officers regularly attend financial conferences with most, if not all, of the brokerage\nfirms that cover our stock.\n2024 17\nANNUAL\nMEETING\nEXECUTIVE COMPENSATION\nWhat Guides Our Executive Compensation Program – Compensation Philosophy\nThe Committee believes that the Company’s strong record of growth, and unique business model in the market, position the Company\nwell for the future, and that shareholder support and a strong executive compensation structure are essential elements to continue\nand further this success. Our goal is to maintain a competitive, balanced compensation program that rewards our NEOs for current\nyear performance and for the creation of long-term shareholder value, without exposing the Company to unreasonable risk,\nincluding credit, interest rate, liquidity, reputation, legal and compliance risk.\nOur executive compensation program has been designed to hold executives accountable for the financial and operational\nperformance of the Company, by balancing the co-priorities of the creation of long-term shareholder value and the appropriate\nlevel of risk.\nOur executive compensation philosophy is grounded on three fundamental principles:\nPRINCIPLE GOAL HOW IT IS ACCOMPLISHED\nEstablish corporate, departmental, and individual goals\nDrive performance based on the consistent with our strategic plan and budget that\n1\nPay for Performance achievement of our overall financial provide the basis for the short and long-term metrics used\nresults and individual contributions. to measure our success and the value that we create for\nshareholders.\nReward our executives for Company, Bank and\nPay at levels that will attract, motivate, individual performance.\n2\nCompetitiveness and retain highly-qualified, talented Align compensation and variable incentives with\nexecutives responsible for our success. measurable, objective, business results and\nappropriate risk management.\nNEOs are required to be shareholders and own a minimum\nlevel of Company stock throughout their employment.\nReinforce a culture of ownership and\n3 60% of the LTIP awards are performance-based, with a 3-\nShareholder Alignment long-term commitment to\nyear measurement period, and vest at the end of a three-\nshareholder value creation.\nyear period ONLY IF the established long-term\nperformance goals are achieved.\nCompensation Mix\nThe Committee strives to establish a total compensation package that appropriately rewards our NEOs for performance, aligns the\ninterests of our NEOs with shareholders’ interests, is competitive with the market, does not encourage or incentivize inappropriate\nrisk, and complies with all legal and regulatory guidelines. Incentive compensation is predominantly long term, with a substantial\nportion at risk depending upon our performance, including the creation of long term shareholder value.\nThe mix of compensation awarded in 2023 to our NEOs reflects our compensation philosophy. The only element of compensation not\nsubject to risk, other than fringe benefits, is the NEO’s base salary; as such, a substantial portion of our executives’ compensation is\nperformance-based and at risk, thereby further aligning the interests of our NEOs and our shareholders. The charts below show the\ntarget total direct compensation of our CEO and our other NEOs for fiscal 2023, broken down by base salary, annual cash incentive\nbonus plan, time-vested restricted stock units (“TRSUs”) and performance-based restricted stock units (“PRSUs”).\n2023 Compensation Mix(1) 2023 Compensation Mix(1)\nCEO Other NEOs\nTRSUs TRSUs\n14% 12%\nBase PRSUs\nSalary 18% Base\nPRSUs\n42% Salary\n20%\n46%\nAnnual\nAnnual Bonus Plan\nBonus Plan 24%\n24%\n(1) Based on target payouts.\n18FIRST\nINTERNET\nBANCORP\nEXECUTIVE COMPENSATION\nCulture of the Company\nWe encourage our employees, including our executives, to “Imagine More.” We seek the game-changers, innovators and dreamers –\nthose who are driven to find a better way of doing things for customers and each other. We encourage community involvement and\nopportunities that support team members, both inside and outside the office. We may be a digital bank, but we strongly believe in the\npower of personal connection and collaboration, resulting in a relationship rich culture that enables us to live to our very best\npotential. Our focus on employees is evident in the number of “best workplace” awards we have been honored with over the years,\nincluding being named one of “central Indiana’s Top Workplaces” by The Indianapolis Star for ten years in a row. We believe that our\nexcellent pay packages, a culture of growth and innovation, and Company-wide pride in our exemplary customer service all enhance\nour ability to attract and retain top talent.\nThe Process for Compensation Decisions\nThe Committee, our CEO and outside advisors all play a role in compensation decisions. The sections that follow describe these\nparties’ respective roles in the compensation-setting process, as well as other important factors that impact compensation\ndecisions.\nRole of the Compensation Committee\nThe Committee is composed entirely of independent directors as determined under the Nasdaq rules. The Committee determines the\nappropriate allocation of each NEO’s potential compensation among base salary, short-term incentive compensation, long-term\nincentive compensation, and other components. Based on our strategic plan and budget, the Committee sets the appropriate goals\nand measures under the Annual Bonus Plan and LTIP and communicates those goals and measures to covered NEOs.\nThe responsibilities of the Committee include:\n• determining our executive compensation philosophy, objectives, policies and programs;\n• administering our compensation programs; and\n• approving or ratifying all compensation-related decisions for the NEOs.\nWhen making executive compensation decisions, the Committee analyzes and seriously considers the feedback of shareholder\nadvisory firms who are communicating our shareholders’ questions and concerns, as well as feedback received directly from\nshareholders.\nIn addition, the Committee regularly:\n• engages an independent compensation consultant and considers input from such compensation consultant; and,\n• considers readily available market data to assess the appropriateness and competitiveness of our current compensation\npractices.\nRole of Executive Management\nFor all executives other than our CEO, the Committee considers the recommendation of our CEO with respect to salary levels. Our\nCEO’s compensation is determined by the Committee. The Committee applies the same principles for executive compensation in\ndetermining our CEO’s compensation that it applies in determining the compensation of our other NEOs. The CEO is not present during\ndeliberations or voting on his compensation.\nRole of Outside Consultants\nPursuant to authority in its charter, the Committee regularly engages a compensation consultant to assist in compensation matters.\nThe Committee engaged Aon plc as its independent compensation consultant to assist in this process. The Committee has assessed\nthe independence of Aon plc pursuant to SEC rules and concluded that the firm’s work for the Committee does not raise any conflict\nof interest. The Committee utilized certain comparative information provided by Aon plc as a data point in its evaluation of the\nappropriateness and competitiveness of our 2023 executive compensation program and on matters of director compensation.\nRetained directly by the Committee and reporting directly to the Committee, Aon plc prepared a comprehensive “Executive\nCompensation Review” report. In this report, Aon plc provided peer group analysis, an evaluation of the comments received from\nproxy advisory firms, as well as other market information to help guide the Committee in its review and decision-making process. This\nreport helped inform the Committee in structuring the NEOs’ compensation program. The Committee believes these actions enhance\nthe alignment between executive compensation and Company performance and grow shareholder value.\n2024 19\nANNUAL\nMEETING\nEXECUTIVE COMPENSATION\nCompensation of Executives in 2023\nElements of Compensation\nThe compensation packages for our Named Executive Officers consist primarily of an annual base salary, short-term incentive\ncompensation and long-term incentive compensation. The Committee believes that our competitive compensation is an appropriate\nreflection of our growth and industry leadership, and has been in an important factor in our executives’ satisfaction, performance\nand retention.\n• Annual Base Salaries. This is the only element of executive compensation, other than employee benefits that are available to all\nemployees, that is not at risk. We utilize base salaries to compensate our NEOs for day-to-day contributions and expertise. We\nbelieve that offering competitive base salaries is a key factor in attracting and retaining talent. When deciding on the\nappropriate annual base salary for each NEO, the Committee takes into consideration the recommendations of our CEO (with\nrespect to the other NEOs), readily available market data, as well as the individual’s performance, his or her roles and\nresponsibilities and related experience in the role.\n• Short-Term Incentive Compensation. In December 2022, the Committee established performance targets for 2023 under the\nAnnual Bonus Plan, consisting of target net income, net interest income, ratio of nonperforming assets to total assets and Texas\nRatio. The Annual Bonus Plan provides for awards to be earned for a fiscal year under each plan criterion, independent of the\nother criteria. For each metric, the Committee determined a threshold, target and maximum level of achievement based on the\nCompany’s operating plan for 2023. The specific threshold, target and maximum opportunity for each NEO is expressed as a\npercentage of annual base salary, reflective of the NEO’s role and our compensation philosophy. Awards are interpolated to the\nnext whole percent between the threshold, target and maximum goals. The four performance metrics were evenly weighted at\n25% each for 2023.\nIn March 2024, the Committee, utilizing the Company’s audited financial statements, reviewed and determined the Company’s\n2023 performance against the applicable performance targets under the Annual Bonus Plan and determined that the corporate\nperformance goals were achieved on a weighted combined basis at 58% of target. For 2023, the Committee determined that the\nperformance level with respect to net income was below threshold, net interest income was below threshold, the nonperforming\nassets to total assets metric was over the maximum metric and the Texas Ratio metric was over the maximum metric.\n• Long-Term Incentive Compensation. The First Internet Bancorp 2013 Equity Incentive Plan (the “2013 Plan”) and the First Internet\nBancorp 2022 Equity Incentive Plan (the “2022 Plan”) are shareholder-approved plans that permitted (in the case of the 2013 Plan)\nor permit (in the case of the 2022 Plan) the Committee to provide executives with equity-based compensation opportunities. The\nCommittee believes that equity-based awards that include multi-year vesting requirements provide our executives with an\nownership stake in the Company, promote executive retention and are prudent in light of competitive market conditions. The\nCommittee also believes that grants of restricted stock units are an effective means to align the interests of executives more\nclosely with those of our shareholders and that grants of performance-based equity awards directly link executive\ncompensation with performance.\nBoth PRSUs (60% of total) and TRSUs (40% of total) were awarded for 2021, 2022 and 2023. These equity-based awards are\ngenerally designed with the following features:\n• PRSUs\nPerformance goals in PRSUs are tied to performance metrics, which were return on average assets and nonperforming\no\nasset ratio (i.e., total dollar amount of nonperforming assets divided by dollar amount of total assets) for 2021 through\n2023 PRSUs;\nIf the nonperforming asset ratio goal is not met, no PRSU awards vest;\no\nIf the nonperforming asset ratio goal is met, the PRSUs vest based upon the level of performance relative to the return\no\non average assets goal;\nThe number of PRSUs earned scales with performance relative to performance metric goal, up to a capped amount;\no\nand\nPRSUs “cliff vest,” if earned, at end of three-year performance period.\no\n• TRSUs vest in three substantially equal installments over three years.\nThe Committee believes that shareholder value is and will be driven more by an increase in net income and resulting increase in\nreturn on average assets. In making this decision, the Committee considered the non-performing asset ratio metric essential to\nassure that the Company was not encouraging excessive risk taking by management.\nWe believe that this equity incentive award structure for our NEOs aligns our compensation structure for NEOs with current\nindustry standards and shareholder interests.\nIn 2023, the Committee awarded an aggregate of 49,153 restricted stock units (“RSUs”) to our NEOs, consisting of 29,492 (60%)\nPRSUs (at target level) and 19,661 (40%) TRSUs, under the 2022 Equity Plan and in accordance with the Company’s long-term\nincentive program.\n20FIRST\nINTERNET\nBANCORP\nEXECUTIVE COMPENSATION\nIn March 2024, the Committee, utilizing the Company’s audited financial statements, reviewed the Company’s 2023\nperformance to determine whether the Company had achieved the nonperforming assets ratio and return on average assets\ngoals governing PRSUs granted to NEOs in 2021. The Committee determined that the nonperforming assets ratio goal had been\nmet, but that the return on average assets goal had not been met. The Committee therefore determined that none of the PRSUs\ngranted to NEOs in 2021 had vested, and those PRSUs were forfeited.\n• Broad- Based Benefits. We provide employee benefits to our NEOs on the same terms as provided to our other employees in an\neffort to encourage retention, including retirement and other related benefits.\n• Medical, Disability and Life Insurance. All full-time employees, including our NEOs, participate in insurance benefits\ncoverage to help manage the financial impact of ill health, disability and death. NEOs are also eligible to participate in\nincreased life insurance coverage at their election.\n• Retirement Benefits. We maintain a 401(k) plan for substantially all employees, as defined in the plan. Employees may\ncontribute to the plan, and we match employee contributions equal to 100% of the first 1% of employee deferrals and then\n50% on deferrals over 1% up to a maximum of 6% of an individual’s total eligible compensation, which vests immediately. In\naddition, we have not historically but may make additional discretionary matching contributions which vest at a rate of\n50% per year of employment and are fully vested after the completion of two years of employment.\n• Employee Stock Purchase Plan. We maintain an employee stock purchase plan (the “ESPP”), in which all of our full-time\nemployees are eligible to participate. The ESPP permits employees to acquire shares of our common stock through periodic\npayroll deductions. Purchases under the ESPP are not subject to any discount or supplemental employer contribution or\nsubsidy.\nPeer Group Competitive Compensation Analysis\nIn evaluating whether compensation for our NEOs is competitive, the Committee collects compensation data from a group of\ncompanies for use as an additional data point. However, the Company’s unique business model limits the efficacy of “peer group”\ndata. For example, we have a national footprint in that, through our platform, we gather deposits, make public finance loans, single\ntenant lease loans, healthcare finance loans, franchise finance loans and small business loans on a nationwide basis. But unlike most\nlarge banks with a national footprint, our footprint thus far is the result of organic growth and is without the benefit of any acquisition\nof another financial institution, without a wealth management division, and without an insurance affiliate. Further, unlike most large\nbanks with a national footprint we have no “brick and mortar” branch network, nor its resulting overhead. Similarly, traditional\ncommunity banks with assets of $3.5 billion to $6 billion generally do not have our national deposit customer base or a national lending\nplatform. Unlike our company, most of these community banks of similar size have grown in part by acquisitions. Also, unlike us, these\ncommunity banks frequently have a branch network to maintain and manage.\nAs a result of the foregoing, the Committee has been challenged to identify a suitable peer group for use in making compensation\ndecisions. Nonetheless, with the assistance of Aon plc, in 2022 the Committee identified a group of bank and financial holding\ncompanies for use in making compensation decisions for 2023. The selected peer group was less focused on high growth peers and\nmore focused on peers who, similar to the Company, are without significant wealth management, insurance, or mortgage servicing\nrevenue. With the assistance of Aon plc, the Committee identified the following financial institutions:\n1. Axos Financial Inc. 9. Hingham Institute for Savings\n2. Bridgewater Bancshares, Inc. 10. Mercantile Bank Corp.\n3. Brookline Bancorp, Inc. 11. National Bank Holdings Corp.\n4. Business First Bancshares, Inc. 12. Primis Financial Corp.\n5. CrossFirst Bankshares, Inc. 13. Republic Bancorp Inc.\n6. Equity Bancshares, Inc. 14. SmartFinancial, Inc.\n7. Farmers & Merchants Bancorp 15. Southern First Bancshares Inc.\n8. Heritage Commerce Corp. 16. Stellar Bancorp, Inc.\nThe common characteristics of these organizations were:\n• asset size ranging from $2.5 billion to $9 billion, with a median asset size of approximately $4.2 billion;\n• no significant wealth management, insurance, or mortgage servicing revenue; and\n• located in Metropolitan Statistical Areas 3-100 (this excludes New York and Los Angeles, and banks headquartered in\nsmaller metropolitan areas).\nOne “exception” to the size parameter above in the peer group is Axos Financial, Inc., which had $18.7 billion in assets at December 31,\n2022. Axos Financial, Inc., was selected to be a part of the peer group because its business model most closely follows our model.\nThe Committee met in December of 2022 and made decisions on the 2023 base salary for our NEOs, the terms of the 2023 Annual Bonus\nPlan, and the terms of the Company’s long-term incentive program for 2023. The Committee met in March 2024 to determine and\nmake awards based on 2023 performance under the 2023 Annual Bonus Plan and PRSU award agreements entered into in 2021.\n2024 21\nANNUAL\nMEETING\nEXECUTIVE COMPENSATION\n2023 Base Salaries\nIn considering the base salary amounts for 2023, the Committee considered each NEO’s:\n• skills, qualifications and experience;\n• responsibilities and future potential;\n• salary level for the prior fiscal year; and\n• performance, as reflected in his or her performance review.\nThe Committee also reviewed the organic growth of the Company and the related balance sheet management, and the performance\nof the Company.\nIn determining the salary of Mr. Becker, the Committee also considered that Mr. Becker was instrumental in creating the unique\nbusiness model of the Company. The Committee believes that the Company’s senior leadership team has provided strong, steady and\nseasoned leadership for the Company, created a scalable technology driven business model with a nationwide loan and deposit\ngenerating platform, and promoted a culture of excellent customer service, which has resulted in additional growth and value.\nThe following table sets forth the annual base salary of each of the NEOs for 2022 and the annual base salary established by the\nCommittee for each of those NEOs for 2023, as well as the percentage increase between the two years:\nANNUAL BASE SALARY\nNAME\n2022 2023\n% CHANGE\nDavid B.

In addition, pursuant to the CEO’s\nrequest, the CEO did not receive an annual base salary increase for 2023.\n2023 Short-Term Incentive Compensation\nThe Committee also established short-term incentive performance goals for 2023 for senior management, including all of our NEOs,\npursuant to the Annual Bonus Plan. The Annual Bonus Plan criteria for 2023 provided an opportunity for each participant to earn an\nannual cash bonus based on the Company’s achievement (at threshold, target and maximum levels) of budgeted goals for net\nincome, net interest income, ratio of nonperforming assets to total assets and Texas Ratio.\nThe budgeted goals are those which were established in the 2023 annual budget of the Company approved by the Board of Directors.\nThese budgeted goals were $21.0 million for net income, $90.8 million for net interest income, 1.00% for the ratio of nonperforming\nassets to total assets and 10.0% for Texas Ratio.\nThe Annual Bonus Plan also required that the following conditions be met for payments to be made with respect to 2023:\n• The executive must have achieved a satisfactory individual 2023 performance rating.\n• The Company must have reported positive net income for 2023 (taking into account the expense of paying all incentive\ncompensation but not any expense attributable to the cost of raising capital).\n• The Company must have declared in 2023, and paid not later than January 31, 2024, a specified amount of cash dividends.\n• The Bank must have received a satisfactory regulatory review for the immediately preceding fiscal year, as determined by the\nCommittee.\nIf the financial goals and conditions were met, then each NEO would be eligible to receive a cash bonus that would range from the\nfollowing minimum and maximum percentages of the officer’s annual base salary:\nPERCENTAGE OF ANNUAL BASE SALARY\nNAMED EXECUTIVE OFFICER THRESHOLD TARGET MAXIMUM\n(90%) (100%) (115%)\nDavid B.

Becker $280,000 35%\nNicole S. Lorch $175,000 35%\nKenneth J. Lovik $109,200 30%\n2023 Long-Term Incentive Compensation Actions\nIn January 2023, the Committee granted equity incentive awards to our senior management, including our NEOs. These equity\nincentive awards to the NEOs are comprised of both PRSUs and TRSUs and have a vesting and/or performance period of three years,\nas detailed below.\nThe number of RSUs awarded to each NEO was determined by dividing a percentage of the NEO’s annual base salary by a reference\nprice equal to the closing price of a share of common stock on the last trading day of 2022, which was $24.28. Mr. Becker and Ms. Lorch\neach received an award representing 75% of his or her respective annual base salary, and Mr. Lovik received an award representing\n60% of his annual base salary. As a result, the following RSUs were awarded to our NEOs for 2023:\nPRSUs TOTAL RSUs\nNAME TRSUs\n(TARGET PAYOUT) (TARGET PAYOUT)\nDavid B. Becker 14,827 9,885 24,712\nNicole S. Lorch 9,267 6,178 15,445\nKenneth J. Lovik 5,398 3,598 8,996\nThe PRSUs (60% of total RSUs based on target payout) may be earned by the NEO depending on the Company’s achievement of\nperformance goals established by the Committee for return on average assets and the non-performing asset percentage, as\nmeasured over a three-year period (beginning January 1, 2023 and ending on December 31, 2025). The PRSUs provide:\n• The Company must achieve the gateway goal for non-performing assets, as determined by the Committee, at the end of the\nthree-year performance period; otherwise, none of the PRSUs will vest and all of the PRSUs shall be forfeited.\n• If the Company achieves the goal for non-performing assets, a number of PRSUs will be eligible to vest at the end of the\nperformance period based on the achievement by the Company of the return on average assets goal, as determined by the\nCommittee. The number of PRSUs that will vest will range from 0% (if performance is below the threshold level), 50% (if\nperformance is at the threshold level), 100% (if performance is at target) to 150% (if performance is at or above the maximum\nlevel.)\n• If at least threshold performance has been met, a number of PRSUs depending on performance will be earned and will vest as of\nDecember 31, 2025, the end of the three-year performance period. In order to vest, the NEO must maintain continued employment\nwith the Company through the end of the performance period, unless the NEO’s employment terminates because of death,\ndisability, or separation of service without cause after attaining the age of 65 (at which point only a pro-rated portion would\nvest).\nFor 2023, the gateway nonperforming assets goal requires that the Company attain either (i) a ratio of nonperforming assets to total\nassets of less than 1.5% as of the last day of the final year of the 3-year performance period, or (ii) a ratio of nonperforming assets to\ntotal assets better than the 75th percentile of the Company’s peer group utilized for 2023 compensation decisions.\nThe return on average assets goal is as follows:\n• target return on average assets goal: 1.0%;\n• threshold return on average assets goal: 0.9%; and\n• maximum return on average assets goal: 1.5%.\n2024 23\nANNUAL\nMEETING\nEXECUTIVE COMPENSATION\nThe TRSUs (40% of total RSUs) will become fully vested and nonforfeitable in three substantially equal installments on January 31, 2024,\n2025 and 2026, subject to continued employment through the vesting date, unless the NEO’s employment terminates because of\ndeath, disability, or separation of service without cause after attaining the age of 65, in which event only a prorated portion of the\naward would vest.\nIn March 2024, the Committee, utilizing the Company’s audited financial statements, reviewed the Company’s 2023 performance to\ndetermine whether the Company had achieved the nonperforming assets ratio and return on average assets goals governing PRSUs\ngranted to NEOs in 2021. The Committee determined that the nonperforming assets ratio goal had been met, but that the return on\naverage assets goal had not been met. The Committee therefore determined that none of the PRSUs granted to NEOs in 2021 had\nvested, and those PRSUs were forfeited.\nCompensation Decisions for 2024\n2024 Peer Group\nSubsequent to the 2023 Annual Meeting, the Committee again utilized Aon plc to advise as to a peer group for use in making\ndeterminations on 2024 compensation. In general, the Committee determined to utilize substantially similar criteria as it had in\ndetermining the peer group for 2022 and 2023 but made some slight revisions to account for the Company’s growth in asset size and\nservicing revenue. Criteria were:\n• asset size ranging from $3.0 billion to $10 billion;\n• no significant wealth management or insurance revenue; and,\n• Metropolitan Statistical Areas 3-100 (this excludes New York and Los Angeles, and banks headquartered in smaller\nmetropolitan areas. The Company is located in the Indianapolis metropolitan statistical area of Indianapolis, which is ranked\n33).\nThis resulted in a number of changes to the peer group. The peer group utilized by the Committee as one element of making\ndeterminations on 2024 compensation consisted of the following:\n1. Amerant Bancorp Inc. 13. FiveStar Bancorp\n2. Axos Financial Inc. 14. HarborOne Bancorp Inc.\n3. Bankwell Financial Group Inc. 15. Heritage Commerce Corp.\n4. Bridgewater Bancshares Inc. 16. Hingham Institute for Savings\n5.

Lovik $364,000 $374,920 3.0%\n2024 Short-Term Incentive Compensation Actions\nThe Committee, relying on the Company’s budget and priorities for 2024, determined not to change the performance metrics that\nwill be used to determine each NEO’s eligibility for cash bonuses on account of 2024 performance under the Annual Bonus Plan. The\nCommittee believes that the metrics appropriately balance the goals of increasing income and net interest income with prudent\ncredit risk management. Each of the four performance metrics (net income, net interest income, ratio of nonperforming assets to\ntotal assets and Texas Ratio) are weighted at 25%.\n24FIRST\nINTERNET\nBANCORP\nEXECUTIVE COMPENSATION\n2024 Long-Term Incentive Compensation Actions\nIn January 2024, the Committee acted to award an aggregate of 50,816 RSUs to our NEOs, consisting of 30,490 (60%) PRSUs and\n20,326 (40%) TRSUs, under the 2022 Plan and in accordance with the Company’s long-term incentive program. Similar to the awards\nin 2023, these awards have a performance and/or vesting period of three years.\nThe number of RSUs awarded to each executive was determined by dividing a percentage of the executive’s 2024 base salary by a\nreference price equal to the closing price of a share of common stock on the last trading day of 2023, which was $24.19. Mr. Becker\nand Ms. Lorch each received an award representing 75% of his or her respective annual base salary, and Mr. Lovik received an award\nrepresenting 60% of his annual base salary. As a result, the following RSUs were awarded to our NEOs for 2024:\nPRSUs TOTAL RSUs\nNAME TRSUs\n(TARGET PAYOUT) (TARGET PAYOUT)\nDavid B. Becker 15,329 10,219 25,548\nNicole S.

Lovik 5,580 3,720 9,300\nThe PRSUs (60% of total RSUs based on target payout) may be earned by the NEO depending on the Company’s achievement of\nperformance goals established by the Committee for return on average assets and ratio of nonperforming assets to total assets, as\nmeasured over a three-year period (beginning January 1, 2024 and ending on December 31, 2026). The PRSUs provide:\n• If the Company fails to achieve the goal for nonperforming assets, as determined by the Committee, at the end of the three-\nyear performance period, none of the PRSUs will vest and all of the PRSUs shall be forfeited.\n• If the Company achieves the nonperforming assets goal at the end of the performance period, a number of PRSUs will be\neligible to vest at the end of the performance period, based on the achievement by the Company, as determined by the\nCommittee, of the return on asset goal. The number of PRSUs that will vest will range from 0% (if performance is below the\nthreshold level), 90% (if performance is at the threshold level), 100% (if performance is at target) to 150% (if performance is at or\nabove the maximum level).\n• If at least threshold performance is met, a number of PRSUs depending on performance will be earned and will vest as of\nDecember 31, 2026, the end of the three-year performance period. The vesting will be further conditioned upon the NEO\nmaintaining continued employment with the Company through the vesting date or the termination of the NEO’s employment\nbecause of death, disability, or separation of service without cause after attaining the age of 65, in which event only a\nprorated portion of the award would vest.\nThe TRSUs (40% of total RSUs) become fully vested and nonforfeitable in three substantially equal installments on January 31, 2025,\n2026 and 2027, subject to continued employment through the vesting date or termination of the NEO’s employment because of death,\ndisability, or separation of service without cause after attaining the age of 65, in which event only a prorated portion of the award\nwould vest.\nTaxes and Accounting Considerations\nSection 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code generally disallows a federal tax deduction to a public company for compensation in any\ntax year paid to certain “covered employees” to the extent that the compensation to such officer exceeds $1 million.\nDespite these limits on the deductibility of performance-based compensation, the Committee believes that a significant portion of\nour NEOs’ compensation should be tied to Company performance. The Committee’s ability to continue to provide a competitive\ncompensation package to attract, motivate and retain the Company’s most senior executives is considered critical to the\nCompany’s success and to advancing the interests of its stockholders.\nSection 409A of the Internal Revenue Code also affects the payments of certain types of deferred compensation to key employees\nand includes requirements relating to when payments under such arrangements can be made, acceleration of benefits, and timing\nof elections under such arrangements. Failure to satisfy these requirements will generally lead to an acceleration of the timing for\nincluding deferred compensation in an employee’s income, as well as certain penalties and interest. Our nonqualified deferred\ncompensation arrangements are exempt from, or meet, the requirements of Section 409A.\nReport of the Compensation Committee\nThe Committee has reviewed the above Compensation Discussion and Analysis and discussed that analysis with management. Based\non its review and discussions with management, the Compensation Committee recommended to the Board that the Compensation\nDiscussion and Analysis be included in this proxy statement and incorporated by reference into the Company’s Annual Report on Form\n10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.

The annual bonuses are to be determined with reference to the\nachievement of annual performance objectives established by the Compensation Committee for the NEOs. The agreements also\nprovide that the NEOs may be awarded additional compensation, benefits or consideration as the Compensation Committee may\ndetermine. Each agreement has its own set terms, which automatically renew for successive one-year terms.\nAmended and Restated Employment Agreement with Mr. Becker\nMr. Becker’s agreement provides that if his employment is terminated by us for “cause,” or by him without “good reason,” then he will\nbe paid only the amounts then due for his services through the date of termination. If Mr. Becker’s employment is terminated without\n“cause” or he resigns for “good reason,” then he will be paid, in twelve equal monthly payments beginning the month following\ntermination, an amount equal to two ties the sum of (x) his then-current annual base salary plus (y) 120% of the amount of the annual\nbonus he was paid for the calendar year preceding the termination. If Mr. Becker’s employment is terminated due to non-renewal of\nhis employment agreement, then he will be paid, in twelve equal monthly payments beginning the month following termination, an\namount equal to two times the sum of (x) his then-current annual base salary plus (y) 120% of the amount of the annual bonus he was\npaid for the calendar year preceding the termination. If Mr. Becker’s employment is terminated due to his death, then his estate will\nbe paid an amount equal to 120% of the annual bonus he was paid for the calendar year preceding the termination in a lump sum. If\nMr. Becker’s employment is terminated due to disability, then he will be paid, over twelve months, an amount equal to the sum of (x)\nhis then-current annual base salary plus (y) 120% of the annual bonus he was paid for the calendar year preceding the termination. If\nMr. Becker’s employment is terminated without “cause” or due to death or disability, due to non-renewal of his agreement, or he\nresigns for “good reason,” he and his family will receive, for the number of months remaining under the employment term in effect on\nthe termination date, health and welfare benefits equal to those provided to Mr. Becker and his family prior to the termination date\n(or a reimbursement of the cost of such continuation of benefits) (“Benefits Continuation”) (provided that in the case of a non-renewal\nof his employment agreement, Benefits Continuation will last for one year).\nIf Mr. Becker’s employment agreement is not renewed or his employment terminates or if he resigns for any reason within twelve\nmonths following a change in control, then he will be paid, in twelve equal monthly payments beginning the month following the end\nof his employment, an amount equal to the sum of (x) three times his then-current annual base salary plus (y) two times 120% of the\namount of the annual bonus he was paid for the calendar year preceding the termination, plus Benefits Continuation and\noutplacement assistance; provided, however, that if the total payments relating to a change in control would be subject to an excise\ntax pursuant to Section 280G of the Code, he will receive the greater of the maximum amount that could be paid to him without\nimposing excise taxes, or the amount which he would receive after paying the excise taxes.\nUnless Mr. Becker’s employment is terminated by us for “cause,” terminated by him without “good reason,” or terminated pursuant\nto a non-renewal of his agreement, then, to the fullest extent permitted by law, all restrictions on any outstanding incentive awards,\nincluding equity awards, will lapse and become 100% vested.\nEmployment Agreements with Other NEOs\nThe employment agreements for Ms. Lorch and Mr. Lovik provide that, if either executive’s employment is terminated by us for any\nreason other than for “cause” (as defined in the employment agreement) or is terminated by them for “good reason” (as defined in\nthe employment agreement), and in either case the termination of employment occurs before a change of control, then the executive\nwill be eligible to receive, in addition to all compensation and benefits ordinarily payable through the date of termination: (A)\ncontinued payments of base salary for the greater of (i) the remaining term of the agreement and (ii) 24 months; (B) a lump sum\npayment equal to the greater of (1) the average of cash bonuses paid or payable in the three fiscal years prior to the fiscal year in\nwhich the termination occurred and (2) the amount of cash bonus the executive was designated to receive under the then current\nannual incentive plan; (C) acceleration of all outstanding time-based equity awards; and (D) payment of the Company portion of\nCOBRA premiums for up to 12 months.\nIf any such termination occurs within twelve months after a change of control (as defined in the employment agreement), then the\nexecutive will be eligible to receive substantially the same severance benefits, except that (A) payments of base salary would\ncontinue for 24 months and (B) payment of the Company portion of COBRA premiums would continue for up to 18 months.\nAll of the above severance benefits remain contingent on the executive signing and not revoking a release of claims and the executive\nremaining in strict compliance with non-solicitation, non-competition, and confidentiality covenants for a period of at least one year\nafter termination.\n30FIRST\nINTERNET\nBANCORP\nEXECUTIVE COMPENSATION\nPotential Payments upon Termination or Change-in-Control\nThe table below reflects the estimated amount of compensation payable to each of the Named Executive Officers in the event of his\nor her termination of employment under various scenarios, assuming that such termination occurred as of December 31, 2023.\nWe do not have any severance or change in control plans other than the employment agreements and the provisions regarding equity\nvesting described above.\nThe table excludes certain amounts payable pursuant to plans that do not discriminate in favor of executive officers and that are\navailable generally to all salaried employees, nor does it reflect amounts attributable to incentive awards that were already vested.\nThe amounts shown are only estimates of the amounts that would be payable to the Named Executive Officers upon termination of\nemployment and do not reflect tax positions we may take or the accounting treatment of such payments.

We estimate that the median employee’s annual total compensation was $80,238 for 2023. This comparison\nresults in a CEO Pay Ratio of 22:1.\nThis ratio is a reasonable estimate calculated in a manner consistent with Item 402(u) of Regulation S-K promulgated under the\nExchange Act, and as required by the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act.\nTo identify the median employee and determine the annual total compensation of our median employee, the methodology and the\nmaterial assumptions, adjustments, and estimates that we used are described below.\n• We determined that, as of December 31, 2023, our employee population consisted of 286 individuals (including full-time and part-\ntime employees, other than the CEO) working at the Company and its consolidated subsidiaries.\n• We used a definition that was based on actual 2023 W-2 taxable income compensation data for those who were employed on\nDecember 31, 2023, rather than annual total compensation tabulated in a manner consistent with the Summary Compensation\nTable. Taxable income was selected because it is inclusive of all forms of cash compensation paid to an employee such as salary,\nwages, overtime, cash bonuses, and commissions, and we believe it is a better representation of our employees’ pay than annual\ntotal compensation.\n• We selected an individual at the median of our employee population and then determined that individual’s annual total\ncompensation in accordance with Regulation S-K, Item 402(c)(2)(x) as provided above.\n2024 31\nANNUAL\nMEETING\nEXECUTIVE COMPENSATION\nPay Versus Peformance\nIn accordance with Section 953(a) of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act and Item 402(v) of Regulation\nS-K, we are providing the following information about the relationships between Compensation Actually Paid to our NEOs and\nCompany performance.

Each non-employee director held 5,005 restricted shares as of\nDecember 31, 2023.\n(2) Mr. Lovejoy’s service as a director ended as of May 15, 2023.\nWe compensate our non-employee directors for their services in the form of an annual retainer paid in equity awards granted under\nthe 2022 Plan, as well as cash payments for Board and committee service and service as a committee chair.\nBoard Compensation. Our directors generally serve from annual meeting to annual meeting. For that service, our non-employee\ndirectors are entitled to receive quarterly cash payments of $6,250 and an annual restricted stock award having a grant date fair\nvalue of $52,000.\nThe number of shares of restricted stock awarded to non-employee directors in 2023 was determined by dividing $52,000 by $10.39,\nwhich was the closing price of our common stock on May 12, 2023, the last trading date before the May 15, 2023 grant date, and\nrounding up to the next whole share.

Until January 1, 2014, the Company had a stock compensation plan for non-employee members of\nthe Board of Directors (“Directors Deferred Stock Plan”). The Company reserved 180,000 shares of common stock that could have\nbeen issued pursuant to the Directors Deferred Stock Plan. The plan provided non-employee directors the option to elect to receive\nup to 100% of their annual retainer in either common stock or deferred stock rights. Deferred stock rights were to be settled in common\nstock following the end of the deferral period payable on the basis of one share of common stock for each deferred stock right.

This proposal, commonly known as the “say-on-\npay” vote, gives our shareholders the opportunity to express their views on our executive compensation. This vote is not intended to\naddress any specific item of compensation but rather the overall compensation paid to our Named Executive Officers for the\npreceding year and the philosophy, policies and practices described in this proxy statement.\nOur executive compensation program is designed to attract, motivate and retain highly qualified and effective leaders who drive our\nsuccess. When designing our program, the Compensation Committee works to foster an environment in which executives are\nmotivated to achieve financial performance goals and individual objectives that will drive the success of our business and, in turn,\nincrease shareholder value on a long-term, sustainable basis. Our compensation program is intended to motivate and retain qualified\nexecutive personnel in a way that establishes an appropriate relationship between executive pay and the creation of shareholder\nvalue. We believe that our executive compensation program accomplishes this goal.\nBased on the foregoing, the following resolution will be voted on at the annual meeting:\nRESOLVED, that the Company’s shareholders approve, on an advisory basis, the compensation of the Company’s named\nexecutive officers for 2023 as disclosed in the Company’s proxy statement for the 2024 Annual Meeting of Shareholders\npursuant to the compensation disclosure rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission, including the compensation\ntables and the narrative discussion.\nAs an advisory vote, this proposal is not binding upon the Company, the Board or the Compensation Committee and will not be\nconstrued as overruling a decision by the Company, the Board or the Compensation Committee or creating or implying any additional\nfiduciary duty for the Company, the Board or the Compensation Committee. However, the Compensation Committee and the Board\nvalue the opinions expressed by shareholders in their vote on this proposal and will consider the outcome of the advisory vote when\nmaking future executive compensation decisions.\nShareholders are encouraged to carefully review the “Executive Compensation” section and the executive compensation tables\nearlier this proxy statement for a detailed discussion of our executive compensation program.\nThe Board of Directors recommends a vote “FOR” the advisory proposal to approve the compensation of our Named Executive\nOfficers as disclosed in this proxy statement.\n36FIRST\nINTERNET\nBANCORP\nAUDIT MATTERS\nThis section includes information regarding audit-related matters, including the Report of the Audit Committee and fees paid to the\nindependent registered public accounting firm for 2023 and 2022.\nReport of the Audit Committee\nIn accordance with a written charter adopted by the Board, as amended, the Audit Committee (formerly the Audit and Risk\nCommittee) assists the Board with fulfilling its oversight responsibility regarding the quality and integrity of the accounting, auditing\nand financial reporting practices of the Company.\nIn discharging its duties, the committee:\n(1) reviewed and discussed the audited financial statements included in the Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31,\n2023 with the Company’s management;\n(2) discussed with FORVIS, LLP, the Company’s independent registered public accounting firm, the matters required to be\ndiscussed by the applicable requirements of the SEC and the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, including the\nquality, not just the acceptability of the accounting principles, but also the reasonableness of significant judgments, and the\nclarity of the disclosures in the financial statements;\n(3) received and reviewed the written disclosures and the letter from FORVIS, LLP required by applicable requirements of the\nPublic Company Accounting Oversight Board regarding FORVIS, LLP’s communications with the committee concerning\nindependence, and the committee discussed with FORVIS, LLP the independence of that firm; and\n(4) reviewed and pre-approved the services provided by FORVIS, LLP and considered whether the provision of such services not\nrelated to the audit of the financial statements are compatible with maintaining FORVIS, LLP’s independence.\nBased upon the reviews and discussions referenced above, the Audit and Risk Committee (now the Audit Committee) recommended\nto the Board that the audited financial statements be included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended\nDecember 31, 2023 for filing with the SEC.\nJean L.

These services may include audit services, audit-related services, tax services and other services.\nPre-approval is generally provided for up to one year and any pre-approval is detailed as to the particular service or category of\nservices. The independent registered public accounting firm and management are required to periodically report to the Audit\nCommittee regarding the extent of services provided by the independent auditor in accordance with this pre-approval, and the fees\nfor the services performed to date. The Audit Committee also may pre-approve particular services on a case-by-case basis.
