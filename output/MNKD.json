Picture the size of a full tennis court and that is roughly the surface area of both lungs in a typical adult. Running through those lungs are airways whose total length measures 1,500 miles – that’s the distance between Chicago and Las Vegas, New York to Albuquerque, and Los Angeles to Nashville.\n\nSimply put, the lungs create a wonderful platform for effective drug delivery. MannKind’s Technosphere technology recognizes this and provides the distinct advantage of rapid, deep lung drug delivery. The effect is similar to intravenous delivery (I.V.; within a vein) and has the added benefit of bypassing the liver which can be especially helpful in reducing systemic side effects.\n\nExamining it closer, it helps to look at inhalation, air flow travel, and the exhale. When you breathe in, air is drawn into the lung and flows down curving, narrowing airways that end in the air sacs or alveoli. When air is exhaled, the flow is reversed. Between the end of an inhalation and the start of exhalation, the air in the lung is stationary. To reach the deep lung, inhaled particles must be carried by the air stream and have enough momentum to continue through the stationary air to collide with the lung surface.\n\nParticles that can reach the lung have aerodynamic diameters between 0.5 µm and 5-6 µm (1 µm is 1 micro-meter or about 0.00004 inches). Particles that are larger than 6 µm will leave the air stream and hit the back of your mouth and throat; smaller than 0.5 µm wouldn’t have the ability to reach the lungs and would simply get exhaled.\n\n“The average Technosphere particle is about 2-2.5 µm which is in the middle of the respirable range,” explains Marshall Grant, PhD, MSc, Executive Director, Clinical Pharmacology & Research for MannKind Corporation. “The particle size distribution is a major reason Technosphere powders are highly efficient in delivering drug to the lungs than other dry powder inhalers (DPIs).”\n\nThe Technosphere particles in FDA-approved Afrezza® (insulin human) Inhalation Powder and Tyvaso DPI™ (treprostinil) Inhalation Powder are manufactured by different processes and possess different characteristics. But both are made up of small crystals of FDKP (fumaryl diketopiperazine), MannKind’s proprietary molecule. FDKP provides high solubility and fast dissolution at physiologic pH – and more importantly – can crystallize and form particles in the range appropriate for optimum delivery to the lungs.\n\nWhen Technosphere powder reaches the lung surface, the FDKP and drug dissolve. The FDKP is then rapidly cleared from the lung into systemic circulation. The FDKP is not metabolized, but rather excreted primarily in the urine. Another value of Technosphere powders has been their versatility – they are compatible with a wide range of doses with different types of drugs.\n\nMannKind’s Technosphere powders are delivered into the lung’s airstream via an inhalation device or DPI (dry powder inhaler). The breath-powered inhalers (Dreamboat® being the most common version) provide excellent delivery efficiency and are proven to deliver up to 70% of the dry-powder dose deep into the lungs. Our DPI are designed to be simple, easy to use and discreet. For patients, imagine having a drug in the convenient form of an inhaler that fits in the palm of your hand. This approach allows patients to not only take control of their health but do it while going about their day and enjoying life more humann.\n\n![picture 1](/system/files-encrypted/nasdaq_kms/inline-images/Picture1.png)\n\n## NTM Lung Disease on the Rise\n\n“I cough every morning upon waking, so I don’t feel rested.” “Imagine not being able to breathe.” “Anxiety ruins everything about you – it’s not a normal life.” “You just exist from day to day and week to week.” These are a sampling of comments about the most bothersome symptoms from living with Nontuberculous Mycobacteria (NTM) shared in a study from NTM Info & Research, Inc. The statements are unfortunately typical and those with NTM often have unpredictable day-to-day health functioning and reduced quality of life.\n\nNTM lung disease is a serious infection that is caused by bacteria that are common in the environment and can cause lung damage. The reality is that we are all exposed to these bacteria in our day-to-day lives – more than 120 species of mycobacteria have been identified. These common bacteria exist in water and soil particles that are in the air, wet places like hot tubs, steamy bathrooms, dishwashers, and even the dewy ground we walk on at the park. But not everyone is at risk of getting NTM lung disease just because they are exposed.\n\nThose predisposed often have underlying conditions such as asthma, COPD, and bronchiectasis, which makes them prone to NTM infection. NTM is not considered to be contagious. Women over the age of 65 make up the majority of those impacted, with a predominance in those of Caucasian and Asian descent.\n\nA rare disease, NTM can often be difficult to diagnose. Many will experience coughing, fatigue, weight loss and shortness of breath – all of which are common with other lung disease symptoms and other conditions like tuberculosis. With NTM, symptoms often worsen, and that is a marker not to be ignored.\n\nIt is estimated that some 86,000 individuals are living with NTM lung diseases, and it is on the rise growing 8% each year. Coastal regions including Gulf States have higher rates of infection accounting for 70% of annual NTM cases.\n\nWhile no cure is available, treatments to manage NTM are available. Treatment for NTM involves antibiotic and multidrug regimens with duration lasting from months to years with tolerability and adverse reactions to treatment which often leads to a lack of adherence to therapy.\n\nThere is a valuable need to develop medicines that are well tolerated and effective that lends to consistent patient use and alleviates symptoms of NTM lung disease. MannKind continues to progress MNKD-101 (Clofazimine) for the treatment of NTM.\n\n![picture 1](/system/files-encrypted/nasdaq_kms/inline-images/Picture1.png)\n\nShare & Print option\n\n  * [![share](/sites/g/files/knoqqb83626/themes/site/client_site/dist/images/icon-share.png) share]()\n  * [![print](/sites/g/files/knoqqb83626/themes/site/client_site/dist/images/icon-print.png) print](#print-page)\n\n\n\n## Release Details\n\n## \n\nMannKind Corporation to Hold 2024 Third Quarter Financial Results Conference Call on November 7, 2024\n\n10/31/24\n\n[PDF Version](/node/20086/pdf)\n\nDANBURY, Conn. and WESTLAKE VILLAGE, Calif., Oct. 31, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- **MannKind Corporation (Nasdaq: MNKD)**, announced today that its third quarter 2024 financial results will be released after market close on Thursday, November 7, 2024.\n\nMannKind will host a webcast beginning at 4:30 p.m. Eastern Time to discuss the quarterly results and provide a business update.

We also recently announced positive topline results from the Afrezza INHALE-3 post-marketing study and expect to announce topline data from the Phase-3 INHALE-1 pediatric study by year-end.”\n\n**Third Quarter 2024 Results**\n\nRevenue Highlights\n\n**Three Months****Ended September 30,**  \n---  \n**2024** | **2023** | **$ Change** | **% Change**  \n**(Dollars in thousands)**  \nRoyalties – collaboration | $ | 27,083 | $ | 20,218 | $ | 6,865 | 34 | %  \nRevenue – collaborations and services | 23,268 | 13,108 | $ | 10,160 | 78 | %  \nNet revenue – Afrezza | 15,035 | 13,476 | $ | 1,559 | 12 | %  \nNet revenue – V-Go | 4,693 | 4,451 | $ | 242 | 5 | %  \nTotal revenues | $ | 70,079 | $ | 51,253 | $ | 18,826 | 37 | %  \n  \nIn the third quarter of 2024, compared to the same period in 2023:\n\n  * royalties for Tyvaso DPI® increased $6.9 million, or 34%, due to increased sales by United Therapeutics (\"UT\");\n  * collaborations and services revenue increased $10.2 million, or 78%, primarily attributable to an increase in manufacturing activities for Tyvaso DPI;\n  * Afrezza® net revenue increased $1.6 million, or 12%, as a result of higher demand and improved gross-to-net adjustments; and\n  * V-Go® net revenue increased $0.2 million, or 5%, as a result of improved gross-to-net adjustments and increased price, partially offset by lower product demand.\n\n\n\nCommercial product gross margin in the third quarter of 2024 was 84% compared to 78% for the same period in 2023. The increase in gross margin was primarily attributable to an increase in Afrezza net revenue.\n\nCost of revenue – collaborations and services for the third quarter of 2024 was $14.8 million compared to $10.3 million for the same period in 2023. The $4.5 million increase was primarily attributable to increased manufacturing volume for Tyvaso DPI.\n\nResearch and development (\"R&D\") expenses for the third quarter of 2024 were $12.9 million compared to $10.0 million for the same period in 2023. The $2.9 million increase was primarily attributed to increased costs for a Phase 3 clinical study of MNKD-101, a Phase 1 clinical study of a dry-powder formulation of MNKD-201, and personnel costs due to increased headcount following a transaction with Pulmatrix, Inc.\n\nSelling expenses were $13.1 million for the third quarter of 2024 compared to $13.4 million for the same period in 2023. The $0.3 million decrease was primarily due to reduced personnel costs related to a sales force restructuring completed during the first quarter of 2024, partially offset by an increase in promotional activities.\n\nGeneral and administrative expenses were $10.8 million for the third quarter of 2024 compared to $10.5 million for the same period in 2023. The $0.3 million increase was primarily attributable to increases in personnel costs partially offset by reduced consulting fees.\n\nInterest income, net, was $3.2 million for the third quarter of 2024 compared to $1.6 million for the same period in 2023. The $1.6 million increase was primarily due to an increase in the underlying investments from the proceeds of the sale of 1% of our Tyvaso DPI royalties in December 2023 and higher yields on our securities portfolio.\n\nInterest expense on liability for sale of future royalties was $4.1 million for the third quarter of 2024 and was attributable to imputed interest and amortization of debt issuance costs on the liability recorded in connection with the sale of 1% of our Tyvaso DPI royalties in December 2023.\n\nInterest expense on financing liability related to the sale-leaseback of our Danbury manufacturing facility was $2.5 million for the third quarter of 2024 and remained consistent with the same period in 2023.\n\nInterest expense was $1.8 million for the third quarter of 2024 compared to $2.8 million for the same period in 2023. The decrease of $1.0 million was primarily due to repayment of the MidCap credit facility and Mann Group convertible note in April 2024.\n\nGain on bargain purchase of $5.3 million for the third quarter of 2024 was the result of the excess of the fair value of net assets acquired over the fair value of the consideration paid in the Pulmatrix transaction.\n\n**Nine Months September 30, 2024**\n\nRevenue Highlights\n\n**Nine Months****Ended September 30,**  \n---  \n**2024** | **2023** | **$ Change** | **% Change**  \n**(Dollars in thousands)**  \nRoyalties – collaboration | $ | 75,326 | $ | 50,951 | $ | 24,375 | 48 | %  \nRevenue – collaborations and services | 74,130 | 35,705 | $ | 38,425 | 108 | %  \nNet revenue – Afrezza | 45,762 | 39,427 | $ | 6,335 | 16 | %  \nNet revenue – V-Go | 13,510 | 14,407 | $ | (897 | ) | (6 | %)  \nTotal revenues | $ | 208,728 | $ | 140,490 | $ | 68,238 | 49 | %  \n  \nFor the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period in 2023:\n\n  * royalties related to Tyvaso DPI increased $24.4 million, or 48%, due to increased sales by UT;\n  * collaborations and services revenue increased $38.4 million, or 108%, primarily attributable to an increase in manufacturing activities for Tyvaso DPI;\n  * Afrezza net revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased $6.3 million, or 16%, primarily as a result of higher demand and price and improved gross-to-net adjustments; and\n  * V-Go net revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 decreased $0.9 million, or 6%, as a result of lower product demand, partially offset by improved gross-to-net adjustments and increased price.\n\n\n\nCommercial product gross margin in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 79% compared to 73% for the same period in 2023. The increase in gross margin was primarily attributable to an increase in Afrezza net revenue.\n\nCost of revenue – collaborations and services for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was $44.4 million compared to $30.0 million for the same period in 2023. The $14.4 million increase was primarily attributable to increased manufacturing volume for product sold to UT.\n\nR&D expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were $34.8 million compared to $22.0 million for the same period in 2023. The $12.8 million increase was primarily attributed to increased expenditures for development activities and a Phase 3 clinical study of MNKD-101, a Phase 1 study of MNKD-201, and personnel costs due to increased headcount as a result of the Pulmatrix transaction.\n\nSelling expenses were $36.2 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to $40.8 million for the same period in 2023. The $4.6 million decrease was primarily due to reduced personnel costs related to a sales force restructuring completed during the first quarter of 2024.\n\nGeneral and administrative expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were $34.2 million compared to $33.0 million for the same period in 2023. The $1.2 million increase was primarily attributable to a loss of $1.4 million related to estimated returns associated with sales of V-Go that pre-date our acquisition of the product and increases in personnel costs, partially offset by reduced consulting fees.\n\nInterest income, net, was $9.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to $4.4 million for the same period in 2023. The $5.4 million increase was primarily due to an increase in the underlying investments from the proceeds of the sale of 1% of our Tyvaso DPI royalties in December 2023 and higher yields on our securities portfolio.\n\nInterest expense on liability for sale of future royalties was $12.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and was attributable to imputed interest and amortization of debt issuance costs on the liability recorded in connection with the sale of 1% of our Tyvaso DPI royalties in December 2023.\n\nInterest expense on financing liability related to the sale-leaseback of our Danbury manufacturing facility was $7.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and remained consistent with the same period in 2023.\n\nInterest expense was $10.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to $12.5 million for the same period in 2023. The decrease of $2.1 million was primarily due to repayment of the MidCap credit facility and Mann Group convertible note in April 2024.\n\nGain on bargain purchase of $5.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was the result of the excess of the fair value of net assets acquired over the fair value of the consideration paid in the Pulmatrix transaction.\n\nLoss on available-for-sale securities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was $1.6 million resulting from the modification of the Thirona note terms. Gain on available-for-sale securities for the same period in 2023 was $0.9 million as a result of the change in fair value of the Thirona investment.\n\nLoss on extinguishment of debt of $7.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was incurred in connection with the prepayment of the MidCap credit facility and the Mann Group convertible note in April 2024.\n\nCash, cash equivalents and investments as of September 30, 2024 were $268.4 million.\n\n**Non-GAAP Measures**\n\nTo supplement our condensed consolidated financial statements presented under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (\"GAAP\"), we are presenting non-GAAP net income (loss) and non-GAAP net income (loss) per share - diluted, which are non-GAAP financial measures. We are providing these non-GAAP financial measures to disclose additional information to facilitate the comparison of past and present operations, and they are among the indicators management uses as a basis for evaluating our financial performance. We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures, when considered together with our GAAP financial results, provide management and investors with an additional understanding of our business operating results, including underlying trends.\n\nThese non-GAAP financial measures are not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for comparable GAAP measures; should be read in conjunction with our condensed consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP; have no standardized meaning prescribed by GAAP; and are not prepared under any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles. In addition, from time to time in the future there may be other items that we may exclude for purposes of our non-GAAP financial measures; and we may in the future cease to exclude items that we have historically excluded for purposes of our non-GAAP financial measures. Likewise, we may determine to modify the nature of adjustments to arrive at our non-GAAP financial measures. Because of the non-standardized definitions of non-GAAP financial measures, the non-GAAP financial measures as used by us in this report have limits in their usefulness to investors and may be calculated differently from, and therefore may not be directly comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies.\n\nThe following table reconciles our financial measures for net income (loss) and net income (loss) per share (\"EPS\") for diluted weighted average shares as reported in our condensed consolidated statements of operations to a non-GAAP presentation.\n\n**Three Months** | **Nine Months**  \n---|---  \n**Ended September 30,** | **Ended September 30,**  \n**2024** | **2023** | **2024** | **2023**  \n**Net Income** | **Basic EPS** | **Net Income** | **Basic EPS** | **Net Income** | **Basic EPS** | **Net Loss** | **Basic EPS**  \n**(In thousands except per share data)**  \nGAAP reported net income (loss) | $ | 11,550 | $ | 0.04 | $ | 1,721 | $ | 0.01 | $ | 20,166 | $ | 0.07 | $ | (13,339 | ) | $ | (0.05 | )  \nNon-GAAP adjustments:  \nSold portion of royalty revenue(1) | (2,708 | ) | (0.01 | ) | — | — | (7,533 | ) | (0.03 | ) | — | —  \nInterest expense on liability for sale of future royalties | 4,089 | 0.02 | — | — | 12,720 | 0.04 | — | —  \nStock compensation | 5,227 | 0.02 | 4,601 | 0.02 | 15,540 | 0.06 | 13,836 | 0.05  \nLoss (gain) on foreign currency transaction | 2,454 | 0.01 | (2,065 | ) | (0.01 | ) | 526 | — | (860 | ) | —  \nGain on bargain purchase | (5,259 | ) | (0.02 | ) | — | — | (5,259 | ) | (0.02 | ) | — | —  \nLoss on extinguishment of debt | — | — | — | — | 7,050 | 0.03 | — | —  \nLoss (gain) on available-for-sale securities | — | — | — | — | 1,550 | 0.01 | (932 | ) | —  \nNon-GAAP adjusted net income (loss) | $ | 15,353 | $ | 0.06 | $ | 4,257 | $ | 0.02 | $ | 44,760 | $ | 0.16 | $ | (1,295 | ) | $ | (0.00 | )  \nWeighted average shares used to compute net income (loss) per share – basic | 274,998 | 268,732 | 272,811 | 266,126  \n  \n__________________________(1) Represents the non-cash portion of the 1% royalty on net sales of Tyvaso DPI earned during the periods presented which is remitted to the royalty purchaser and recognized as royalties – collaboration in our consolidated statements of operations.

Picture the size of a full tennis court and that is roughly the surface area of both lungs in a typical adult. Running through those lungs are airways whose total length measures 1,500 miles – that’s the distance between Chicago and Las Vegas, New York to Albuquerque, and Los Angeles to Nashville.\n\nSimply put, the lungs create a wonderful platform for effective drug delivery. MannKind’s Technosphere technology recognizes this and provides the distinct advantage of rapid, deep lung drug delivery. The effect is similar to intravenous delivery (I.V.; within a vein) and has the added benefit of bypassing the liver which can be especially helpful in reducing systemic side effects.\n\nExamining it closer, it helps to look at inhalation, air flow travel, and the exhale. When you breathe in, air is drawn into the lung and flows down curving, narrowing airways that end in the air sacs or alveoli. When air is exhaled, the flow is reversed. Between the end of an inhalation and the start of exhalation, the air in the lung is stationary. To reach the deep lung, inhaled particles must be carried by the air stream and have enough momentum to continue through the stationary air to collide with the lung surface.\n\nParticles that can reach the lung have aerodynamic diameters between 0.5 µm and 5-6 µm (1 µm is 1 micro-meter or about 0.00004 inches). Particles that are larger than 6 µm will leave the air stream and hit the back of your mouth and throat; smaller than 0.5 µm wouldn’t have the ability to reach the lungs and would simply get exhaled.\n\n“The average Technosphere particle is about 2-2.5 µm which is in the middle of the respirable range,” explains Marshall Grant, PhD, MSc, Executive Director, Clinical Pharmacology & Research for MannKind Corporation. “The particle size distribution is a major reason Technosphere powders are highly efficient in delivering drug to the lungs than other dry powder inhalers (DPIs).”\n\nThe Technosphere particles in FDA-approved Afrezza® (insulin human) Inhalation Powder and Tyvaso DPI™ (treprostinil) Inhalation Powder are manufactured by different processes and possess different characteristics. But both are made up of small crystals of FDKP (fumaryl diketopiperazine), MannKind’s proprietary molecule. FDKP provides high solubility and fast dissolution at physiologic pH – and more importantly – can crystallize and form particles in the range appropriate for optimum delivery to the lungs.\n\nWhen Technosphere powder reaches the lung surface, the FDKP and drug dissolve. The FDKP is then rapidly cleared from the lung into systemic circulation. The FDKP is not metabolized, but rather excreted primarily in the urine. Another value of Technosphere powders has been their versatility – they are compatible with a wide range of doses with different types of drugs.\n\nMannKind’s Technosphere powders are delivered into the lung’s airstream via an inhalation device or DPI (dry powder inhaler). The breath-powered inhalers (Dreamboat® being the most common version) provide excellent delivery efficiency and are proven to deliver up to 70% of the dry-powder dose deep into the lungs. Our DPI are designed to be simple, easy to use and discreet. For patients, imagine having a drug in the convenient form of an inhaler that fits in the palm of your hand. This approach allows patients to not only take control of their health but do it while going about their day and enjoying life more humann.\n\n![picture 1](/system/files-encrypted/nasdaq_kms/inline-images/Picture1.png)\n\n## NTM Lung Disease on the Rise\n\n“I cough every morning upon waking, so I don’t feel rested.” “Imagine not being able to breathe.” “Anxiety ruins everything about you – it’s not a normal life.” “You just exist from day to day and week to week.” These are a sampling of comments about the most bothersome symptoms from living with Nontuberculous Mycobacteria (NTM) shared in a study from NTM Info & Research, Inc. The statements are unfortunately typical and those with NTM often have unpredictable day-to-day health functioning and reduced quality of life.\n\nNTM lung disease is a serious infection that is caused by bacteria that are common in the environment and can cause lung damage. The reality is that we are all exposed to these bacteria in our day-to-day lives – more than 120 species of mycobacteria have been identified. These common bacteria exist in water and soil particles that are in the air, wet places like hot tubs, steamy bathrooms, dishwashers, and even the dewy ground we walk on at the park. But not everyone is at risk of getting NTM lung disease just because they are exposed.\n\nThose predisposed often have underlying conditions such as asthma, COPD, and bronchiectasis, which makes them prone to NTM infection. NTM is not considered to be contagious. Women over the age of 65 make up the majority of those impacted, with a predominance in those of Caucasian and Asian descent.\n\nA rare disease, NTM can often be difficult to diagnose. Many will experience coughing, fatigue, weight loss and shortness of breath – all of which are common with other lung disease symptoms and other conditions like tuberculosis. With NTM, symptoms often worsen, and that is a marker not to be ignored.\n\nIt is estimated that some 86,000 individuals are living with NTM lung diseases, and it is on the rise growing 8% each year. Coastal regions including Gulf States have higher rates of infection accounting for 70% of annual NTM cases.\n\nWhile no cure is available, treatments to manage NTM are available. Treatment for NTM involves antibiotic and multidrug regimens with duration lasting from months to years with tolerability and adverse reactions to treatment which often leads to a lack of adherence to therapy.\n\nThere is a valuable need to develop medicines that are well tolerated and effective that lends to consistent patient use and alleviates symptoms of NTM lung disease. MannKind continues to progress MNKD-101 (Clofazimine) for the treatment of NTM.\n\n![picture 1](/system/files-encrypted/nasdaq_kms/inline-images/Picture1.png)\n\nShare & Print option\n\n  * [![share](/sites/g/files/knoqqb83626/themes/site/client_site/dist/images/icon-share.png) share]()\n  * [![print](/sites/g/files/knoqqb83626/themes/site/client_site/dist/images/icon-print.png) print](#print-page)\n\n\n\n## Release Details\n\n## \n\nMannKind to Present at 2024 UBS Healthcare Conference\n\n11/05/24\n\n[PDF Version](/node/20116/pdf)\n\nDANBURY, Conn. and WESTLAKE VILLAGE, Calif., Nov. 05, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- **MannKind Corporation (Nasdaq: MNKD)** , a company focused on the development and commercialization of innovative inhaled therapeutic products and devices for patients with endocrine and orphan lung diseases, announced today that Chief Executive Officer Michael Castagna, PharmD, and Chief Financial Officer Chris Prentiss will share updates during a fireside chat at the 2024 UBS Healthcare Conference in Rancho Palos Verdes, Calif.\n\nThe fireside chat will take place on Tuesday, November 12, at 10:15 a.m. Pacific Time.

The primary objective of the study was to evaluate the safety and tolerability of nintedanib DPI. The secondary study objective was to evaluate the pharmacokinetics (PK) of MNKD-201.\n\n“We are encouraged by the findings from this Phase 1 study of nintedanib DPI,” said Dr. Wassim Fares, MSc, FCCP, Senior Vice President, Therapeutic Area Head, Orphan Lung Diseases for MannKind Corporation. “Building on the known efficacy of oral nintedanib for IPF, delivery of a dry powder formulation directly to the lungs could potentially treat the disease while reducing the common adverse effects associated with oral delivery of nintedanib. Pending late-stage development trials, nintedanib DPI could offer an alternative and/or addition to current IPF therapies.”\n\nAdditionally, the preclinical chronic toxicology study did not show any adverse findings and supports further development of nintedanib DPI.\n\n**About Pulmonary Fibrosis and IPF** The Pulmonary Fibrosis Foundation indicates that there are over 250,000 Americans living with pulmonary fibrosis (PF) and interstitial lung disease (ILD) today, and 50,000 new cases are diagnosed each year. While the number of people affected by IPF is unknown, it is one of the most common forms of pulmonary fibrosis. IPF is predominantly identified in men but is also increasing in women.\n\n**About MannKind**MannKind Corporation (Nasdaq: MNKD) focuses on the development and commercialization of innovative inhaled therapeutic products and devices to address serious unmet medical needs for those living with endocrine and orphan lung diseases.\n\nWe are committed to using our formulation capabilities and device engineering prowess to lessen the burden of diseases such as diabetes, nontuberculous mycobacterial (NTM) lung disease, pulmonary fibrosis, and pulmonary hypertension.
