Forward-looking statements, which are based on certain assumptions and describe our future plans, strategies and expectations, can generally be identified by the use of forward-looking terms such as “believe,” “expect,” “may,” “should,” “could,” “seek,” “intend,” “plan,” “goal,” “estimate,” “anticipate” or other comparable terms. For example, we are using forward-looking statements when discussing the Company’s exclusive worldwide distribution rights of certain advanced drone safety systems which are subject to certain conditions, the Company’s commitment to leveraging its expertise in e-commerce to bring advanced technological solutions to consumers, and the ability of the drone safety systems to address key challenges in the industry. Instead, they are based only on our current beliefs, expectations and assumptions regarding the future of our business, future plans and strategies, projections, anticipated events and trends, the economy and other future conditions. Because forward-looking statements relate to the future, they are subject to inherent uncertainties, risks and changes in circumstances that are difficult to predict and many of which are outside of our control. Our actual results and financial condition may differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements. Therefore, you should not rely on any of these forward-looking statements. Important factors that could cause our actual results and financial condition to differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements include, among others, the following: our ability to adapt to significant future alterations in Amazon’s policies; our ability to sell our existing products and grow our brands and product offerings, including by acquiring new brands; our ability to meet our expectations regarding the revenue growth and the demand for e-commerce; the overall global economic environment; the impact of competition and new e-commerce technologies; general market, political and economic conditions in the countries in which we operate; projected capital expenditures and liquidity; the impact of possible changes in Amazon’s policies and terms of use; the impact of the conditions in Israel, including the recent attacks by Hamas, Iran, and other terrorist organizations; and the other risks and uncertainties described in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 20-F for the year ended December 31, 2023, filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), on April 1, 2024 and our other filings with the SEC. We undertake no obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statement, whether written or oral, that may be made from time to time, whether as a result of new information, future developments or otherwise.\n\nStory Continues\n\n_Investor Relations Contact:_\n\nMichal Efraty Adi and Michal PR- IR Investor Relations, Israel[michal@efraty.com](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=ZLuyzRaWE-tW149kdHFYHQ6DroPsHV7L59qike_hkRWxBr_UP9n3f-rkEiL4Bjxy5mGZ00cnpR6xonqUa5YKn_TWEMjdwrerF5-Nk4pWx-0=)\n\nView Comments \n\n[Terms ](https://guce.yahoo.com/terms?locale=en-US) and [Privacy Policy ](https://guce.yahoo.com/privacy-policy?locale=en-US)\n\n[Privacy Dashboard ](https://guce.yahoo.com/privacy-dashboard?locale=en-US)\n\n## Recommended Stories\n\nWaiting for permission\n\nAllow microphone access to enable voice search\n\nTry again.\n\nTry saying\n"

Forward-looking statements, which are based on certain assumptions and describe our future plans, strategies and expectations, can generally be identified by the use of forward-looking terms such as “believe,” “expect,” “may,” “should,” “could,” “seek,” “intend,” “plan,” “goal,” “estimate,” “anticipate” or other comparable terms. For example, we are using forward-looking statements when discussing the Company’s exclusive worldwide distribution rights of certain advanced drone safety systems which are subject to certain conditions, the Company’s commitment to leveraging its expertise in e-commerce to bring advanced technological solutions to consumers, and the ability of the drone safety systems to address key challenges in the industry. Instead, they are based only on our current beliefs, expectations and assumptions regarding the future of our business, future plans and strategies, projections, anticipated events and trends, the economy and other future conditions. Because forward-looking statements relate to the future, they are subject to inherent uncertainties, risks and changes in circumstances that are difficult to predict and many of which are outside of our control. Our actual results and financial condition may differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements. Therefore, you should not rely on any of these forward-looking statements. Important factors that could cause our actual results and financial condition to differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements include, among others, the following: our ability to adapt to significant future alterations in Amazon’s policies; our ability to sell our existing products and grow our brands and product offerings, including by acquiring new brands; our ability to meet our expectations regarding the revenue growth and the demand for e-commerce; the overall global economic environment; the impact of competition and new e-commerce technologies; general market, political and economic conditions in the countries in which we operate; projected capital expenditures and liquidity; the impact of possible changes in Amazon’s policies and terms of use; the impact of the conditions in Israel, including the recent attacks by Hamas, Iran, and other terrorist organizations; and the other risks and uncertainties described in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 20-F for the year ended December 31, 2023, filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), on April 1, 2024 and our other filings with the SEC. We undertake no obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statement, whether written or oral, that may be made from time to time, whether as a result of new information, future developments or otherwise.\n\nStory Continues\n\n_Investor Relations Contact:_\n\nMichal Efraty Adi and Michal PR- IR Investor Relations, Israel [michal@efraty.com](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=zEFsEydq4Ozf5EIUbUikiX_NzYyaXd_I2myBjoZUIE7nkMoT-bAl9a1WhOOPrQ43G5Hi-t45nlfC5IbxAPYar3ptr2oLy_2DRL-U3hRYqfU=)\n\nView Comments \n\n[Terms ](https://guce.yahoo.com/terms?locale=en-US) and [Privacy Policy ](https://guce.yahoo.com/privacy-policy?locale=en-US)\n\n[Privacy Dashboard ](https://guce.yahoo.com/privacy-dashboard?locale=en-US)\n\n## Recommended Stories\n\nWaiting for permission\n\nAllow microphone access to enable voice search\n\nTry again.\n\nTry saying\n"

(GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Jeffs' Brands Ltd (“Jeffs’ Brands” or the “Company”) (Nasdaq: JFBR, JFBRW), a data-driven e-commerce company operating on the Amazon Marketplace, has entered into a binding Letter of Intent (“LOI”) with Deliverz.AI Ltd. (“Deliverz.AI”), a company focused on artificial intelligence (“AI”) powered fully autonomous multi-purpose robotic platforms, as previously announced on November 27, 2024. The LOI, entered into on November 27, 2024, outlines a plan to establish a joint venture (“JV”) to operate exclusively in the United States, combining the strengths of both companies to introduce AI-powered fully autonomous robotic solutions for healthcare logistics in the United States.\n\nDeliverz.AI specializes in autonomous navigation platforms that streamline logistics operations.

Forward-looking statements, which are based on certain assumptions and describe our future plans, strategies and expectations, can generally be identified by the use of forward-looking terms such as “believe,” “expect,” “may,” “should,” “could,” “seek,” “intend,” “plan,” “goal,” “estimate,” “anticipate” or other comparable terms. For example, we are using forward-looking statements when discussing the JV, which is subject to the execution of binding definitive agreements and the completion of satisfactory due diligence, the establishment of the JV and the commencement of its operations in the U.S., including partnering with U.S. medical centers and the projected growth in the service robotics market. Instead, they are based only on our current beliefs, expectations and assumptions regarding the future of our business, future plans and strategies, projections, anticipated events and trends, the economy and other future conditions. Because forward-looking statements relate to the future, they are subject to inherent uncertainties, risks and changes in circumstances that are difficult to predict and many of which are outside of our control. Our actual results and financial condition may differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements. Therefore, you should not rely on any of these forward-looking statements. Important factors that could cause our actual results and financial condition to differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements include, among others, the following: our ability to adapt to significant future alterations in Amazon’s policies; our ability to sell our existing products and grow our brands and product offerings, including by acquiring new brands; our ability to meet our expectations regarding the revenue growth and the demand for e-commerce; the overall global economic environment; the impact of competition and new e-commerce technologies; general market, political and economic conditions in the countries in which we operate; projected capital expenditures and liquidity; the impact of possible changes in Amazon’s policies and terms of use; the impact of the conditions in Israel, including the recent attacks by Hamas, Iran, and other terrorist organizations; and the other risks and uncertainties described in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 20-F for the year ended December 31, 2023, filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), on April 1, 2024 and our other filings with the SEC.

If any other business is properly brought before the Meeting, the persons named as proxies may vote in respect thereof in accordance with their best judgment.\n\nUnder Israeli law, one or more shareholders holding at least 1% of the voting rights at the general meeting of the shareholders may request that the board of directors include a matter in the agenda of a general meeting of the shareholders to be convened in the future, provided that it is appropriate to discuss such a matter at the general meeting. Notwithstanding the foregoing, as a company listed on an exchange outside of Israel, a matter relating to the appointment or removal of a director may only be requested by one or more shareholders holding at least 5% of the voting rights at the general meeting of the shareholders. Our amended and restated articles of association contain procedural guidelines and disclosure items with respect to the submission of shareholder proposals for general meetings.\n\nThe last date for submitting a request to include a Proposal in accordance with Section 66(b) of the Israeli Companies Law, 5759-1999, is June 18, 2024. To the extent that there are any additional agenda items that our Board determines to add as a result of any such submission, the Company will publish an updated agenda and proxy card with respect to the Meeting, no later than Tuesday, June 25, 2024, which will be furnished to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “** _SEC_** ”), on a Report of Foreign Private Issuer on Form 6-K, and will be made available to the public on the SEC’s website at http://www.sec.gov.\n\n2\n\nThe approval of each of the Proposals requires the affirmative vote of the Company’s shareholders holding at least a majority of the Company’s ordinary shares present, in person or by proxy, and voting on the matter.\n\nThe approval of Proposal No.2, is subject to the fulfillment of one of the following additional voting requirements: (i) the majority of the ordinary shares that are voted at the Meeting in favor of the Proposal, excluding abstentions, includes a majority of the votes of shareholders who are not controlling shareholders or do not have a personal interest in the approval of the Proposal (each, an “** _Interested Shareholder_** ”); or (ii) the total number of ordinary shares of the shareholders mentioned in clause (i) above that are voted against the Proposal does not exceed two percent (2%) of the total voting rights in the Company.\n\nFor this purpose, a “** _controlling shareholder_** ” is any shareholder that has the ability to direct the Company’s activities (other than by means of being a director or office holder of the Company). A person is presumed to be a controlling shareholder if it holds or controls, by himself or together with others, one half or more of any one of the “means of control” of a company. “** _Means of control_** ” is defined as any one of the following: (i) the right to vote at a general meeting of a company, or (ii) the right to appoint directors of a company or its chief executive officer. A “personal interest” of a shareholder in an action or transaction of a company includes a personal interest of any of the shareholder’s relatives (i.e. spouse, brother or sister, parent, grandparent, child as well as child, brother, sister or parent of such shareholder’s spouse or the spouse of any of the above) or an interest of a company with respect to which the shareholder or the shareholder’s relative (as defined above) holds 5% or more of such company’s issued shares or voting rights, in which any such person has the right to appoint a director or the chief executive officer or in which any such person serves as director or the chief executive officer, including the personal interest of a person voting pursuant to a proxy which the proxy grantor has a personal interest, whether or not the person voting pursuant to such proxy has discretion with regards to the vote; and excludes an interest arising solely from the ownership of ordinary shares of a company. For the purpose of Proposal No. 2, the term controlling shareholder shall also include a person who holds 25% or more of the voting rights in the general meeting of the company if there is no other person who holds more than 50% of the voting rights in the company; for the purpose of a holding, two or more persons holding voting rights in the company each of which has a personal interest in the approval of the transaction being brought for approval of the company will be considered to be joint holders.\n\n**Under Israeli law, every voting shareholder is required to notify the Company whether such shareholder is an Interested Shareholder. To avoid confusion, every shareholder voting by means of the enclosed proxy card or voting instruction form, or via telephone or internet voting, will be deemed to confirm that such shareholder is NOT an Interested Shareholder. If you are an Interested Shareholder (in which case your vote will only count for or against the ordinary majority, and not for or against the special tally under Proposal No. 2), please notify Mr. Ronen Zalayet, Chief Financial Officer, at c/o Jeffs’ Brands Ltd, 7 Mezada Street, Bnei Brak, Israel, telephone: +972-3-771-3520, or by email (ronen@jeffsbrands.com). If your ordinary shares are held in “street name” by your broker, bank or other nominee and you are an Interested Shareholder, you should notify your broker, bank or other nominee of that status, and they in turn should notify the Company as described in the preceding sentence.**\n\nIn connection with Proposal No. 2, the Companies Law allows the Board to approve such proposal even if the general meeting of shareholders has voted against its approval, provided that the Company’s compensation committee, and thereafter the Board, each determines to approve it, based on detailed arguments, and after having reconsidered the matter.\n\nIn connection with Proposal No. 2, the Companies Law allows the Board to approve such proposal even if the general meeting of shareholders has voted against its approval, provided that the Company’s compensation committee, and thereafter the Board, each determines to approve it, based on detailed arguments, and after having reconsidered the matter.\n\nYou are entitled to receive notice of, and vote at, the Meeting if you are a shareholder of record at the close of business on Wednesday, June 12, 2024 (the “** _Record Date_** ”), in person or through a broker, trustee or other nominee that is one of our shareholders of record at such time, or which appear in the participant listing of a securities depository on that date.\n\n3\n\nYou can vote your ordinary shares by attending the Meeting or by completing and signing the proxy card to be distributed with the proxy statement. If you hold ordinary shares through a bank, broker or other nominee (i.e., in “street name”) which is one of our shareholders of record at the close of business on the Record Date, or which appears in the participant listing of a securities depository on that date, you must follow the instructions included in the voting instruction form you receive from your bank, broker or nominee, and may also be able to submit voting instructions to your bank, broker or nominee by phone or via the Internet. Please be certain to have your control number from your voting instruction form ready for use in providing your voting instructions. If you hold your ordinary shares in “street name,” you must obtain a legal proxy from the record holder to enable you to participate in and to vote your ordinary shares at the Meeting (or to appoint a proxy to do so).\n\n**_After careful consideration, the Board recommends that you vote FOR each of the above Proposals, which are described in the proxy statement._**\n\nThe presence (in person or by proxy) of any two or more shareholders holding, in the aggregate, at least 25% of the voting power of the Company’s ordinary shares constitutes a quorum for purposes of the Meeting. If such quorum is not present within half an hour from the time scheduled for the Meeting, the Meeting will be adjourned to Wednesday, July 17, 2024 at 5:00 p.m. (Israel time). At such adjourned meeting the presence of at least one or more shareholders in person or by proxy (regardless of the voting power represented by their ordinary shares) will constitute a quorum.\n\nWhether or not you plan to attend the Meeting, it is important that your ordinary shares be represented and voted at the Meeting. Accordingly, after reading the Notice of Annual General Meeting of Shareholders and the proxy statement, please sign, date and mail the proxy card in the envelope provided or vote by telephone or over the Internet in accordance with the instructions on your proxy card. If voting by mail, the proxy card must be received by no later than 11:59 p.m. EDT July 15, 2024 to be validly included in the tally of ordinary shares voted at the Meeting. Detailed proxy voting instructions will be provided both in the proxy statement and in the proxy card.\n\nBy Order of the Board of Directors,  \n---  \n/s/ Oz Adler  \nMr. Oz Adler  \n_Chairperson of the Board of Directors_  \n  \n4\n\n![](ex99-1_001.jpg)\n\n**Proxy Statement**\n\n**Annual General Meeting of Shareholders To Be Held on July 16, 2024**\n\nThis proxy statement is being furnished in connection with the solicitation of proxies on behalf of the board of directors (the “** _Board_** ”) of Jeffs’ Brands Ltd (the “** _Company_** ” or “** _Jeffs’ Brands_** ”) to be voted at an Annual General Meeting of Shareholders of the Company (the “** _Meeting_** ”), and at any adjournment or postponement thereof, pursuant to the accompanying Notice of Annual General Meeting of Shareholders. The Meeting will be held on Tuesday, July 16, 2024, at 5:00 p.m. (Israel time), at the Company’s offices, at 7 Mezada Street, Bnei Brak 5126112, Israel.\n\nThis proxy statement, the attached Notice of Annual General Meeting of Shareholders and the enclosed proxy card or voting instruction form are being made available to holders of Jeffs’ Brands ordinary shares, no par value (“** _ordinary shares_** ”), beginning June 11, 2024.\n\nYou are entitled to receive notice of, and vote at, the Meeting if you are a shareholder of record at the close of business on Wednesday, June 12, 2024 (the “** _Record Date_** ”), in person or through a broker, trustee or other nominee that is one of our shareholders of record at such time, or which appear in the participant listing of a securities depository on that date. You can vote your ordinary shares by attending the Meeting or by following the instructions under “ _How You Can Vote_ ” below. The Board urges you to vote your ordinary shares so that they will be counted at the Meeting or at any postponements or adjournments of the Meeting.\n\n**_Agenda Items_**\n\nThe following matters are on the agenda for the Meeting (the “** _Proposals_** ”):\n\n(1)| to re-elect of each of Mr. Liron Carmel and Mr. Eliyahu Yoresh as a Class II director, to serve until the Company’s third annual general meeting of shareholders following the Meeting, and until their respective successor is duly elected and qualified;  \n---|---  \n(2)| to approve a new Compensation Policy for the Company’s Executive Officers and Directors;  \n---|---  \n(3)| to approve the amendment to the articles of association of the Company;  \n---|---  \n(4)| to approve the amendment to the employment terms of Mr. Oz Adler, the chairperson of our Board of directors;  \n---|---  \n(5)| to approve the amendment to the employment terms of Mr. Viki Hakmon, the Company’s Chief Executive Officer (and a member of the Board);  \n---|---  \n(6)| to approve a reverse split of the Company’s issued and outstanding ordinary shares at a ratio between 1:2 and 1:22; and  \n---|---  \n(7)| to ratify and approve the re-appointment of Brightman Almagor Zohar & Co., a firm in the Deloitte Global Network, as our independent registered public accounting firm until the next annual general meeting of shareholders, and to authorize the Company’s Board (with power of delegation to its audit committee) to set the fees to be paid to such auditors.  \n---|---  \n  \nIn addition to considering the foregoing Proposals, the Company’s shareholders will have the opportunity to hear from representatives of the Company’s management, who will be available at the Meeting to review and discuss with shareholders the consolidated financial statements of the Company for the year ended December 31, 2023.\n\nWe are not aware of any other matters that will come before the Meeting. If any other matters are presented properly at the Meeting, the persons designated as proxies intend to vote upon such matters in accordance with their best judgment and the recommendation of the Board.\n\n5\n\n**_Board Recommendation_**\n\n**The Board unanimously recommends that you vote “FOR” each of the above Proposals.**\n\n**_Quorum and Adjournment_**\n\nOn June 11, 2024, we had a total of 9,177,100 ordinary shares issued and outstanding. Each ordinary share outstanding as of the close of business on June 12, 2024, is entitled to one vote on each of the Proposals to be presented at the Meeting. Under our amended and restated articles of association, currently in effect (the “** _Articles of Association_** ”), the Meeting will be properly convened if at least two shareholders attend the Meeting in person or sign and return proxies, provided that they hold ordinary shares representing at least 25% of our voting power. If such quorum is not present within half an hour from the time scheduled for the Meeting, the Meeting will be adjourned to Wednesday, July 17, 2024, at 5:00 p.m. (Israel time). At such adjourned meeting the presence of at least one or more shareholders in person or by proxy (regardless of the voting power represented by their ordinary shares) will constitute a quorum.\n\nAbstentions and “broker non-votes” are counted as present and entitled to vote for purposes of determining a quorum. A “broker non-vote” occurs when a bank, broker or other holder of record holding ordinary shares for a beneficial owner attends the Meeting but does not vote on a particular proposal because that holder does not have discretionary voting power for that particular item and has not received instructions from the beneficial owner. Brokers that hold ordinary shares in “street name” for clients (as described below) typically have authority to vote on “routine” proposals even when they have not received instructions from beneficial owners. The only item on the Meeting agenda that may be considered routine is Proposal No. 7 relating to the reappointment of the Company’s independent registered public accounting firm for the year ended December 31, 2024 and until the next annual general meeting of shareholders; however, we cannot be certain whether this will be treated as a routine matter since our proxy statement is prepared in compliance with the Israeli Companies Law 5759-1999 (the “** _Companies Law_** ”), rather than the rules applicable to domestic U.S. reporting companies. Therefore, it is important for a shareholder that holds ordinary shares through a bank or broker to instruct its bank or broker how to vote its ordinary shares, if the shareholder wants its ordinary shares to count for the Proposals.\n\n**_Vote Required for Approval of Each of the Proposals_**\n\nThe affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the voting power represented and voting in person or by proxy is required to approve each of the Proposals.\n\nThe approval of Proposal No. 2, is subject to the fulfillment of one of the following additional voting requirements: (i) the majority of the ordinary shares that are voted at the Meeting in favor of the Proposal, excluding abstentions, includes a majority of the votes of shareholders who are not controlling shareholders or do not have a personal interest in the approval of the Proposal (each, a “** _Interested Shareholder_** ”); or (ii) the total number of ordinary shares of the shareholders mentioned in clause (i) above that are voted against the Proposal does not exceed two percent (2%) of the total voting rights in the Company.\n\nFor this purpose, a “** _controlling shareholder_** ” is any shareholder that has the ability to direct the Company’s activities (other than by means of being a director or office holder of the Company. A person is presumed to be a controlling shareholder if it holds or controls, by himself or together with others, one half or more of any one of the “means of control” of a company. “** _Means of control_** ” is defined as any one of the following: (i) the right to vote at a general meeting of a company, or (ii) the right to appoint directors of a company or its chief executive officer. A “** _personal interest_** ” of a shareholder in an action or transaction of a company includes a personal interest of any of the shareholder’s relatives (i.e. spouse, brother or sister, parent, grandparent, child as well as child, brother, sister or parent of such shareholder’s spouse or the spouse of any of the above) or an interest of a company with respect to which the shareholder or the shareholder’s relative (as defined above) holds 5% or more of such company’s issued shares or voting rights, in which any such person has the right to appoint a director or the chief executive officer or in which any such person serves as director or the chief executive officer, including the personal interest of a person voting pursuant to a proxy which the proxy grantor has a personal interest, whether or not the person voting pursuant to such proxy has discretion with regards to the vote; and excludes an interest arising solely from the ownership of ordinary shares of a company. For the purpose of Proposal No. 2, the term controlling shareholder shall also include a person who holds 25% or more of the voting rights in the general meeting of the company if there is no other person who holds more than 50% of the voting rights in the company; for the purpose of a holding, two or more persons holding voting rights in the company each of which has a personal interest in the approval of the transaction being brought for approval of the company will be considered to be joint holders.\n\n6\n\n**Under Israeli law, every voting shareholder is required to notify the Company whether such shareholder is an Interested Shareholder. To avoid confusion, every shareholder voting by means of the enclosed proxy card or voting instruction form, or via telephone or internet voting, will be deemed to confirm that such shareholder is NOT an Interested Shareholder. If you are an Interested Shareholder (in which case your vote will only count for or against the ordinary majority, and not for or against the special tally under Proposal No. 2), please notify Mr. Ronen Zalayet, Chief Financial Officer, at c/o Jeffs’ Brands Ltd, 7 Mezada Street, Bnei Brak, Israel, telephone: +972-3-771-3520, or by email (ronen@jeffsbrands.com). If your ordinary shares are held in “street name” by your broker, bank or other nominee and you are an Interested Shareholder, you should notify your broker, bank or other nominee of that status, and they in turn should notify the Company as described in the preceding sentence.**\n\nIn connection with Proposal No. 2, the Companies Law allows the Board to approve such proposal even if the general meeting of shareholders has voted against its approval, provided that the Company’s compensation committee, and thereafter the Board, each determines to approve it, based on detailed arguments, and after having reconsidered the matter.\n\nYou are entitled to receive notice of, and vote at, the Meeting if you are a shareholder of record at the close of business on the Record Date in person or through a broker, trustee or other nominee that is one of our shareholders of record at such time, or which appear in the participant listing of a securities depository on that date. You can vote your ordinary shares by attending the Meeting or by following the instructions under “ _How You Can Vote_ ” below. The Board urges you to vote your ordinary shares so that they will be counted at the Meeting or at any postponements or adjournments of the Meeting.\n\nApart from for the purpose of determining a quorum, broker non-votes will not be counted as present and are not entitled to vote. Abstentions will not be treated as either a vote “FOR” or “AGAINST” a matter.\n\n**_How You Can Vote_**\n\nYou can vote either in person at the Meeting or by authorizing another person as your proxy, whether or not you attend the Meeting. You may vote in any of the manners below:\n\n●| ** _By Internet_** — If you are a shareholder of record, you can submit a proxy over the Internet by logging on to the website listed on the enclosed proxy card, entering your control number located on the enclosed proxy card and submitting a proxy by following the on-screen prompts. If you hold shares in “street name,” and if the brokerage firm, bank or other similar nominee that holds your shares offers Internet voting, you may follow the instructions shown on the enclosed voting instruction form in order to submit your proxy over the Internet;  \n---|---  \n●| ** _By telephone_** — If you are a shareholder of record, you can submit a proxy by telephone by calling the toll-free number listed on the enclosed proxy card, entering your control number located on the enclosed proxy card and following the prompts.

You should sign your name exactly as it appears on the enclosed proxy card. If you are signing in a representative capacity (for example, as a guardian, executor, trustee, custodian, attorney or officer of a corporation), please indicate your name and title or capacity. If you hold shares in “street name,” you have the right to direct your brokerage firm, bank or other similar organization on how to vote your shares, and the brokerage firm, bank or other similar organization is required to vote your shares in accordance with your instructions. To provide instructions to your brokerage firm, bank or other similar organization by mail, please complete, date, sign and return your voting instruction form in the postage-paid envelope provided by your brokerage firm, bank or other similar organization.  \n---|---  \n  \n7\n\n_Registered Holders_\n\nIf you are a shareholder of record whose ordinary shares are registered directly in your name with our transfer agent, VStock Transfer, LLC, you can vote your ordinary shares by attending the Meeting or by completing and signing a proxy card. In such case, these proxy materials are being sent directly to you. As the shareholder of record, you have the right to grant your voting proxy directly to the individuals listed as proxies on the proxy card or to vote in person at the Meeting. Please follow the instructions on the proxy card. You may change your mind and cancel your proxy card by sending us a written notice, by signing and returning a proxy card with a later date, or by voting in person or by proxy at the Meeting.

As a beneficial owner, you have the right to direct your broker, trustee or nominee how to vote, and you are also invited to attend the Meeting.\n\nBecause a beneficial owner is not a shareholder of record, you may not vote those ordinary shares directly at the Meeting unless you obtain a “legal proxy” from the broker, trustee or nominee that holds your ordinary shares, giving you the right to vote the ordinary shares at the Meeting. Your broker, trustee or nominee has enclosed or provided voting instructions for you to use in directing the broker, trustee or nominee how to vote your ordinary shares.\n\n**_Who Can Vote_**\n\nYou are entitled to receive notice of, and vote at, the Meeting if you are a shareholder of record at the close of business on the Record Date, in person or through a broker, trustee or other nominee that is one of our shareholders of record at such time, or which appear in the participant listing of a securities depository on that date.\n\n**_Revocation of Proxies_**\n\nShareholders of record may revoke the authority granted by their execution of proxies at any time before the effective exercise thereof by filing with us a written notice of revocation or duly executed proxy bearing a later date, or by voting in person at the Meeting.

Accordingly, the Board has determined that each of Messrs. Oz Adler, Amitay Weiss, Israel Berstein, Tomer Etzyoni and Moshe Revach satisfy the independent director requirements under the Nasdaq corporate governance requirements. As such, the Board is comprised of a majority of independent directors as such term is defined in the Nasdaq rules.\n\nThe Board has further determined that each member of our audit committee is independent as such term is defined in Rule 10A-3 under the Exchange Act, and that each member of our audit committee and compensation committee satisfies the additional requirements applicable under the Nasdaq rules to members of audit committees and compensation committees, respectively.\n\n9\n\n**BOARD DIVERSITY**\n\n**_As of June 11, 2024_**\n\nCountry of Principal Executive Offices | Israel  \n---|---  \nForeign Private Issuer | Yes  \nDisclosure Prohibited Under Home Country Law | No  \nTotal Number of Directors | 9  \nPart I: Gender Identity | Female | Male | Non-Binary | Did Not Disclose Gender  \nDirectors | 1 | 8 | 0 | 0  \nPart II: Demographic Background  \nUnderrepresented Individual in Home Country Jurisdiction | 0  \nLGBTQ+ | 0  \nDid Not Disclose Demographic Background | 3  \n  \n**PROPOSAL 1 APPROVAL OF THE RE-ELECTION OF EACH OF MR. LIRON CARMEL AND MR. ELIYAHU YORESH AS A CLASS II DIRECTOR OF THE COMPANY**\n\n**_Background_**\n\nThe Board currently has nine directors, who, other than with respect to our former external directors, are divided into three classes with staggered three-year terms as follows:\n\n●| the Class I directors consist of Mr. Amitay Weiss, Mr. Moshe Revach and Ms. Tali Dinar and their terms will expire at our annual general meeting of shareholders to be held in 2026;  \n---|---  \n●| the Class II directors consist of Mr. Liron Carmel and Mr. Eliyahu Yoresh and their terms expire at the Meeting; and  \n---|---  \n●| the Class III directors consist of Mr. Oz Adler, Mr. Viki Hakmon and their terms will expire at our annual general meeting of shareholders to be held in 2025.  \n---|---  \n  \nAt each annual general meeting of our shareholders, the election or re-election of directors following the expiration of the term of office of the directors of that class, will be for a term of office that expires on the date of the third annual general meeting following such election or re-election. Effective as of May 2024, and our adoption of the exemption under the Israeli Companies Regulations (Reliefs for Public Companies whose Shares are Listed on a Stock Exchange Outside of Israel), 2000, (the “** _Regulation_** ”), our directors in office who were elected and classified as external directors, Mr. Israel Berstein and Mr. Tomer Etzyoni, are no longer classified as such under the Companies Law. The transition rules set forth under the Regulation provide that such directors have the right to remain in office as our directors at their option after the exemption under the Regulation is adopted until the earlier of such directors’ original end of term of office or the second annual meeting of shareholders after the adoption of the exemption under the Regulation, which in the case of both Mr. Israel Berstein and Mr. Tomer Etzyoni is expected to be until the date of our annual meeting of shareholders to be held in 2025.\n\n10\n\nAt the Meeting, shareholders will be asked to re-elect each of Mr. Liron Carmel and Mr. Eliyahu Yoresh as a Class II director of the Company.\n\nIf re-elected at the Meeting, each of Mr. Liron Carmel and Mr. Eliyahu Yoresh will serve until the third annual general meeting of our shareholders following the Meeting, and until their successor has been duly elected and qualified, or until their office is vacated in accordance with our Articles of Association.\n\nIn accordance with the Companies Law, each of Mr. Liron Carmel and Mr. Eliyahu Yoresh has certified to us that they meet all the requirements of the Companies Law for election as a director of a public company and possess the necessary qualifications and has sufficient time to fulfill their duties as a director of Jeffs’ Brands, taking into account the special needs of Jeffs’ Brands.\n\nBiographical information concerning of Mr. Liron Carmel and Mr. Eliyahu Yoresh is set forth below:\n\n_Mr. Liron Carmel_ has served as one of our directors since September 2021.

The term “office holders,” as defined in the Companies Law, includes directors and most executive officers. Under the Companies Law, our compensation policy must be reviewed by the compensation committee of our Board, and by our Board, from time to time. In addition, the compensation committee, followed by the Board (based on the recommendation of the compensation committee) and our shareholders, are each required to approve and adopt the compensation policy once every three years. The compensation policy sets forth a framework for the terms of office and employment of our office holders, including with respect to the grant of any benefit, other payment or undertaking to provide payment, such as salary, bonus, equity awards, severance and other compensation (including in connection with termination of services or change of control over the Company), as well as exemption from liability, insurance or indemnification.\n\nOur compensation policy was last approved on May 3, 2022, effective as of the effective time of the registration statement for our initial public offering, in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Law (the “** _Existing Compensation Policy_** ”).\n\nOur compensation committee (the “** _Compensation Committee_** ”), and Board reviewed our Existing Compensation Policy during the period leading up to the convening of the Meeting. Based on that review, the Compensation Committee and the Board proposed adjustments to the form, which adjusted form is now being brought to the approval of the shareholders in accordance with the requirements under the Companies Law. A copy of the proposed policy is attached to this Proxy Statement as ** _Exhibit A_** and which we refer to as the Compensation Policy.\n\nWe have highlighted below certain key substantive features of the Compensation Policy. The following description is merely a summary of those features of our Compensation Policy. We urge you to review ** _Exhibit A_** in its entirety for the complete text of the Compensation Policy.\n\n**_Variable vs. Fixed Compensation of Executive Officers:_**\n\nThe total annual variable compensation — consisting of target bonus and target equity-based compensation (based on the fair market value, in accordance with the methodology to be set by our Company, at the time of grant) — of each executive officer will not exceed 95% of the total compensation package of that executive officer for a given year.\n\n12\n\n**_Annual Cash Bonus:_**\n\n_Executive Officers (other than the CEO):_\n\nThe target annual cash bonus for an executive officer, other than our chief executive officer (the “** _CEO_** ”), for any given calendar year, will not exceed four (4) of such executive officer’s monthly base salaries.\n\nThe maximum annual cash bonus — including for overachievement performance — that an executive officer, other than the CEO, will be entitled to actually receive for any given calendar year, will not exceed five (5) of such executive officer’s monthly base salary payments.\n\nIn accordance with the First Appendix to the Companies Law, the Compensation Policy provides that our Company may determine that whether a cash bonus will be paid or not to an executive officer who is subordinate to the CEO may be based in whole or in part on a discretionary evaluation of his or her performance.\n\n_CEO:_\n\nThe target annual cash bonus for the CEO for any given calendar year will not exceed six (6) of his or her monthly base salary payments.\n\nThe maximum annual cash bonus— including for overachievement performance — that the CEO will be entitled to actually receive for any given calendar year, will not exceed eight (8) of his or her monthly base salary payments.\n\nA portion of the annual cash bonus granted to our CEO — not exceeding two (2) of the CEO’s monthly base salary payments — may be based on a discretionary evaluation of the CEO’s overall performance by the Compensation Committee and the Board based on quantitative and qualitative criteria.\n\n**_Non-Material Changes to Compensation:_**\n\nThe Companies Law regulations allow for a non-material change in the terms of compensation of an executive officer other than the CEO to be approved by the CEO alone. According to the Compensation Policy non-material change in the terms of compensation of an executive officer other than the CEO to be approved by the CEO alone so long as the annual total cost to our Company from that change does not exceed an amount equal to two (2) monthly base salary payments of the relevant employee.\n\n**_Automatic Update Based on Updates to Companies Law:_**\n\nThe Compensation Policy includes a general provision allowing the Company to rely on any amendment to provisions of the Companies Law and any other applicable rules and regulations that facilitates our ability to more readily approve or pay executive officer or director compensation, even if that amendment contradicts the principles of the Compensation Policy.\n\nWe believe that the proposed executive compensation framework under the Compensation Policy will be effective in achieving our objectives of:\n\n●| To closely align the interests of the executive officers with those of the Company’s shareholders in order to enhance shareholder value;  \n---|---  \n●| To align a significant portion of the executive officers’ compensation with the Company’s short and long-term goals and performance;  \n---|---  \n●| To provide the executive officers with a structured compensation package, including competitive salaries, performance-motivating cash and equity incentive programs and benefits, and to be able to present to each executive officer an opportunity to advance in a growing organization;  \n---|---  \n●| To strengthen the retention and the motivation of executive officers in the long-term;  \n---|---  \n●| To provide appropriate awards in order to incentivize superior individual excellence and corporate performance; and  \n---|---  \n●| To maintain consistency in the way executive officers are compensated.  \n---|---  \n  \n13\n\n**_Annual Equity Awards:_**\n\nThe total fair market value of an annual equity-based compensation award at the time of grant (not including bonuses paid in equity in lieu of cash) shall not exceed: (i) with respect to the CEO - the higher of (w) 300% of his or her annual base salary or (x) 2% of the Company’s fair market value at the time of approval of the grant by the Board; and (ii) with respect to each of the other Executive Officers - the higher of (y) 150% of his or her annual base salary or (z) 1% of the Company’s fair market value at the time of approval of the grant by the Board.\n\nThe fair market value of the equity-based compensation for the Executive Officers will be determined by using the Black Scholes formula or according to other acceptable valuation practices at the time of grant, in each case, as determined by the Compensation Committee and the Board. \n\nThe equity-based compensation shall be granted from time to time and be individually determined and awarded according to the performance, educational background, prior business experience, qualifications, corporate role and the personal responsibilities of the Executive Officer.\n\n**_Compensation for Directors:_**\n\nThe Compensation Policy also governs the compensation of our Board members and provides that our chairperson and non-employee directors will be entitled to an annual cash fee retainer, up to the limits set forth in the Compensation Policy.\n\nUnder the Compensation Policy, our Board members may also be awarded annual equity-based compensation up to the limits set forth in the Compensation Policy, as shall be determined from time to time and approved by the Compensation Committee, the Board and the Company’s shareholders, which will be subject to a vesting schedule over several years. In addition, our directors will be entitled to reimbursement of expenses incurred in the performance of their duties to the Company.\n\n**_Clawback:_**\n\nIn accordance with the amendment to Rule 10D-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, in the event of an accounting restatement, we will be entitled to recover from our executive officers the bonus compensation or performance-based equity compensation in the amount by which that compensation exceeded what would have been paid under our financial statements, as restated.\n\nIf the Compensation Policy is not approved by our shareholders in accordance with the required special majority under the Companies Law, our Board may nevertheless approve it, provided that the Compensation Committee and the Board determine, after additional discussions concerning the Compensation Policy, and for specified reasons, that the approval of the Compensation Policy is beneficial to our Company.\n\n**_Proposal_**\n\nIt is proposed that the following resolution be adopted at the Meeting:\n\n“**RESOLVED** , to approve and adopt the Compensation Policy for the Executive Officers and Directors of the Company, in the form attached as **_Exhibit A_** to the Proxy Statement, dated June 11, 2024.”\n\n**_Vote Required_**\n\nSee “ _Vote Required for Approval of Each of the Proposals_ ” above.\n\n**_Board Recommendation_**\n\n**The Board recommends a vote “FOR” the approval and adoption of the Compensation Policy.**\n\n14\n\n**PROPOSAL 3 APPROVAL OF AMENDMENT TO THE ARTICLES OF ASSOCIATION OF THE COMPANY**\n\nAt the Meeting, shareholders will be asked to approve amendments to the Articles of Association of the Company (the “** _Proposed Articles_** ”) in the form attached hereto as **_Exhibit B_**.\n\nThe Proposed Articles, if approved by our shareholders, will become effective immediately following the Meeting. If the Proposed Articles will not be approved by our shareholders, our current Articles of Association will remain in full force and effect.\n\nThe Proposed Articles include, among others, the following changes:\n\n__Authorized Share Capital__\n\nUnder our current Articles of Association, our authorized share capital consists of 43,567,567 ordinary shares, no par value. As of June 11, 2024, an aggregate of 9,177,100 ordinary shares were issued and outstanding.\n\nWe propose to approve an increase of the Company’s authorized share capital, by an additional 46,432,433 ordinary shares no par value, and has determined that it is in the best interest of the Company and its shareholders.\n\nThe increase in the authorized share capital of the Company is designed to enable us to have sufficient authorized share capital for the upcoming years and to allow us to meet our future business needs as they arise. These needs could include, among other things, the sale of shares in public and private offerings to raise additional capital, the acquisition of other companies, the use of shares for various equity compensation and other employee benefit plans and arrangements and other bona fide corporate purposes.\n\n__Shareholder Proposal Request.__\n\nSection 25(a) of our current Articles of Association concerning our shareholders’ ability to add a proposal to the agenda of a general meeting reflects the then applicable provisions of the Companies Law and the regulations promulgated thereunder at that time. Accordingly, Section 25(a) of our current Articles of Association reflects that any Company shareholder that holds at least one percent (1%) of the Company’s voting rights may request, subject to the requirements of the Companies Law, that the Board includes a matter for consideration at a shareholders meeting.\n\nOn March 12, 2024, certain amendments to the Israeli Companies Regulations (Relief for Companies with Securities Listed for Trading on a Foreign Stock Exchange) (the “** _Amended Regulations_** ”) became effective. Under the Amended Regulations, a shareholder must hold at least five percent (5%) of a company’s voting rights in order to request that the Board add a proposal to the agenda of a general meeting relating to the appointment or removal of a director.\n\n15\n\nIn order to align our Articles of Association with the Amended Regulations, our Board is proposing to amend Section 25(a) of our Articles of Association as follows (additions underlined and deletions in strikethrough):\n\n_25. Shareholder Proposal Request_.\n\n(a) Any Shareholder or Shareholders of the Company holding at least _the required percentage_ ~~one precent (1%) or a higher precent, as may be required by,~~ under the Companies Law ~~from time to time~~ of the voting rights of the Company _which entitles such Shareholder(s) to require the Company to include a matter on the agenda of a General Meeting_ (the “**Proposing Shareholder(s)** ”) may request, subject to the Companies Law, that the Board of Directors include a matter on the agenda of a General Meeting to be held in the future, provided that the Board _of Directors_ determines that the matter is appropriate to be considered ~~in~~ _at_ a General Meeting (a “**Proposal Request** ”). In order for the Board of Directors to consider a Proposal Request and whether to include the matter stated therein in the agenda of a General Meeting, notice of the Proposal Request must be timely delivered in accordance with applicable law, and the Proposal Request must comply with the requirements of these Articles (including this Article 25) and any applicable law and stock exchange rules and regulations. The Proposal Request must be in writing, signed by all of the Proposing shareholder(s) making such request, delivered, either in person or by certified mail, postage prepaid, and received by the secretary (or, in the absence thereof by the Chief Executive Officer of the Company).

Our Board and its Compensation Committee have designed our compensation programs to support the creation of shareholders’ value while also maintaining our ability to recruit and retain talent. We view long-term incentive compensation in the form of equity linked awards as a critical element of the compensation package offered to our executives.\n\nMr. Viki Hakmon has been instrumental in the Company’s recent corporate developments, including successful capital raises and improvements to the Company’s strategy.\n\nAt the Meeting, shareholder will be asked to approve the following amendments to the compensation terms of Mr. Viki Hakmon, the Chief Executive Officer of the Company:\n\n(i)| An annual bonus for year 2023 in the amount of four (4) monthly base salary payments;  \n---|---  \n(ii)| A monthly reimbursement of car and mobile expenses of NIS 4,000 (including full gross up);  \n---|---  \n(iii)| An annual bonus of up to six (6) monthly base salary payments (or eight monthly (8) base salary payments in the case of overachievement), subject to objectives which are annually predetermined by our Compensation Committee and Board, in accordance with our compensation policy.  \n---|---  \n  \nThe proposed employment terms of Mr. Viki Hakmon are in line with our current compensation policy as approved by our shareholders and the proposed Compensation Policy as attached to the Proxy Statement dated June 11, 2024.\n\n**_Proposal_**\n\nIt is proposed that the following resolution be adopted at the Meeting:\n\n“**RESOLVED** , to approve the compensation terms of Mr. Viki Hakmon, our Chief Executive Officer as detailed in the Proxy Statement, dated June 11, 2024.”\n\n**_Vote Required_**\n\nSee “ _Vote Required for Approval of Each of the Proposals_ ” above.\n\n**_Board Recommendation_**\n\n**The Board recommends a vote “FOR” the approval of the compensation terms of Mr. Viki Hakmon.**\n\n19\n\n**PROPOSAL 6**\n\n**APPROVAL OF A REVERSE SHARE SPLIT OF THE COMPANY’S ISSUED AND OUTSTANDING ORDINARY SHARES**\n\n**_Background_**\n\nOn July 25, 2023, the Board approved a framework for a reverse split of the Company’s issued and outstanding ordinary shares in the range of a ratio of between 1:2 and 1:22, to be effected at the discretion of, and at such ratio and on such date to be determined by, the Board. Such resolution is subject to the approval of our shareholders.\n\nWe are therefore seeking approval of the shareholders to effect a reverse split of the Company’s issued and outstanding ordinary shares at a ratio of between 1:2 and 1:22, such that, depending on the ratio, every two ordinary shares and up to twenty two ordinary shares shall be converted into one ordinary share (the “** _Reverse Split_** ”). If this Proposal 6 is approved by our shareholders, the Board will have the authority, in its own discretion, to determine if to implement the Reverse Split, and the exact ratio and the effective date of the Reverse Split.\n\nIf the Reverse Split is implemented, the number of the issued and outstanding ordinary shares would be reduced in accordance with the Reverse Split ratio. The Reverse Split, if implemented, would not adjust the number of authorized ordinary shares under our Articles of Association, which, as of the date hereof consist of 43,567,567 ordinary shares, and if approved under Proposal 3, will consist of 90,000,000. In addition, if the Reverse Split is implemented, the exercise price and the number of ordinary shares issuable pursuant to outstanding options and warrants will be proportionately adjusted pursuant to the terms of the respective options and warrants in connection with the Reverse Split. Furthermore, upon completion of the Reverse Split, the number of ordinary shares available for issuance under our incentive plans shall be appropriately adjusted.\n\nNo fractional shares will be issued as a result of the Reverse Split. In accordance with our Articles of Association, all fractional shares will be rounded to the nearest whole ordinary share, such that only shareholders holding fractional consolidated shares of more than one half of one whole share shall be entitled to receive one consolidated share.\n\nUpon the implementation of the Reverse Split, we intend to treat shares held by shareholders through a bank, broker, custodian or other nominee in the same manner as registered shareholders whose shares are registered in their names. Banks, brokers, custodians or other nominees will be instructed to effect the Reverse Split for their beneficial holders holding our ordinary shares in street name. However, these banks, brokers, custodians or other nominees may have different procedures than registered shareholders for processing the Reverse Split. Shareholders who hold our ordinary shares with a bank, broker, custodian or other nominee and who have any questions in this regard are encouraged to contact their banks, brokers, custodians or other nominees.\n\n**_Proposal_**\n\nIt is proposed that the following resolution be adopted at the Meeting:\n\n“**RESOLVED** , to approve a reverse share split of the Company’s issued and outstanding ordinary shares in the range of a ratio between 1:2 and 1:22, such that, depending on the ratio, every two ordinary shares and up to twenty two ordinary shares shall be converted into one ordinary share, to be effected at the discretion of, and at such ratio and on such date to be determined by the Board, as detailed in the Proxy Statement, dated June 11, 2024.”\n\n**_Vote Required_**\n\nSee “ _Vote Required for Approval of Each of the Proposals_ ” above.\n\n**_Board Recommendation_**\n\n**The Board recommends a vote “FOR” the approval of the Reverse Split.**\n\n20\n\n**PROPOSAL 7 RE-APPOINTMENT OF INDEPENDENT AUDITORS AND AUTHORIZATION OF THE BOARD TO FIX THEIR REMUNERATION**\n\n**_Background_**\n\nOur audit committee and Board have approved the re-appointment of Brightman Almagor Zohar & Co., a firm in the Deloitte Global Network, as our independent registered public accounting firm for the year ending December 31, 2024 and until the next annual general meeting of shareholders, subject to the approval of our shareholders.

Overview and Objectives_**\n\n**1.**| **Introduction**  \n---|---  \n  \nThis document sets forth the Compensation Policy for Executive Officers and Directors (this “**Compensation Policy** ” or “**Policy** ”) of Jeffs’ Brands Ltd. (“**Jeffs' Brands** ” or the “**Company** ”), in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Law, 5759-1999 and the regulations promulgated thereunder (the “**Companies Law** ”).\n\nCompensation is a key component of Jeffs’ Brands’ overall human capital strategy to attract, retain, reward, and motivate highly skilled individuals that will enhance Jeffs’ Brands’ value and otherwise assist Jeffs’ Brands to reach its business and financial long-term goals. Accordingly, the structure of this Policy is established to tie the compensation of each officer to Jeffs’ Brands’ goals and performance.\n\nFor purposes of this Policy, “Executive Officers” shall mean “Office Holders” as such term is defined in Section 1 of the Companies Law, excluding, unless otherwise expressly indicated herein, Jeffs’ Brands’ directors.\n\nThis policy is subject to applicable law and is not intended, and should not be interpreted as limiting or derogating from, provisions of applicable law to the extent not permitted.\n\nThis Policy shall apply to compensation agreements and arrangements which will be approved after the date on which this Policy is adopted and shall serve as Jeffs’ Brands’ Compensation Policy for three (3) years, commencing as of its adoption, unless amended earlier.\n\nThe Compensation Committee and the Board of Directors of Jeffs’ Brands (the “**Compensation Committee** ” and the “**Board** ”, respectively) shall review and reassess the adequacy of this Policy from time to time, as required by the Companies Law.\n\n**2.**| **Objectives**  \n---|---  \n  \nJeffs’ Brands’ objectives and goals in setting this Policy are to attract, motivate and retain experienced and talented leaders who will contribute to Jeffs’ Brands’ success and enhance shareholder value, while demonstrating professionalism in an achievement-oriented and merit-based culture that rewards long-term excellence, and embedding and modeling Jeffs’ Brands’ core values as part of a motivated behavior. To that end, this Policy is designed, among other things:\n\n2.1.| To closely align the interests of the Executive Officers with those of Jeffs’ Brands’ shareholders in order to enhance shareholder value;  \n---|---  \n2.2.| To align a significant portion of the Executive Officers’ compensation with Jeffs’ Brands’ short and long-term goals and performance;  \n---|---  \n2.3.| To provide the Executive Officers with a structured compensation package, including competitive salaries, performance-motivating cash and equity incentive programs and benefits, and to be able to present to each Executive Officer an opportunity to advance in a growing organization;  \n---|---  \n2.4.| To strengthen the retention and the motivation of Executive Officers in the long-term;  \n---|---  \n  \nEx A-1\n\n2.5.| To provide appropriate awards in order to incentivize superior individual excellence and corporate performance; and  \n---|---  \n2.6.| To maintain consistency in the way Executive Officers are compensated.  \n---|---  \n**3.**| **Compensation Instruments**  \n---|---  \n  \nCompensation instruments under this Policy may include the following:\n\n3.1.| Base salary;  \n---|---  \n3.2.| Benefits;  \n---|---  \n3.3.| Cash bonuses;  \n---|---  \n3.4.| Equity based compensation;  \n---|---  \n3.5.| Change of control provisions; and  \n---|---  \n3.6.| Retirement and termination terms.  \n---|---  \n**4.**| **Overall Compensation - Ratio Between Fixed and Variable Compensation**  \n---|---  \n4.1.| This Policy aims to balance the mix of “Fixed Compensation” (comprised of base salary and benefits) and “Variable Compensation” (comprised of cash bonuses and equity-based compensation) in order to, among other things, appropriately incentivize Executive Officers to meet Jeffs’ Brands’ short and long-term goals while taking into consideration the Company’s need to manage a variety of business risks.  \n---|---  \n4.2.| The total annual target bonus and equity-based compensation per vesting annum (based on the fair market value at the time of grant calculated on a linear basis) of each Executive Officer shall not exceed 95% of such Executive Officer’s total compensation package for such year.  \n---|---  \n**5.**| **Inter-Company Compensation Ratio**  \n---|---  \n5.1.| In the process of drafting this Policy, Jeffs’ Brands’ Board and Compensation Committee have examined the ratio between employer cost associated with the engagement of the Executive Officers, including directors, and the average and median employer cost associated with the engagement of Jeffs’ Brands’ other employees (including contractor employees as defined in the Companies Law) (the “**Ratio** ”).  \n---|---  \n5.2.| The possible ramifications of the Ratio on the daily working environment in Jeffs’ Brands were examined and will continue to be examined by Jeffs’ Brands from time to time in order to ensure that levels of executive compensation, as compared to the overall workforce will not have a negative impact on work relations in Jeffs’ Brands.  \n---|---  \n  \n**_B. Base Salary and Benefits_**\n\n**6.**| **Base Salary**  \n---|---  \n6.1.| A base salary provides stable compensation to Executive Officers and allows Jeffs’ Brands to attract and retain competent executive talent and maintain a stable management team. The base salary varies among Executive Officers, and is individually determined according to the educational background, prior vocational experience, qualifications, corporate role, business responsibilities and past performance of each Executive Officer.  \n---|---  \n6.2.| Since a competitive base salary is essential to Jeffs’ Brands’ ability to attract and retain highly skilled professionals, Jeffs’ Brands will seek to establish a base salary that is competitive with base salaries paid to Executive Officers in a peer group of other companies operating in technology sectors that are as much as possible similar in their characteristics to Jeffs’ Brands. To that end, Jeffs’ Brands shall utilize comparative market data and practices as a reference, including a survey comparing and analyzing the level of the overall compensation package offered to an Executive Officer of the Company with compensation packages for persons serving in similar positions (to that of the relevant officer) in the peer group. Such compensation survey may be conducted internally or through an external independent consultant.  \n---|---  \n  \nEx A-2\n\n6.3.| The Compensation Committee and the Board may periodically consider and approve base salary adjustments for Executive Officers. The main considerations for salary adjustment will be similar to those used in initially determining the base salary, but may also include change of role or responsibilities, recognition for professional achievements, regulatory or contractual requirements, budgetary constraints or market trends. The Compensation Committee and the Board will also consider the previous and existing compensation arrangements of the Executive Officer whose base salary is being considered for adjustment. Any limitation herein based on the annual base salary shall be calculated based on the monthly base salary applicable at the time of consideration of the respective grant or benefit.  \n---|---  \n**7.**| **Benefits**  \n---|---  \n7.1.| The following benefits may be granted to the Executive Officers in order, among other things, to comply with legal requirements:  \n---|---  \n7.1.1.| Vacation days in accordance with market practice;  \n---|---  \n7.1.2.| Sick days in accordance with market practice;  \n---|---  \n7.1.3.| Convalescence pay according to applicable law;  \n---|---  \n7.1.4.| Monthly remuneration for a study fund, as allowed by applicable law and with reference to Jeffs’ Brands’ practice and the practice in peer group companies (including contributions on bonus payments);  \n---|---  \n7.1.5.| Jeffs’ Brands shall contribute on behalf of the Executive Officer to an insurance policy or a pension fund, as allowed by applicable law and with reference to Jeffs’ Brands’ policies and procedures and the practice in peer group companies (including contributions on bonus payments); and  \n---|---  \n7.1.6.| Jeffs’ Brands shall contribute on behalf of the Executive Officer towards work disability insurance, as allowed by applicable law and with reference to Jeffs’ Brands’ policies and procedures and to the practice in peer group companies.  \n---|---  \n7.2.| Non-Israeli Executive Officers may receive other similar, comparable or customary benefits as applicable in the relevant jurisdiction in which they are employed. Such customary benefits shall be determined based on the methods described in Section ‎6.2 of this Policy (with the necessary changes and adjustments).  \n---|---  \n7.3.| In the events of relocation and/or repatriation of an Executive Officer to another geography, such Executive Officer may receive other similar, comparable or customary benefits as applicable in the relevant jurisdiction in which he or she is employed or additional payments to reflect adjustments in the cost of living. Such benefits may include reimbursement for out-of-pocket one-time payments and other ongoing expenses, such as a housing allowance, a car allowance, home leave visit, etc.  \n---|---  \n  \nEx A-3\n\n7.4.| Jeffs’ Brands may offer additional benefits to its Executive Officers, which will be comparable to customary market practices, such as, but not limited to: cellular and land line phone benefits, company car and travel benefits, reimbursement of business travel including a daily stipend when traveling and other business related expenses, insurances, other benefits (such as newspaper subscriptions, academic and professional studies), etc., provided, however, that such additional benefits shall be determined in accordance with Jeffs’ Brands’ policies and procedures.  \n---|---  \n  \n**_C. Cash Bonuses_**\n\n**8.**| **Annual Cash Bonuses - The Objective**  \n---|---  \n8.1.| Compensation in the form of an annual cash bonus is an important element in aligning the Executive Officers’ compensation with Jeffs’ Brands’ objectives and business goals. Therefore, annual cash bonuses will reflect a pay-for-performance element, with payout eligibility and levels determined based on actual financial and operational results, in addition to other factors the Compensation Committee may determine, including individual performance.  \n---|---  \n8.2.| An annual cash bonus may be awarded to Executive Officers upon the attainment of pre-set periodical objectives and individual targets determined by the Compensation Committee (and, if required by law, by the Board) for each fiscal year, or in connection with such officer’s engagement, in case of newly hired Executive Officers, taking into account Jeffs’ Brands’ short and long-term goals, as well as its compliance and risk management policies. The Compensation Committee and the Board may also determine applicable minimum thresholds that must be met for entitlement to the annual cash bonus (all or any portion thereof) and the formula for calculating any annual cash bonus payout, with respect to each fiscal year, for each Executive Officer. In special circumstances, as determined by the Compensation Committee and the Board (e.g., regulatory changes, significant changes in Jeffs’ Brands’ business environment, a significant organizational change, significant merger and acquisition events, etc.), the Compensation Committee and the Board may modify the objectives and/or their relative weight during the fiscal year, or may modify payouts following the conclusion of the year.  \n---|---  \n8.3.| In the event that the employment of an Executive Officer is terminated prior to the end of a fiscal year, the Company may (but shall not be obligated to) pay such Executive Officer an annual cash bonus (which may or may not be pro-rated) assuming the Executive Officer is otherwise entitled to an annual cash bonus.  \n---|---  \n8.4.| The actual annual cash bonus to be paid to Executive Officers shall be approved by the Compensation Committee and the Board.  \n---|---  \n**9.**| **Annual Cash Bonuses - The Formula**  \n---|---  \n  \n_Executive Officers other than the CEO_\n\n9.1.| The performance objectives for the annual cash bonus of Jeffs’ Brands’ Executive Officers, other than the chief executive officer (the “CEO”), may be approved by Jeffs’ Brands’ CEO (in lieu of the Compensation Committee) and may be based on company, division/ departmental/business unit and individual objectives. Measurable performance objectives, which include the objectives and the weight to be assigned to each achievement in the overall evaluation, may be based on actual financial and operational results, personal objectives, operational objectives, project milestones objectives or investment in human capital objectives. The Company may also grant annual cash bonuses to Jeffs’ Brands’ Executive Officers, other than the CEO, on a discretionary basis.  \n---|---  \n  \nEx A-4\n\n9.2.| The target annual cash bonus that an Executive Officer, other than the CEO, will be entitled to receive for any given fiscal year, will not exceed four (4) of such Executive Officer’s monthly base salaries.  \n---|---  \n9.3.| The maximum annual cash bonus, including for overachievement performance, that an Executive Officer, other than the CEO, will be entitled to receive for any given fiscal year, will not exceed five (5) of such Executive Officer’s monthly base salaries.  \n---|---  \n  \n_CEO_\n\n9.4.| The annual cash bonus of Jeffs’ Brands’ CEO will be based on measurable performance objectives and subject to minimum thresholds as provided in Section 8.2 above and based on a discretionary element as provided in Section 9.5 below. Measurable performance objectives will be determined annually by Jeffs’ Brands’ Compensation Committee (and, if required by law, by Jeffs’ Brands’ Board) and will be based on company and personal objectives.  \n---|---  \n9.5.| The annual cash bonus granted to Jeffs’ Brands’ CEO, may be based on a discretionary evaluation of the CEO’s overall performance by the Compensation Committee and the Board based on quantitative and qualitative criteria. The discretionary bonus for any given fiscal year will not exceed two (2) of the CEO’s monthly base salaries.  \n---|---  \n9.6.| The target annual cash bonus that the CEO will be entitled to receive for any given fiscal year, will not exceed six (6) of his or her monthly base salaries.  \n---|---  \n9.7.| The maximum annual cash bonus including for overachievement performance that the CEO will be entitled to receive for any given fiscal year, will not exceed eight (8) of his or her monthly base salaries.  \n---|---  \n**10.**| **Other Bonuses**  \n---|---  \n10.1.| _Special Bonus_. Jeffs’ Brands may grant its Executive Officers a special bonus as an award for special achievements (such as in connection with mergers and acquisitions, offerings, achieving target budget or business plan objectives under exceptional circumstances, or special recognition in case of retirement) or as a retention award at the CEO’s discretion for Executive Officers other than the CEO (and in the CEO’s case, at the Compensation Committee’s and the Board’s discretion), subject to any additional approval as may be required by the Companies Law (the “**Special Bonus** ”). Any such Special Bonus will not exceed 200% of the Executive Officer’s annual base salary. A Special Bonus can be paid, in whole or in part, in equity in lieu of cash and the value of any such equity component of a Special Bonus shall be determined in accordance with Section ‎13.3 below.  \n---|---  \n10.2.| _Signing Bonus_. Jeffs’ Brands may grant a newly recruited Executive Officer a signing bonus. Any such signing bonus shall be granted and determined at the CEO’s discretion for Executive Officers other than the CEO (and in the CEO’s case, at the Compensation Committee’s and the Board’s discretion), subject to any additional approval as may be required by the Companies Law (the “**Signing Bonus** ”). Any such Signing Bonus will not exceed 100% of the Executive Officer’s annual base salary.  \n---|---  \n10.3.| _Relocation/ Repatriation Bonus_.
