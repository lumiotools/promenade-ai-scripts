This transition is a calculated move designed to align our offerings with the evolving needs of our aging population. While we anticipate some short-term revenue fluctuations as we implement this strategy, we remain committed to maintaining robust profitability and positive cash flow. Our partnerships with community centers and the introduction of integrated products, such as our 'Food as Medicine' line, are pivotal in creating a holistic ecosystem that addresses the lifestyle and wellness demands of older adults. As we advance through fiscal year 2025, our focus will be on establishing sustainable competitive advantages that contribute to long-term value for our shareholders.”\n\nMr. Dong Xie, Chief Financial Officer of QuantaSing, added, “The financial results for the first quarter reflect our commitment to profitability during this strategic transition. We have seen improvements in operational efficiency as we shift from a traffic-driven to a product-driven business model, while also scaling back investments in non-core areas. Our disciplined cost management has resulted in a healthy net margin of 10.0%, and our cash position has strengthened to RMB1,193.7 million as of September 30, 2024. This solid financial foundation provides us with the flexibility to pursue growth opportunities within the silver economy while ensuring we maintain profitability.”\n\n**Financial Results for the First Quarter of FY 2025**\n\n**Revenues**\n\nRevenues were RMB810.4 million (US$115.5 million) in the first quarter of FY 2025, compared to RMB869.1 in the first quarter of FY 2024. The change was primarily due to a shift in revenue streams as the Company strategically moved towards the silver economy.\n\n  * _Revenues from individual online learning services_ decreased by 6.2% year over year to RMB709.0 million (US$101.0million) in the first quarter of FY 2025, from RMB755.9 million in the first quarter of FY 2024. This decrease was primarily due to the decline of RMB82.8 million (US$11.8 million) in revenues from financial literacy courses and the decline of RMB35.6 million (US$5.1 million) in revenues from recreation and leisure courses3, partially offset by the increase of RMB71.5 million (US$10.2 million) in revenues from skills upgrading courses3.\n  * _Revenues from enterprise services_ were RMB47.8 million (US$6.8 million) in the first quarter of FY 2025, compared to RMB68.4 million in the first quarter of FY 2024, representing a year-over year change of 30.2%, primarily due to a change in revenue streams from transactions involving a related party and certain other third parties.\n  * _Revenues from consumer business_ 4 increased to RMB49.5 million (US$7.1 million) in the first quarter of FY 2025, representing a 10.4% increase from RMB44.8 million in the first quarter of FY 2024, as a result of the Company’s expansion into wellness products.\n  * _Revenues from othe_ rs4 were RMB4.1 million (US$0.6 million) in the first quarter of FY 2025, compared to nil in the first quarter of FY 2024, primarily due to revenue generated from the Company’s online language education services for children.\n\n\n\n**Cost of revenues**\n\nCost of revenues was RMB134.4 million (US$19.2 million) in the first quarter of FY 2025, compared to RMB118.2 million in the first quarter of FY 2024, representing a change of 13.8%. This increase was primarily due to increased labor outsourcing costs of RMB13.8 million (US$2.0 million) and higher procurement costs of RMB4.3 million (US$0.6 million).\n\n**Sales and marketing expenses**\n\nSales and marketing expenses were RMB515.0 million (US$73.4 million) in the first quarter of FY2025, compared to RMB620.2 million in the first quarter of FY 2024, representing a decrease of 17.0%. The decrease was mainly due to declines in marketing and promotion expenses of RMB81.6 million (US$11.6 million), labor outsourcing costs of RMB11.2 million (US$1.6 million), and staff costs of RMB9.5 million (US$1.4 million), which includes a decrease in share-based compensation expenses of RMB4.5 million (US$0.6 million).\n\n**Research and development expenses**\n\nResearch and development expenses were RMB28.1 million (US$4.0 million) in the first quarter of FY 2025, compared to RMB43.8 million in the first quarter of FY 2024, representing a decrease of 35.9%.

The decrease was primarily due to a decline in share-based compensation expenses of RMB10.4 million (US$1.5 million).\n\n**Net income and adjusted net income**\n\nNet income was RMB80.7 million (US$11.5 million) in the first quarter of FY 2025, compared with RMB66.7 million in the first quarter of FY 2024. Adjusted net income was RMB88.0 million (US$12.5 million) in the first quarter of FY 2025, compared with RMB94.0 million in the first quarter of FY 2024.\n\n**Earnings per share and adjusted earnings per share** 5\n\nBasic and diluted net income per share were RMB0.52 (US$0.07) and RMB0.50 (US$0.07), respectively, in the first quarter of FY 2025, compared with basic and diluted net income per share of RMB0.39 and RMB0.38, respectively, in the first quarter of FY 2024.

Listeners may access the call by dialing the following numbers:\n\nInternational:| 1-412-902-4272  \n---|---  \nUnited States Toll Free:| 1-888-346-8982  \nMainland China Toll Free:| 4001-201203  \nHong Kong Toll Free:| 800-905945  \nConference ID:| QuantaSing Group Limited  \n  \nThe replay will be accessible through December 4, 2024 by dialing the following numbers:\n\nInternational:| 1-412-317-0088  \n---|---  \nUnited States Toll Free:| 1-877-344-7529  \nReplay Access Code:| 9195244  \n  \nA live and archived webcast of the conference call will be available at the Company's investor relations website at https://ir.quantasing.com.\n\n**Non-GAAP Financial Measures**\n\nTo supplement the Company’s consolidated financial statements, which are prepared and presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP, the Company uses gross billings of individual online learning services, adjusted net income and basic and diluted adjusted net income per share as its non-GAAP financial measures. Gross billings of individual online learning services for a specific period represents revenues of the Company’s individual online learning services net of the changes in deferred revenues in such period, further adjusted by value-added tax in such period. Adjusted net income represents net income excluding share-based compensation expense. Basic and diluted adjusted net income per share represents adjusted net income attributable to ordinary shareholders of QuantaSing Group Limited divided by weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the periods used in computing adjusted net income per share, basic and diluted. The Company believes that the non-GAAP financial measures provide useful information about the Company's results of operations, enhance the overall understanding of the Company's past performance and future prospects and allow for greater visibility with respect to key metrics used by the Company's management in its financial and operational decision-making.\n\nThe non-GAAP financial measures are not defined under U.S. GAAP and are not presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The non-GAAP financial measures have limitations as analytical tools, and when assessing the Company's operating performance, investors should not consider them in isolation, or as a substitute for revenue, net income, net income per share, basic and diluted or other consolidated statements of operations data prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The Company's definition of non-GAAP financial measures may differ from those of industry peers and may not be comparable with their non-GAAP financial measures.\n\nThe Company mitigates these limitations by reconciling the non-GAAP financial measures to the most comparable U.S. GAAP performance measures, all of which should be considered when evaluating the Company's performance. For more information on these non-GAAP financial measures, please see the table captioned “QuantaSing Group Limited Unaudited Reconciliation of GAAP and Non-GAAP Results” near the end of this release.\n\n**Exchange Rate Information**\n\nThis announcement contains translations of certain Renminbi (“RMB”) amounts into U.S. dollars (“US$”) at specified rates solely for the convenience of the reader. Unless otherwise stated, all translations from Renminbi to U.S. dollars were made at the rate of RMB7.0176 to US$1.00, the exchange rate on September 30, 2024, set forth in the H.10 statistical release of the Federal Reserve Board. The Company makes no representation that the Renminbi or U.S. dollars amounts referred to could be converted into U.S. dollars or Renminbi, as the case may be, at any particular rate or at all.\n\n**Safe Harbor Statements**\n\nThis announcement contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of Securities Act of 1933, as amended and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended and the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1955.
