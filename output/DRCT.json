(Nasdaq: DRCT) (\"Direct Digital Holdings\" or the \"Company\"), a leading advertising and marketing technology platform operating through its companies Colossus Media, LLC (\"Colossus SSP\") and Orange 142, LLC (\"Orange 142\"), today announced financial results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2024.\n\nMark D. Walker, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, commented, \"The past few quarters have presented significant challenges for our company due to a targeted and defamatory disinformation campaign. We describe this as disinformation not only because it contained factual inaccuracies, but also because it omitted key insights and context that would have clarified our business practices. As a result, Direct Digital Holdings experienced an unexpected business disruption among our partners, advertisers, and clients, including a major customer who paused its connection with our supply-side platform, Colossus SSP, which led to a temporary reduction in our revenues.\"\n\nWalker continued, \"We moved swiftly to address these claims, working closely with all of our partners to ensure they understood the truth of our practices and taking legal action against the author of the defamatory claims. Our paused customer has since restored its connection, with volumes through our sell-side platform steadily increasing, though not yet fully returned to previous levels. Throughout this, we have been working diligently with our multi-national HoldCo agencies, our Fortune 500 brand partners, and demand-side partners, to resume business, which many already have. While we are confident we will return the Company to normalcy, it will take time to rebuild. We are grateful for the resiliency and focus of our employees as they work to position us to rebound from these challenges.\"\n\nRevenues for the third quarter of 2024 were $9.1 million, consisting of $2.2 million in our sell-side advertising segment and $6.9 million in our buy-side advertising segment. The key driver for the reduction of our revenue from prior periods was the pause by our customer as described above.\n\nKeith Smith, President, commented, \"Our recently announced $20 million Equity Reserve Facility with New Circle Principal Investments provides us with enhanced financial flexibility to execute on our strategic initiatives while also strengthening our balance sheet. This new financing source will support both our technology investments and growth objectives as we continue to evolve our platform capabilities and position Direct Digital Holdings for sustainable, long-term growth.\"\n\nWalker added, \"Over these past few months, we have innovated and optimized our business and are now in a position of strength, well-situated to capitalize on several of our key growth initiatives. Direct Digital Holdings' technology platform, diversified client base, optimized cost structure and new financing sources allow us to expand into new industry verticals, accelerate our direct integrations with leading demand-side platforms, advance our technological capabilities across our business and maintain our commitment to bringing underrepresented publishers into the programmatic ecosystem.\"\n\n**_Advancing Innovation for Colossus SSP_**\n\nThe Company expects to make investments to drive technological advancements for Direct Digital Holdings' supply-side platform, Colossus SSP, including the launch of Colossus Connections, an aggressive initiative the Company is already executing to accelerate direct integrations with leading demand platforms. This initiative will aim to unlock direct access to more demand partners and revenue, while optimizing transaction costs and efficiency for Colossus SSP and its clients. As a result of Colossus Connections, the Company has already signed two of the leading demand-side partners, with those direct connections expected to go live in 2025.\n\nAdditionally, for Colossus SSP, the Company is developing new curation and segment-based products in areas such as carbon, attention, and media quality, which are in high-demand among advertisers. The Company is also expanding efforts to bring underrepresented publishers and creators into the programmatic ecosystem, with their unique and premium inventory available through Colossus SSP.\n\n**_Enhancing Growth on the Demand Side_**\n\nOn the demand-side, the Company expects that funding will support the recently announced unification of Direct Digital Holdings' buy-side divisions, Orange 142 and Huddled Masses. This will enable the delivery of new capabilities, particularly in helping clients navigate emerging technologies, such as artificial intelligence and machine learning, as well as emerging, high-growth channels such as marketing-enabled services, connected TV, social media and retail media. Small- and mid-sized clients will be a key focus for the combined entity, as these clients are increasingly shifting advertising budgets to digital and require support to navigate its complexities and optimize their ad spend. Currently, the Company serves hundreds of small- and mid-sized clients, enabling over 2,000 campaigns each year.\n\n**_Third Quarter 2024 Financial Highlights:_**\n\n  * For the third quarter of 2024, revenue was $9.1 million, a decrease of $50.4 million, or an 85% decline compared to the $59.5 million in the same period of 2023.\n    * Sell-side advertising segment revenue fell to $2.2 million compared to $51.6 million in the same period of 2023, 96% decrease year-over-year. As described above, the key driver for this reduction was the suspension by one of our large customers following the defamatory article against the Company, and this customer has since restored its connection.\n    * Buy-side advertising segment revenue fell to $6.9 million compared to $7.9 million in the same period of 2023, a 12% year-over-year decline.\n  * Gross profit was $3.5 million, or 39% of revenue, in the third quarter of 2024 compared to $11.8 million, or 20% of revenue, in the same period of 2023.\n  * Operating expenses were $7.2 million in the third quarter of 2024, a decrease of $0.1 million, or 1%, over $7.3 million in the same period of 2023.\n  * Consolidated operating loss was $3.7 million, compared to operating income of $4.5 million in the same period of 2023, a decrease of $8.2 million or 181%.\n  * Net loss was $6.4 million in the third quarter, compared to net income of $3.4 million in the same period of 2023.\n  * Adjusted EBITDA(1) was a loss of $2.9 million in the third quarter of 2024, compared to positive Adjusted EBITDA of $5.4 million in the same period of 2023.\n  * As of September 30, 2024, the Company held cash and cash equivalents of $4.1 million compared to $5.1 million as of December 31, 2023.\n\n\n\n(1) \"Adjusted EBITDA\" is a non-GAAP financial measure. The section titled \"Non-GAAP Financial Measures\" below describes our usage of non-GAAP financial measures and provides reconciliations between historical GAAP and non-GAAP information contained in this press release.  \n---  \n  \n**_Financial Outlook_**\n\nAssuming the U.S. economy does not experience any major economic conditions that deteriorate or otherwise significantly reduce advertiser demand, and subject to certain uncertainties related to the ramp-up of our businesses and general market conditions, Direct Digital Holdings is providing full-year revenue guidance of $60 million to $70 million for FY 2024 and full-year revenue guidance of $90 million to $110 million for FY 2025 as the Company rebuilds to previous levels.\n\nDiana Diaz, Chief Financial Officer, stated, \"As we move forward, we are pleased to return to a normal cadence of reporting our financial results which will provide our investors with the timely and accurate information they deserve. We're committed to delivering sustainable growth for our investors while offering our partners industry-leading marketing and advertising capabilities.\"\n\nSmith added, \"While Direct Digital Holdings is working to overcome these recent challenges, defamatory disinformation attacks go far beyond the advertising technology industry, distorting public perception, manipulating stock prices, often to the disadvantage of everyday investors, and stifling innovation. The weaponization of disinformation is posing a profound risk to small and up-and-coming businesses such as ours, and calls for a deeper dive into this pernicious and increasingly ubiquitous issue and an appropriate systemic response.\"\n\n**_Conference Call and Webcast Details_**\n\nDirect Digital will host a conference call on Tuesday, November 12, 2024 at 5:00 p.m. Eastern Time to discuss the Company's third quarter 2024 financial results.

We use words such as \"could,\" \"would,\" \"may,\" \"might,\" \"will,\" \"expect,\" \"likely,\" \"believe,\" \"continue,\" \"anticipate,\" \"estimate,\" \"intend,\" \"plan,\" \"project\" and other similar expressions to identify forward-looking statements, but not all forward-looking statements include these words. All of our forward-looking statements involve estimates and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in or implied by the forward-looking statements. Accordingly, any such statements are qualified in their entirety by reference to the information described under the caption \"Risk Factors\" and elsewhere in our most recent Annual Report on Form 10 K (the \"Form 10-K\") and subsequent periodic and or current reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the \"SEC\").\n\nThe forward-looking statements contained in this press release are based on assumptions that we have made in light of our industry experience and our perceptions of historical trends, current conditions, expected future developments and other factors we believe are appropriate under the circumstances. As you read and consider this press release, you should understand that these statements are not guarantees of performance or results. They involve risks, uncertainties (many of which are beyond our control) and assumptions.\n\nAlthough we believe that these forward-looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions, you should be aware that many factors could affect our actual operating and financial performance and cause our performance to differ materially from the performance expressed in or implied by the forward-looking statements. We believe these factors include, but are not limited to, the following: conditions to our ability to sell Class A common stock under our equity reserve facility; the restrictions and covenants imposed upon us by our credit facilities; the substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern, which may hinder our ability to obtain future financing; our ability to secure additional financing to meet our capital needs; our ineligibility to file short-form registration statements on Form S-3, which may impair our ability to raise capital; our failure to satisfy applicable listing standards of the Nasdaq Capital Market resulting in a potential delisting of our common stock; failure to remedy any listing deficiencies noted in the deficiency letters from the Listing Qualifications Department of The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC; the risk that the Listing Qualifications Department of The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC does not accept the Company's plan to regain compliance with applicable rules to maintain its listing on The Nasdaq Capital Market; costs, risks and uncertainties related to the restatement of certain prior period financial statements; any significant fluctuations caused by our high customer concentration; risks related to non-payment by our clients; reputational and other harms caused by our failure to detect advertising fraud; operational and performance issues with our platform, whether real or perceived, including a failure to respond to technological changes or to upgrade our technology systems; restrictions on the use of third-party \"cookies,\" mobile device IDs or other tracking technologies, which could diminish our platform's effectiveness; unfavorable publicity and negative public perception about our industry, particularly concerns regarding data privacy and security relating to our industry's technology and practices, and any perceived failure to comply with laws and industry self-regulation; our failure to manage our growth effectively; the difficulty in identifying and integrating any future acquisitions or strategic investments; any changes or developments in legislative, judicial, regulatory or cultural environments related to information collection, use and processing; challenges related to our buy-side clients that are destination marketing organizations and that operate as public/private partnerships; any strain on our resources or diversion of our management's attention as a result of being a public company; the intense competition of the digital advertising industry and our ability to effectively compete against current and future competitors; any significant inadvertent disclosure or breach of confidential and/or personal information we hold, or of the security of our or our customers', suppliers' or other partners' computer systems; as a holding company, we depend on distributions from Direct Digital Holdings, LLC (\"DDH LLC\") to pay our taxes, expenses (including payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement) and any amount of any dividends we may pay to the holders of our common stock; the fact that DDH LLC is controlled by DDM, whose interest may differ from those of our public stockholders; any failure by us to maintain or implement effective internal controls or to detect fraud; and other factors and assumptions discussed in our Form 10-K and subsequent periodic and current reports we may file with the SEC.\n\nShould one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize, or should any of these assumptions prove to be incorrect, our actual operating and financial performance may vary in material respects from the performance projected in these forward-looking statements. Further, any forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date on which it is made, and except as required by law, we undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statement contained in this press release to reflect events or circumstances after the date on which it is made or to reflect the occurrence of anticipated or unanticipated events or circumstances, and we claim the protection of the safe harbor for forward-looking statements contained in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. New factors that could cause our business not to develop as we expect emerge from time to time, and it is not possible for us to predict all of them. Further, we cannot assess the impact of each currently known or new factor on our results of operations or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements. \n\n**_About Direct Digital Holdings_**\n\nDirect Digital Holdings (Nasdaq: DRCT) brings state-of-the-art sell- and buy-side advertising platforms together under one umbrella company.

3,540  \n  \n**NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES**\n\nIn addition to our results determined in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (\"GAAP\"), including, in particular operating income, net cash provided by operating activities, and net income, we believe that earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (\"EBITDA\"), as adjusted for loss on early termination of line of credit, revaluation of tax receivable agreement liability and stock-based compensation (\"Adjusted EBITDA\"), a non-GAAP financial measure, is useful in evaluating our operating performance. The most directly comparable GAAP measure to Adjusted EBITDA is net income (loss).\n\nIn addition to operating income and net income, we use Adjusted EBITDA as a measure of operational efficiency. We believe that this non-GAAP financial measure is useful to investors for period-to-period comparisons of our business and in understanding and evaluating our operating results for the following reasons:\n\n  * Adjusted EBITDA is widely used by investors and securities analysts to measure a company's operating performance without regard to items such as depreciation and amortization, interest expense, provision for income taxes, stock-based compensation, revaluation of tax receivable agreement liability and certain one-time items such as acquisition costs, losses from early termination or redemption of credit agreements or preferred units and gains from settlements or loan forgiveness that can vary substantially from company to company depending upon their financing, capital structures and the method by which assets were acquired; \n  * Our management uses Adjusted EBITDA in conjunction with GAAP financial measures for planning purposes, including the preparation of our annual operating budget, as a measure of operating performance and the effectiveness of our business strategies and in communications with our board of directors concerning our financial performance; and \n  * Adjusted EBITDA provides consistency and comparability with our past financial performance, facilitates period-to-period comparisons of operations, and also facilitates comparisons with other peer companies, many of which use similar non-GAAP financial measures to supplement their GAAP results.\n\n\n\nOur use of this non-GAAP financial measure has limitations as an analytical tool, and you should not consider it in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our financial results as reported under GAAP.

(Nasdaq: DRCT)\n(\"Direct Digital Holdings\" or the \"Company\"), a leading advertising and marketing technology\nplatform operating through its companies Colossus Media, LLC (\"Colossus SSP\") and\nOrange 142, LLC (\"Orange 142\"), today announced financial results for the third quarter\nended September 30, 2024.\nMark D. Walker, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, commented, \"The past few quarters\nhave presented significant challenges for our company due to a targeted and defamatory\ndisinformation campaign. We describe this as disinformation not only because it contained\nfactual inaccuracies, but also because it omitted key insights and context that would have\nclarified our business practices. As a result, Direct Digital Holdings experienced an\nunexpected business disruption among our partners, advertisers, and clients, including a\nmajor customer who paused its connection with our supply-side platform, Colossus SSP,\nwhich led to a temporary reduction in our revenues.\"\nWalker continued, \"We moved swiftly to address these claims, working closely with all of our\npartners to ensure they understood the truth of our practices and taking legal action against\nthe author of the defamatory claims. Our paused customer has since restored its connection,\nwith volumes through our sell-side platform steadily increasing, though not yet fully returned\nto previous levels. Throughout this, we have been working diligently with our multi-national\nHoldCo agencies, our Fortune 500 brand partners, and demand-side partners, to resume\nbusiness, which many already have. While we are confident we will return the Company to\nnormalcy, it will take time to rebuild. We are grateful for the resiliency and focus of our\nemployees as they work to position us to rebound from these challenges.\"\nRevenues for the third quarter of 2024 were $9.1 million, consisting of $2.2 million in our\nsell-side advertising segment and $6.9 million in our buy-side advertising segment. The key\ndriver for the reduction of our revenue from prior periods was the pause by our customer as\ndescribed above.\nKeith Smith, President, commented, \"Our recently announced $20 million Equity Reserve\nFacility with New Circle Principal Investments provides us with enhanced financial flexibility\nto execute on our strategic initiatives while also strengthening our balance sheet. This new\nfinancing source will support both our technology investments and growth objectives as we\ncontinue to evolve our platform capabilities and position Direct Digital Holdings for\nsustainable, long-term growth.\"\nWalker added, \"Over these past few months, we have innovated and optimized our business\nand are now in a position of strength, well-situated to capitalize on several of our key growth\ninitiatives. Direct Digital Holdings' technology platform, diversified client base, optimized cost\nstructure and new financing sources allow us to expand into new industry verticals,\naccelerate our direct integrations with leading demand-side platforms, advance our\ntechnological capabilities across our business and maintain our commitment to bringing\nunderrepresented publishers into the programmatic ecosystem.\"\nAdvancing Innovation for Colossus SSP\nThe Company expects to make investments to drive technological advancements for Direct\nDigital Holdings' supply-side platform, Colossus SSP, including the launch of Colossus\nConnections, an aggressive initiative the Company is already executing to accelerate direct\nintegrations with leading demand platforms. This initiative will aim to unlock direct access to\nmore demand partners and revenue, while optimizing transaction costs and efficiency for\nColossus SSP and its clients. As a result of Colossus Connections, the Company has\nalready signed two of the leading demand-side partners, with those direct connections\nexpected to go live in 2025.\nAdditionally, for Colossus SSP, the Company is developing new curation and segment-\nbased products in areas such as carbon, attention, and media quality, which are in high-\ndemand among advertisers. The Company is also expanding efforts to bring\nunderrepresented publishers and creators into the programmatic ecosystem, with their\nunique and premium inventory available through Colossus SSP.\nEnhancing Growth on the Demand Side\nOn the demand-side, the Company expects that funding will support the recently announced\nunification of Direct Digital Holdings' buy-side divisions, Orange 142 and Huddled Masses.\nThis will enable the delivery of new capabilities, particularly in helping clients navigate\nemerging technologies, such as artificial intelligence and machine learning, as well as\nemerging, high-growth channels such as marketing-enabled services, connected TV, social\nmedia and retail media. Small- and mid-sized clients will be a key focus for the combined\nentity, as these clients are increasingly shifting advertising budgets to digital and require\nsupport to navigate its complexities and optimize their ad spend. Currently, the Company\nserves hundreds of small- and mid-sized clients, enabling over 2,000 campaigns each year.\nThird Quarter 2024 Financial Highlights:\nFor the third quarter of 2024, revenue was $9.1 million, a decrease of $50.4 million, or\nan 85% decline compared to the $59.5 million in the same period of 2023.\nSell-side advertising segment revenue fell to $2.2 million compared to $51.6\nmillion in the same period of 2023, 96% decrease year-over-year. As described\nabove, the key driver for this reduction was the suspension by one of our large\ncustomers following the defamatory article against the Company, and this\ncustomer has since restored its connection.\nBuy-side advertising segment revenue fell to $6.9 million compared to $7.9\nmillion in the same period of 2023, a 12% year-over-year decline.\nGross profit was $3.5 million, or 39% of revenue, in the third quarter of 2024 compared\nto $11.8 million, or 20% of revenue, in the same period of 2023.\nOperating expenses were $7.2 million in the third quarter of 2024, a decrease of $0.1\nmillion, or 1%, over $7.3 million in the same period of 2023.\nConsolidated operating loss was $3.7 million, compared to operating income of $4.5\nmillion in the same period of 2023, a decrease of $8.2 million or 181%.\nNet loss was $6.4 million in the third quarter, compared to net income of $3.4 million in\nthe same period of 2023.\nAdjusted EBITDA(1) was a loss of $2.9 million in the third quarter of 2024, compared to\npositive Adjusted EBITDA of $5.4 million in the same period of 2023.\nAs of September 30, 2024, the Company held cash and cash equivalents of $4.1\nmillion compared to $5.1 million as of December 31, 2023.\n(1) \"Adjusted EBITDA\" is a non-GAAP financial measure. The section titled \"Non-GAAP Financial Measures\" below describes our\nusage of non-GAAP financial measures and provides reconciliations between historical GAAP and non-GAAP information contained\nin this press release.\nFinancial Outlook\nAssuming the U.S. economy does not experience any major economic conditions that\ndeteriorate or otherwise significantly reduce advertiser demand, and subject to certain\nuncertainties related to the ramp-up of our businesses and general market conditions, Direct\nDigital Holdings is providing full-year revenue guidance of $60 million to $70 million for FY\n2024 and full-year revenue guidance of $90 million to $110 million for FY 2025 as the\nCompany rebuilds to previous levels.\nDiana Diaz, Chief Financial Officer, stated, \"As we move forward, we are pleased to return to\na normal cadence of reporting our financial results which will provide our investors with the\ntimely and accurate information they deserve. We're committed to delivering sustainable\ngrowth for our investors while offering our partners industry-leading marketing and\nadvertising capabilities.\"\nSmith added, \"While Direct Digital Holdings is working to overcome these recent challenges,\ndefamatory disinformation attacks go far beyond the advertising technology industry,\ndistorting public perception, manipulating stock prices, often to the disadvantage of everyday\ninvestors, and stifling innovation. The weaponization of disinformation is posing a profound\nrisk to small and up-and-coming businesses such as ours, and calls for a deeper dive into\nthis pernicious and increasingly ubiquitous issue and an appropriate systemic response.\"\nConference Call and Webcast Details\nDirect Digital will host a conference call on Tuesday, November 12, 2024 at 5:00 p.m.\nEastern Time to discuss the Company's third quarter 2024 financial results.

determined in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting\nprinciples (\"GAAP\"), including, in particular operating income, net cash provided by operating\nactivities, and net income, we believe that earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and\namortization (\"EBITDA\"), as adjusted for loss on early termination of line of credit,\nrevaluation of tax receivable agreement liability and stock-based compensation (\"Adjusted\nEBITDA\"), a non-GAAP financial measure, is useful in evaluating our operating performance.\nThe most directly comparable GAAP measure to Adjusted EBITDA is net income (loss).\nIn addition to operating income and net income, we use Adjusted EBITDA as a measure of\noperational efficiency. We believe that this non-GAAP financial measure is useful to\ninvestors for period-to-period comparisons of our business and in understanding and\nevaluating our operating results for the following reasons:\nAdjusted EBITDA is widely used by investors and securities analysts to measure a\ncompany's operating performance without regard to items such as depreciation and\namortization, interest expense, provision for income taxes, stock-based compensation,\nrevaluation of tax receivable agreement liability and certain one-time items such as\nacquisition costs, losses from early termination or redemption of credit agreements or\npreferred units and gains from settlements or loan forgiveness that can vary\nsubstantially from company to company depending upon their financing, capital\nstructures and the method by which assets were acquired;\nOur management uses Adjusted EBITDA in conjunction with GAAP financial measures\nfor planning purposes, including the preparation of our annual operating budget, as a\nmeasure of operating performance and the effectiveness of our business strategies\nand in communications with our board of directors concerning our financial\nperformance; and\nAdjusted EBITDA provides consistency and comparability with our past financial\nperformance, facilitates period-to-period comparisons of operations, and also facilitates\ncomparisons with other peer companies, many of which use similar non-GAAP\nfinancial measures to supplement their GAAP results.\nOur use of this non-GAAP financial measure has limitations as an analytical tool, and you\nshould not consider it in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our financial results as\nreported under GAAP. The following table presents a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to\nnet income (loss) for each of the periods presented:\nNON-GAAP FINANCIAL METRICS\n(unaudited, in thousands)\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nNet (loss) income $ (6,377) $ 3,351 $ (13,338) $ 3,212\nAdd back (deduct):\nInterest expense 1,413 1,060 4,068 3,104\nAmortization of intangible assets 488 488 1,465 1,465\nStock-based compensation 149 242 811 546\nDepreciation and amortization of property, equipment and software 67 64 205 185\nLoss on early termination of line of credit — — — 300\nIncome tax expense 6,606 166 6,132 166\nRevaluation of tax receivable agreement liability (5,201) — (5,201) —\nAdjusted EBITDA $ (2,855) $ 5,371 $ (5,858) $ 8,978\nContacts:\nInvestors:\nBrett Milotte, ICR\ninvestors@directdigitalholdings.com\nView original content to download multimedia:https://www.prnewswire.com/news-\nreleases/direct-digital-holdings-reports-q3-2024-financial-results-302303281.html\nSOURCE Direct Digital Holdings"

Direct Digital Holdings, Inc. is the holding company for Direct Digital Holdings, LLC (“DDH LLC”), which is, in turn, the holding company for the business formed by DDH LLC’s founders in 2018 through the acquisition of Colossus Media, LLC (“Colossus Media”) and Huddled Masses, LLC (“Huddled Masses®” or “Huddled Masses”). Colossus Media operates the Company’s proprietary sell-side programmatic platform operating under the trademarked banner of Colossus SSPTM (“Colossus SSP”). In late September 2020, DDH LLC acquired Orange142, LLC (“Orange 142”) to further bolster its overall programmatic buy-side advertising platform and to enhance its offerings across multiple industry verticals such as travel, healthcare, education, financial services, consumer products, and other sectors with particular emphasis intended for small and mid-sized businesses transitioning into digital with growing digital media budgets. In February 2022, Direct Digital Holdings, Inc. completed an initial public offering of its securities and, together with DDH LLC, effected a series of transactions (together, the “Organizational Transactions”) whereby Direct Digital Holdings, Inc. became the sole managing member of DDH LLC, the holder of 100% of the voting interests of DDH LLC and the holder of 19.7% of the economic interests of DDH LLC, commonly referred to as an “Up-C” structure. (See Note 6 — Related Party Transactions). In these condensed consolidated financial statements, the “Company,” “Direct Digital,” “Direct Digital Holdings,” “DDH,” “we,” “us” and “our” refer to Direct Digital Holdings, Inc., and, unless otherwise stated, all of its subsidiaries, including DDH LLC and its subsidiaries. All of the subsidiaries are incorporated in the state of Delaware, except for DDH LLC, which was formed under the laws of the State of Texas.\n\nDirect Digital Holdings, Inc. owns 100% of the voting interest in Direct Digital Holdings, LLC. As of September 30, 2024, DDH owns 25.9% of the economic interest in Direct Digital Holdings, LLC. See further discussion of the Up-C structure in Note 6 of our condensed consolidated financial statements. Direct Digital Holdings, LLC was formed on June 21, 2018 and acquired by DDH on February 15, 2022 in connection with the Organizational Transactions. Direct Digital Holdings, LLC’s wholly-owned subsidiaries are as follows:\n\nSubsidiary| Current %Ownership | Business Segment| Date of Formation| Date ofAcquisition  \n---|---|---|---|---  \nColossus Media, LLC| 100%| Sell-side| September 8, 2017| June 21, 2018  \nOrange142, LLC| 100%| Buy-side| March 6, 2013| September 30, 2020  \nHuddled Masses, LLC| 100%| Buy-side| November 13, 2012| June 21, 2018  \n  \nColossus SSP is a stand-alone platform intended to deliver targeted advertising to diverse and multicultural audiences as well as to general audiences. Both buy-side subsidiaries, Orange 142 and Huddled Masses, offer technology-enabled advertising solutions and consulting services to clients through demand side platforms (“DSPs”).\n\nProviding both the front-end, buy-side operations coupled with the Company’s proprietary sell-side operations enables the Company to curate the first through the last mile in the ad tech ecosystem execution process to drive higher results.\n\nNote 2 — Basis of Presentation and Consolidation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\n\nBasis of presentation and consolidation\n\nThe accompanying condensed unaudited consolidated financial statements have been prepared by the Company in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”) for interim financial reporting and as required by Rule 8-03 of Regulation S-X. Accordingly, the condensed unaudited consolidated financial statements may not include all of the information and notes required by GAAP for audited financial statements. The condensed consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2023 included herein was derived from audited financial statements but does not include all disclosures required by GAAP for complete financial statements. In the opinion of the Company’s management, the accompanying condensed unaudited consolidated financial statements contain all adjustments, consisting of items of a normal and recurring nature, necessary to present fairly the Company’s financial position as of September 30, 2024, the results of its operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, cash flows for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, and stockholders’ deficit for the three and nine months ended \n\n7\n\n[Table of Contents](#i20ec97510e3b4e6bba093038fbf06538_7)\n\nSeptember 30, 2024 and 2023. The results of operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the full year. The preparation of condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts of assets and liabilities, and related disclosures, as of the date of the financial statements, and the amounts of revenues and expenses reported during the period. Actual results could differ from estimates. The accompanying condensed unaudited consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the Company’s audited financial statements and the accompanying notes for the year ended December 31, 2023, which was included in Form 10-K filed with the SEC on October 15, 2024. \n\nThe condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Direct Digital Holdings, Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiaries. All material intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.\n\nThe Company is an emerging growth company, as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (the “JOBS Act”). Under the JOBS Act, emerging growth companies can delay adopting new or revised accounting standards otherwise applicable to public companies until such time as those standards apply to private companies. The Company has elected to use this extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards that have different effective dates for public and private companies until the earlier of the date that it (i) is no longer an emerging growth company or (ii) it affirmatively and irrevocably opts out of the extended transition period provided in the JOBS Act. As a result, these condensed consolidated financial statements may not be comparable to companies that comply with the new or revised accounting pronouncements as of public company effective dates. The adoption dates discussed below reflect this election.\n\nRevenue recognition \n\nThe Company recognizes revenue using the following five steps: 1) identification of a contract with a customer; 2) identification of the performance obligation(s) in the contract; 3) determination of the transaction price; 4) allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligation(s) in the contract; and 5) recognition of revenue when, or as, the performance obligation(s) are satisfied. The Company’s revenues are derived primarily from two sources: sell-side advertising and buy-side advertising. Thus, the Company disaggregates the revenue earned into these two segments. For additional segment disclosures, refer to Note 7 — Segment Information of our condensed consolidated financial statements. The Company maintains agreements with its customers in the form of written service agreements, which set out the terms of the relationship, including payment terms (typically 30 to 90 days).\n\nFor the sell-side advertising segment, the Company generates revenue by selling advertising inventory (digital ad units) that the Company purchases from publishers to advertisers through a process of monetizing ad impressions on the Company’s proprietary sell-side programmatic platform operating under the trademarked banner Colossus SSP. For the buy-side advertising segment, the Company generates revenue from customers that enter into agreements with the Company to provide managed advertising campaigns, which include digital marketing and media services to purchase digital advertising space, data and other add-on features.\n\nIn connection with the Company’s analysis of principal vs agent considerations, the Company has evaluated the specified goods or services and considered whether the Company controls the goods or services before they are provided to the customer, including the three indicators of control. Based upon this analysis and the Company’s specific facts and circumstances, the Company concluded that it is a principal for the goods or services sold through both the Company’s sell-side advertising segment and buy-side advertising segment because the Company controls the specified good or service before it is transferred to the customer and the Company is the primary obligor in the agreement with customers. Therefore, the Company reports revenue on a gross basis inclusive of all supplier costs and pays suppliers for the cost of digital media, advertising inventory, data and any add-on services or features.\n\nIn the advertising industry, companies commonly experience seasonal fluctuations in revenue. For example, in our sell-side advertising segment, many advertisers allocate the largest portion of their budgets to the fourth quarter of the calendar year in order to coincide with increased holiday purchasing while, in our buy-side segment, the second and third quarters of the year reflect our highest levels of advertising activity and the first quarter reflects the lowest level of such activity.\n\nSell-side advertising\n\nThe Company partners with publishers to sell advertising inventory to the Company’s Colossus Media-curated clients and the open markets (collectively referred to as “buyers”) seeking to access the general market as well as unique multi-cultural audiences. The Company generates revenue from the delivery of targeted digital media solutions, enabling \n\n8\n\n[Table of Contents](#i20ec97510e3b4e6bba093038fbf06538_7)\n\nadvertisers to connect intelligently with their audiences across online display, video, social and mobile mediums using its proprietary programmatic sell-side platform (“SSP”). The Company refers to its publishers, app developers, and channel partners collectively as its \"publishers.\" The Company’s platform allows the Company to sell, in real time, ad impressions from publishers to buyers and provides automated inventory management and monetization tools to publishers across various device types and digital ad formats. The Company recognizes revenue at a point in time when an ad is delivered or displayed in response to a winning bid request from ad buyers.\n\nBuy-side advertising\n\nThe Company purchases media based on the budget established by its customers with a focus on leveraging data services, customer branding, real-time market analysis and micro-location advertising. The Company offers its services on a fully managed basis, which is recognized over time using the output method when the performance obligation is fulfilled. An “impression” is delivered when an advertisement appears on pages viewed by users. The performance obligation is satisfied over time as the volume of impressions are delivered up to the contractual maximum. Many customers run several different campaigns throughout the year to capitalize on different seasons, special events and other happenings at their respective regions and localities. The Company provides digital advertising and media buying capabilities with a focus on generating measurable digital and financial life for its customers.\n\nRevenue arrangements are evidenced by a fully executed insertion order (“IO”) and/or a master service agreement (“MSA”) covering a combination of marketing tactics. Generally, IOs specify the number and type of advertising impressions to be delivered over a specified time at an agreed upon price and performance objectives for an ad campaign. Performance objectives are generally a measure of targeting, as defined by the parties in advance, such as number of ads displayed, consumer clicks on ads or consumer actions (which may include qualified leads, registrations, downloads, inquiries or purchases). These payment models are commonly referred to as CPM (cost per impression), CPC (cost per click) and CPA (cost per action). The majority of the Company’s contracts are flat-rate, fee-based contracts.\n\nCash payments received prior to the Company’s delivery of its services are recorded to deferred revenue until the performance obligation is satisfied. The Company recorded deferred revenue (contract liabilities) to account for billings in excess of revenue recognized, primarily related to contractual minimums billed in advance and customer prepayment, of $1.0 million and $0.4 million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. Revenue recognized during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 from amounts included within the deferred revenue balances at the beginning of each respective period amounted to $0.4 million and $0.5 million, respectively.\n\nAccounting Standards Codification (\"ASC\") 606 provides various optional practical expedients. The Company elected the use of the practical expedient relating to the disclosure of remaining performance obligations within a contract and will not disclose remaining performance obligations for contracts with an original expected duration of one year or less.\n\nGoodwill\n\nAs of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, goodwill was $6.5 million, which includes $2.4 million as a result of the acquisition of Huddled Masses and Colossus Media in 2018 and $4.1 million from the acquisition of Orange 142 in 2020. The Company expects to deduct goodwill for tax purposes in future years. Goodwill is attributable to entry into new markets not previously accessible and generation of future growth opportunities. Goodwill is assessed for impairment at least annually (December 31) starting with a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit containing goodwill is less than its carrying value. This qualitative assessment may include, but is not limited to, reviewing factors such as macroeconomic conditions, industry and market considerations, cost factors, entity-specific financial performance and other events, such as changes in our management, strategy and primary user base. If the Company determines that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value, then a quantitative goodwill impairment analysis is performed. Depending upon the results of the quantitative measurement, the recorded goodwill may be written down and an impairment expense is recorded in the condensed consolidated statements of operations when the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit. Goodwill is reviewed annually and tested for impairment upon the occurrence of a triggering event. The Company determined that there was no impairment of goodwill during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023.\n\nIntangible assets, net\n\nIntangible assets consist of customer relationships, trademarks and non-compete agreements. Intangible assets are recorded at fair value at the time of their acquisition and are stated within the condensed consolidated balance sheets net of accumulated amortization. Intangible assets are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives and recorded as amortization expense within general and administrative expenses in the condensed consolidated statements of \n\n9\n\n[Table of Contents](#i20ec97510e3b4e6bba093038fbf06538_7)\n\noperations. The Company’s intangible assets are being amortized over their estimated useful lives, using the straight-line method with non-compete agreements over 5 years and other intangibles over 10 years.\n\nImpairment of long-lived assets\n\nThe Company evaluates the recoverability of long-lived assets, including property, equipment and software costs and intangible assets if facts or circumstances indicate that any of those assets might be impaired. ASC 360-10-15 requires the Company to group assets and liabilities at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities and evaluate the asset group against the sum of the undiscounted future cash flows to determine if a write-down to fair value is necessary. No impairment loss was recognized during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023.\n\nStock-based compensation\n\nStock-based compensation cost for options and restricted stock units (“RSU”) awarded to employees and directors is measured at the grant date based on the calculated fair value of the award and is recognized as an expense over the requisite service period (generally the vesting period of the equity grant). Contingently issued awards with a requisite service period that precedes the grant date are measured and recognized at the start of the requisite service period and remeasured each reporting period until the grant date. \n\nThe Company estimates the fair value of RSU’s based on the closing price of the Company’s common stock on the date of the grant. The Company estimates the fair value of stock options using the Black-Scholes valuation model. Key input assumptions used to estimate the fair value of stock options include the fair value of the Company’s common stock, as well as assumptions regarding the expected common stock price volatility over the term of the stock options, the expected term of the stock options, risk-free interest rates and the expected dividend yield. Given the Company's short history as a public company, the expected volatility is determined based on the trading history of several unrelated public companies within the industry that the Company considers to be comparable and the expected term is determined based on a combination of the terms of stock options and peer data. The risk-free interest rate is derived using the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at date of grant. Other assumptions are based on historical experience and activity. The Company considers an estimated forfeiture rate for stock options based on historical experience and the anticipated forfeiture rates during the future contract life.\n\nIncome taxes\n\nIn February 2022, concurrent with the Organizational Transactions, the Company entered into a tax receivable agreement (“Tax Receivable Agreement” or “TRA”) with DDH LLC and Direct Digital Management, LLC (“DDM”). The TRA provides for certain income (loss) allocations between the Company and DDH LLC under the agreement. DDH LLC is a limited liability company, is treated as a partnership for federal income tax purposes and generally is not subject to any entity-level U.S. federal income tax and certain state and local income taxes. Any taxable income or loss generated by the Company is allocated to holders of LLC units (“LLC Units”) in accordance with the Second Amended and Restated Limited Liability Company Agreement (“LLC Agreement”), and distributions to the owners of LLC Units in an amount sufficient to fund their tax obligations. The Company is subject to U.S. federal income taxes, in addition to state and local income taxes with respect to its allocable share of any taxable income or loss under the LLC Agreement. Pursuant to the Company’s election under Section 754 of the Internal Revenue Code (the “Code”), the Company expects to obtain an increase in its share of the tax basis in the net assets of DDH, LLC when LLC Units are redeemed or exchanged by the members of DDH, LLC. The Company made an election under Section 754 of the Code for each taxable year in which a redemption or exchange of LLC interest occurred. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, members of DDM exchanged no shares of Class B Common Stock into shares of Class A Common Stock.\n\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse. A valuation allowance is established when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The establishment of a valuation allowance requires significant judgment and is impacted by various estimates. Both positive and negative evidence, as well as the objectivity and verifiability of that evidence, is considered in determining the appropriateness of recording a valuation allowance on deferred tax assets. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company recorded a valuation allowance of $7.3 million and $0.5 million, respectively.\n\n10\n\n[Table of Contents](#i20ec97510e3b4e6bba093038fbf06538_7)\n\nAccounts receivable, net\n\nAccounts receivable primarily consists of billed amounts for products and services rendered to customers under normal trade terms. The Company performs credit evaluations of its customers’ financial condition and generally does not require collateral. Accounts receivable are stated at net realizable value. The Company insures a significant portion of its accounts receivable with unrelated third-party insurance companies in an effort to mitigate any future write-offs and establishes provision for credit losses as deemed necessary for accounts not covered by this insurance. Management periodically reviews outstanding accounts receivable for reasonableness. If warranted, the Company processes a claim with the third-party insurance company to recover uncollected balances, rather than writing the balances off to bad debt expense. The guaranteed recovery for the claim is approximately 90% of the original balance, and if the full amount is collected by the insurance company, the remaining 10% is remitted to the Company. If the insurance company is unable to collect the full amount, the Company records the remaining 10% to bad debt expense. The Company’s provision for credit losses reflects the current expected credit loss inherent in the accounts receivable considering the Company’s aging analysis, historical collection experience, customer creditworthiness, current and future economic conditions and market conditions. Accounts receivable balances are written off against the provision when the Company believes it is probable the receivable will not be recovered. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company's provision for credit losses net of recoveries, as reflected in the condensed consolidated statements of cash flows was less than $0.1 million. \n\nConcentrations of customers and suppliers\n\nThere is an inherent concentration of credit risk associated with accounts receivable arising from revenue from major customers on both the sell-side and buy-side of the business. For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, one buy-side customer represented 12% and one sell-side customer represented 82% of revenues, respectively. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, one sell-side customer represented 52% and 72% of revenues, respectively. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, three customers and one customer accounted for 35% and 83%, respectively, of accounts receivable. \n\nAs of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, one vendor and three sellers of advertising inventory each accounted for at least 10%, and collectively accounted for 17% and 77%, respectively, of consolidated accounts payable.\n\nAccrued Liabilities\n\nThe components of accrued liabilities on the balance sheet as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 are as follows (in thousands):\n\nSeptember 30,2024| December 31,2023  \n---|---  \nAccrued compensation and benefits | $| 277 | $| 2,789  \nAccrued expenses | 534 | 631  \nAccrued severance| — | 189  \nAccrued litigation settlement (1)| — | 171  \nAccrued interest| 70 | 36  \nTotal accrued liabilities| $| 881 | $| 3,816  \n  \n(1) In July 2022, the Company entered into a litigation settlement agreement with a vendor of Huddled Masses related to a delinquent balance from 2019 and agreed to pay a total of $0.5 million with monthly installment payments over 24 months beginning September 1, 2022.\n\nCash and cash equivalents\n\nCash and cash equivalents consist of funds deposited with financial institutions and highly liquid instruments with original maturities of three months or less. Such deposits may, at times, exceed federally insured limits. The risk of loss attributable to any uninsured balances is mitigated by depositing funds only in high credit quality financial institutions. The Company has not experienced any losses in such amounts and believes it is not exposed to any significant credit risk to cash.\n\n11\n\n[Table of Contents](#i20ec97510e3b4e6bba093038fbf06538_7)\n\nDeferred offering costs\n\nThe Company records certain legal, accounting and other third-party fees that are directly associated with an offering to stockholders’ equity or debt in the event that the Company completes an offering. Costs associated with debt offerings are amortized to interest expense using the straight-line method over the life of the debt. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, $1.3 million and $1.7 million, respectively, of unamortized deferred financing costs are netted against debt in the condensed consolidated balance sheets. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, $0.1 million and $0.2 million, respectively, of unamortized deferred issuance costs are classified as prepaid expenses and other current assets in the condensed consolidated balance sheets.\n\nFair value measurements\n\nThe Company employs a hierarchy which prioritizes the inputs used to measure recurring fair value into three distinct categories based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. The methodology for categorizing assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value pursuant to this hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets and the lowest levels to unobservable inputs, summarized as follows:\n\n•Level 1 – Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.\n\n•Level 2 – Other significant observable inputs (including quoted prices in active markets for similar assets or liabilities).\n\n•Level 3 – Significant unobservable inputs (including our own assumptions in determining fair value).\n\nWe use the cost, income or market valuation approaches to estimate the fair value of our assets and liabilities when insufficient market-observable data is available to support our valuation assumptions.\n\nFair value of financial instruments\n\nThe Company considers the fair value of all financial instruments, including cash, accounts receivable and accounts payable to approximate their carrying values at year-end due to their short-term nature. The carrying value of the Company’s debt approximates fair value due to the market rates of interest.\n\nNet income (loss) per share\n\nBasic net income (loss) per share excludes dilution and is determined by dividing net income (loss) by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding including participating securities during the period. Diluted net income (loss) per share reflects the potential dilution that could occur if securities and other contracts to issue common stock were exercised or converted into common stock.\n\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\n\nAccounting pronouncements adopted\n\nNo standards have been adopted which have had a material impact on the Company’s condensed consolidated financial statements.\n\nAccounting pronouncements not yet adopted\n\nIn December 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the “FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (\"ASU\") 2023-09, Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures, a final standard on improvements to income tax disclosures. The standard requires disaggregated information about a reporting entity's effective tax rate reconciliation as well as information on income taxes paid. The standard is intended to benefit investors by providing more detailed income tax disclosures that would be useful in making capital allocation decisions and applies to all entities subject to income taxes. The new standard is effective for emerging growth companies for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2025. This accounting standard is effective in the first quarter of the Company's fiscal year ending December 31, 2026. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adoption on our financial disclosures.\n\nIn November 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic 280) - Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures. The ASU requires that an entity disclose significant segment expenses impacting profit and loss that are regularly provided to the Company's chief operating decision maker (\"CODM\"). The update is required to be applied \n\n12\n\n[Table of Contents](#i20ec97510e3b4e6bba093038fbf06538_7)\n\nretrospectively to prior periods presented, based on the significant segment expense categories identified and disclosed in the period of adoption. The amendments in this ASU are required to be adopted for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adoption on our financial disclosures.\n\nOther accounting standards that have been issued or proposed by the FASB or other standards-setting bodies that do not require adoption until a future date are not expected to have a material impact on the Company’s condensed consolidated financial statements.\n\nLiquidity and capital resources\n\nGoing Concern\n\nThe Company evaluated whether relevant conditions or events, considered in the aggregate, raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. Substantial doubt exists when conditions and events, considered in the aggregate, indicate it is probable that a company will not be able to meet its obligations as they become due within one year after the issuance date of its financial statements. Management’s assessment is based on the relevant conditions that are known or reasonably knowable as of the date these condensed consolidated financial statements were issued or were available to be issued.\n\nAs discussed in Note 9, one of the Company’s sell-side customers paused its connection to the Company for a couple of weeks in May 2024, which reduced sell-side sales volumes. As of the date of this report, sell-side volumes related to this customer have resumed but not yet at the levels experienced prior to the pause in May 2024 which has created significant disruption in the Company’s sell-side business. The Company is actively working with its partners to achieve prior volume levels. However, there can be no assurance that the Company will be able to achieve prior volume levels with its partners or on the timing of achieving such volume levels. Additionally, the Company (1) incurred a net loss of $13.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 reflecting the impact of the sell-side disruption described above and a decrease in customer spend on the buy-side, (2) reported an accumulated deficit of $6.6 million as of September 30, 2024, (3) reported cash and cash equivalents of $4.1 million as of September 30, 2024, (4) has borrowed $9.7 million and $8.7 million, respectively, as of September 30, 2024 and the date of this report, under the Credit Agreement which matures in July 2025, (5) was notified on April 17, 2024 that the Company’s auditor had resigned, (6) was unable to timely file its 2023 annual report and quarterly reports for the first two quarters of 2024 and (7) was notified by Nasdaq on October 18, 2024 that it was not in compliance with Nasdaq's minimum stockholders' equity requirements. The delay in filing the Company’s annual and quarterly reports disrupted existing capital-raising efforts and created additional audit, legal and other expenses. These factors raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern over the next twelve months.\n\nThe Company anticipates sources of liquidity to include cash on hand and cash flow from operations and has taken several actions to address liquidity concerns. These actions include (1) a plan to reduce expenses through a staff reduction, a pause on hiring and cost savings measures that were executed on July 1, 2024, (2) working with lenders to provide temporary various relief from debt covenants (see Note 3 — Long-Term Debt) while rebuilding sell-side volumes, (3) putting in place a program to raise capital through an equity reserve facility (see Note 4 — Stockholders’ Deficit and Stock-Based Compensation), (4) regaining compliance with respect to delinquent SEC filings on October 15, 2024 which will allow the Company to access the capital markets as well as other financing sources and (5) a plan to achieve compliance with Nasdaq's minimum stockholders' equity requirements. There can be no assurance that the Company’s actions will be successful or that additional financing will be available when needed or on acceptable terms.\n\nThe accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming the Company will continue to operate as a going concern, which contemplates the realization of assets and settlement of liabilities in the normal course of business, and do not include any adjustments to reflect the possible future effects on the recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts and classifications of liabilities that may result from uncertainty related to its ability to continue as a going concern.\n\n13\n\n[Table of Contents](#i20ec97510e3b4e6bba093038fbf06538_7)\n\nNote 3 — Long-Term Debt\n\nAt September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, long-term debt consisted of the following (in thousands):\n\nSeptember 30, 2024| December 31, 2023  \n---|---  \n2021 Credit Facility| $| 28,221 | $| 28,594  \nCredit Agreement| 9,700 | 3,000  \nEconomic Injury Disaster Loan| 150 | 150  \nTotal debt| 38,071 | 31,744  \nLess: deferred financing costs| (1,254)| (1,688)  \nTotal debt, net of deferred financing costs| 36,817 | 30,056  \nLess: current portion| (36,667)| (1,478)  \nTotal long-term debt, net of current portion| $| 150| $| 28,578  \n  \nThe components of interest expense and related fees for long-term debt is as follows (in thousands):\n\nThree Months EndedSeptember 30,| Nine Months EndedSeptember 30,  \n---|---  \n2024| 2023| 2024| 2023  \nInterest expense – Lafayette Square| $| 1,020 | $| 896 | $| 2,975 | $| 2,665  \nInterest expense – East West Bank| 206 | — | 531 | —  \nInterest expense – other| 1 | 1 | 4 | 4  \nAmortization of deferred financing costs| 186 | 163 | 558 | 435  \nTotal interest expense and amortization of deferred financing costs | $| 1,413 | $| 1,060 | $| 4,068 | $| 3,104  \n  \nLafayette Square\n\nOn December 3, 2021, the Company entered into the Term Loan and Security Agreement (the “2021 Credit Facility”) with Lafayette Square Loan Services, LLC (\"Lafayette Square\") as administrative agent, and the various lenders thereto. The term loan under the 2021 Credit Facility initially provided for a term loan in the principal amount of up to $32.0 million, consisting of a $22.0 million closing date term loan (the \"Term Loan\") and an up to $10.0 million delayed draw term loan (the “Delayed Draw Loan”). The loans under the 2021 Credit Facility originally bore interest at LIBOR plus the applicable margin minus any applicable impact discount. The applicable margin under the 2021 Credit Facility was determined based on the consolidated total net leverage ratio of the Company and its consolidated subsidiaries, at a rate of 6.50% per annum if the consolidated total net leverage ratio is less than 2.00 to 1.00 and up to 9.00% per annum if the consolidated total net leverage ratio was greater than 4.00 to 1.00. On June 1, 2023, as originally contemplated under the 2021 Credit Facility, the Company entered into an agreement with Lafayette Square to convert the existing LIBOR based rate to a Term Secured Overnight Financing Rate (\"SOFR\") with a credit spread of 0.15% per annum for the interest periods of three months and providing for a credit spread adjustment of 0.10%, 0.15% or 0.25% per annum for interest periods of one month, three months or six months, respectively. The loans under the 2021 Credit Facility bear interest at SOFR plus the applicable credit spread adjustment plus the applicable margin minus any applicable impact discount. Prior to entering into the Fifth Amendment as defined below, the applicable margin under the 2021 Credit Facility was based on the consolidated total net leverage ratio of the Company at a rate of 7.00% per annum if the consolidated total net leverage ratio was less than or equal to 1.00 to 1.00 with gradual increases as the ratio increased up to 10.00% per annum if the consolidated total net leverage ratio was greater than 3.50 to 1.00. The maturity date of the 2021 Credit Facility is December 3, 2026.\n\nOn July 28, 2022, the Company entered into the Second Amendment and Joinder to Term Loan and Security Agreement and received proceeds of $4.3 million borrowed under the Delayed Draw Loan to pay the balance owed on the common unit redemption as well as costs associated with the transaction. \n\nSubsequently, on October 3, 2023, the Company entered into the Fourth Amendment to the 2021 Credit Facility (the “Fourth Amendment”) and received proceeds of $3.6 million borrowed under the Delayed Draw Loan to make payments in connection with the consummation of the 2023 warrant tender offer and fees and expenses incurred as described in Note 4 — Stockholders’ Deficit and Stock-Based Compensation in the notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements. In \n\n14\n\n[Table of Contents](#i20ec97510e3b4e6bba093038fbf06538_7)\n\nconnection with the Fourth Amendment, the Company agreed it would not be permitted to request any additional funds under the Delayed Draw Loan, and Lafayette Square would not be obligated to fund any such requests.\n\nQuarterly installment payments on the Term Loan and the Delayed Draw Loan, due on the last day of each fiscal quarter, began March 31, 2022 with a final installment due December 3, 2026 for remaining balances outstanding under each loan. Each quarterly installment payment under the closing date term loan was $0.1 million from January 1, 2022 through December 31, 2023, and each installment payment thereafter until maturity is $0.3 million. Each quarterly installment payment under the Delayed Draw Loan was 0.625% of the amount of the Delayed Draw Loan through December 31, 2023, and each installment payment thereafter until maturity is 1.25% of the amount of the Delayed Draw Loan.\n\nUnder the 2021 Credit Facility, dividends and distributions by DDH LLC to the Company and any shareholders of the Company are permitted so long as (i) no default or event of default is continuing or would occur after giving pro forma effect to such dividends and distributions under the 2021 Credit Facility, (ii) the Company, on a pro forma basis, maintains a consolidated senior net leverage ratio of not greater than 1.5 to 1.0, and (iii) the Company, on a pro forma basis, maintains liquidity of not less than $15.0 million. The Company did not meet these conditions as of September 30, 2024 and therefore DDH LLC assets are considered restricted and no dividends or distributions to the Company and any shareholders is permitted while these conditions are not met.\n\nThe obligations under the 2021 Credit Facility are secured by senior, first-priority liens on all or substantially all assets of the Company. As of September 30, 2024, the Company owed a balance on the 2021 Credit Facility of $28.2 million. No additional deferred financing costs were incurred during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and less than $0.1 million of additional deferred financing costs were incurred during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Unamortized deferred financing costs as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 were $1.3 million and $1.7 million respectively. Accrued and unpaid interest was less than $0.1 million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. The 2021 Credit Facility contains customary affirmative and negative covenants. Prior to entering into the Fifth Amendment, the Company was required to maintain a net leverage ratio of no more than 3.50 to 1.00 as of December 31, 2021 and the last day of each fiscal quarter through December 31, 2023, 3.25 to 1.00 as of March 31, 2024 and the last day of each fiscal quarter through March 31, 2025, 3.00 to 1.00 as of June 30, 2025 and September 30, 2025, with incremental tightening of the ratio to 2.50 to 1.00 as of June 30, 2026 and thereafter through maturity. Prior to entering into the Fifth Amendment, the 2021 Credit Facility also required the Company to maintain a fixed charge coverage ratio of not less than 1.50 to 1.00 as of the last day of each fiscal quarter, as well as restrictions on the ability to incur indebtedness, create certain liens, make certain investments, make certain dividends and other types of distributions, and enter into or undertake certain mergers, consolidations, acquisitions and sales of certain assets and subsidiaries.\n\nOn October 15, 2024, with an effective date of June 30, 2024, the Company and Lafayette Square entered into the Fifth Amendment to the Term Loan and Security Agreement (the “Fifth Amendment”) which among other things, (1) defers quarterly installment payments on the Term Loan and the Delayed Draw Loan for the periods from June 30, 2024 through December 31, 2025, (2) requires that the Company pay a commitment fee of 50 basis points or an amount of $0.1 million to Lafayette Square, (3) allows proceeds from future equity raises by the Company, if any, to cure potential financial covenant noncompliance, (4) provides for one-month and three-month interest periods, (5) replaces the calculation of the consolidated total net leverage ratio with a consolidated total leverage ratio for purposes of calculating the applicable margin and the financial covenant and (6) replaces the financial covenants under the 2021 Credit Facility (effective as of June 30, 2024) with the following:\n\n15\n\n[Table of Contents](#i20ec97510e3b4e6bba093038fbf06538_7)\n\nAs of| Minimum TTM* EBITDA ($ in millions)| Minimum Liquidity ($ in millions)| Maximum Consolidated Total Leverage Ratio| Minimum Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio  \n---|---|---|---|---  \nJune 30, 2024| n/a| n/a| n/a| n/a  \nSeptember 30, 2024| $5.0| $1.5| n/a| n/a  \nDecember 31, 2024| $3.5| $1.5| n/a| n/a  \nMarch 31, 2025| $5.5| $2.0| n/a| n/a  \nJune 30, 2025| $7.5| $2.0| n/a| 1.50 to 1.00  \nSeptember 30, 2025| n/a| $2.0| 4.25 to 1.00| 1.50 to 1.00  \nDecember 31, 2025| n/a| $2.0| 4.00 to 1.00| 1.50 to 1.00  \nMarch 31, 2026| n/a| $2.0| 3.75 to 1.00| 1.50 to 1.00  \nJune 30, 2026| n/a| $2.0| 3.50 to 1.00| 1.50 to 1.00  \nSeptember 30, 2026| n/a| $2.0| 3.25 to 1.00| 1.50 to 1.00  \n  \n* TTM = Trailing Twelve Months\n\nThe Company was in compliance with all the financial covenants under the 2021 Credit Facility as of September 30, 2024 after giving effect to the amendments to the 2021 Credit Facility under the Fifth Amendment, except for the minimum trailing twelve months EBITDA covenant. The Company is in discussion with Lafayette Square to waive the current non-compliance with the financial covenant. While the Company expects to negotiate an acceptable resolution, there can be no assurance that it will be able to negotiate a waiver or an amendment, or that such waiver or amendment will be on terms acceptable to the Company. If the Company is unable to obtain a waiver from or enter into an amendment with Lafayette Square, it could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and our ability to execute our business plan. Because of the non-compliance, the debt under the 2021 Credit Facility is classified as current as of September 30, 2024.\n\n2023 Revolving Line of Credit - East West Bank\n\nOn July 7, 2023, the Company entered into a Credit Agreement (as amended, the “Credit Agreement”), with East West Bank (“EWB”), as lender. The Credit Agreement provides for a revolving credit facility in the principal amount of up to $10 million, subject to a borrowing base determined based on eligible accounts, and an up to $5 million uncommitted incremental revolving facility. Loans under the Credit Agreement mature on July 7, 2025 (the “Maturity Date”), unless the Credit Agreement is otherwise terminated pursuant to the terms of the Credit Agreement.\n\nBorrowings under the Credit Agreement bear interest at a rate per annum equal to the one-month Term SOFR rate and as determined by EWB on the first day of the applicable interest period, plus 0.10% (10 basis points), plus 3.00% per annum (the “Loan Rate”); provided, that, in no event shall the Loan Rate be less than 0.50% of the Loan Rate effective as of the date of the Credit Agreement nor more than the maximum rate of interest allowed under applicable law. Upon an event of default under the Credit Agreement, the outstanding principal amounts of any advances will accrue interest at a rate per annum equal to the Loan Rate plus five percent (5%), but in no event in excess of the maximum rate of interest allowed under applicable law.\n\nAt the Company’s option, the Company may at any time prepay the outstanding principal balance of the Credit Agreement in whole or in part, without fee, penalty or premium. All accrued but unpaid interest on outstanding advances under the Credit Agreement are payable in monthly installments on the last day of each monthly interest period until the Maturity Date when the then-outstanding principal balance of the advances and all accrued but unpaid interest thereon becomes due and payable. The obligations under the Credit Agreement are secured by all or substantially all of the borrowers’ assets.\n\nPrior to entering into the Third Amendment as defined below, the Company was required to maintain compliance at all times with the following financial covenants on a consolidated basis: (i) a fixed charge coverage ratio of not less than 1.25 to 1.0, beginning with the fiscal quarter ended on June 30, 2023 and at the end of each fiscal quarter thereafter; (ii) a total funded debt-to-EBITDA ratio of no more than 3.50 to 1.00 as of June 30, 2023 and the last day of each fiscal quarter through December 31, 2023, 3.25 to 1.00 as of March 31, 2024 and the last day of each fiscal quarter through March 31, 2025 and 3.00 to 1.00 as of June 30, 2025 and thereafter through maturity; and (iii) a liquidity covenant requiring the Company to maintain minimum liquid assets at all times (calculated in the manner provided for in the Credit Agreement), in one or more accounts held with EWB plus Revolving Credit Availability in the amount of $1.0 million. Revolving Credit Availability is defined as an amount such that the ratio of the value of eligible accounts to the aggregate amount of all outstanding advances under the credit agreement at such time is not less than 2.0 to 1.0. Additionally, the amounts \n\n16\n\n[Table of Contents](#i20ec97510e3b4e6bba093038fbf06538_7)\n\noutstanding under the Credit Agreement exceeded the Company’s borrowing base as of June 30, 2024 by $0.5 million which was addressed in the Third Amendment, requiring a $1.0 million principal payment on the outstanding loans under the Credit Agreement as of the date of the Third Amendment.\n\nOn October 15, 2024, with an effective date of June 30, 2024, the Company and EWB entered into the Third Amendment to the Credit Agreement (the “Third Amendment”) which, among other things, (1) provides that the Company will make prepayments of the outstanding principal balance of the Credit Agreement of $1.0 million upon execution of the Third Amendment, $1.0 million on or before January 15, 2025 and $2.0 million on or before April 15, 2025, (2) requires the Company to file a registration statement with the SEC to establish an equity line of credit offering on or before October 31, 2024 and to use commercially reasonable efforts to cause such registration statement to become effective, (3) requires the net proceeds of a potential equity line of credit to be applied to the outstanding principal balance under the Credit Agreement in an amount that would cause the ratio of the value of eligible accounts to the aggregate amount of revolving credit advances to be not less than 1.00 to 1.00, (4) requires the consent of EWB prior to the ability of the Company to make certain restricted payments, including cash dividends, (5) requires the Company to make additional prepayments in the amount by which the outstanding loans under the Credit Agreement exceed the borrowing base between the calendar months ending November 30, 2024 and April 15, 2025, and (6) replaces the financial covenants under the Credit Agreement, effective as of June 30, 2024, with the following:\n\nAs of| Minimum TTM(1) EBITDA ($ in millions)| Minimum Liquid Assets ($ in millions)| Maximum Total Funded Debt to EBITDA Leverage Ratio| Minimum Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio| Revolving Credit Availability (as of each month end)  \n---|---|---|---|---|---  \nJune 30, 2024| n/a| $1.0| n/a| n/a| n/a  \nSeptember 30, 2024| $5.0| $1.5| n/a| n/a| n/a  \nDecember 31, 2024| $3.5| $1.5| n/a| n/a| 1.00 to 1.00(2)  \nMarch 31, 2025| $5.5| $2.0| n/a| n/a| 1.50 to 1.00(3)  \nJune 30, 2025| $7.5| $2.0| n/a| 1.25 to 1.00| 2.00 to 1.00(4)  \n  \n(1)TTM = Trailing Twelve Months\n\n(2)Beginning November 30, 2024\n\n(3)Beginning January 31, 2025\n\n(4)Beginning April 15, 2025\n\nThe Company was in compliance with all the financial covenants under the Credit Agreement as of September 30, 2024 after giving effect to the amendments to the Credit Agreement under the Third Amendment, except for the minimum trailing twelve months EBITDA covenant. The Company is in discussion with EWB to waive the current non-compliance with the financial covenant. While the Company expects to negotiate an acceptable resolution, there can be no assurance that it will be able to negotiate a waiver or an amendment, or that such waiver or amendment will be on terms acceptable to the Company. If the Company is unable to obtain a waiver from or enter into an amendment with EWB, it could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and our ability to execute our business plan. Because of the maturity date, the debt under the Credit Agreement is classified as current as of September 30, 2024.\n\nThe Credit Agreement contains customary representations and warranties and includes affirmative and negative covenants applicable to the borrowers and their respective subsidiaries. The affirmative covenants include, among others, covenants requiring the Company to maintain its legal existence and governmental compliance, deliver certain financial reports and maintain insurance coverage. The negative covenants include, among others, restrictions on indebtedness, liens, investments, mergers, dispositions, prepayment of other indebtedness and dividends and other distributions.\n\nThe Credit Agreement also includes customary events of default, including, among other things, non-payment defaults, covenant defaults, inaccuracy of representations and warranties, defaults under any of the loan documents, certain cross-defaults to other indebtedness, certain bankruptcy and insolvency events, invalidity of guarantees or grant of security interest, certain ERISA-related transactions and events, certain orders of forfeiture, change of control, certain undischarged attachments, sequestrations, or similar proceedings, and certain undischarged or non-stayed judgments, in certain cases subject to certain thresholds and grace periods. The occurrence of an event of default could result in the acceleration of the obligations under the Credit Agreement of the Company or other borrowers. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company did not incur any deferred financing costs associated with the Credit Agreement. As of September 30, 2024, there was $9.7 million outstanding under the Credit Agreement which was classified as short term due to the Maturity Date being within twelve months of the reporting period.\n\n17\n\n[Table of Contents](#i20ec97510e3b4e6bba093038fbf06538_7)\n\nThe collateral securing the obligations under the 2021 Credit Facility and the Credit Agreement is subject to intercreditor agreements between Lafayette Square and EWB.\n\nSilicon Valley Bank (“SVB”) Financing\n\nOn January 9, 2023, the Company entered into the SVB Loan Agreement, by and among SVB, as lender, and DDH LLC, the Company, Huddled Masses, Colossus Media and Orange 142, as borrowers. The SVB Loan Agreement provided for a revolving credit facility (the “SVB Revolving Credit Facility”) in the original principal amount of $5 million, subject to a borrowing base determined based on eligible accounts, and up to an additional $2.5 million incremental revolving facility subject to the lender’s consent, which would increase the aggregate principal amount of the Credit Facility to $7.5 million. Loans under the SVB Revolving Credit Facility were to mature on September 30, 2024 unless the Credit Facility was otherwise terminated pursuant to the terms of the Loan Agreement.\n\nOn March 10, 2023, the California Department of Financial Protection and Innovation closed SVB and appointed the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation as receiver. As the Company had not yet drawn any amounts under the SVB Revolving Credit Facility, on March 13, 2023, the Company issued a notice of termination of the SVB Loan Agreement. The termination of the SVB Revolving Credit Facility became effective April 20, 2023. Prior to issuing the notice of termination, the Company received consent to terminate the SVB Revolving Credit Facility and a waiver of the terms relating to the SVB Revolving Credit Facility under its Term Loan and Security Agreement, dated as of December 3, 2021, with Lafayette Square Loan Servicing, LLC (“Lafayette Square”). The Company did not hold material cash deposits or securities at Silicon Valley Bank and did not experience any adverse impact to its liquidity or to its current and projected business operations, financial condition or results of operations as a result of the SVB closure. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Company incurred $0.4 million of deferred financing costs. After the Company issued the notice of termination, total deferred financing costs of $0.3 million were expensed to loss on early termination of line of credit during the nine months ended September 30, 2023.\n\nU.S. Small Business Administration Loans\n\nEconomic Injury Disaster Loan\n\nIn 2020, the Company applied and was approved for a loan pursuant to the Economic Injury Disaster Loan (“EIDL”), administered by the U.S. Small Business Administration (“SBA”). The Company received the loan proceeds of $0.2 million on June 15, 2020. The loan bears interest at a rate of 3.75% and matures on June 15, 2050. Installment payments, including principal and interest, of less than $0.1 million began monthly on December 15, 2022. Each payment will first be applied to pay accrued interest, then the remaining balance will be used to reduce principal. The loan is secured by substantially all assets of DDH LLC.\n\nAccrued and unpaid interest expense as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 was less than $0.1 million and is included in accrued liabilities on the condensed consolidated balance sheets.\n\nOverall\n\nAs of September 30, 2024, future minimum payments related to long-term debt are as follows (in thousands):\n\nRemaining 2024| $| 1,109  \n---|---|---  \n2025| 11,160  \n2026| 25,656  \n2027| 3  \n2028| 3  \nThereafter| 140  \nTotal| 38,071  \nLess current portion| (36,667)  \nLess deferred financing costs| (1,254)  \nLong-term debt, net| $| 150  \n  \n18\n\n[Table of Contents](#i20ec97510e3b4e6bba093038fbf06538_7)\n\nNote 4 — Stockholders’ Deficit and Stock-Based Compensation\n\nStockholders’ Equity – Initial Public Offering\n\nFollowing the completion of the Organizational Transactions, DDH LLC’s limited liability company agreement was amended and restated to, among other things, appoint the Company as the sole managing member of DDH LLC and effectuate a recapitalization of all outstanding preferred units and common units into (i) economic nonvoting units of DDH LLC held by the Company and, through their indirect ownership of DDM, the Company's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and President, and (ii) noneconomic voting units of DDH LLC, 100% of which are held by the Company. In August 2022 and December 2023, DDM tendered 100,000 and 410,000, respectively, of its limited liability company units to the Company in exchange for newly issued shares of Class A Common Stock of the Company on a one-for-one basis. In connection with these exchanges, an equivalent number of the holder’s shares of Class B Common Stock were cancelled. As of September 30, 2024, DDM held 10,868,000 shares of Class B Common Stock.\n\nThe Company is authorized to issue 160,000,000 shares of Class A Common Stock, par value $0.001 per share, 20,000,000 shares of Class B Common Stock, par value $0.001 per share, and 10,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par value $0.001 per share.\n\nOn February 15, 2022, the Company completed its initial public offering of 2,800,000 units (“Units”), each consisting of (i) one share of its Class A Common Stock and (ii) one warrant entitling the holder to purchase one share of its Class A Common Stock at an exercise price of $5.50 per share. The warrants became immediately exercisable upon issuance and were exercisable for a period of five years after the issuance date. The shares of Class A Common Stock and warrants were immediately transferable separately upon issuance. As of September 30, 2024, none of these warrants were outstanding. The underwriters in our initial public offering were granted a 45-day option to purchase up to an additional 420,000 shares and/or warrants, or any combination thereof, to cover over-allotments, which they initially exercised, in part, electing to purchase warrants to purchase an additional 420,000 shares of Class A Common Stock. As of September 30, 2024, none of these warrants were outstanding. In connection with the Company’s initial public offering, the Company issued to the underwriters of the offering a unit purchase option to purchase (i) an additional 140,000 Units at a per Unit exercise price of $6.60, which was equal to 120% of the public offering price per Unit sold in the initial public offering, and (ii) warrants to purchase 21,000 shares of Class A Common Stock at a per warrant exercise price of $0.012, which was equal to 120% of the public offering price per warrant sold in the offering. A group of underwriters exercised 70,000 Units and 10,500 warrants in November 2023 and exercised 70,000 Units and 10,500 warrants in February 2024.\n\nThe warrants had a fair value of $0 that was calculated using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. Variables used in the Black-Scholes option-pricing model include: (1) discount rate of 1.94% based on the applicable U.S. Treasury bill rate, (2) expected life of 5 years, (3) expected volatility of approximately 66% based on the trading history of similar companies, and (4) zero expected dividends. \n\nOn August 29, 2023, the Company filed a Tender Offer Statement on Schedule TO pursuant to which the Company offered to purchase all of its outstanding warrants for $1.20 per warrant in cash. The Tender Offer expired at one minute after 11:59 PM, Eastern Time on September 28, 2023. The Company accepted all validly tendered warrants for purchase and settlement on October 2, 2023. As a result of the Tender Offer, a total of 2,213,652 warrants were tendered and not validly withdrawn prior to the expiration of the tender offer for a total purchase price of approximately $2.7 million. On October 23, 2023, the Company distributed a notice of redemption to the registered holders of the remaining outstanding warrants announcing the redemption of those warrants for $0.35 per warrant. The redemption closed on October 30, 2023, and all remaining 1,004,148 warrants were purchased for an aggregate price of approximately $0.4 million.\n\nEquity Reserve Facility\n\nOn October 18, 2024, the Company entered into a Share Purchase Agreement (the “Purchase Agreement”) with New Circle Principal Investments LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (“New Circle”), pursuant to which New Circle has committed to purchase, subject to certain limitations, up to $20 million (the “Total Commitment”) of the Company’s Class A common stock, par value $0.001 per share (the “Class A Common Stock”). Under the applicable Nasdaq rules, the Company may not issue to New Circle under the Purchase Agreement more than 19.99% of the shares of all classes of the Company’s common stock outstanding immediately prior to the execution of the Purchase Agreement (the “Exchange Cap”), unless (i) the Company obtains stockholder approval to issue shares of its Class A Common Stock in excess of the Exchange Cap in accordance with applicable Nasdaq rules, or (ii) the average purchase price per share paid by New Circle for all shares of the Company’s Class A Common Stock, if any, that the Company elects to sell to New Circle under the Purchase Agreement equals or exceeds certain minimums permitted under the rules of the Nasdaq Stock Market. The purchase price of the shares that may be sold to New Circle under the Purchase Agreement will be based on an agreed upon fixed discount to the market price of our Class A Common Stock as computed under the Purchase Agreement.\n\n19\n\n[Table of Contents](#i20ec97510e3b4e6bba093038fbf06538_7)\n\nAs consideration for New Circle’s irrevocable commitment to purchase shares of the Company’s Class A Common Stock upon the terms of and subject to satisfaction of the conditions set forth in the Purchase Agreement, the Company paid New Circle structuring and legal fees of less than $0.1 million. In addition, the Company will pay a commitment fee of $150,000 to New Circle, which we may issue in the form of the Company’s Class A Common Stock (the “Commitment Fee”), the market value of which shall be determined based on the closing price of the Class A Common Stock on the date the Registration Statement is declared effective by the SEC; provided, however, that the Company may, in its sole discretion, elect to pay any portion of the Commitment Fee in cash, so long as such amount is paid on or prior to the day of filing of the Registration Statement filed in order to register the Company’s Class A Common Stock sold under the Purchase Agreement.\n\nThe Purchase Agreement will automatically terminate on the earliest of (i) the 36-month anniversary of the of the Purchase Agreement, (ii) the date on which New Circle shall have made payment to the Company for Class A Common Stock equal to the Total Commitment or (iii) the date any statute, rule, regulation, executive order, decree, ruling or injunction that would prohibit any of the transactions contemplated by the Purchase Agreement goes into effect. The Company has the right to terminate the Purchase Agreement at any time, at no cost or penalty, upon five trading days’ prior written notice to New Circle so long as (a) there are no outstanding purchase notices under which our Class A Common Stock have yet to be issued and (b) the Company has paid all amounts owed to New Circle pursuant to the Purchase Agreement. The Company and New Circle may also agree to terminate the Purchase Agreement by mutual written consent.\n\nNoncontrolling Interest\n\nDirect Digital Holdings, Inc. is the sole managing member of DDH LLC, and consolidates the financial results of DDH LLC. Therefore, Direct Digital Holdings, Inc. reports a noncontrolling interest (\"NCI\") based on the common units of DDH LLC held by DDM. While Direct Digital Holdings, Inc. retains its controlling interest in DDH LLC, changes in its ownership interest in DDH LLC are accounted for as equity transactions. As such, future redemptions or direct exchanges of LLC Units by DDM will result in a change in ownership and reduce or increase the amount recorded as noncontrolling interest and increase or decrease additional paid-in capital when DDH LLC has positive or negative net assets, respectively. \n\nStock-Based Compensation Plans\n\nIn connection with the initial public offering, the Company adopted the 2022 Omnibus Incentive Plan (“2022 Omnibus Plan”) to facilitate the grant of equity awards to the Company’s employees, consultants and non-employee directors. The Company’s board of directors reserved 1,500,000 shares of Class A Common Stock for issuance in equity awards under the 2022 Omnibus Plan. Information on activity for both the stock options and RSUs is detailed below.\n\nDuring the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company recognized $0.8 million and $0.5 million, respectively, of total stock-based compensation expense in the condensed consolidated statement of operations in compensation, tax and benefits.\n\nStock Options\n\nOptions to purchase shares of common stock vest annually on the grant date anniversary over a period of three years and expire 10 years following the date of grant. The following table summarizes the stock option activity under the 2022 Omnibus Plan as of September 30, 2024:\n\nStock Options  \n---  \nShares| Weighted AverageExercise Price| Weighted AverageContractual Life(in years)| AggregateIntrinsic Value (in thousands)  \nOutstanding at January 1, 2024| 371,116| $| 2.51 | 8.77| $| 4,591  \nGranted| — | $| — | — | $| —  \nExercised| (12,557)| $| 2.39 | —| $| 179  \nForfeited| (17,701)| $| 2.98 | —| $| 36  \nOutstanding at September 30, 2024| 340,858| $| 2.49 | 7.92| $| 97  \nVested and exercisable at September 30, 2024| 172,543| $| 2.17 | 7.64| $| 63  \n  \n20\n\n[Table of Contents](#i20ec97510e3b4e6bba093038fbf06538_7)\n\nAs of September 30, 2024, unrecognized stock-based compensation of $0.2 million related to 168,315 of unvested stock options which will be recognized on a straight-line basis over a weighted-average vesting period of 1.20 year.\n\nRestricted Stock Units\n\nRSUs generally vest annually on the grant date anniversary over a period of three years. A summary of RSU activity during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and related information is as follows:\n\nRestricted Stock Units  \n---  \nNumber of Shares| Weighted AverageGrant Date Fair Valueper Share  \nUnvested- January 1, 2024| 542,396| $| 2.87  \nGranted| 99,474| $| 16.90  \nVested| (362,799)| $| 6.76  \nForfeited| (14,111)| $| 3.01  \nUnvested- September 30, 2024| 264,960| $| 2.79  \n  \nThe majority of vested RSUs were net share settled such that the Company withheld shares with a value equivalent to the employees’ obligation for the applicable income and other employment taxes. The total shares withheld were 98,036 and were based on the value of the RSUs on their respective vesting dates as determined by the Company’s closing stock price. As of September 30, 2024, there was unrecognized stock-based compensation of $0.5 million related to unvested RSUs which will be recognized on a straight-line basis over a weighted average period of 1.23 years.\n\nNote 5 — Tax Receivable Agreement and Income Taxes\n\nTax Receivable Agreement\n\nThe Company's TRA with DDH LLC and DDM (together, the “TRA Holders”) provides for payment by the Company to the TRA Holders of 85% of the net cash savings, if any, in U.S. federal, state and local income tax and franchise tax that the Company actually realizes or is deemed to realize in certain circumstances. The Company retains the benefit of the remaining 15% of these net cash savings.\n\nThe TRA liability is calculated by determining the tax basis subject to the TRA (“tax basis”) and applying a blended tax rate to the basis differences and calculating the resulting impact. The blended tax rate consists of the U.S. federal income tax rate and assumed combined state and local income tax rate driven by the apportionment factors applicable to each state. Any taxable income or loss generated by the Company will be allocated to TRA Holders in accordance with the LLC Agreement and the TRA, and distributions to the owners of LLC Units in an amount sufficient to fund their tax obligations will be made. Pursuant to the Company’s election under Section 754 of the Code in 2022, the Company expects to obtain an increase in its share of the tax basis in the net assets of DDH, LLC when LLC interests are redeemed or exchanged by the members of DDH, LLC. In August 2022 and December 2023, members of DDM exchanged 100,000 and 410,000 Class B shares into Class A shares, respectively. \n\nThe Company has recorded a liability related to the tax receivable agreement of less than $0.1 million and $5.2 million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. The Company has recorded a deferred tax asset primarily from the outside basis difference in the partnership interest of $0.0 million and $6.1 million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. The deferred tax asset is net of a valuation allowance of $7.3 million and $0.5 million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. TRA payments of $0 and less than $0.1 million were made during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The payments under the TRA will not be conditional on holder of rights under the TRA having a continued ownership interest in either DDH LLC or the Company. The Company may elect to defer payments due under the TRA if the Company does not have available cash to satisfy its payment obligations under the TRA. Any such deferred payments under the TRA generally will accrue interest from the due date for such payment until the payment date. The Company accounts for any amounts payable under the TRA in accordance with ASC Topic 450, Contingencies, and recognizes subsequent period changes to the measurement of the liability from the TRA in the statement of operations as a component of income before taxes. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, $5.2 million was recognized as income under other income (expense) due to the derecognition of the TRA liability, as a valuation allowance was recorded against the deferred taxes associated with the TRA.\n\n21\n\n[Table of Contents](#i20ec97510e3b4e6bba093038fbf06538_7)\n\nThe term of the TRA commenced upon completion of the initial public offering and will continue until all tax benefits that are subject to the TRA have been utilized or expired, unless the Company exercises its right to terminate the TRA. If the Company elects to terminate the TRA early (or it is terminated early due to changes in control), the obligations under the TRA would accelerate and the Company would be required to make an immediate payment equal to the present value of the anticipated future payments to be made by the Company under the TRA.\n\nIncome Taxes\n\nThrough the Organizational Transactions completed in February 2022, the Company formed an Up-C structure which allows DDM to continue to realize tax benefits associated with owning interests in an entity that is treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Under the Up-C structure, the Company is subject to corporation income tax on the variable ownership changes. The ownership was 20.45% as of January 1, 2023 and increased to 23.35% in the fourth quarter of 2023. There was no exchange of shares of Class B common stock for shares of Class A common stock in the nine months ended September 30, 2024.\n\nThe Company recorded a tax benefit for federal and state income tax for which the components and the effective income tax rates are as follows (in thousands):\n\nThree Months EndedSeptember 30,| Nine Months EndedSeptember 30,  \n---|---  \n2024| 2023| 2024| 2023  \nIncome tax expense| $| 6,606 | $| 166 | $| 6,132 | $| 166  \nEffective income tax rate| 2884.7 | %| 4.7 | %| (85.1 | %)| 4.9 | %  \n  \nThe effective tax rates were lower than the statutory tax rates for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 primarily due to the Company’s partnership loss that is not subject to federal and state taxes. The effective tax rates were different from the statutory rates for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 primarily due to recording a valuation allowance against deferred taxes.\n\nAs of September 30, 2024, the Company had federal net operating loss carryforwards of $4.4 millionthat can be carried forward indefinitely.\n\nThe Company files income tax returns in the United States federal jurisdiction and various state jurisdictions. In the normal course of business, the Company can be examined by various tax authorities, including the Internal Revenue Service in the United States. There are currently no federal or state audits in process. The Company analyzes its tax filing positions in all of the U.S. federal, state and local tax jurisdictions where it is required to file income tax returns, as well as for all open tax years in these jurisdictions. Federal and various states returns for the years ended December 2022 and 2021 remain open as of September 30, 2024. The Company evaluates tax positions taken or expected to be taken in the course of preparing an entity’s tax returns to determine whether it is “more-likely-than-not” that each tax position will be sustained by the applicable tax authority. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company had no uncertain tax positions. Accordingly, the Company has not recognized any penalty, interest or tax impact related to uncertain tax positions.\n\nNote 6 — Related Party Transactions\n\nRelated Party Transactions\n\nMember Payable\n\nAs of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company had a net receivable from members that totaled $1.7 million, which is included as a related party receivable on the condensed consolidated balance sheets.\n\nUp-C Structure\n\nIn February 2022, the Company completed an initial public offering of its securities, and through the Organizational Transactions, formed an Up-C structure, which is often used by partnerships and limited liability companies and allows DDM, a Delaware limited liability company indirectly owned by Mark Walker (“Walker”) and Keith Smith (“Smith”), to retain its equity ownership in DDH LLC and to continue to realize tax benefits associated with owning interests in an entity that is treated as a partnership, or “pass-through” entity, for U.S. federal income tax purposes. DDM holds economic \n\n22\n\n[Table of Contents](#i20ec97510e3b4e6bba093038fbf06538_7)\n\nnonvoting LLC Units in DDH LLC and holds noneconomic voting equity interests in the form of the Class B Common Stock in Direct Digital Holdings (See Note 4 — Stockholders’ Deficit and Stock-Based Compensation). One of the tax benefits to DDM associated with this structure is that future taxable income of DDH LLC that is allocated to DDM will be taxed on a pass-through basis and therefore will not be subject to corporate taxes at the entity level. Additionally, DDM may, from time to time, redeem or exchange its LLC Units for shares of the Company’s Class A Common Stock on a one-for-one basis. The Up-C structure also provides DDM with potential liquidity that holders of non-publicly traded limited liability companies are not typically afforded. If the Company ever generates sufficient taxable income to utilize the tax benefits, DDH expects to benefit from the Up-C structure because, in general, the Company expects cash tax savings in amounts equal to 15% of certain tax benefits arising from such redemptions or exchanges of DDM's LLC Units for Class A Common Stock or cash and certain other tax benefits covered by the TRA. As described in Note 5 — Tax Receivable Agreement and Income Taxes, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, $5.2 million was recorded as income in other income (expense) for such change as the deferred taxes giving rise to the TRA have a valuation allowance recorded to offset the deferred tax assets.\n\nThe aggregate balance of tax receivable liabilities as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, is as follows (in thousands):\n\nSeptember 30,2024| December 31,2023  \n---|---  \nLiability related to tax receivable agreement  \nShort term| $| 41| $| 41  \nLong term| —| 5,201  \nTotal liability related to tax receivable agreement| $| 41| $| 5,242  \n  \nNote 7 — Segment Information\n\nRevenue by business segment is as follows (in thousands):\n\nThree Months EndedSeptember 30,| Nine Months EndedSeptember 30,  \n---|---  \n2024| 2023| 2024| 2023  \nSell-side advertising| $| 2,202 | $| 51,622 | $| 33,001 | $| 89,006  \nBuy-side advertising| 6,873 | 7,850 | 20,204 | 27,093  \nTotal revenues| $| 9,075 | $| 59,472 | $| 53,205 | $| 116,099  \n  \nOperating loss by business segment reconciled to loss before income taxes is as follows (in thousands):\n\nThree Months EndedSeptember 30,| Nine Months EndedSeptember 30,  \n---|---  \n2024| 2023| 2024| 2023  \nSell-side advertising| $| (873)| $| 6,206 | $| 536 | $| 9,657  \nBuy-side advertising| 1,349 | 1,551 | 3,490 | 6,980  \nCorporate office expenses | (4,134)| (3,263)| (12,555)| (10,030)  \nTotal operating (loss) income| (3,658)| 4,494 | (8,529)| 6,607  \nCorporate other expense| 3,887 | (977)| 1,323 | (3,229)  \nIncome (loss) before income taxes| $| 229 | $| 3,517 | $| (7,206)| $| 3,378  \n  \n23\n\n[Table of Contents](#i20ec97510e3b4e6bba093038fbf06538_7)\n\nTotal assets by business segment are as follows (in thousands):\n\nSeptember 30,2024| December 31,2023  \n---|---  \nSell-side advertising| $| 3,807 | $| 34,354  \nBuy-side advertising| 20,604 | 22,539  \nCorporate office | 6,880 | 13,779  \nTotal assets| $| 31,291 | $| 70,672  \n  \nNote 8 — Net (Loss) Income Per Share\n\nThe Company has two classes of common stock, Class A and Class B. Shares of the Company’s Class B Common Stock do not share in the earnings or losses attributable to Direct Digital Holdings, Inc. and are therefore not participating securities. The Company uses the two-class method to calculate basic and diluted earnings per share as a result of outstanding participating securities in the form of warrants for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. The following table sets forth the computation of the Company’s basic and diluted net (loss) income per share (in thousands, except per share amounts):\n\nThree Months EndedSeptember 30,| Nine Months EndedSeptember 30,  \n---|---  \n2024| 2023| 2024| 2023  \nNet (loss) income attributable to Class A shareholders and participating securities| $| (2,690)| $| 571 | $| (4,055)| $| 549  \nLess: net income allocated to participating securities| — | 296 | — | 285  \nNet (loss) income allocated to Class A shareholders| $| (2,690)| $| 275 | $| (4,055)| $| 264  \nWeighted average common shares outstanding - basic| 3,793 | 2,990 | 3,667 | 2,938  \nClass B Common Stock| — | — | — | —  \nOptions to purchase common stock| — | 20 | — | 24  \nUnvested restricted stock units| — | 34 | — | 118  \nWeighted average common shares outstanding - diluted| 3,793 | 3,044 | 3,667 | 3,080  \nNet (loss) income per common share, basic| $| (0.71)| $| 0.09| $| (1.11)| $| 0.09  \nNet (loss) income per common share, diluted| $| (0.71)| $| 0.09| $| (1.11)| $| 0.09  \n  \nThe following weighted-average outstanding shares of common stock equivalents were excluded from the computation of diluted net (loss) income per share attributable to common stockholders for the periods presented because including them would have been anti-dilutive (in thousands):\n\nThree Months EndedSeptember 30,| Nine Months EndedSeptember 30,  \n---|---  \n2024| 2023| 2024| 2023  \nClass B Common Stock| 10,868| 11,278| 10,868| 11,278  \nOptions to purchase common stock| 346| 343| 362| 365  \nUnvested restricted stock units| 268| 495| 402| 382  \nTotal excludable from net loss per share attributable to common stockholders - diluted| 11,482| 12,116| 11,632| 12,025  \n  \nNote 9 — Commitments and Contingencies\n\nLitigation\n\nWe may from time to time be subject to various legal or administrative claims and proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business. As of the date hereof, except as set forth below, we are not a party to any material legal or administrative proceedings nor are there any proceedings in which any of our directors, executive officers or affiliates, or \n\n24\n\n[Table of Contents](#i20ec97510e3b4e6bba093038fbf06538_7)\n\nany registered or beneficial stockholder, is an adverse party or has a material interest adverse to our interest. Litigation or any other legal or administrative proceeding, regardless of the outcome, is likely to result in substantial cost and diversion of our resources, including our management’s time and attention.\n\nOn May 10, 2024, the Company was the subject of a defamatory article / blog post. In connection with this post, one of the Company’s sell-side customers paused its connection to the Company while the allegations were investigated. This customer reconnected the Company on May 22, 2024 and sell-side volumes have resumed but not yet at the levels experienced prior to the pause in May 2024. The Company is actively working with its partners to achieve prior volume levels. On May 14, 2024, the Company filed a lawsuit against the author of the defamatory article and is vigorously pursuing its rights. The Company cannot make any predictions about the final outcome of this litigation matter or the timing thereof.\n\nOn May 23, 2024, an alleged stockholder, purportedly on behalf of the persons or entities who purchased or acquired publicly traded securities of the Company between April 2023 and March 2024, filed a putative class action against the Company, certain of our officers and directors, and other defendants in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Texas, alleging violations of federal securities laws related to alleged false or misleading disclosures made by the Company in its public filings. On July 9, 2024, another alleged stockholder filed a similar securities class action against the Company, certain of our officers and directors, also in the Southern District of Texas. The two actions have been consolidated. Each of these complaints seeks unspecified damages, plus costs, fees, and attorneys’ fees. The Company cannot make any predictions about the final outcome of this matter or the timing thereof but believes that plaintiffs’ claims lack merit and intends to vigorously defend these lawsuits.\n\nOperating Leases\n\nDuring the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company incurred fixed rent expense associated with operating leases for real estate of $0.2 million. The Company did not have any finance leases, short-term leases nor variable leases over this time period.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\n\nYou should read the following discussion together with our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and our audited consolidated financial statements and the related notes included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023. This discussion contains forward-looking statements based upon current expectations that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including those set forth under the section titled “Risk Factors” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K or in other parts of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. See “– Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” below. Our historical results are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for any period in the future.\n\nCautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\n\nThis Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws and which are subject to certain risks, trends and uncertainties. We use words such as “could,” “would,” “may,” “might,” “will,” “expect,” “likely,” “believe,” “continue,” “anticipate,” “estimate,” “intend,” “plan,” “project” and other similar expressions to identify forward-looking statements, but not all forward-looking statements include these words. All of our forward-looking statements involve estimates and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in or implied by the forward-looking statements. Accordingly, any such statements are qualified in their entirety by reference to the information described under the caption “Risk Factors” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K and elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023.\n\nThe forward-looking statements contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q are based on assumptions that we have made in light of our industry experience and our perceptions of historical trends, current conditions, expected future developments and other factors we believe are appropriate under the circumstances. As you read and consider this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, you should understand that these statements are not guarantees of performance or results. They involve risks, uncertainties (many of which are beyond our control) and assumptions.\n\nAlthough we believe that these forward-looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions, you should be aware that many factors could affect our actual operating and financial performance and cause our performance to differ materially from the performance expressed in or implied by the forward-looking statements. We believe these factors include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\n•the restrictions and covenants imposed upon us by our credit facilities; \n\n•the substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern, which may hinder our ability to obtain future financing;\n\n•our ability to secure additional financing to meet our capital needs; \n\n•ineligibility to file short-form registration statements on Form S-3, which may impair our ability to raise capital; \n\n•failure to satisfy applicable listing standards of the Nasdaq Capital Market resulting in a potential delisting of our common stock;\n\n•costs, risks and uncertainties related to the restatement of certain prior period financial statements;\n\n•any significant fluctuations caused by our high customer concentration;\n\n•risks related to non-payment by our clients; \n\n•reputational and other harms caused by our failure to detect advertising fraud; \n\n•operational and performance issues with our platform, whether real or perceived, including a failure to respond to technological changes or to upgrade our technology systems;\n\n•restrictions on the use of third-party “cookies,” mobile device IDs or other tracking technologies, which could diminish our platform’s effectiveness;\n\n•unfavorable publicity and negative public perception about our industry, particularly concerns regarding data privacy and security relating to our industry’s technology and practices, and any perceived failure to comply with laws and industry self-regulation;\n\n•our failure to manage our growth effectively; \n\n28\n\n[Table of Contents](#i20ec97510e3b4e6bba093038fbf06538_7)\n\n•the difficulty in identifying and integrating any future acquisitions or strategic investments; \n\n•any changes or developments in legislative, judicial, regulatory or cultural environments related to information collection, use and processing; \n\n•challenges related to our buy-side clients that are destination marketing organizations and that operate as public/private partnerships; \n\n•any strain on our resources or diversion of our management’s attention as a result of being a public company;\n\n•the intense competition of the digital advertising industry and our ability to effectively compete against current and future competitors; \n\n•any significant inadvertent disclosure or breach of confidential and/or personal information we hold, or of the security of our or our customers’, suppliers’ or other partners’ computer systems;\n\n•as a holding company, we depend on distributions from Direct Digital Holdings, LLC (“DDH LLC”) to pay our taxes, expenses (including payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement) and any amount of any dividends we may pay to the holders of our common stock;\n\n•the fact that DDH LLC is controlled by DDM, whose interest may differ from those of our public stockholders; \n\n•any failure by us to maintain or implement effective internal controls or to detect fraud; and\n\n•other factors and assumptions discussed under “Risk Factors” and elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023.\n\nShould one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize or should any of these assumptions prove to be incorrect, our actual operating and financial performance may vary in material respects from the performance projected in these forward-looking statements. Further, any forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date on which it is made, and except as required by law, we undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statement contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q to reflect events or circumstances after the date on which it is made or to reflect the occurrence of anticipated or unanticipated events or circumstances. New factors that could cause our business not to develop as we expect emerge from time to time, and it is not possible for us to predict all of them. Further, we cannot assess the impact of each currently known or new factor on our results of operations or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements.\n\nOverview\n\nDirect Digital Holdings, Inc. and its subsidiaries (collectively the “Company,” “DDH,” “we,” “us” and “our”), headquartered in Houston, Texas, is an end-to-end, full-service programmatic advertising platform primarily focused on providing advertising technology, data-driven campaign optimization and other solutions intended for underserved and less efficient markets on both the sell- and buy-side of the digital advertising ecosystem. Direct Digital Holdings, Inc. is the holding company that, since the completion of our initial public offering on February 15, 2022, owns certain common units, and serves as the manager of DDH LLC, which operates the business formed in 2018 through the acquisition of Colossus Media, LLC (\"Colossus Media\"), a sell-side marketing platform, and Huddled Masses, LLC (“Huddled Masses™” or “Huddled Masses”), a buy-side marketing platform.\n\nIn late September 2020, DDH LLC acquired Orange142, LLC (“Orange 142”) to further bolster its overall programmatic buy-side advertising platform and enhance its offerings across multiple industry verticals such as travel, education, healthcare, financial services, consumer products and other sectors, with particular emphasis on small- and mid-sized businesses transitioning into digital with growing digital media budgets.\n\nDirect Digital Holdings, Inc. owns 100% of the voting interest in Direct Digital Holdings, LLC. As of September 30, 2024, DDH owns 25.9% of the economic interest in Direct Digital Holdings, LLC. See further discussion of the Up-C structure in Note 6 of our condensed consolidated financial statements. Direct Digital Holdings, LLC was formed on June \n\n29\n\n[Table of Contents](#i20ec97510e3b4e6bba093038fbf06538_7)\n\n21, 2018 and acquired by DDH on February 15, 2022 in connection with the Organizational Transactions. Direct Digital Holdings, LLC’s wholly-owned subsidiaries are as follows:\n\nSubsidiary| Current %Ownership | Business Segment| Date of Formation| Date ofAcquisition  \n---|---|---|---|---  \nColossus Media, LLC| 100%| Sell-side| September 8, 2017| June 21, 2018  \nOrange142, LLC| 100%| Buy-side| March 6, 2013| September 30, 2020  \nHuddled Masses, LLC| 100%| Buy-side| November 13, 2012| June 21, 2018  \n  \nColossus Media operates our proprietary sell-side programmatic platform operating under the trademarked banner of Colossus SSP™ (“Colossus SSP”). Colossus SSP is a stand-alone sell-side platform (\"SSP\") intended to deliver targeted advertising to diverse and multicultural audiences as well as to general audiences, including African Americans, Latin Americans, Asian Americans and LGBTQIA+ customers, as well as general audiences. Both buy-side advertising businesses, Orange 142 and Huddled Masses, offer technology-enabled advertising solutions and consulting services to clients through demand side platforms (“DSPs”). \n\nProviding both the front-end, buy-side advertising businesses coupled with our proprietary sell-side operations enables us to curate the first through the last mile in the ad tech ecosystem execution process to drive higher results.\n\nOperating segments are components of an enterprise for which separate financial information is available and evaluated regularly by our chief operating decision maker (“CODM”) for purpose of allocating resources and assessing performance. Our CODM is our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. We operate as two reportable segments: sell-side advertising, which includes the results of Colossus Media, and buy-side advertising, which includes the results of Orange 142 and Huddled Masses. All our revenues are attributable to the United States.\n\nRecent Developments\n\nNasdaq Rule Noncompliance.\n\nOn October 18, 2024, we received a deficiency letter (the “Letter”) from the Listing Qualifications Department of Nasdaq (the \"Staff\") notifying the Company that it was not in compliance with the minimum stockholders’ equity requirement for continued listing on Nasdaq under Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(b)(1). Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(b)(1) requires companies listed on Nasdaq to maintain stockholders’ equity of at least $2.5 million (the “Stockholders’ Equity Requirement”). The Company’s Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the period ended June 30, 2024 reported a stockholders’ deficit of $8.77 million. The Letter further noted that as of the letter date, the Company did not have a market value of listed securities of $35 million, or net income from continued operations of $500,000 in the most recently completed fiscal year or in two of the last three most recently completed fiscal years, which are the alternative quantitative standards to the Stockholders’ Equity Requirement for continued listing on Nasdaq. In accordance with the Nasdaq Listing Rules, the Company was provided 45 calendar days, or until December 2, 2024, to submit a plan to regain compliance (the “Compliance Plan”). If the Compliance Plan is acceptable to the Staff, the Staff may grant an extension of up to 180 calendar days from the date of the Letter. If the Staff does not accept the Compliance Plan, the Staff will provide written notification to the Company that the Compliance Plan has been rejected. At that time, the Company may appeal the Staff’s determination to a Nasdaq Hearings Panel. The Company intends to submit a Compliance Plan on or before December 2, 2024. Further, the Company intends to take all reasonable measures available to regain compliance under the Nasdaq Listing Rules and remain listed on Nasdaq, including by capital-raising activities such as through the Purchase Agreement, defined below, for the equity reserve facility described in Note 4 — Stockholders’ Deficit and Stock-Based Compensation. However, there can be no assurance that Nasdaq will approve the Compliance Plan or that the Company will ultimately regain compliance with all applicable requirements for continued listing. Neither the Letter nor the Company’s non-compliance have an immediate effect on the listing or trading of the Company’s Class A Common Stock.\n\nEquity Reserve Facility.\n\nOn October 18, 2024, the Company entered into a Share Purchase Agreement (the “Purchase Agreement”) with New Circle Principal Investments LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (“New Circle”), pursuant to which New Circle has committed to purchase, subject to certain limitations, up to $20 million (the “Total Commitment”) of the Company’s Class A common stock, par value $0.001 per share (the “Class A Common Stock”). Under the applicable Nasdaq rules, the Company may not issue to New Circle under the Purchase Agreement more than 19.99% of the shares of all classes of the Company’s common stock outstanding immediately prior to the execution of the Purchase Agreement (the “Exchange Cap”), unless (i) the Company obtains stockholder approval to issue shares of its Class A Common Stock in excess of the Exchange Cap in accordance with applicable Nasdaq rules, or (ii) the average purchase price per share paid by New Circle for all shares of the Company’s Class A Common Stock, if any, that the Company elects to sell to New Circle under the \n\n30\n\n[Table of Contents](#i20ec97510e3b4e6bba093038fbf06538_7)\n\nPurchase Agreement equals or exceeds certain minimums permitted under the rules of the Nasdaq Stock Market. The purchase price of the shares that may be sold to New Circle under the Purchase Agreement will be based on an agreed upon fixed discount to the market price of our Class A Common Stock as computed under the Purchase Agreement. As consideration for New Circle’s irrevocable commitment to purchase shares of the Company’s Class A Common Stock upon the terms of and subject to satisfaction of the conditions set forth in the Purchase Agreement, the Company paid New Circle structuring and legal fees of less than $0.1 million. In addition, the Company will pay a commitment fee of $150,000 to New Circle, which we may issue in the form of the Company’s Class A Common Stock (the “Commitment Fee”), the market value of which shall be determined based on the closing price of the Class A Common Stock on the date the Registration Statement is declared effective by the SEC; provided, however, that the Company may, in its sole discretion, elect to pay any portion of the Commitment Fee in cash, so long as such amount is paid on or prior to the day of filing of the Registration Statement filed in order to register the Company’s Class A Common Stock sold under the Purchase Agreement. The Purchase Agreement will automatically terminate on the earliest of (i) the 36-month anniversary of the Purchase Agreement, (ii) the date on which New Circle shall have made payment to the Company for Class A Common Stock equal to the Total Commitment or (iii) the date any statute, rule, regulation, executive order, decree, ruling or injunction that would prohibit any of the transactions contemplated by the Purchase Agreement goes into effect. The Company has the right to terminate the Purchase Agreement at any time, at no cost or penalty, upon five trading days’ prior written notice to New Circle so long as (a) there are no outstanding purchase notices under which our Class A Common Stock have yet to be issued and (b) the Company has paid all amounts owed to New Circle pursuant to the Purchase Agreement.\n\nRelationship with Sell-Side Customer.\n\nOn May 10, 2024, the Company was the subject of a defamatory article / blog post which the Company believes was part of a coordinated misinformation campaign. In connection with this post, one of the Company’s sell-side customers paused its connection to the Company while the allegations were investigated. This customer reconnected the Company on May 22, 2024 and sell-side volumes have resumed but not yet at the levels experienced prior to the pause in May 2024. The Company is actively working with its partners to achieve prior volume levels. On May 14, 2024, the Company filed a lawsuit against the author of the defamatory article and is vigorously pursuing its rights. The Company cannot make any predictions about the final outcome of this litigation matter or the timing thereof.\n\nBuy-side Unification.\n\nOn October 31, 2024, the Company announced the unification of its buy-side businesses, Orange 142 and Huddled Masses. The unification did not have a material impact on the Company's business operations nor on the Company's condensed consolidated financial statements.\n\nKey Factors Affecting Our Performance\n\nWe believe our growth and financial performance are dependent on many factors, including those described below.\n\nSell-side advertising business\n\nIncreasing revenue from customers through increased advertising spend from buyers\n\nColossus Media operates our proprietary sell-side programmatic platform operating under the trademarked banner of Colossus SSP. Our customers (or buyers) include ad exchanges, DSPs, agencies and individual advertisers. We have broad exposure to the ecosystem of buyers, reaching on average approximately 176,000 advertisers per month in the three months ended September 30, 2024, an increase of 71% over the 103,000 advertisers per month in the three months ended September 30, 2023. As spending on programmatic advertising increasingly becomes a larger share of the overall ad spend, advertisers and agencies are seeking greater control of their digital advertising supply chains. To take advantage of this industry shift, we have entered into Supply Path Optimization agreements directly with customers which address acceptable advertisements and data usage. As part of these agreements, we provide advertisers and agencies with benefits ranging from custom data and workflow integrations, product features, volume-based business terms, and visibility into campaign performance data and methodology. As a result of these direct relationships, our existing advertisers and agencies are incentivized to allocate an increasing percentage of their advertising budgets to our platform.\n\nWe also strive to retain existing publishers and add new publishers. Establishing multiple header bidding integrations by leveraging our technology capabilities allows us to maximize our access to publishers’ ad formats, devices and various properties that a publisher may own. We may also up-sell additional products including our header bidding management, identity, and audience solutions. We enter into master service agreements with our publishers which, among other terms, set a fixed rate for content to be sold on Colossus SSP. Our strategy on the sell-side advertising business represents growth \n\n31\n\n[Table of Contents](#i20ec97510e3b4e6bba093038fbf06538_7)\n\npotential, and we believe we are well positioned to be able to bring underserved multicultural publishers into the advertising ecosystem, thereby increasing our value proposition across all customers, including large advertisers and agencies.\n\nMonetizing ad impressions for publishers and buyers\n\nWe curate advertisers and increase access to publishers with valuable ad impressions. We focus on monetizing digital impressions by coordinating daily real-time auctions and bids. Each time the publisher’s web page loads, an ad request is sent to multiple ad exchanges and, in some cases, to the demand side platform directly from Colossus SSP. In case of real-time bidding (“RTB”) media buys, many DSPs would place bids to the impressions being offered by the publisher during the auction. The advertiser that bids a higher amount compared to other advertisers will win the bid and pay the second highest price for the winning impression to serve the ads. We continuously review our available inventory from existing publishers across every format (mobile, desktop, digital video, OTT, CTV, and rich media). The factors we consider when determining which impressions we process include transparency, viewability, and whether or not the impression is human sourced. By consistently applying these criteria, we believe the ad impressions we process will be valuable and marketable to advertisers.\n\nEnhancing ad inventory quality\n\nIn the advertising industry, inventory quality is assessed in terms of invalid traffic (“IVT”) which can be impacted by fraud such as “fake eyeballs” generated by automated technologies set up to artificially inflate impression counts. Through our platform design and proactive IVT mitigation efforts, we address and minimize IVT on a number of fronts, including sophisticated technology, which detects and avoids IVT on the front end; direct publisher and inventory relationships, for supply path optimization; and ongoing campaign and inventory performance review, to ensure inventory quality and brand protection controls are in place.\n\nGrowing access to valuable ad impressions\n\nHistorically, our growth has been driven by a variety of factors including increased access to mobile web (display and video) and mobile app (display and video) impressions and desktop video impressions. Our performance is affected by our ability to maintain and grow our access to valuable ad impressions from current publishers as well as through new relationships with publishers. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, we processed over 513.3 billion average monthly bid requests, down 51% from 2023, reflecting the pause in service by one of our sell-side customers in May 2024 which has not yet returned to pre-pause levels.\n\nExpanding and managing investments\n\nEach impression or transaction occurs in a fraction of a second. Given that most transactions take place in an auction/bidding format, we continue to make investments across the platform to further reduce the processing time. In addition to the robust infrastructure supporting our platform, it is also critical that we align with key industry partners in the digital supply chain. The Colossus SSP is agnostic to any specific demand side platform.\n\nWe automate workflow processes whenever feasible to drive predictable and value-added outcomes for our customers and increase productivity of our organization. In the first half of 2023, we transitioned our server platform to HPE Greenlake, which provides increased capacity, faster response time, and expansion capabilities to align with growth in our business.\n\nManaging industry dynamics\n\nWe operate in the rapidly evolving digital advertising industry. Due to the scale and complexity of the digital advertising ecosystem, direct sales via manual, person-to-person processes are insufficient for delivering a real-time, personalized ad experience, creating the need for programmatic advertising. In turn, advances in programmatic technologies have enabled publishers to auction their ad inventory to more buyers, simultaneously, and in real time through a process referred to as header bidding. Header bidding has also provided advertisers with transparent access to ad impressions. As advertisers keep pace with ongoing changes in the way that consumers view and interact with digital media we anticipate further innovation and expect that header bidding will be extended into new areas such as OTT/CTV. We believe our focus on publishers and buyers has allowed us to understand their needs and our ongoing innovation has enabled us to quickly adapt to changes in the industry, develop new solutions and do so cost effectively. Our performance depends on our ability to keep pace with industry changes such as header bidding and the evolving needs of our publishers and buyers while continuing our cost efficiency.\n\n32\n\n[Table of Contents](#i20ec97510e3b4e6bba093038fbf06538_7)\n\nSeasonality\n\nIn the advertising industry, companies commonly experience seasonal fluctuations in revenue. For example, in our sell-side advertising segment, many advertisers allocate the largest portion of their budgets to the fourth quarter of the calendar year in order to coincide with increased holiday purchasing. We expect our sell-side revenue to continue to fluctuate based on seasonal factors that affect the advertising industry as a whole.\n\nBuy-side advertising business\n\nNew Customer Acquisitions\n\nOn the buy-side of our business, our customers consist of purchasers of programmatic advertising inventory (ad space) looking to place their advertisements. We serve the needs of over 230 small and mid-sized clients, consisting of advertising space buyers, including small and mid-sized companies, large advertising holding companies (which may manage several agencies), independent advertising agencies and mid-market advertising service organizations. We serve a variety of customers across multiple industries including travel/tourism (including destination marketing organizations (“DMOs”)), education, energy, consumer packaged goods, healthcare, financial services (including cryptocurrency technologies) and other industries.\n\nWe are focused on increasing the number of customers that use our buy-side advertising businesses as their advertising partner. Our long-term growth and results of operations will depend on our ability to attract more customers, including DMOs, across multiple geographies.\n\nExpand Sales to Existing Customers\n\nOur customers understand the independent nature of our platform and relentless focus on driving results based on return on investment (“ROI”). Our value proposition is complete alignment across our entire digital supply platform beginning with the first dollar in and last dollar out. We are technology, DSP and media agnostic, and we believe our clients trust us to provide the best opportunity for success of their brands and businesses. As a result, our clients have been loyal, with approximately 88% client retention amongst the clients that represent approximately 80% of our revenue during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. In addition, we cultivate client relationships through our pipeline of managed and moderate serve clients that conduct campaigns through our platform. The managed services delivery model allows us to combine our technology with a highly personalized offering to strategically design and manage advertising campaigns.\n\nShift to Digital Advertising\n\nMedia has increasingly become more digital as a result of three key ongoing developments:\n\n•Advances in technology with more sophisticated digital content delivery across multiple platforms;\n\n•Changes in consumer behavior, including spending longer portions of the day using mobile and other devices; and\n\n•Better audience segmentation with more efficient targeting and measurable results.\n\nThe resulting shift has enabled a variety of options for advertisers to efficiently target and measure their advertising campaigns across nearly every media channel and device. These efforts have been led by big-budgeted, large, multi-national corporations incentivized to cast a broad advertising net to support national brands.\n\nIncreased Adoption of Digital Advertising by Small-and Mid-Sized Companies\n\nOnly recently have small and mid-sized businesses begun to leverage the power of digital media in meaningful ways, as emerging technologies have enabled advertising across multiple channels in a highly localized nature. Campaign efficiencies yielding measurable results and higher advertising ROI have prompted these companies to begin utilizing digital advertising on an accelerated pace. We believe this market is rapidly expanding, and that small-to-mid-sized advertisers will continue to increase their digital spend.\n\nSeasonality\n\nIn the advertising industry, companies commonly experience seasonal fluctuations in revenue. Historically, for our buy-side advertising segment, the second and third quarters of the year reflect our highest levels of advertising activity and \n\n33\n\n[Table of Contents](#i20ec97510e3b4e6bba093038fbf06538_7)\n\nthe first quarter reflects the lowest level of such activity. We expect our buy-side revenue to continue to fluctuate based on seasonal factors that affect the advertising industry as a whole.\n\nComponents of Our Results of Operations\n\nRevenue\n\nFor the sell-side advertising segment, we generate revenue by selling advertising inventory (digital ad units) that we purchase from publishers to advertisers through a process of monetizing ad impressions on our proprietary sell-side programmatic platform operating under the trademarked banner Colossus SSP. For the buy-side advertising segment, we generate revenue from customers that enter into agreements with us to provide managed advertising campaigns, which include digital marketing and media services to purchase digital advertising space, data and other add-on features.\n\nIn connection with our analysis of principal vs agent considerations, we have evaluated the specified goods or services and we considered whether we control the goods or services before they are provided to the customer including the three indicators of control. Based upon this analysis and our specific facts and circumstances, we concluded that we are a principal for the goods or services sold through both our sell-side advertising segment and our buy-side segment because we control the specified good or service before it is transferred to the customer and we are the primary obligor in the agreement with the customer. Therefore, we report revenue on a gross basis inclusive of all supplier costs. We pay suppliers for the cost of digital media, advertising inventory, data and any add-on services or features.\n\nOur revenue recognition policies are discussed in more detail under “—Critical Accounting Estimates and Related Policies” set forth in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.\n\nCost of revenues\n\nFor cost of revenues for our sell-side advertising segment, we pay publishers a fee, which is typically a percentage of the value of the ad impressions monetized through our platform. Cost of revenues consists primarily of publisher media fees and data center co-location costs. Media fees include the publishing and real time bidding costs to secure advertising space. For the buy-side advertising segment, cost of revenues consists primarily of digital media fees, third-party platform access fees, and other third-party fees associated with providing services to our customers.\n\nOperating expenses\n\nOperating expenses consist of compensation expenses related to our executive, sales, finance and administrative personnel (including salaries, commissions, stock-based compensation, bonuses, benefits and taxes); general and administrative expenses (including rent expense, professional fees, independent contractor costs, selling and marketing fees, administrative and operating system subscription costs, insurance, amortization expense related to our intangible assets); and other expenses (including transactions that are unusual in nature or which are occurring infrequently).\n\nOther income (expense), net\n\nOther income. Other income includes income associated with recovery of receivables and other miscellaneous credit card rebates.\n\nInterest expense. Interest expense is mainly related to our debt as further described below in “—Liquidity and Capital Resources.” \n\nLoss on early termination of line of credit. In January 2023, we entered into a Loan and Security Agreement (the “Loan Agreement”), by and among Silicon Valley Bank (“SVB”), which provided for a revolving credit facility (the “Credit Facility”).In March 2023, we issued a notice of termination and recognized a loss on the write-off of the deferred financing fees.\n\nDerecognition of tax receivable agreement liability. The Company derecognized its tax receivable agreement liability in connection with the full valuation allowance recorded on the Company's deferred tax assets.\n\n34\n\n[Table of Contents](#i20ec97510e3b4e6bba093038fbf06538_7)\n\nResults of Operations\n\nComparison of the Three and Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023\n\nThe following tables set forth our condensed consolidated results of operations for the periods presented (in thousands).

Sell-side advertising revenue decreased $49.4 million, or 96%, primarily due to a decrease in impression inventory. This decrease was primarily caused by one of the Company’s sell-side customers pausing its connection to the Company during the second quarter while it investigated allegations made against the Company in a defamatory article / blog post which the Company believes was part of a coordinated misinformation campaign. This customer reconnected the Company on May 22, 2024 and sell-side volumes have resumed but not yet at the levels experienced prior to the pause in May 2024, which affected the entirety of the quarter ended September 30, 2024. The Company sold approximately 0.2 billion average monthly impressions over the three months ended September 30, 2024, a decrease of 97% from the prior period. Buy-side revenue decreased $1.0 million, or 12%, over the three months ended September 30, 2023 due to a $0.7 million decrease in spending from our existing customer base, a $0.7 million decrease from completion of certain one-time campaigns in 2023 partially offset by growth from existing and new customers. \n\nOur revenues of $53.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 decreased by $62.9 million, or 54%, from $116.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Sell-side advertising revenue decreased $56.0 million, or 63%, primarily due to a decrease in impression inventory, resulting from the customer suspension that occurred during May 2024, which negatively affected revenue in the second and third quarters of 2024. The Company sold approximately 1.4 billion average monthly impressions over the nine months ended September 30, 2024, a decrease of 64% from the prior period. Buy-side revenue decreased $6.9 million, or 25%, over the nine months ended September 30, 2023 due to a $4.5 \n\n35\n\n[Table of Contents](#i20ec97510e3b4e6bba093038fbf06538_7)\n\nmillion decrease in spending from our existing customer base and a $3.6 million decrease from completion of certain one-time campaigns in 2023 partially offset by growth from existing and new customers.\n\nCost of revenues\n\nConsistent with the overall decrease in revenues, cost of revenues of $5.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 decreased by $42.2 million, or 88%, from $47.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Sell-side advertising cost of revenues decreased $42.0 million, to $2.7 million, or 121% of revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to $44.6 million, or 86% of revenue, for the same period in 2023. The decrease in costs was primarily due to the related decrease in revenue, while the increase as a percentage of revenue was due to fixed costs remaining at a level consistent with the prior year. Buy-side advertising cost of revenues decreased $0.2 million, to $2.9 million, or 42% of revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to $3.1 million, or 40% of revenue, for the same period in 2023. \n\nConsistent with the overall decrease in revenues, cost of revenues of $38.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 decreased by $49.1 million, or 56% from $87.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Sell-side advertising cost of revenues decreased $46.5 million, to $30.7 million, or 93% of revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to $77.2 million, or 87% of revenue, for the same period in 2023. The decrease in costs was primarily due to the related decrease in revenue, while the 6% increase as a percentage of revenue was due to an increase in fixed costs of approximately $0.5 million related to an increase in server capacity and approximately $1.1 million related to new analytic and technology-related costs to support the growth as well as the mix and concentration of publishers and the related costs. Buy-side advertising cost of revenues decreased $2.6 million, to $8.1 million, or 40% of revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to $10.7 million, or 39% of revenue, for the same period in 2023. \n\nGross profit\n\nGross profit was $3.5 million, or 39% of revenue, for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to $11.8 million, or 20% of revenue, for the same period in 2023, reflecting a decrease of $8.2 million, or 70%. The change in margin for the three months ended September 30, 2024 is attributable to the mix in revenue between our business segments as our sell-side segment has higher cost of revenues compared to our buy-side segment, as well as the consistent level of fixed costs not covered by current period sell-side revenue.\n\nSell-side advertising gross profit decreased $7.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same period in 2023, primarily due to a consistent level of fixed costs not covered by current period sell-side revenue. Sell-side advertising gross margin was (21)% and 14% for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Buy-side advertising gross profit decreased $0.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the same period in the prior year, primarily due to the decrease in revenue. Buy-side advertising gross margin was 58% and 60% for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. \n\nGross profit was $14.4 million, or 27% of revenue, for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to $28.3 million, or 24% of revenue, for the same period in 2023, reflecting a decrease of $13.8 million or 49%. The change in margin for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 is attributable to the mix in revenue between our business segments as our sell-side segment has higher cost of revenues compared to our buy-side segment, as well as the additional sell-side fixed costs related to an increase in server capacity and new analytic and technology-related costs.\n\nSell-side advertising gross profit decreased $9.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same period in 2023, primarily due to the increase in fixed costs of approximately $1.6 million related to our servers and analytic and technology-related costs and the decrease in revenues. Sell-side advertising gross margin was 7% and 13% for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Buy-side advertising gross profit decreased $4.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the same period in the prior year, primarily due to the decrease in revenue. Buy-side advertising gross margin was 60% and 61% for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. \n\n36\n\n[Table of Contents](#i20ec97510e3b4e6bba093038fbf06538_7)\n\nOperating expenses\n\nThe following table sets forth the components of operating expenses for the periods presented (in thousands):\n\nThree Months Ended September 30,| Change| Nine Months Ended September 30,| Change  \n---|---|---|---  \n2024| 2023| Amount| %| 2024| 2023| Amount| %  \nCompensation, tax and benefits| $| 3,526 | $| 4,747 | $| (1,221)| (26)| %| $| 12,216 | $| 12,934 | $| (718)| (6)| %  \nGeneral and administrative| 3,646 | 2,512 | 1,134 | 45 | %| 10,757 | 8,718 | 2,039 | 23 | %  \nTotal operating expenses| $| 7,172 | $| 7,259 | $| (87)| (1)| %| $| 22,973 | $| 21,652 | $| 1,321 | 6 | %  \n  \nCompensation, taxes and benefits\n\nCompensation, taxes and benefits of $3.5 million, decreased by $1.2 million, or 26%, for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from $4.7 million for the same period in 2023. The decrease is due primarily to a decrease in bonus and commissions expense related to the decrease in revenue. Sequentially, compensation, taxes and benefits decreased by $0.6 million, or 15%, from $4.2 million for the three months ended June 30, 2024 primarily due to lower payroll costs resulting from headcount reductions made effective July 1, 2024.\n\nCompensation, taxes and benefits of $12.2 million, decreased by $0.7 million, or 6%, for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from $12.9 million for the same period in 2023. The decrease is primarily due to a decrease in bonus and commission expense related to the decrease in revenue. \n\nOn July 1, 2024, we executed an internal reorganization plan that included a staff reduction, a pause on hiring and cost savings measures, which we anticipate will lower certain ongoing expenses, especially as the Company incurs additional one-time expenses to regain compliance with respect to delinquent SEC filings.\n\nGeneral and administrative expenses\n\nGeneral and administrative (“G&A”) expenses of $3.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 increased from $2.5 million for the same period in 2023. G&A expenses as a percentage of revenue was 40% and 4% for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, we incurred $1.1 million in costs to regain compliance with respect to delinquent SEC filings as well as $0.3 million higher legal expenses compared to the prior year. Sequentially, G&A expenses decreased by $0.2 million, or 5%, from $3.8 million for the three months ended June 30, 2024 primarily due to lower sales and marketing expenses, travel and franchise tax expense, partially offset by $0.9 million of higher compliance and legal costs.\n\nGeneral and administrative (“G&A”) expenses of $10.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased from $8.7 million for the same period in 2023. G&A expenses as a percentage of revenue was 20% and 8% for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we incurred $1.3 million in costs to regain compliance with respect to delinquent SEC filings, $0.4 million higher legal expenses and $0.4 million higher franchise tax expense.\n\nWe expect to continue to invest in and incur additional expenses associated with our operation as a public company, including increased professional fees, investment in automation, and compliance costs associated with developing the requisite infrastructure required for internal controls. However, on July 1, 2024, we executed an internal reorganization plan that included a staff reduction, a pause on hiring and cost savings measures, which we anticipate will lower certain ongoing expenses, especially as the Company ceases incurring additional one-time expenses to regain compliance with respect to delinquent SEC filings, which have now all been filed.\n\n37\n\n[Table of Contents](#i20ec97510e3b4e6bba093038fbf06538_7)\n\nOther income (expense), net\n\nThe following table sets forth the components of other income (expense), net for the periods presented (in thousands).\n\nThree Months EndedSeptember 30,| Change| Nine Months Ended September 30,| Change  \n---|---|---|---  \n2024| 2023| Amount| %| 2024| 2023| Amount| %  \nInterest expense| $| (1,413)| $| (1,060)| $| (353)| 33 | %| $| (4,068)| $| (3,104)| $| (964)| 31 | %  \nOther income| 99 | 83 | 16 | 19 | %| 190 | 175 | 15 | 9 | %  \nLoss on early termination of line of credit| — | — | — | nm| — | (300)| 300 | nm  \nDerecognition of tax receivable agreement liability| 5,201 | — | 5,201 | nm| 5,201 | — | 5,201 | nm  \nTotal other income (expense), net| $| 3,887 | $| (977)| $| 4,864 | nm| $| 1,323 | $| (3,229)| $| 4,552 | nm  \n  \nnm – not meaningful\n\nOther income (expense), net primarily includes $5.2 million relating to the derecognition of tax receivable agreement liability in connection with the full valuation allowance recorded on the Company’s deferred tax assets during the three months ended September 30, 2024. Other income (expense), net for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 also consists of $1.4 million and $1.1 million, respectively, of interest expense. Interest expense increased by $0.4 million due to additional net borrowings of $12.7 million under the Company’s credit facilities, as well as higher interest rates.\n\nOther income (expense), net for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 primarily includes $5.2 million relating to the derecognition of tax receivable agreement liability in connection with the full valuation allowance recorded on the Company’s deferred tax assets. Other income (expense), net also consists of $4.1 million and $3.1 million, respectively, of interest expense. Interest expense increased by $1.0 million due to additional net borrowings of $12.7 million under the Company’s credit facilities, as well as higher interest rates. Lastly, other income (expense), net for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 also includes $0.3 million related to the loss on early termination of the line of credit with SVB.\n\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\n\nGoing Concern\n\nAs discussed in Note 9 to the condensed consolidated financial statements, on May 10, 2024, the Company was the subject of a defamatory article / blog post which the Company believes was part of a coordinated misinformation campaign. In connection with this post, one of the Company’s sell-side customers paused its connection to the Company for a couple of weeks in May 2024, which reduced sell-side sales volumes. As of the date of this report, sell-side volumes related to this customer have resumed but not yet at the levels experienced prior to the pause in May 2024 which has created significant disruption in the Company’s sell-side business. The Company is actively working with its partners to achieve prior volume levels. However, there can be no assurance that the Company will be able to achieve prior volume levels with its partners or on the timing of achieving such volume levels. Additionally, the Company (1) incurred a net loss of $13.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 reflecting the impact of the sell-side disruption described above and a decrease in customer spend on the buy-side, (2) reported an accumulated deficit of $6.6 million as of September 30, 2024, (3) reported cash and cash equivalents of $4.1 million as of September 30, 2024, (4) has borrowed $9.7 million and $8.7 million, respectively, as of September 30, 2024 and the date of this report, under the Credit Agreement which matures in July 2025, (5) was notified on April 17, 2024 that the Company’s auditor had resigned, (6) was unable to timely file its 2023 annual report and quarterly reports for the first two quarters of 2024 and (7) was notified by Nasdaq on October 18, 2024 that it was not in compliance with Nasdaq's minimum stockholders' equity requirement. The delay in filing the Company’s annual and quarterly reports disrupted existing capital-raising efforts and created additional audit, legal and other expenses. These factors raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern over the next twelve months.\n\nThe Company anticipates sources of liquidity to include cash on hand and cash flow from operations and has taken several actions to address liquidity concerns. These actions include (1) a plan to reduce expenses through a staff reduction, a pause on hiring and cost savings measures that were executed on July 1, 2024, (2) working with lenders to provide temporary various relief from debt covenants (see Note 3 — Long-Term Debt in the condensed consolidated financial statements) while rebuilding sell-side volumes, (3) putting in place a program to raise capital through an equity reserve facility (see Note 4 - Stockholders' Deficit and Stock-Based Compensation in the condensed consolidated financial statements), (4) regaining compliance with respect to delinquent SEC filings on October 15, 2024 which will allow the Company to access the capital markets as well as other financing sources and (5) a plan to achieve compliance with \n\n38\n\n[Table of Contents](#i20ec97510e3b4e6bba093038fbf06538_7)\n\nNasdaq's minimum stockholders' equity requirement. There can be no assurance that the Company’s actions will be successful or that additional financing will be available when needed or on acceptable terms.\n\nSources of Liquidity\n\nThe following table summarizes our cash and cash equivalents, working capital, and availability under our Credit Agreement (as defined below) on September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 (in thousands):\n\nSeptember 30, 2024| December 31, 2023  \n---|---  \nCash and cash equivalents| $| 4,087 | $| 5,116   \nWorking capital (1)| $| (33,813)| $| 3,280   \nAvailability under Credit Agreement| $| 300 | $| 7,000   \n  \n(1) Working capital as of September 30, 2024 includes all amounts owed to Lafayette Square, which is shown as current portion of long term debt until a waiver or amendment is finalized with Lafayette Square. See Note 3 — Long-Term Debt in the notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements.\n\nTo fund our operations and service our debt thereafter and depending on our growth and results of operations, we may raise additional capital through the issuance of additional equity and/or debt, which could have the effect of diluting our stockholders. Any future equity or debt financings may be on terms which are not favorable to us. As our credit facilities become due, we will need to repay, extend or replace such indebtedness. Our ability to do so will be subject to future economic, financial, business and other factors, many of which are beyond our control.\n\nCredit Facilities\n\nThe terms and conditions of the various credit facilities we entered into are further described in Note 3 — Long-Term Debt in the notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements.\n\nEquity Reserve Facility\n\nThe terms and conditions of the equity reserve facility we entered into with New Circle are further described in Note 4 — Stockholders’ Deficit and Stock-Based Compensation in the notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements.\n\nHistorical Cash Flows:\n\nThe following table sets forth our cash flows for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 (in thousands):\n\nNine Months Ended September 30,  \n---  \n2024| 2023  \nNet cash (used in) provided by operating activities| $| (7,095)| $| 4,481   \nNet cash used in investing activities| (17)| (137)  \nNet cash provided by (used in) financing activities| 6,083 | (2,909)  \nNet (decrease) increase in cash and cash equivalents| $| (1,029)| $| 1,435   \n  \nOur cash and cash equivalents at September 30, 2024 were held for working capital and general corporate purposes. The decrease in cash and cash equivalents compared with September 30, 2023, primarily resulted from $7.1 million in cash flows used in operating activities partially offset by $6.1 million in cash flows provided by financing activities.\n\nOperating Activities\n\nFor the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023\n\nCash provided by operating activities has typically been generated from net income and by changes in our operating assets and liabilities, particularly in the areas of accounts receivable and accounts payable and accrued expenses, adjusted for certain non-cash and non-operating expense items such as depreciation, amortization, stock-based compensation and deferred income taxes.\n\nFor the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net cash flows used in operating activities were $7.1 million and consisted of net loss of $13.3 million, offset by $4.1 million in adjustments for non-cash and non-operating items and \n\n39\n\n[Table of Contents](#i20ec97510e3b4e6bba093038fbf06538_7)\n\n$2.1 million of cash inflows from working capital. Adjustments for non-cash and non-operating items mainly consisted of depreciation and amortization expense of $2.3 million, stock-based compensation expense of $0.8 million and deferred tax expense of $6.1 million partially offset by $5.2 million of derecognition of tax receivable agreement liability in connection with the full valuation allowance recorded on the Company’s deferred tax assets. The $2.1 million increase in cash resulting from changes in working capital primarily consisted of a $30.9 million decrease in accounts receivable, partially offset by a $27.5 million decrease in accounts payable and a $1.5 million decrease in accrued expenses such as payroll and payroll related expenses. The decrease in accounts payable and accounts receivable is mainly due to the May 2024 temporary disconnection by a significant customer as a result of a customer investigating a defamatory article / blog post against the Company, as well as a payment of $8.8 million to a few publishers associated with a charge recorded in 2023 related to a disputed short pay from a customer.\n\nFor the nine months ended September 30, 2023, net cash flows provided by operating activities were $4.5 million and mainly consisted of net income of $3.2 million and $3.2 million in adjustments for noncash and non-operating items, partially offset by $2.0 million of cash outflows from working capital. Adjustments for non-cash and non-operating items primarily consisted of depreciation and amortization expense of $2.2 million, stock-based compensation expense of $0.5 million and loss on early termination of line of credit of $0.3 million. The $2.0 million decrease in cash resulting from changes in working capital consisted primarily of a $28.4 million increase in accounts receivable and a $0.8 million decrease in accrued liabilities, offset by a $27.3 million increase in accounts payable. The increase in accounts receivable and accounts payable is mainly due to the seasonal nature of the sell-side segment of the business.\n\nInvesting Activities\n\nFor the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023\n\nOur investing activities to date have consisted primarily of purchases of software, office furniture and leasehold improvements. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, net cash flows used in investing activities of less than $0.1 million and $0.1 million, respectively, were primarily related to office furniture and leasehold improvements.\n\nFinancing Activities\n\nFor the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023\n\nFor the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net cash provided by financing activities was $6.1 million mainly resulting from $6.7 million of proceeds from line of credit and $0.2 million proceeds from warrants exercised partially offset by $0.6 million for payments on shares withheld for taxes and $0.4 million paid on term loan.\n\nFor the nine months ended September 30, 2023, net cash used in financing activities was $2.9 million mainly resulting from $2.0 million for distributions paid to LLC holders, $0.5 million paid on the term loan and $0.4 million for deferred financing costs.\n\nContractual Obligations and Future Cash Requirements\n\nAs of September 30, 2024, our principal contractual obligations expected to give rise to material cash requirements consist of the 2021 Credit Facility, the Credit Agreement and non-cancelable leases for our various facilities. After giving effect to the October 2024 amendments to the Company's debt facilities, we anticipate that the future minimum payments related to our current indebtedness over the next five years will be $1.0 million in 2024, $8.7 million in 2025, $28.2 million in 2026, less than $0.1 million in 2027, less than $0.1 million in 2028, and $0.1 million thereafter, assuming we do not refinance our indebtedness, enter into a new revolving credit facility or make any further draws under the revolving facility. The leases will require minimum payments of $0.1 million in 2024, $0.3 million in 2025, $0.3 million in 2026, $0.3 million in 2027, $0.2 million in 2028, and $0.2 million thereafter. As of September 30, 2024, we had cash and cash equivalents of $4.1 million.\n\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\n\nIn addition to our results determined in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”), including, in particular operating income, net cash provided by operating activities, and net income, we believe that earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, as adjusted for loss on early termination of line of credit, derecognition of tax receivable agreement liability and stock-based compensation (“Adjusted EBITDA”), a non-GAAP measure, is useful in evaluating our operating performance. The most directly comparable GAAP measure to Adjusted EBITDA is net income.\n\n40\n\n[Table of Contents](#i20ec97510e3b4e6bba093038fbf06538_7)\n\nThe following table presents a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to net (loss) income for each of the periods presented (in thousands):\n\nThree Months EndedSeptember 30,| Nine Months EndedSeptember 30,  \n---|---  \n2024| 2023| 2024| 2023  \nNet (loss) income| $| (6,377)| $| 3,351 | $| (13,338)| $| 3,212   \nAdd back (deduct):  \nInterest expense| 1,413 | 1,060 | 4,068 | 3,104   \nAmortization of intangible assets| 488 | 488 | 1,465 | 1,465   \nStock-based compensation| 149 | 242 | 811 | 546   \nDepreciation and amortization of property, equipment and software| 67 | 64 | 205 | 185   \nLoss on early termination of line of credit| — | — | — | 300   \nIncome tax expense| 6,606 | 166 | 6,132 | 166   \nDerecognition of tax receivable agreement liability| (5,201)| — | (5,201)| —   \nAdjusted EBITDA| $| (2,855)| $| 5,371 | $| (5,858)| $| 8,978   \n  \nIn addition to operating income and net income, we use Adjusted EBITDA as a measure of operational efficiency. We believe that this non-GAAP financial measure is useful to investors for period-to-period comparisons of our business and in understanding and evaluating our operating results for the following reasons:\n\n•Adjusted EBITDA is widely used by investors and securities analysts to measure a company’s operating performance without regard to items such as depreciation and amortization, interest expense, provision for income taxes, stock-based compensation, derecognition of tax receivable agreement liability, and certain one-time items such as acquisition transaction costs, losses from early termination or redemption of credit agreements or preferred units and gains from settlements or loan forgiveness that can vary substantially from company to company depending upon their financing, capital structures and the method by which assets were acquired;\n\n•Our management uses Adjusted EBITDA in conjunction with GAAP financial measures for planning purposes, including the preparation of our annual operating budget, as a measure of operating performance and the effectiveness of our business strategies and in communications with our board of directors concerning our financial performance; and\n\n•Adjusted EBITDA provides consistency and comparability with our past financial performance, facilitates period-to-period comparisons of operations, and also facilitates comparisons with other peer companies, many of which use similar non-GAAP financial measures to supplement their GAAP results.\n\nOur use of this non-GAAP financial measure has limitations as an analytical tool, and you should not consider it in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our financial results as reported under GAAP.\n\nCritical Accounting Estimates and Related Policies\n\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities and disclosure of contingent liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from these estimates. The Company bases its estimates on past experiences, market conditions, and other assumptions that the Company believes are reasonable under the circumstances, and the Company evaluates these estimates on an ongoing basis.\n\nThere have been no material changes to our critical accounting estimates and related policies as compared to the critical accounting estimates and related policies described in our \"Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\" set forth in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.\n\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\n\nSee Note 2 to our condensed consolidated financial statements for accounting pronouncements recently adopted and accounting pronouncements not yet adopted.\n\n41\n\n[Table of Contents](#i20ec97510e3b4e6bba093038fbf06538_7)\n\nITEM 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\n\nAs a “smaller reporting company,” we are not required to provide the information required by this Part I, Item 3.\n\nITEM 4. Controls and Procedures\n\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\n\nThe Company maintains disclosure controls and procedures (“Disclosure Controls”) as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our Exchange Act reports is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including the Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”) and Chief Financial Officer (“CFO”) as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. The Company conducted an evaluation (the “Evaluation”), under the supervision and with the participation of the CEO and CFO, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our Disclosure Controls as of September 30, 2024 pursuant to the Rules 13a-5(b) and 15d-15(b) of the Exchange Act. In designing and evaluating the Disclosure Controls, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives and management was required to apply judgement in evaluating its controls and procedures. Based on this Evaluation, due to the material weaknesses described below, the CEO and CFO concluded that the Company’s Disclosure Controls were not effective as of September 30, 2024.\n\nMaterial Weaknesses\n\nWe identified previously material weaknesses in our controls over the journal entry processes, information technology general controls (“ITGC”) and the technical evaluation of accounting matters that existed as of December 31, 2023. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal controls over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. The material weaknesses are a result of our processes and related controls not operating effectively related to journal entry processes, ITGC and the technical evaluation of accounting matters. As further detailed in Note 13 – Restatement (Unaudited) of the Company's consolidated financial statements included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, the Company identified prior year accounting errors in the Company’s previously reported unaudited interim consolidated financial statements beginning March 31, 2022 resulting from the incorrect (1) accounting for and presentation of noncontrolling interests (\"NCI\"), (2) recognition of an organizational transaction, (3) presentation of earnings per share considering the effect of certain features of the Company's warrants and the impact of correcting the accounting for, and presentation of NCI, and (4) timing of the recording of the 2023 redemption of warrants. The Company’s management and the audit committee of the Company’s Board of Directors concluded that it was appropriate to restate the quarterly unaudited consolidated financial statements for the quarterly periods ended March 31, 2023, June 30, 2023, and September 30, 2023.\n\nOther than the described above, there were no material misstatements as a result of these material weaknesses; however, it could have resulted in a material misstatement to the annual or interim financial statements that would not have been prevented or detected on a timely basis.\n\nManagement’s Plan to Remediate the Previously Reported Material Weaknesses\n\nManagement has implemented remediation steps to address the material weaknesses and to improve our internal controls. Specifically, in late 2023, the Company engaged consultants to assist with identifying and testing the design of controls over business processes as well as ITGC. The first phase of the project was completed in the first quarter of 2024. We are now in the process of enhancing the design of certain internal control procedures and implementing new internal controls over (1) the segregation of duties within the journal entry process, (2) the access to program and change management within our information technology environment, and (3) the evaluation of technical accounting matters. These controls are planned to be tested for design and operating effectiveness in future periods. The Company will continue the engagement with outside consultants to review the revised control processes and procedures.\n\nWhile the Company has implemented remediation steps, the material weaknesses cannot be considered fully remediated until the improved controls have been in place and operate for a sufficient period of time. However, our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has concluded that, notwithstanding the identified material weaknesses in our internal controls over financial reporting, the financial statements fairly present, in all material respects, our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows for the periods presented in conformity with U.S. GAAP.\n\n42\n\n[Table of Contents](#i20ec97510e3b4e6bba093038fbf06538_7)\n\nChanges in Internal Controls Over Financial Reporting\n\nOther than as discussed above, there were no changes in internal controls over financial reporting during the three months ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal controls system over financial reporting.\n\nPART II. Other Information\n\nITEM 1. Legal Proceedings\n\nWe may from time to time be subject to various legal or administrative claims and proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business. As of the date hereof, except as set forth below, we are not a party to any material legal or administrative proceedings nor are there any proceedings in which any of our directors, executive officers or affiliates, or any registered or beneficial stockholder, is an adverse party or has a material interest adverse to our interest. Litigation or any other legal or administrative proceeding, regardless of the outcome, is likely to result in substantial cost and diversion of our resources, including our management’s time and attention.\n\nOn May 10, 2024, the Company was the subject of a defamatory article / blog post which the Company believes was part of a coordinated misinformation campaign. In connection with this post, one of the Company’s sell-side customers paused its connection to the Company while the allegations were investigated. This customer reconnected the Company on May 22, 2024 and sell-side volumes have resumed but not yet at the levels experienced prior to the pause in May 2024. The Company is actively working with its partners to achieve prior volume levels. On May 14, 2024, the Company filed a lawsuit against the author of the defamatory article and is vigorously pursuing its rights. The Company cannot make any predictions about the final outcome of this litigation matter or the timing thereof.\n\nOn May 23, 2024, an alleged stockholder, purportedly on behalf of the persons or entities who purchased or acquired publicly traded securities of the Company between April 2023 and March 2024, filed a putative class action against the Company, certain of our officers and directors, and other defendants in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Texas, alleging violations of federal securities laws related to alleged false or misleading disclosures made by the Company in its public filings. On July 9, 2024, another alleged stockholder filed a similar securities class action against the Company, certain of our officers and directors, also in the Southern District of Texas. The two actions have been consolidated. Each of these complaints seeks unspecified damages, plus costs, fees, and attorneys’ fees. The Company cannot make any predictions about the final outcome of this matter or the timing thereof.\n\nITEM 1A. Risk Factors\n\nAs of the date of this Quarterly Report, other than the below, there have not been any material changes to the information related to the ITEM 1A. “Risk Factors” disclosure in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023. Our business involves significant risks. You should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described in our Annual Report, together with all of the other information in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, as well as our audited consolidated financial statements and related notes as disclosed in our Annual Report. The risks and uncertainties described below and in our Annual Report are not the only ones we face. Additional risks and uncertainties that we are unaware of or that we deem immaterial may also become important factors that adversely affect our business. The realization of any of these risks and uncertainties could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, business, financial condition, results of operations, growth and future prospects as well as our ability to accomplish our strategic objectives. In that event, the market price of our common stock could decline and you could lose part or all of your investment.\n\nIf we fail to satisfy applicable listing standards, including compliance with the rules requiring that our stockholders’ equity be at least $2.5 million, our common stock may be delisted from the Nasdaq Capital Market.\n\nOn October 18, 2024, we received the Letter from the Staff of Nasdaq notifying the Company that it was not in compliance with the minimum stockholders’ equity requirement for continued listing on The Nasdaq Capital Market under Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(b)(1). Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(b)(1) requires companies listed on The Nasdaq Capital Market to maintain stockholders’ equity of at least $2.5 million. The Company’s Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the periods ended June 30, 2024 and September 30, 2024 reported stockholders’ equity of negative $8.8 million and negative $13.3 million, respectively. The Letter further noted that as of the letter date, the Company did not have a market value of listed securities of $35 million, or net income from continued operations of $500,000 in the most recently completed fiscal year or in two of the last three most recently completed fiscal years, the alternative quantitative standards for continued listing on The Nasdaq Capital Market.\n\n43\n\n[Table of Contents](#i20ec97510e3b4e6bba093038fbf06538_7)\n\nNeither the notice from Nasdaq nor the Company’s non-compliance with the stockholders’ equity requirement has an immediate effect on the listing or trading of the Company’s securities on Nasdaq, which currently continues to trade on The Nasdaq Capital Market under the symbol “DRCT.”\n\nThere can be no assurances, however, that we will be successful in regaining compliance with the continued listing requirements and maintaining the listing of our common stock on the Nasdaq Capital Market. Delisting from the Nasdaq could adversely affect our ability to raise additional financing through the public or private sale of equity securities, would significantly affect the ability of investors to trade our securities and would negatively affect the value and liquidity of our common stock. Delisting could also have other negative results, including the potential loss of confidence by employees, the loss of institutional investor interest and fewer business development opportunities. If our common stock is delisted by the Nasdaq, the price of our common stock may decline and our common stock may be eligible to trade on the OTC Markets or other over-the-counter quotation system, where an investor may find it more difficult to dispose of their common stock or obtain accurate quotations as to the market value of our common stock. Further, if we are delisted, we would incur additional costs under requirements of state “blue sky” laws in connection with any sales of our securities. These requirements could severely limit the market liquidity of our common stock and the ability of our stockholders to sell our common stock in the secondary market.\n\nITEM 2.

AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Unaudited)\nNote 1 — Organization and Description of Business\nDirect Digital Holdings, Inc., incorporated as a Delaware corporation on August 23, 2021 and headquartered in Houston, Texas, together with its subsidiaries, operates an\nend-to-end, programmatic advertising platform primarily focused on providing advertising technology, data-driven campaign optimization and other solutions intended for\nunderserved and less efficient markets on both the sell- and buy-side of the digital advertising ecosystem. Direct Digital Holdings, Inc. is the holding company for Direct\nDigital Holdings, LLC (“DDH LLC”), which is, in turn, the holding company for the business formed by DDH LLC’s founders in 2018 through the acquisition of Colossus\nMedia, LLC (“Colossus Media”) and Huddled Masses, LLC (“Huddled Masses®” or “Huddled Masses”). Colossus Media operates the Company’s proprietary sell-side\nprogrammatic platform operating under the trademarked banner of Colossus SSPTM (“Colossus SSP”). In late September 2020, DDH LLC acquired Orange142, LLC (“Orange\n142”) to further bolster its overall programmatic buy-side advertising platform and to enhance its offerings across multiple industry verticals such as travel, healthcare,\neducation, financial services, consumer products, and other sectors with particular emphasis intended for small and mid-sized businesses transitioning into digital with growing\ndigital media budgets. In February 2022, Direct Digital Holdings, Inc. completed an initial public offering of its securities and, together with DDH LLC, effected a series of\ntransactions (together, the “Organizational Transactions”) whereby Direct Digital Holdings, Inc. became the sole managing member of DDH LLC, the holder of 100% of the\nvoting interests of DDH LLC and the holder of 19.7% of the economic interests of DDH LLC, commonly referred to as an “Up-C” structure. (See Note 6 — Related Party\nTransactions). In these condensed consolidated financial statements, the “Company,” “Direct Digital,” “Direct Digital Holdings,” “DDH,” “we,” “us” and “our” refer to Direct\nDigital Holdings, Inc., and, unless otherwise stated, all of its subsidiaries, including DDH LLC and its subsidiaries. All of the subsidiaries are incorporated in the state of\nDelaware, except for DDH LLC, which was formed under the laws of the State of Texas.\nDirect Digital Holdings, Inc. owns 100% of the voting interest in Direct Digital Holdings, LLC. As of September 30, 2024, DDH owns 25.9% of the economic interest in\nDirect Digital Holdings, LLC. See further discussion of the Up-C structure in Note 6 of our condensed consolidated financial statements. Direct Digital Holdings, LLC was\nformed on June 21, 2018 and acquired by DDH on February 15, 2022 in connection with the Organizational Transactions. Direct Digital Holdings, LLC’s wholly-owned\nsubsidiaries are as follows:\nCurrent % Business Date of\nSubsidiary Ownership Segment Date of Formation Acquisition\nColossus Media, LLC 100% Sell-side September 8, 2017 June 21, 2018\nOrange142, LLC 100% Buy-side March 6, 2013 September 30, 2020\nHuddled Masses, LLC 100% Buy-side November 13, 2012 June 21, 2018\nColossus SSP is a stand-alone platform intended to deliver targeted advertising to diverse and multicultural audiences as well as to general audiences. Both buy-side\nsubsidiaries, Orange 142 and Huddled Masses, offer technology-enabled advertising solutions and consulting services to clients through demand side platforms (“DSPs”).\nProviding both the front-end, buy-side operations coupled with the Company’s proprietary sell-side operations enables the Company to curate the first through the last mile\nin the ad tech ecosystem execution process to drive higher results.\nNote 2 — Basis of Presentation and Consolidation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\nBasis of presentation and consolidation\nThe accompanying condensed unaudited consolidated financial statements have been prepared by the Company in accordance with accounting principles generally\naccepted in the United States (“GAAP”) for interim financial reporting and as required by Rule 8-03 of Regulation S-X. Accordingly, the condensed unaudited consolidated\nfinancial statements may not include all of the information and notes required by GAAP for audited financial statements. The condensed consolidated balance sheet as of\nDecember 31, 2023 included herein was derived from audited financial statements but does not include all disclosures required by GAAP for complete financial statements. In\nthe opinion of the Company’s management, the accompanying condensed unaudited consolidated financial statements contain all adjustments, consisting of items of a normal\nand recurring nature, necessary to present fairly the Company’s financial position as of September 30, 2024, the results of its operations for the three and nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024 and 2023, cash flows for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, and stockholders’ deficit for the three and nine months ended\n7\nTable of Contents\nSeptember 30, 2024 and 2023. The results of operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, are not necessarily indicative of the results to be\nexpected for the full year. The preparation of condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions\nthat affect the amounts of assets and liabilities, and related disclosures, as of the date of the financial statements, and the amounts of revenues and expenses reported during the\nperiod. Actual results could differ from estimates. The accompanying condensed unaudited consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the Company’s\naudited financial statements and the accompanying notes for the year ended December 31, 2023, which was included in Form 10-K filed with the SEC on October 15, 2024.\nThe condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Direct Digital Holdings, Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiaries. All material intercompany\naccounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.\nThe Company is an emerging growth company, as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (the “JOBS Act”). Under the JOBS Act, emerging growth\ncompanies can delay adopting new or revised accounting standards otherwise applicable to public companies until such time as those standards apply to private companies. The\nCompany has elected to use this extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards that have different effective dates for public and private\ncompanies until the earlier of the date that it (i) is no longer an emerging growth company or (ii) it affirmatively and irrevocably opts out of the extended transition period\nprovided in the JOBS Act. As a result, these condensed consolidated financial statements may not be comparable to companies that comply with the new or revised accounting\npronouncements as of public company effective dates. The adoption dates discussed below reflect this election.\nRevenue recognition\nThe Company recognizes revenue using the following five steps: 1) identification of a contract with a customer; 2) identification of the performance obligation(s) in the\ncontract; 3) determination of the transaction price; 4) allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligation(s) in the contract; and 5) recognition of revenue when, or\nas, the performance obligation(s) are satisfied. The Company’s revenues are derived primarily from two sources: sell-side advertising and buy-side advertising. Thus, the\nCompany disaggregates the revenue earned into these two segments. For additional segment disclosures, refer to Note 7 — Segment Information of our condensed consolidated\nfinancial statements. The Company maintains agreements with its customers in the form of written service agreements, which set out the terms of the relationship, including\npayment terms (typically 30 to 90 days).\nFor the sell-side advertising segment, the Company generates revenue by selling advertising inventory (digital ad units) that the Company purchases from publishers to\nadvertisers through a process of monetizing ad impressions on the Company’s proprietary sell-side programmatic platform operating under the trademarked banner Colossus\nSSP. For the buy-side advertising segment, the Company generates revenue from customers that enter into agreements with the Company to provide managed advertising\ncampaigns, which include digital marketing and media services to purchase digital advertising space, data and other add-on features.\nIn connection with the Company’s analysis of principal vs agent considerations, the Company has evaluated the specified goods or services and considered whether the\nCompany controls the goods or services before they are provided to the customer, including the three indicators of control. Based upon this analysis and the Company’s specific\nfacts and circumstances, the Company concluded that it is a principal for the goods or services sold through both the Company’s sell-side advertising segment and buy-side\nadvertising segment because the Company controls the specified good or service before it is transferred to the customer and the Company is the primary obligor in the\nagreement with customers. Therefore, the Company reports revenue on a gross basis inclusive of all supplier costs and pays suppliers for the cost of digital media, advertising\ninventory, data and any add-on services or features.\nIn the advertising industry, companies commonly experience seasonal fluctuations in revenue. For example, in our sell-side advertising segment, many advertisers allocate\nthe largest portion of their budgets to the fourth quarter of the calendar year in order to coincide with increased holiday purchasing while, in our buy-side segment, the second\nand third quarters of the year reflect our highest levels of advertising activity and the first quarter reflects the lowest level of such activity.\nSell-side advertising\nThe Company partners with publishers to sell advertising inventory to the Company’s Colossus Media-curated clients and the open markets (collectively referred to as\n“buyers”) seeking to access the general market as well as unique multi-cultural audiences. The Company generates revenue from the delivery of targeted digital media\nsolutions, enabling\n8\nTable of Contents\nadvertisers to connect intelligently with their audiences across online display, video, social and mobile mediums using its proprietary programmatic sell-side platform (“SSP”).\nThe Company refers to its publishers, app developers, and channel partners collectively as its \"publishers.\" The Company’s platform allows the Company to sell, in real time,\nad impressions from publishers to buyers and provides automated inventory management and monetization tools to publishers across various device types and digital ad\nformats. The Company recognizes revenue at a point in time when an ad is delivered or displayed in response to a winning bid request from ad buyers.\nBuy-side advertising\nThe Company purchases media based on the budget established by its customers with a focus on leveraging data services, customer branding, real-time market analysis and\nmicro-location advertising. The Company offers its services on a fully managed basis, which is recognized over time using the output method when the performance obligation\nis fulfilled. An “impression” is delivered when an advertisement appears on pages viewed by users. The performance obligation is satisfied over time as the volume of\nimpressions are delivered up to the contractual maximum. Many customers run several different campaigns throughout the year to capitalize on different seasons, special events\nand other happenings at their respective regions and localities. The Company provides digital advertising and media buying capabilities with a focus on generating measurable\ndigital and financial life for its customers.\nRevenue arrangements are evidenced by a fully executed insertion order (“IO”) and/or a master service agreement (“MSA”) covering a combination of marketing tactics.\nGenerally, IOs specify the number and type of advertising impressions to be delivered over a specified time at an agreed upon price and performance objectives for an ad\ncampaign. Performance objectives are generally a measure of targeting, as defined by the parties in advance, such as number of ads displayed, consumer clicks on ads or\nconsumer actions (which may include qualified leads, registrations, downloads, inquiries or purchases). These payment models are commonly referred to as CPM (cost per\nimpression), CPC (cost per click) and CPA (cost per action). The majority of the Company’s contracts are flat-rate, fee-based contracts.\nCash payments received prior to the Company’s delivery of its services are recorded to deferred revenue until the performance obligation is satisfied. The Company\nrecorded deferred revenue (contract liabilities) to account for billings in excess of revenue recognized, primarily related to contractual minimums billed in advance and\ncustomer prepayment, of $1.0 million and $0.4 million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. Revenue recognized during the nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024 and 2023 from amounts included within the deferred revenue balances at the beginning of each respective period amounted to $0.4 million and\n$0.5 million, respectively.\nAccounting Standards Codification (\"ASC\") 606 provides various optional practical expedients. The Company elected the use of the practical expedient relating to the\ndisclosure of remaining performance obligations within a contract and will not disclose remaining performance obligations for contracts with an original expected duration of\none year or less.\nGoodwill\nAs of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, goodwill was $6.5 million, which includes $2.4 million as a result of the acquisition of Huddled Masses and Colossus\nMedia in 2018 and $4.1 million from the acquisition of Orange 142 in 2020. The Company expects to deduct goodwill for tax purposes in future years. Goodwill is attributable\nto entry into new markets not previously accessible and generation of future growth opportunities. Goodwill is assessed for impairment at least annually (December 31) starting\nwith a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit containing goodwill is less than its carrying value. This\nqualitative assessment may include, but is not limited to, reviewing factors such as macroeconomic conditions, industry and market considerations, cost factors, entity-specific\nfinancial performance and other events, such as changes in our management, strategy and primary user base. If the Company determines that it is more likely than not that the\nfair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value, then a quantitative goodwill impairment analysis is performed. Depending upon the results of the quantitative\nmeasurement, the recorded goodwill may be written down and an impairment expense is recorded in the condensed consolidated statements of operations when the carrying\namount of the reporting unit exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit. Goodwill is reviewed annually and tested for impairment upon the occurrence of a triggering event.\nThe Company determined that there was no impairment of goodwill during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023.\nIntangible assets, net\nIntangible assets consist of customer relationships, trademarks and non-compete agreements. Intangible assets are recorded at fair value at the time of their acquisition and\nare stated within the condensed consolidated balance sheets net of accumulated amortization. Intangible assets are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful\nlives and recorded as amortization expense within general and administrative expenses in the condensed consolidated statements of\n9\nTable of Contents\noperations. The Company’s intangible assets are being amortized over their estimated useful lives, using the straight-line method with non-compete agreements over 5 years\nand other intangibles over 10 years.\nImpairment of long-lived assets\nThe Company evaluates the recoverability of long-lived assets, including property, equipment and software costs and intangible assets if facts or circumstances indicate\nthat any of those assets might be impaired. ASC 360-10-15 requires the Company to group assets and liabilities at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely\nindependent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities and evaluate the asset group against the sum of the undiscounted future cash flows to determine if a write-down to\nfair value is necessary. No impairment loss was recognized during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023.\nStock-based compensation\nStock-based compensation cost for options and restricted stock units (“RSU”) awarded to employees and directors is measured at the grant date based on the calculated fair\nvalue of the award and is recognized as an expense over the requisite service period (generally the vesting period of the equity grant). Contingently issued awards with a\nrequisite service period that precedes the grant date are measured and recognized at the start of the requisite service period and remeasured each reporting period until the grant\ndate.\nThe Company estimates the fair value of RSU’s based on the closing price of the Company’s common stock on the date of the grant. The Company estimates the fair value\nof stock options using the Black-Scholes valuation model. Key input assumptions used to estimate the fair value of stock options include the fair value of the Company’s\ncommon stock, as well as assumptions regarding the expected common stock price volatility over the term of the stock options, the expected term of the stock options, risk-free\ninterest rates and the expected dividend yield. Given the Company's short history as a public company, the expected volatility is determined based on the trading history of\nseveral unrelated public companies within the industry that the Company considers to be comparable and the expected term is determined based on a combination of the terms\nof stock options and peer data. The risk-free interest rate is derived using the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at date of grant. Other assumptions are based on historical\nexperience and activity. The Company considers an estimated forfeiture rate for stock options based on historical experience and the anticipated forfeiture rates during the\nfuture contract life.\nIncome taxes\nIn February 2022, concurrent with the Organizational Transactions, the Company entered into a tax receivable agreement (“Tax Receivable Agreement” or “TRA”) with\nDDH LLC and Direct Digital Management, LLC (“DDM”). The TRA provides for certain income (loss) allocations between the Company and DDH LLC under the agreement.\nDDH LLC is a limited liability company, is treated as a partnership for federal income tax purposes and generally is not subject to any entity-level U.S. federal income tax and\ncertain state and local income taxes. Any taxable income or loss generated by the Company is allocated to holders of LLC units (“LLC Units”) in accordance with the Second\nAmended and Restated Limited Liability Company Agreement (“LLC Agreement”), and distributions to the owners of LLC Units in an amount sufficient to fund their tax\nobligations. The Company is subject to U.S. federal income taxes, in addition to state and local income taxes with respect to its allocable share of any taxable income or loss\nunder the LLC Agreement. Pursuant to the Company’s election under Section 754 of the Internal Revenue Code (the “Code”), the Company expects to obtain an increase in its\nshare of the tax basis in the net assets of DDH, LLC when LLC Units are redeemed or exchanged by the members of DDH, LLC. The Company made an election under Section\n754 of the Code for each taxable year in which a redemption or exchange of LLC interest occurred. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, members of\nDDM exchanged no shares of Class B Common Stock into shares of Class A Common Stock.\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and are measured using the enacted\ntax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse. A valuation allowance is established when it is more likely than not that some portion or all\nof the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The establishment of a valuation allowance requires significant judgment and is impacted by various estimates. Both positive and\nnegative evidence, as well as the objectivity and verifiability of that evidence, is considered in determining the appropriateness of recording a valuation allowance on deferred\ntax assets. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company recorded a valuation allowance of $7.3 million and $0.5 million, respectively.\n10\nTable of Contents\nAccounts receivable, net\nAccounts receivable primarily consists of billed amounts for products and services rendered to customers under normal trade terms. The Company performs credit\nevaluations of its customers’ financial condition and generally does not require collateral. Accounts receivable are stated at net realizable value. The Company insures a\nsignificant portion of its accounts receivable with unrelated third-party insurance companies in an effort to mitigate any future write-offs and establishes provision for credit\nlosses as deemed necessary for accounts not covered by this insurance. Management periodically reviews outstanding accounts receivable for reasonableness. If warranted, the\nCompany processes a claim with the third-party insurance company to recover uncollected balances, rather than writing the balances off to bad debt expense. The guaranteed\nrecovery for the claim is approximately 90% of the original balance, and if the full amount is collected by the insurance company, the remaining 10% is remitted to the\nCompany. If the insurance company is unable to collect the full amount, the Company records the remaining 10% to bad debt expense. The Company’s provision for credit\nlosses reflects the current expected credit loss inherent in the accounts receivable considering the Company’s aging analysis, historical collection experience, customer\ncreditworthiness, current and future economic conditions and market conditions. Accounts receivable balances are written off against the provision when the Company believes\nit is probable the receivable will not be recovered. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company's provision for credit losses net of recoveries, as\nreflected in the condensed consolidated statements of cash flows was less than $0.1 million.\nConcentrations of customers and suppliers\nThere is an inherent concentration of credit risk associated with accounts receivable arising from revenue from major customers on both the sell-side and buy-side of the\nbusiness. For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, one buy-side customer represented 12% and one sell-side customer represented 82% of revenues,\nrespectively. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, one sell-side customer represented 52% and 72% of revenues, respectively. As of September 30, 2024\nand December 31, 2023, three customers and one customer accounted for 35% and 83%, respectively, of accounts receivable.\nAs of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, one vendor and three sellers of advertising inventory each accounted for at least 10%, and collectively accounted for\n17% and 77%, respectively, of consolidated accounts payable.\nAccrued Liabilities\nThe components of accrued liabilities on the balance sheet as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 are as follows (in thousands):\nSeptember 30, December 31,\n2024 2023\nAccrued compensation and benefits $ 277 $ 2,789\nAccrued expenses 534 631\nAccrued severance — 189\nAccrued litigation settlement (1) — 171\nAccrued interest 70 36\nTotal accrued liabilities $ 881 $ 3,816\n(1) In July 2022, the Company entered into a litigation settlement agreement with a vendor of Huddled Masses related to a delinquent balance from 2019 and agreed to pay\na total of $0.5 million with monthly installment payments over 24 months beginning September 1, 2022.\nCash and cash equivalents\nCash and cash equivalents consist of funds deposited with financial institutions and highly liquid instruments with original maturities of three months or less. Such deposits\nmay, at times, exceed federally insured limits. The risk of loss attributable to any uninsured balances is mitigated by depositing funds only in high credit quality financial\ninstitutions. The Company has not experienced any losses in such amounts and believes it is not exposed to any significant credit risk to cash.\n11\nTable of Contents\nDeferred offering costs\nThe Company records certain legal, accounting and other third-party fees that are directly associated with an offering to stockholders’ equity or debt in the event that the\nCompany completes an offering. Costs associated with debt offerings are amortized to interest expense using the straight-line method over the life of the debt. As of\nSeptember 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, $1.3 million and $1.7 million, respectively, of unamortized deferred financing costs are netted against debt in the condensed\nconsolidated balance sheets. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, $0.1 million and $0.2 million, respectively, of unamortized deferred issuance costs are\nclassified as prepaid expenses and other current assets in the condensed consolidated balance sheets.\nFair value measurements\nThe Company employs a hierarchy which prioritizes the inputs used to measure recurring fair value into three distinct categories based on the lowest level of input that is\nsignificant to the fair value measurement. The methodology for categorizing assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value pursuant to this hierarchy gives the highest\npriority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets and the lowest levels to unobservable inputs, summarized as follows:\n• Level 1 – Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.\n• Level 2 – Other significant observable inputs (including quoted prices in active markets for similar assets or liabilities).\n• Level 3 – Significant unobservable inputs (including our own assumptions in determining fair value).\nWe use the cost, income or market valuation approaches to estimate the fair value of our assets and liabilities when insufficient market-observable data is available to\nsupport our valuation assumptions.\nFair value of financial instruments\nThe Company considers the fair value of all financial instruments, including cash, accounts receivable and accounts payable to approximate their carrying values at year-\nend due to their short-term nature. The carrying value of the Company’s debt approximates fair value due to the market rates of interest.\nNet income (loss) per share\nBasic net income (loss) per share excludes dilution and is determined by dividing net income (loss) by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding\nincluding participating securities during the period. Diluted net income (loss) per share reflects the potential dilution that could occur if securities and other contracts to issue\ncommon stock were exercised or converted into common stock.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nAccounting pronouncements adopted\nNo standards have been adopted which have had a material impact on the Company’s condensed consolidated financial statements.\nAccounting pronouncements not yet adopted\nIn December 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the “FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (\"ASU\") 2023-09, Improvements to Income Tax\nDisclosures, a final standard on improvements to income tax disclosures. The standard requires disaggregated information about a reporting entity's effective tax rate\nreconciliation as well as information on income taxes paid. The standard is intended to benefit investors by providing more detailed income tax disclosures that would be useful\nin making capital allocation decisions and applies to all entities subject to income taxes. The new standard is effective for emerging growth companies for annual periods\nbeginning after December 15, 2025. This accounting standard is effective in the first quarter of the Company's fiscal year ending December 31, 2026. The Company is currently\nevaluating the impact of adoption on our financial disclosures.\nIn November 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic 280) - Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures. The ASU requires that an entity\ndisclose significant segment expenses impacting profit and loss that are regularly provided to the Company's chief operating decision maker (\"CODM\"). The update is required\nto be applied\n12\nTable of Contents\nretrospectively to prior periods presented, based on the significant segment expense categories identified and disclosed in the period of adoption. The amendments in this ASU\nare required to be adopted for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024. Early adoption is\npermitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adoption on our financial disclosures.\nOther accounting standards that have been issued or proposed by the FASB or other standards-setting bodies that do not require adoption until a future date are not\nexpected to have a material impact on the Company’s condensed consolidated financial statements.\nLiquidity and capital resources\nGoing Concern\nThe Company evaluated whether relevant conditions or events, considered in the aggregate, raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going\nconcern. Substantial doubt exists when conditions and events, considered in the aggregate, indicate it is probable that a company will not be able to meet its obligations as they\nbecome due within one year after the issuance date of its financial statements. Management’s assessment is based on the relevant conditions that are known or reasonably\nknowable as of the date these condensed consolidated financial statements were issued or were available to be issued.\nAs discussed in Note 9, one of the Company’s sell-side customers paused its connection to the Company for a couple of weeks in May 2024, which reduced sell-side sales\nvolumes. As of the date of this report, sell-side volumes related to this customer have resumed but not yet at the levels experienced prior to the pause in May 2024 which has\ncreated significant disruption in the Company’s sell-side business. The Company is actively working with its partners to achieve prior volume levels. However, there can be no\nassurance that the Company will be able to achieve prior volume levels with its partners or on the timing of achieving such volume levels. Additionally, the Company (1)\nincurred a net loss of $13.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 reflecting the impact of the sell-side disruption described above and a decrease in customer\nspend on the buy-side, (2) reported an accumulated deficit of $6.6 million as of September 30, 2024, (3) reported cash and cash equivalents of $4.1 million as of September 30,\n2024, (4) has borrowed $9.7 million and $8.7 million, respectively, as of September 30, 2024 and the date of this report, under the Credit Agreement which matures in July\n2025, (5) was notified on April 17, 2024 that the Company’s auditor had resigned, (6) was unable to timely file its 2023 annual report and quarterly reports for the first two\nquarters of 2024 and (7) was notified by Nasdaq on October 18, 2024 that it was not in compliance with Nasdaq's minimum stockholders' equity requirements. The delay in\nfiling the Company’s annual and quarterly reports disrupted existing capital-raising efforts and created additional audit, legal and other expenses. These factors raise substantial\ndoubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern over the next twelve months.\nThe Company anticipates sources of liquidity to include cash on hand and cash flow from operations and has taken several actions to address liquidity concerns. These\nactions include (1) a plan to reduce expenses through a staff reduction, a pause on hiring and cost savings measures that were executed on July 1, 2024, (2) working with\nlenders to provide temporary various relief from debt covenants (see Note 3 — Long-Term Debt) while rebuilding sell-side volumes, (3) putting in place a program to raise\ncapital through an equity reserve facility (see Note 4 — Stockholders’ Deficit and Stock-Based Compensation), (4) regaining compliance with respect to delinquent SEC filings\non October 15, 2024 which will allow the Company to access the capital markets as well as other financing sources and (5) a plan to achieve compliance with Nasdaq's\nminimum stockholders' equity requirements. There can be no assurance that the Company’s actions will be successful or that additional financing will be available when needed\nor on acceptable terms.\nThe accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming the Company will continue to operate as a going concern, which\ncontemplates the realization of assets and settlement of liabilities in the normal course of business, and do not include any adjustments to reflect the possible future effects on\nthe recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts and classifications of liabilities that may result from uncertainty related to its ability to continue as a going concern.\n13\nTable of Contents\nNote 3 — Long-Term Debt\nAt September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, long-term debt consisted of the following (in thousands):\nSeptember 30, 2024 December 31, 2023\n2021 Credit Facility $ 28,221 $ 28,594\nCredit Agreement 9,700 3,000\nEconomic Injury Disaster Loan 150 150\nTotal debt 38,071 31,744\nLess: deferred financing costs (1,254) (1,688)\nTotal debt, net of deferred financing costs 36,817 30,056\nLess: current portion (36,667) (1,478)\nTotal long-term debt, net of current portion $ 150 $ 28,578\nThe components of interest expense and related fees for long-term debt is as follows (in thousands):\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nInterest expense – Lafayette Square $ 1,020 $ 896 $ 2,975 $ 2,665\nInterest expense – East West Bank 206 — 531 —\nInterest expense – other 1 1 4 4\nAmortization of deferred financing costs 186 163 558 435\nTotal interest expense and amortization of deferred financing costs $ 1,413 $ 1,060 $ 4,068 $ 3,104\nLafayette Square\nOn December 3, 2021, the Company entered into the Term Loan and Security Agreement (the “2021 Credit Facility”) with Lafayette Square Loan Services, LLC\n(\"Lafayette Square\") as administrative agent, and the various lenders thereto. The term loan under the 2021 Credit Facility initially provided for a term loan in the principal\namount of up to $32.0 million, consisting of a $22.0 million closing date term loan (the \"Term Loan\") and an up to $10.0 million delayed draw term loan (the “Delayed Draw\nLoan”). The loans under the 2021 Credit Facility originally bore interest at LIBOR plus the applicable margin minus any applicable impact discount. The applicable margin\nunder the 2021 Credit Facility was determined based on the consolidated total net leverage ratio of the Company and its consolidated subsidiaries, at a rate of 6.50% per annum\nif the consolidated total net leverage ratio is less than 2.00 to 1.00 and up to 9.00% per annum if the consolidated total net leverage ratio was greater than 4.00 to 1.00. On June\n1, 2023, as originally contemplated under the 2021 Credit Facility, the Company entered into an agreement with Lafayette Square to convert the existing LIBOR based rate to a\nTerm Secured Overnight Financing Rate (\"SOFR\") with a credit spread of 0.15% per annum for the interest periods of three months and providing for a credit spread\nadjustment of 0.10%, 0.15% or 0.25% per annum for interest periods of one month, three months or six months, respectively. The loans under the 2021 Credit Facility bear\ninterest at SOFR plus the applicable credit spread adjustment plus the applicable margin minus any applicable impact discount. Prior to entering into the Fifth Amendment as\ndefined below, the applicable margin under the 2021 Credit Facility was based on the consolidated total net leverage ratio of the Company at a rate of 7.00% per annum if the\nconsolidated total net leverage ratio was less than or equal to 1.00 to 1.00 with gradual increases as the ratio increased up to 10.00% per annum if the consolidated total net\nleverage ratio was greater than 3.50 to 1.00. The maturity date of the 2021 Credit Facility is December 3, 2026.\nOn July 28, 2022, the Company entered into the Second Amendment and Joinder to Term Loan and Security Agreement and received proceeds of $4.3 million borrowed\nunder the Delayed Draw Loan to pay the balance owed on the common unit redemption as well as costs associated with the transaction.\nSubsequently, on October 3, 2023, the Company entered into the Fourth Amendment to the 2021 Credit Facility (the “Fourth Amendment”) and received proceeds of\n$3.6 million borrowed under the Delayed Draw Loan to make payments in connection with the consummation of the 2023 warrant tender offer and fees and expenses incurred\nas described in Note 4 — Stockholders’ Deficit and Stock-Based Compensation in the notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements. In\n14\nTable of Contents\nconnection with the Fourth Amendment, the Company agreed it would not be permitted to request any additional funds under the Delayed Draw Loan, and Lafayette Square\nwould not be obligated to fund any such requests.\nQuarterly installment payments on the Term Loan and the Delayed Draw Loan, due on the last day of each fiscal quarter, began March 31, 2022 with a final installment due\nDecember 3, 2026 for remaining balances outstanding under each loan. Each quarterly installment payment under the closing date term loan was $0.1 million from January 1,\n2022 through December 31, 2023, and each installment payment thereafter until maturity is $0.3 million. Each quarterly installment payment under the Delayed Draw Loan\nwas 0.625% of the amount of the Delayed Draw Loan through December 31, 2023, and each installment payment thereafter until maturity is 1.25% of the amount of the\nDelayed Draw Loan.\nUnder the 2021 Credit Facility, dividends and distributions by DDH LLC to the Company and any shareholders of the Company are permitted so long as (i) no default or\nevent of default is continuing or would occur after giving pro forma effect to such dividends and distributions under the 2021 Credit Facility, (ii) the Company, on a pro forma\nbasis, maintains a consolidated senior net leverage ratio of not greater than 1.5 to 1.0, and (iii) the Company, on a pro forma basis, maintains liquidity of not less than\n$15.0 million. The Company did not meet these conditions as of September 30, 2024 and therefore DDH LLC assets are considered restricted and no dividends or distributions\nto the Company and any shareholders is permitted while these conditions are not met.\nThe obligations under the 2021 Credit Facility are secured by senior, first-priority liens on all or substantially all assets of the Company. As of September 30, 2024, the\nCompany owed a balance on the 2021 Credit Facility of $28.2 million. No additional deferred financing costs were incurred during the nine months ended September 30, 2024\nand less than $0.1 million of additional deferred financing costs were incurred during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Unamortized deferred financing costs as of\nSeptember 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 were $1.3 million and $1.7 million respectively. Accrued and unpaid interest was less than $0.1 million as of September 30, 2024\nand December 31, 2023. The 2021 Credit Facility contains customary affirmative and negative covenants. Prior to entering into the Fifth Amendment, the Company was\nrequired to maintain a net leverage ratio of no more than 3.50 to 1.00 as of December 31, 2021 and the last day of each fiscal quarter through December 31, 2023, 3.25 to 1.00\nas of March 31, 2024 and the last day of each fiscal quarter through March 31, 2025, 3.00 to 1.00 as of June 30, 2025 and September 30, 2025, with incremental tightening of\nthe ratio to 2.50 to 1.00 as of June 30, 2026 and thereafter through maturity. Prior to entering into the Fifth Amendment, the 2021 Credit Facility also required the Company to\nmaintain a fixed charge coverage ratio of not less than 1.50 to 1.00 as of the last day of each fiscal quarter, as well as restrictions on the ability to incur indebtedness, create\ncertain liens, make certain investments, make certain dividends and other types of distributions, and enter into or undertake certain mergers, consolidations, acquisitions and\nsales of certain assets and subsidiaries.\nOn October 15, 2024, with an effective date of June 30, 2024, the Company and Lafayette Square entered into the Fifth Amendment to the Term Loan and Security\nAgreement (the “Fifth Amendment”) which among other things, (1) defers quarterly installment payments on the Term Loan and the Delayed Draw Loan for the periods from\nJune 30, 2024 through December 31, 2025, (2) requires that the Company pay a commitment fee of 50 basis points or an amount of $0.1 million to Lafayette Square, (3) allows\nproceeds from future equity raises by the Company, if any, to cure potential financial covenant noncompliance, (4) provides for one-month and three-month interest periods, (5)\nreplaces the calculation of the consolidated total net leverage ratio with a consolidated total leverage ratio for purposes of calculating the applicable margin and the financial\ncovenant and (6) replaces the financial covenants under the 2021 Credit Facility (effective as of June 30, 2024) with the following:\n15\nTable of Contents\nMinimum TTM* EBITDA ($ in Minimum Liquidity ($ in Maximum Consolidated Total Minimum Fixed Charge\nAs of millions) millions) Leverage Ratio Coverage Ratio\nJune 30, 2024 n/a n/a n/a n/a\nSeptember 30, 2024 $5.0 $1.5 n/a n/a\nDecember 31, 2024 $3.5 $1.5 n/a n/a\nMarch 31, 2025 $5.5 $2.0 n/a n/a\nJune 30, 2025 $7.5 $2.0 n/a 1.50 to 1.00\nSeptember 30, 2025 n/a $2.0 4.25 to 1.00 1.50 to 1.00\nDecember 31, 2025 n/a $2.0 4.00 to 1.00 1.50 to 1.00\nMarch 31, 2026 n/a $2.0 3.75 to 1.00 1.50 to 1.00\nJune 30, 2026 n/a $2.0 3.50 to 1.00 1.50 to 1.00\nSeptember 30, 2026 n/a $2.0 3.25 to 1.00 1.50 to 1.00\n* TTM = Trailing Twelve Months\nThe Company was in compliance with all the financial covenants under the 2021 Credit Facility as of September 30, 2024 after giving effect to the amendments to the\n2021 Credit Facility under the Fifth Amendment, except for the minimum trailing twelve months EBITDA covenant. The Company is in discussion with Lafayette Square to\nwaive the current non-compliance with the financial covenant. While the Company expects to negotiate an acceptable resolution, there can be no assurance that it will be able to\nnegotiate a waiver or an amendment, or that such waiver or amendment will be on terms acceptable to the Company. If the Company is unable to obtain a waiver from or enter\ninto an amendment with Lafayette Square, it could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and our ability to execute our business plan. Because of the non-\ncompliance, the debt under the 2021 Credit Facility is classified as current as of September 30, 2024.\n2023 Revolving Line of Credit - East West Bank\nOn July 7, 2023, the Company entered into a Credit Agreement (as amended, the “Credit Agreement”), with East West Bank (“EWB”), as lender. The Credit Agreement\nprovides for a revolving credit facility in the principal amount of up to $10 million, subject to a borrowing base determined based on eligible accounts, and an up to $5 million\nuncommitted incremental revolving facility. Loans under the Credit Agreement mature on July 7, 2025 (the “Maturity Date”), unless the Credit Agreement is otherwise\nterminated pursuant to the terms of the Credit Agreement.\nBorrowings under the Credit Agreement bear interest at a rate per annum equal to the one-month Term SOFR rate and as determined by EWB on the first day of the\napplicable interest period, plus 0.10% (10 basis points), plus 3.00% per annum (the “Loan Rate”); provided, that, in no event shall the Loan Rate be less than 0.50% of the Loan\nRate effective as of the date of the Credit Agreement nor more than the maximum rate of interest allowed under applicable law. Upon an event of default under the Credit\nAgreement, the outstanding principal amounts of any advances will accrue interest at a rate per annum equal to the Loan Rate plus five percent (5%), but in no event in excess\nof the maximum rate of interest allowed under applicable law.\nAt the Company’s option, the Company may at any time prepay the outstanding principal balance of the Credit Agreement in whole or in part, without fee, penalty or\npremium. All accrued but unpaid interest on outstanding advances under the Credit Agreement are payable in monthly installments on the last day of each monthly interest\nperiod until the Maturity Date when the then-outstanding principal balance of the advances and all accrued but unpaid interest thereon becomes due and payable. The\nobligations under the Credit Agreement are secured by all or substantially all of the borrowers’ assets.\nPrior to entering into the Third Amendment as defined below, the Company was required to maintain compliance at all times with the following financial covenants on a\nconsolidated basis: (i) a fixed charge coverage ratio of not less than 1.25 to 1.0, beginning with the fiscal quarter ended on June 30, 2023 and at the end of each fiscal quarter\nthereafter; (ii) a total funded debt-to-EBITDA ratio of no more than 3.50 to 1.00 as of June 30, 2023 and the last day of each fiscal quarter through December 31, 2023, 3.25 to\n1.00 as of March 31, 2024 and the last day of each fiscal quarter through March 31, 2025 and 3.00 to 1.00 as of June 30, 2025 and thereafter through maturity; and (iii) a\nliquidity covenant requiring the Company to maintain minimum liquid assets at all times (calculated in the manner provided for in the Credit Agreement), in one or more\naccounts held with EWB plus Revolving Credit Availability in the amount of $1.0 million. Revolving Credit Availability is defined as an amount such that the ratio of the value\nof eligible accounts to the aggregate amount of all outstanding advances under the credit agreement at such time is not less than 2.0 to 1.0. Additionally, the amounts\n16\nTable of Contents\noutstanding under the Credit Agreement exceeded the Company’s borrowing base as of June 30, 2024 by $0.5 million which was addressed in the Third Amendment, requiring\na $1.0 million principal payment on the outstanding loans under the Credit Agreement as of the date of the Third Amendment.\nOn October 15, 2024, with an effective date of June 30, 2024, the Company and EWB entered into the Third Amendment to the Credit Agreement (the “Third\nAmendment”) which, among other things, (1) provides that the Company will make prepayments of the outstanding principal balance of the Credit Agreement of $1.0 million\nupon execution of the Third Amendment, $1.0 million on or before January 15, 2025 and $2.0 million on or before April 15, 2025, (2) requires the Company to file a\nregistration statement with the SEC to establish an equity line of credit offering on or before October 31, 2024 and to use commercially reasonable efforts to cause such\nregistration statement to become effective, (3) requires the net proceeds of a potential equity line of credit to be applied to the outstanding principal balance under the Credit\nAgreement in an amount that would cause the ratio of the value of eligible accounts to the aggregate amount of revolving credit advances to be not less than 1.00 to 1.00, (4)\nrequires the consent of EWB prior to the ability of the Company to make certain restricted payments, including cash dividends, (5) requires the Company to make additional\nprepayments in the amount by which the outstanding loans under the Credit Agreement exceed the borrowing base between the calendar months ending November 30, 2024\nand April 15, 2025, and (6) replaces the financial covenants under the Credit Agreement, effective as of June 30, 2024, with the following:\nMaximum Total\nMinimum TTM(1) Funded Debt to Revolving Credit\nEBITDA ($ in Minimum Liquid EBITDA Leverage Minimum Fixed Availability (as of each\nAs of millions) Assets ($ in millions) Ratio Charge Coverage Ratio month end)\nJune 30, 2024 n/a $1.0 n/a n/a n/a\nSeptember 30, 2024 $5.0 $1.5 n/a n/a n/a\nDecember 31, 2024 $3.5 $1.5 n/a n/a 1.00 to 1.00(2)\nMarch 31, 2025 $5.5 $2.0 n/a n/a 1.50 to 1.00(3)\nJune 30, 2025 $7.5 $2.0 n/a 1.25 to 1.00 2.00 to 1.00(4)\n(1) TTM = Trailing Twelve Months\n(2) Beginning November 30, 2024\n(3) Beginning January 31, 2025\n(4) Beginning April 15, 2025\nThe Company was in compliance with all the financial covenants under the Credit Agreement as of September 30, 2024 after giving effect to the amendments to the Credit\nAgreement under the Third Amendment, except for the minimum trailing twelve months EBITDA covenant. The Company is in discussion with EWB to waive the current non-\ncompliance with the financial covenant. While the Company expects to negotiate an acceptable resolution, there can be no assurance that it will be able to negotiate a waiver or\nan amendment, or that such waiver or amendment will be on terms acceptable to the Company. If the Company is unable to obtain a waiver from or enter into an amendment\nwith EWB, it could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and our ability to execute our business plan. Because of the maturity date, the debt under the Credit\nAgreement is classified as current as of September 30, 2024.\nThe Credit Agreement contains customary representations and warranties and includes affirmative and negative covenants applicable to the borrowers and their respective\nsubsidiaries. The affirmative covenants include, among others, covenants requiring the Company to maintain its legal existence and governmental compliance, deliver certain\nfinancial reports and maintain insurance coverage. The negative covenants include, among others, restrictions on indebtedness, liens, investments, mergers, dispositions,\nprepayment of other indebtedness and dividends and other distributions.\nThe Credit Agreement also includes customary events of default, including, among other things, non-payment defaults, covenant defaults, inaccuracy of representations\nand warranties, defaults under any of the loan documents, certain cross-defaults to other indebtedness, certain bankruptcy and insolvency events, invalidity of guarantees or\ngrant of security interest, certain ERISA-related transactions and events, certain orders of forfeiture, change of control, certain undischarged attachments, sequestrations, or\nsimilar proceedings, and certain undischarged or non-stayed judgments, in certain cases subject to certain thresholds and grace periods. The occurrence of an event of default\ncould result in the acceleration of the obligations under the Credit Agreement of the Company or other borrowers. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the\nCompany did not incur any deferred financing costs associated with the Credit Agreement. As of September 30, 2024, there was $9.7 million outstanding under the Credit\nAgreement which was classified as short term due to the Maturity Date being within twelve months of the reporting period.\n17\nTable of Contents\nThe collateral securing the obligations under the 2021 Credit Facility and the Credit Agreement is subject to intercreditor agreements between Lafayette Square and EWB.\nSilicon Valley Bank (“SVB”) Financing\nOn January 9, 2023, the Company entered into the SVB Loan Agreement, by and among SVB, as lender, and DDH LLC, the Company, Huddled Masses, Colossus\nMedia and Orange 142, as borrowers. The SVB Loan Agreement provided for a revolving credit facility (the “SVB Revolving Credit Facility”) in the original principal amount\nof $5 million, subject to a borrowing base determined based on eligible accounts, and up to an additional $2.5 million incremental revolving facility subject to the lender’s\nconsent, which would increase the aggregate principal amount of the Credit Facility to $7.5 million. Loans under the SVB Revolving Credit Facility were to mature on\nSeptember 30, 2024 unless the Credit Facility was otherwise terminated pursuant to the terms of the Loan Agreement.\nOn March 10, 2023, the California Department of Financial Protection and Innovation closed SVB and appointed the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation as\nreceiver. As the Company had not yet drawn any amounts under the SVB Revolving Credit Facility, on March 13, 2023, the Company issued a notice of termination of the SVB\nLoan Agreement. The termination of the SVB Revolving Credit Facility became effective April 20, 2023. Prior to issuing the notice of termination, the Company received\nconsent to terminate the SVB Revolving Credit Facility and a waiver of the terms relating to the SVB Revolving Credit Facility under its Term Loan and Security Agreement,\ndated as of December 3, 2021, with Lafayette Square Loan Servicing, LLC (“Lafayette Square”). The Company did not hold material cash deposits or securities at Silicon\nValley Bank and did not experience any adverse impact to its liquidity or to its current and projected business operations, financial condition or results of operations as a result\nof the SVB closure. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Company incurred $0.4 million of deferred financing costs.

The warrants became immediately exercisable upon\nissuance and were exercisable for a period of five years after the issuance date. The shares of Class A Common Stock and warrants were immediately transferable separately\nupon issuance. As of September 30, 2024, none of these warrants were outstanding. The underwriters in our initial public offering were granted a 45-day option to purchase up\nto an additional 420,000 shares and/or warrants, or any combination thereof, to cover over-allotments, which they initially exercised, in part, electing to purchase warrants to\npurchase an additional 420,000 shares of Class A Common Stock. As of September 30, 2024, none of these warrants were outstanding. In connection with the Company’s initial\npublic offering, the Company issued to the underwriters of the offering a unit purchase option to purchase (i) an additional 140,000 Units at a per Unit exercise price of $6.60,\nwhich was equal to 120% of the public offering price per Unit sold in the initial public offering, and (ii) warrants to purchase 21,000 shares of Class A Common Stock at a per\nwarrant exercise price of $0.012, which was equal to 120% of the public offering price per warrant sold in the offering.

Variables used in the Black-Scholes option-pricing model include:\n(1) discount rate of 1.94% based on the applicable U.S. Treasury bill rate, (2) expected life of 5 years, (3) expected volatility of approximately 66% based on the trading history\nof similar companies, and (4) zero expected dividends.\nOn August 29, 2023, the Company filed a Tender Offer Statement on Schedule TO pursuant to which the Company offered to purchase all of its outstanding warrants for\n$1.20 per warrant in cash. The Tender Offer expired at one minute after 11:59 PM, Eastern Time on September 28, 2023. The Company accepted all validly tendered warrants\nfor purchase and settlement on October 2, 2023. As a result of the Tender Offer, a total of 2,213,652 warrants were tendered and not validly withdrawn prior to the expiration of\nthe tender offer for a total purchase price of approximately $2.7 million. On October 23, 2023, the Company distributed a notice of redemption to the registered holders of the\nremaining outstanding warrants announcing the redemption of those warrants for $0.35 per warrant. The redemption closed on October 30, 2023, and all remaining 1,004,148\nwarrants were purchased for an aggregate price of approximately $0.4 million.\nEquity Reserve Facility\nOn October 18, 2024, the Company entered into a Share Purchase Agreement (the “Purchase Agreement”) with New Circle Principal Investments LLC, a Delaware limited\nliability company (“New Circle”), pursuant to which New Circle has committed to purchase, subject to certain limitations, up to $20 million (the “Total Commitment”) of the\nCompany’s Class A common stock, par value $0.001 per share (the “Class A Common Stock”). Under the applicable Nasdaq rules, the Company may not issue to New Circle\nunder the Purchase Agreement more than 19.99% of the shares of all classes of the Company’s common stock outstanding immediately prior to the execution of the Purchase\nAgreement (the “Exchange Cap”), unless (i) the Company obtains stockholder approval to issue shares of its Class A Common Stock in excess of the Exchange Cap in\naccordance with applicable Nasdaq rules, or (ii) the average purchase price per share paid by New Circle for all shares of the Company’s Class A Common Stock, if any, that\nthe Company elects to sell to New Circle under the Purchase Agreement equals or exceeds certain minimums permitted under the rules of the Nasdaq Stock Market. The\npurchase price of the shares that may be sold to New Circle under the Purchase Agreement will be based on an agreed upon fixed discount to the market price of our Class A\nCommon Stock as computed under the Purchase Agreement.\n19\nTable of Contents\nAs consideration for New Circle’s irrevocable commitment to purchase shares of the Company’s Class A Common Stock upon the terms of and subject to satisfaction of\nthe conditions set forth in the Purchase Agreement, the Company paid New Circle structuring and legal fees of less than $0.1 million. In addition, the Company will pay a\ncommitment fee of $150,000 to New Circle, which we may issue in the form of the Company’s Class A Common Stock (the “Commitment Fee”), the market value of which\nshall be determined based on the closing price of the Class A Common Stock on the date the Registration Statement is declared effective by the SEC; provided, however, that\nthe Company may, in its sole discretion, elect to pay any portion of the Commitment Fee in cash, so long as such amount is paid on or prior to the day of filing of the\nRegistration Statement filed in order to register the Company’s Class A Common Stock sold under the Purchase Agreement.\nThe Purchase Agreement will automatically terminate on the earliest of (i) the 36-month anniversary of the of the Purchase Agreement, (ii) the date on which New Circle\nshall have made payment to the Company for Class A Common Stock equal to the Total Commitment or (iii) the date any statute, rule, regulation, executive order, decree,\nruling or injunction that would prohibit any of the transactions contemplated by the Purchase Agreement goes into effect. The Company has the right to terminate the Purchase\nAgreement at any time, at no cost or penalty, upon five trading days’ prior written notice to New Circle so long as (a) there are no outstanding purchase notices under which our\nClass A Common Stock have yet to be issued and (b) the Company has paid all amounts owed to New Circle pursuant to the Purchase Agreement. The Company and New\nCircle may also agree to terminate the Purchase Agreement by mutual written consent.\nNoncontrolling Interest\nDirect Digital Holdings, Inc. is the sole managing member of DDH LLC, and consolidates the financial results of DDH LLC. Therefore, Direct Digital Holdings, Inc.\nreports a noncontrolling interest (\"NCI\") based on the common units of DDH LLC held by DDM. While Direct Digital Holdings, Inc. retains its controlling interest in DDH\nLLC, changes in its ownership interest in DDH LLC are accounted for as equity transactions. As such, future redemptions or direct exchanges of LLC Units by DDM will result\nin a change in ownership and reduce or increase the amount recorded as noncontrolling interest and increase or decrease additional paid-in capital when DDH LLC has positive\nor negative net assets, respectively.\nStock-Based Compensation Plans\nIn connection with the initial public offering, the Company adopted the 2022 Omnibus Incentive Plan (“2022 Omnibus Plan”) to facilitate the grant of equity awards to the\nCompany’s employees, consultants and non-employee directors. The Company’s board of directors reserved 1,500,000 shares of Class A Common Stock for issuance in equity\nawards under the 2022 Omnibus Plan. Information on activity for both the stock options and RSUs is detailed below.\nDuring the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company recognized $0.8 million and $0.5 million, respectively, of total stock-based compensation\nexpense in the condensed consolidated statement of operations in compensation, tax and benefits.\nStock Options\nOptions to purchase shares of common stock vest annually on the grant date anniversary over a period of three years and expire 10 years following the date of grant.

The total shares withheld were 98,036 and were based on the value of the RSUs on their respective vesting dates as determined by the Company’s\nclosing stock price. As of September 30, 2024, there was unrecognized stock-based compensation of $0.5 million related to unvested RSUs which will be recognized on a\nstraight-line basis over a weighted average period of 1.23 years.\nNote 5 — Tax Receivable Agreement and Income Taxes\nTax Receivable Agreement\nThe Company's TRA with DDH LLC and DDM (together, the “TRA Holders”) provides for payment by the Company to the TRA Holders of 85% of the net cash savings,\nif any, in U.S. federal, state and local income tax and franchise tax that the Company actually realizes or is deemed to realize in certain circumstances. The Company retains the\nbenefit of the remaining 15% of these net cash savings.\nThe TRA liability is calculated by determining the tax basis subject to the TRA (“tax basis”) and applying a blended tax rate to the basis differences and calculating the\nresulting impact. The blended tax rate consists of the U.S. federal income tax rate and assumed combined state and local income tax rate driven by the apportionment factors\napplicable to each state. Any taxable income or loss generated by the Company will be allocated to TRA Holders in accordance with the LLC Agreement and the TRA, and\ndistributions to the owners of LLC Units in an amount sufficient to fund their tax obligations will be made. Pursuant to the Company’s election under Section 754 of the Code\nin 2022, the Company expects to obtain an increase in its share of the tax basis in the net assets of DDH, LLC when LLC interests are redeemed or exchanged by the members\nof DDH, LLC. In August 2022 and December 2023, members of DDM exchanged 100,000 and 410,000 Class B shares into Class A shares, respectively.\nThe Company has recorded a liability related to the tax receivable agreement of less than $0.1 million and $5.2 million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023,\nrespectively. The Company has recorded a deferred tax asset primarily from the outside basis difference in the partnership interest of $0.0 million and $6.1 million as of\nSeptember 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. The deferred tax asset is net of a valuation allowance of $7.3 million and $0.5 million as of September 30, 2024 and\nDecember 31, 2023, respectively. TRA payments of $0 and less than $0.1 million were made during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The\npayments under the TRA will not be conditional on holder of rights under the TRA having a continued ownership interest in either DDH LLC or the Company. The Company\nmay elect to defer payments due under the TRA if the Company does not have available cash to satisfy its payment obligations under the TRA. Any such deferred payments\nunder the TRA generally will accrue interest from the due date for such payment until the payment date. The Company accounts for any amounts payable under the TRA in\naccordance with ASC Topic 450, Contingencies, and recognizes subsequent period changes to the measurement of the liability from the TRA in the statement of operations as a\ncomponent of income before taxes. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, $5.2 million was recognized as income under other income (expense) due to the\nderecognition of the TRA liability, as a valuation allowance was recorded against the deferred taxes associated with the TRA.\n21\nTable of Contents\nThe term of the TRA commenced upon completion of the initial public offering and will continue until all tax benefits that are subject to the TRA have been utilized or\nexpired, unless the Company exercises its right to terminate the TRA. If the Company elects to terminate the TRA early (or it is terminated early due to changes in control), the\nobligations under the TRA would accelerate and the Company would be required to make an immediate payment equal to the present value of the anticipated future payments\nto be made by the Company under the TRA.\nIncome Taxes\nThrough the Organizational Transactions completed in February 2022, the Company formed an Up-C structure which allows DDM to continue to realize tax benefits\nassociated with owning interests in an entity that is treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Under the Up-C structure, the Company is subject to\ncorporation income tax on the variable ownership changes. The ownership was 20.45% as of January 1, 2023 and increased to 23.35% in the fourth quarter of 2023. There was\nno exchange of shares of Class B common stock for shares of Class A common stock in the nine months ended September 30, 2024.\nThe Company recorded a tax benefit for federal and state income tax for which the components and the effective income tax rates are as follows (in thousands):\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nIncome tax expense $ 6,606 $ 166 $ 6,132 $ 166\nEffective income tax rate 2884.7 % 4.7 % (85.1 %) 4.9 %\nThe effective tax rates were lower than the statutory tax rates for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 primarily due to the Company’s partnership loss that\nis not subject to federal and state taxes. The effective tax rates were different from the statutory rates for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 primarily due to\nrecording a valuation allowance against deferred taxes.\nAs of September 30, 2024, the Company had federal net operating loss carryforwards of $4.4 million that can be carried forward indefinitely.\nThe Company files income tax returns in the United States federal jurisdiction and various state jurisdictions. In the normal course of business, the Company can be\nexamined by various tax authorities, including the Internal Revenue Service in the United States. There are currently no federal or state audits in process. The Company\nanalyzes its tax filing positions in all of the U.S. federal, state and local tax jurisdictions where it is required to file income tax returns, as well as for all open tax years in these\njurisdictions. Federal and various states returns for the years ended December 2022 and 2021 remain open as of September 30, 2024. The Company evaluates tax positions\ntaken or expected to be taken in the course of preparing an entity’s tax returns to determine whether it is “more-likely-than-not” that each tax position will be sustained by the\napplicable tax authority. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company had no uncertain tax positions. Accordingly, the Company has not recognized any\npenalty, interest or tax impact related to uncertain tax positions.\nNote 6 — Related Party Transactions\nRelated Party Transactions\nMember Payable\nAs of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company had a net receivable from members that totaled $1.7 million, which is included as a related party\nreceivable on the condensed consolidated balance sheets.\nUp-C Structure\nIn February 2022, the Company completed an initial public offering of its securities, and through the Organizational Transactions, formed an Up-C structure, which is often\nused by partnerships and limited liability companies and allows DDM, a Delaware limited liability company indirectly owned by Mark Walker (“Walker”) and Keith Smith\n(“Smith”), to retain its equity ownership in DDH LLC and to continue to realize tax benefits associated with owning interests in an entity that is treated as a partnership, or\n“pass-through” entity, for U.S. federal income tax purposes. DDM holds economic\n22\nTable of Contents\nnonvoting LLC Units in DDH LLC and holds noneconomic voting equity interests in the form of the Class B Common Stock in Direct Digital Holdings (See Note 4 —\nStockholders’ Deficit and Stock-Based Compensation). One of the tax benefits to DDM associated with this structure is that future taxable income of DDH LLC that is\nallocated to DDM will be taxed on a pass-through basis and therefore will not be subject to corporate taxes at the entity level. Additionally, DDM may, from time to time,\nredeem or exchange its LLC Units for shares of the Company’s Class A Common Stock on a one-for-one basis. The Up-C structure also provides DDM with potential liquidity\nthat holders of non-publicly traded limited liability companies are not typically afforded. If the Company ever generates sufficient taxable income to utilize the tax benefits,\nDDH expects to benefit from the Up-C structure because, in general, the Company expects cash tax savings in amounts equal to 15% of certain tax benefits arising from such\nredemptions or exchanges of DDM's LLC Units for Class A Common Stock or cash and certain other tax benefits covered by the TRA. As described in Note 5 — Tax\nReceivable Agreement and Income Taxes, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, $5.2 million was recorded as income in other income (expense) for such\nchange as the deferred taxes giving rise to the TRA have a valuation allowance recorded to offset the deferred tax assets.\nThe aggregate balance of tax receivable liabilities as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, is as follows (in thousands):\nSeptember 30, December 31,\n2024 2023\nLiability related to tax receivable agreement\nShort term $ 41 $ 41\nLong term — 5,201\nTotal liability related to tax receivable agreement $ 41 $ 5,242\nNote 7 — Segment Information\nRevenue by business segment is as follows (in thousands):\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nSell-side advertising $ 2,202 $ 51,622 $ 33,001 $ 89,006\nBuy-side advertising 6,873 7,850 20,204 27,093\nTotal revenues $ 9,075 $ 59,472 $ 53,205 $ 116,099\nOperating loss by business segment reconciled to loss before income taxes is as follows (in thousands):\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nSell-side advertising $ (873) $ 6,206 $ 536 $ 9,657\nBuy-side advertising 1,349 1,551 3,490 6,980\nCorporate office expenses (4,134) (3,263) (12,555) (10,030)\nTotal operating (loss) income (3,658) 4,494 (8,529) 6,607\nCorporate other expense 3,887 (977) 1,323 (3,229)\nIncome (loss) before income taxes $ 229 $ 3,517 $ (7,206) $ 3,378\n23\nTable of Contents\nTotal assets by business segment are as follows (in thousands):\nSeptember 30, December 31,\n2024 2023\nSell-side advertising $ 3,807 $ 34,354\nBuy-side advertising 20,604 22,539\nCorporate office 6,880 13,779\nTotal assets $ 31,291 $ 70,672\nNote 8 — Net (Loss) Income Per Share\nThe Company has two classes of common stock, Class A and Class B. Shares of the Company’s Class B Common Stock do not share in the earnings or losses attributable\nto Direct Digital Holdings, Inc. and are therefore not participating securities. The Company uses the two-class method to calculate basic and diluted earnings per share as a\nresult of outstanding participating securities in the form of warrants for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. The following table sets forth the computation of\nthe Company’s basic and diluted net (loss) income per share (in thousands, except per share amounts):\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nNet (loss) income attributable to Class A shareholders and participating securities $ (2,690) $ 571 $ (4,055) $ 549\nLess: net income allocated to participating securities — 296 — 285\nNet (loss) income allocated to Class A shareholders $ (2,690) $ 275 $ (4,055) $ 264\nWeighted average common shares outstanding - basic 3,793 2,990 3,667 2,938\nClass B Common Stock — — — —\nOptions to purchase common stock — 20 — 24\nUnvested restricted stock units — 34 — 118\nWeighted average common shares outstanding - diluted 3,793 3,044 3,667 3,080\nNet (loss) income per common share, basic $ (0.71) $ 0.09 $ (1.11) $ 0.09\nNet (loss) income per common share, diluted $ (0.71) $ 0.09 $ (1.11) $ 0.09\nThe following weighted-average outstanding shares of common stock equivalents were excluded from the computation of diluted net (loss) income per share attributable\nto common stockholders for the periods presented because including them would have been anti-dilutive (in thousands):\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nClass B Common Stock 10,868 11,278 10,868 11,278\nOptions to purchase common stock 346 343 362 365\nUnvested restricted stock units 268 495 402 382\nTotal excludable from net loss per share attributable to common stockholders -\ndiluted 11,482 12,116 11,632 12,025\nNote 9 — Commitments and Contingencies\nLitigation\nWe may from time to time be subject to various legal or administrative claims and proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business.

In connection with this post, one of the Company’s sell-side customers paused its\nconnection to the Company while the allegations were investigated. This customer reconnected the Company on May 22, 2024 and sell-side volumes have resumed but not yet\nat the levels experienced prior to the pause in May 2024. The Company is actively working with its partners to achieve prior volume levels. On May 14, 2024, the Company\nfiled a lawsuit against the author of the defamatory article and is vigorously pursuing its rights. The Company cannot make any predictions about the final outcome of this\nlitigation matter or the timing thereof.\nOn May 23, 2024, an alleged stockholder, purportedly on behalf of the persons or entities who purchased or acquired publicly traded securities of the Company between\nApril 2023 and March 2024, filed a putative class action against the Company, certain of our officers and directors, and other defendants in the U.S. District Court for the\nSouthern District of Texas, alleging violations of federal securities laws related to alleged false or misleading disclosures made by the Company in its public filings. On July 9,\n2024, another alleged stockholder filed a similar securities class action against the Company, certain of our officers and directors, also in the Southern District of Texas. The\ntwo actions have been consolidated. Each of these complaints seeks unspecified damages, plus costs, fees, and attorneys’ fees. The Company cannot make any predictions about\nthe final outcome of this matter or the timing thereof but believes that plaintiffs’ claims lack merit and intends to vigorously defend these lawsuits.\nOperating Leases\nDuring the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company incurred fixed rent expense associated with operating leases for real estate of $0.2 million.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nYou should read the following discussion together with our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this\nQuarterly Report on Form 10-Q and our audited consolidated financial statements and the related notes included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended\nDecember 31, 2023. This discussion contains forward-looking statements based upon current expectations that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results may differ\nmaterially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including those set forth under the section titled “Risk Factors” in our\nAnnual Report on Form 10-K or in other parts of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. See “– Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” below. Our historical\nresults are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for any period in the future.\nCautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\nThis Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws and which are subject to certain risks, trends\nand uncertainties. We use words such as “could,” “would,” “may,” “might,” “will,” “expect,” “likely,” “believe,” “continue,” “anticipate,” “estimate,” “intend,” “plan,”\n“project” and other similar expressions to identify forward-looking statements, but not all forward-looking statements include these words. All of our forward-looking\nstatements involve estimates and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in or implied by the forward-looking statements.\nAccordingly, any such statements are qualified in their entirety by reference to the information described under the caption “Risk Factors” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K\nand elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023.\nThe forward-looking statements contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q are based on assumptions that we have made in light of our industry experience and our\nperceptions of historical trends, current conditions, expected future developments and other factors we believe are appropriate under the circumstances. As you read and\nconsider this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, you should understand that these statements are not guarantees of performance or results. They involve risks, uncertainties (many\nof which are beyond our control) and assumptions.\nAlthough we believe that these forward-looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions, you should be aware that many factors could affect our actual operating\nand financial performance and cause our performance to differ materially from the performance expressed in or implied by the forward-looking statements. We believe these\nfactors include, but are not limited to, the following:\n• the restrictions and covenants imposed upon us by our credit facilities;\n• the substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern, which may hinder our ability to obtain future financing;\n• our ability to secure additional financing to meet our capital needs;\n• ineligibility to file short-form registration statements on Form S-3, which may impair our ability to raise capital;\n• failure to satisfy applicable listing standards of the Nasdaq Capital Market resulting in a potential delisting of our common stock;\n• costs, risks and uncertainties related to the restatement of certain prior period financial statements;\n• any significant fluctuations caused by our high customer concentration;\n• risks related to non-payment by our clients;\n• reputational and other harms caused by our failure to detect advertising fraud;\n• operational and performance issues with our platform, whether real or perceived, including a failure to respond to technological changes or to upgrade our\ntechnology systems;\n• restrictions on the use of third-party “cookies,” mobile device IDs or other tracking technologies, which could diminish our platform’s effectiveness;\n• unfavorable publicity and negative public perception about our industry, particularly concerns regarding data privacy and security relating to our industry’s\ntechnology and practices, and any perceived failure to comply with laws and industry self-regulation;\n• our failure to manage our growth effectively;\n28\nTable of Contents\n• the difficulty in identifying and integrating any future acquisitions or strategic investments;\n• any changes or developments in legislative, judicial, regulatory or cultural environments related to information collection, use and processing;\n• challenges related to our buy-side clients that are destination marketing organizations and that operate as public/private partnerships;\n• any strain on our resources or diversion of our management’s attention as a result of being a public company;\n• the intense competition of the digital advertising industry and our ability to effectively compete against current and future competitors;\n• any significant inadvertent disclosure or breach of confidential and/or personal information we hold, or of the security of our or our customers’, suppliers’ or other\npartners’ computer systems;\n• as a holding company, we depend on distributions from Direct Digital Holdings, LLC (“DDH LLC”) to pay our taxes, expenses (including payments under the\nTax Receivable Agreement) and any amount of any dividends we may pay to the holders of our common stock;\n• the fact that DDH LLC is controlled by DDM, whose interest may differ from those of our public stockholders;\n• any failure by us to maintain or implement effective internal controls or to detect fraud; and\n• other factors and assumptions discussed under “Risk Factors” and elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for\nthe fiscal year ended December 31, 2023.\nShould one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize or should any of these assumptions prove to be incorrect, our actual operating and financial performance may\nvary in material respects from the performance projected in these forward-looking statements. Further, any forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date on which it is\nmade, and except as required by law, we undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statement contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q to reflect events or\ncircumstances after the date on which it is made or to reflect the occurrence of anticipated or unanticipated events or circumstances. New factors that could cause our business\nnot to develop as we expect emerge from time to time, and it is not possible for us to predict all of them. Further, we cannot assess the impact of each currently known or new\nfactor on our results of operations or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-\nlooking statements.\nOverview\nDirect Digital Holdings, Inc. and its subsidiaries (collectively the “Company,” “DDH,” “we,” “us” and “our”), headquartered in Houston, Texas, is an end-to-end, full-\nservice programmatic advertising platform primarily focused on providing advertising technology, data-driven campaign optimization and other solutions intended for\nunderserved and less efficient markets on both the sell- and buy-side of the digital advertising ecosystem. Direct Digital Holdings, Inc. is the holding company that, since the\ncompletion of our initial public offering on February 15, 2022, owns certain common units, and serves as the manager of DDH LLC, which operates the business formed in\n2018 through the acquisition of Colossus Media, LLC (\"Colossus Media\"), a sell-side marketing platform, and Huddled Masses, LLC (“Huddled Masses™” or “Huddled\nMasses”), a buy-side marketing platform.\nIn late September 2020, DDH LLC acquired Orange142, LLC (“Orange 142”) to further bolster its overall programmatic buy-side advertising platform and enhance its\nofferings across multiple industry verticals such as travel, education, healthcare, financial services, consumer products and other sectors, with particular emphasis on small- and\nmid-sized businesses transitioning into digital with growing digital media budgets.\nDirect Digital Holdings, Inc. owns 100% of the voting interest in Direct Digital Holdings, LLC. As of September 30, 2024, DDH owns 25.9% of the economic interest in\nDirect Digital Holdings, LLC. See further discussion of the Up-C structure in Note 6 of our condensed consolidated financial statements. Direct Digital Holdings, LLC was\nformed on June\n29\nTable of Contents\n21, 2018 and acquired by DDH on February 15, 2022 in connection with the Organizational Transactions. Direct Digital Holdings, LLC’s wholly-owned subsidiaries are as\nfollows:\nCurrent % Business Date of\nSubsidiary Ownership Segment Date of Formation Acquisition\nColossus Media, LLC 100% Sell-side September 8, 2017 June 21, 2018\nOrange142, LLC 100% Buy-side March 6, 2013 September 30, 2020\nHuddled Masses, LLC 100% Buy-side November 13, 2012 June 21, 2018\nColossus Media operates our proprietary sell-side programmatic platform operating under the trademarked banner of Colossus SSP™ (“Colossus SSP”). Colossus SSP\nis a stand-alone sell-side platform (\"SSP\") intended to deliver targeted advertising to diverse and multicultural audiences as well as to general audiences, including African\nAmericans, Latin Americans, Asian Americans and LGBTQIA+ customers, as well as general audiences. Both buy-side advertising businesses, Orange 142 and Huddled\nMasses, offer technology-enabled advertising solutions and consulting services to clients through demand side platforms (“DSPs”).\nProviding both the front-end, buy-side advertising businesses coupled with our proprietary sell-side operations enables us to curate the first through the last mile in the ad\ntech ecosystem execution process to drive higher results.\nOperating segments are components of an enterprise for which separate financial information is available and evaluated regularly by our chief operating decision maker\n(“CODM”) for purpose of allocating resources and assessing performance. Our CODM is our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. We operate as two reportable segments:\nsell-side advertising, which includes the results of Colossus Media, and buy-side advertising, which includes the results of Orange 142 and Huddled Masses. All our revenues\nare attributable to the United States.\nRecent Developments\nNasdaq Rule Noncompliance.\nOn October 18, 2024, we received a deficiency letter (the “Letter”) from the Listing Qualifications Department of Nasdaq (the \"Staff\") notifying the Company that it was\nnot in compliance with the minimum stockholders’ equity requirement for continued listing on Nasdaq under Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(b)(1). Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(b)(1)\nrequires companies listed on Nasdaq to maintain stockholders’ equity of at least $2.5 million (the “Stockholders’ Equity Requirement”). The Company’s Quarterly Report on\nForm 10-Q for the period ended June 30, 2024 reported a stockholders’ deficit of $8.77 million. The Letter further noted that as of the letter date, the Company did not have a\nmarket value of listed securities of $35 million, or net income from continued operations of $500,000 in the most recently completed fiscal year or in two of the last three most\nrecently completed fiscal years, which are the alternative quantitative standards to the Stockholders’ Equity Requirement for continued listing on Nasdaq. In accordance with\nthe Nasdaq Listing Rules, the Company was provided 45 calendar days, or until December 2, 2024, to submit a plan to regain compliance (the “Compliance Plan”). If the\nCompliance Plan is acceptable to the Staff, the Staff may grant an extension of up to 180 calendar days from the date of the Letter. If the Staff does not accept the Compliance\nPlan, the Staff will provide written notification to the Company that the Compliance Plan has been rejected. At that time, the Company may appeal the Staff’s determination to\na Nasdaq Hearings Panel. The Company intends to submit a Compliance Plan on or before December 2, 2024. Further, the Company intends to take all reasonable measures\navailable to regain compliance under the Nasdaq Listing Rules and remain listed on Nasdaq, including by capital-raising activities such as through the Purchase Agreement,\ndefined below, for the equity reserve facility described in Note 4 — Stockholders’ Deficit and Stock-Based Compensation. However, there can be no assurance that Nasdaq will\napprove the Compliance Plan or that the Company will ultimately regain compliance with all applicable requirements for continued listing. Neither the Letter nor the\nCompany’s non-compliance have an immediate effect on the listing or trading of the Company’s Class A Common Stock.\nEquity Reserve Facility.\nOn October 18, 2024, the Company entered into a Share Purchase Agreement (the “Purchase Agreement”) with New Circle Principal Investments LLC, a Delaware limited\nliability company (“New Circle”), pursuant to which New Circle has committed to purchase, subject to certain limitations, up to $20 million (the “Total Commitment”) of the\nCompany’s Class A common stock, par value $0.001 per share (the “Class A Common Stock”). Under the applicable Nasdaq rules, the Company may not issue to New Circle\nunder the Purchase Agreement more than 19.99% of the shares of all classes of the Company’s common stock outstanding immediately prior to the execution of the Purchase\nAgreement (the “Exchange Cap”), unless (i) the Company obtains stockholder approval to issue shares of its Class A Common Stock in excess of the Exchange Cap in\naccordance with applicable Nasdaq rules, or (ii) the average purchase price per share paid by New Circle for all shares of the Company’s Class A Common Stock, if any, that\nthe Company elects to sell to New Circle under the\n30\nTable of Contents\nPurchase Agreement equals or exceeds certain minimums permitted under the rules of the Nasdaq Stock Market. The purchase price of the shares that may be sold to New\nCircle under the Purchase Agreement will be based on an agreed upon fixed discount to the market price of our Class A Common Stock as computed under the Purchase\nAgreement. As consideration for New Circle’s irrevocable commitment to purchase shares of the Company’s Class A Common Stock upon the terms of and subject to\nsatisfaction of the conditions set forth in the Purchase Agreement, the Company paid New Circle structuring and legal fees of less than $0.1 million. In addition, the Company\nwill pay a commitment fee of $150,000 to New Circle, which we may issue in the form of the Company’s Class A Common Stock (the “Commitment Fee”), the market value of\nwhich shall be determined based on the closing price of the Class A Common Stock on the date the Registration Statement is declared effective by the SEC; provided, however,\nthat the Company may, in its sole discretion, elect to pay any portion of the Commitment Fee in cash, so long as such amount is paid on or prior to the day of filing of the\nRegistration Statement filed in order to register the Company’s Class A Common Stock sold under the Purchase Agreement. The Purchase Agreement will automatically\nterminate on the earliest of (i) the 36-month anniversary of the Purchase Agreement, (ii) the date on which New Circle shall have made payment to the Company for Class A\nCommon Stock equal to the Total Commitment or (iii) the date any statute, rule, regulation, executive order, decree, ruling or injunction that would prohibit any of the\ntransactions contemplated by the Purchase Agreement goes into effect. The Company has the right to terminate the Purchase Agreement at any time, at no cost or penalty, upon\nfive trading days’ prior written notice to New Circle so long as (a) there are no outstanding purchase notices under which our Class A Common Stock have yet to be issued and\n(b) the Company has paid all amounts owed to New Circle pursuant to the Purchase Agreement.\nRelationship with Sell-Side Customer.\nOn May 10, 2024, the Company was the subject of a defamatory article / blog post which the Company believes was part of a coordinated misinformation campaign. In\nconnection with this post, one of the Company’s sell-side customers paused its connection to the Company while the allegations were investigated. This customer reconnected\nthe Company on May 22, 2024 and sell-side volumes have resumed but not yet at the levels experienced prior to the pause in May 2024. The Company is actively working with\nits partners to achieve prior volume levels. On May 14, 2024, the Company filed a lawsuit against the author of the defamatory article and is vigorously pursuing its rights. The\nCompany cannot make any predictions about the final outcome of this litigation matter or the timing thereof.\nBuy-side Unification.\nOn October 31, 2024, the Company announced the unification of its buy-side businesses, Orange 142 and Huddled Masses. The unification did not have a material impact\non the Company's business operations nor on the Company's condensed consolidated financial statements.\nKey Factors Affecting Our Performance\nWe believe our growth and financial performance are dependent on many factors, including those described below.\nSell-side advertising business\nIncreasing revenue from customers through increased advertising spend from buyers\nColossus Media operates our proprietary sell-side programmatic platform operating under the trademarked banner of Colossus SSP. Our customers (or buyers) include ad\nexchanges, DSPs, agencies and individual advertisers. We have broad exposure to the ecosystem of buyers, reaching on average approximately 176,000 advertisers per month\nin the three months ended September 30, 2024, an increase of 71% over the 103,000 advertisers per month in the three months ended September 30, 2023. As spending on\nprogrammatic advertising increasingly becomes a larger share of the overall ad spend, advertisers and agencies are seeking greater control of their digital advertising supply\nchains. To take advantage of this industry shift, we have entered into Supply Path Optimization agreements directly with customers which address acceptable advertisements\nand data usage. As part of these agreements, we provide advertisers and agencies with benefits ranging from custom data and workflow integrations, product features, volume-\nbased business terms, and visibility into campaign performance data and methodology. As a result of these direct relationships, our existing advertisers and agencies are\nincentivized to allocate an increasing percentage of their advertising budgets to our platform.\nWe also strive to retain existing publishers and add new publishers. Establishing multiple header bidding integrations by leveraging our technology capabilities allows us to\nmaximize our access to publishers’ ad formats, devices and various properties that a publisher may own. We may also up-sell additional products including our header bidding\nmanagement, identity, and audience solutions. We enter into master service agreements with our publishers which, among other terms, set a fixed rate for content to be sold on\nColossus SSP. Our strategy on the sell-side advertising business represents growth\n31\nTable of Contents\npotential, and we believe we are well positioned to be able to bring underserved multicultural publishers into the advertising ecosystem, thereby increasing our value\nproposition across all customers, including large advertisers and agencies.\nMonetizing ad impressions for publishers and buyers\nWe curate advertisers and increase access to publishers with valuable ad impressions. We focus on monetizing digital impressions by coordinating daily real-time auctions\nand bids. Each time the publisher’s web page loads, an ad request is sent to multiple ad exchanges and, in some cases, to the demand side platform directly from Colossus SSP.\nIn case of real-time bidding (“RTB”) media buys, many DSPs would place bids to the impressions being offered by the publisher during the auction. The advertiser that bids a\nhigher amount compared to other advertisers will win the bid and pay the second highest price for the winning impression to serve the ads. We continuously review our\navailable inventory from existing publishers across every format (mobile, desktop, digital video, OTT, CTV, and rich media). The factors we consider when determining which\nimpressions we process include transparency, viewability, and whether or not the impression is human sourced. By consistently applying these criteria, we believe the ad\nimpressions we process will be valuable and marketable to advertisers.\nEnhancing ad inventory quality\nIn the advertising industry, inventory quality is assessed in terms of invalid traffic (“IVT”) which can be impacted by fraud such as “fake eyeballs” generated by automated\ntechnologies set up to artificially inflate impression counts. Through our platform design and proactive IVT mitigation efforts, we address and minimize IVT on a number of\nfronts, including sophisticated technology, which detects and avoids IVT on the front end; direct publisher and inventory relationships, for supply path optimization; and\nongoing campaign and inventory performance review, to ensure inventory quality and brand protection controls are in place.\nGrowing access to valuable ad impressions\nHistorically, our growth has been driven by a variety of factors including increased access to mobile web (display and video) and mobile app (display and video)\nimpressions and desktop video impressions. Our performance is affected by our ability to maintain and grow our access to valuable ad impressions from current publishers as\nwell as through new relationships with publishers. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, we processed over 513.3 billion average monthly bid requests, down 51%\nfrom 2023, reflecting the pause in service by one of our sell-side customers in May 2024 which has not yet returned to pre-pause levels.\nExpanding and managing investments\nEach impression or transaction occurs in a fraction of a second. Given that most transactions take place in an auction/bidding format, we continue to make investments\nacross the platform to further reduce the processing time. In addition to the robust infrastructure supporting our platform, it is also critical that we align with key industry\npartners in the digital supply chain. The Colossus SSP is agnostic to any specific demand side platform.\nWe automate workflow processes whenever feasible to drive predictable and value-added outcomes for our customers and increase productivity of our organization. In the\nfirst half of 2023, we transitioned our server platform to HPE Greenlake, which provides increased capacity, faster response time, and expansion capabilities to align with\ngrowth in our business.\nManaging industry dynamics\nWe operate in the rapidly evolving digital advertising industry. Due to the scale and complexity of the digital advertising ecosystem, direct sales via manual, person-to-\nperson processes are insufficient for delivering a real-time, personalized ad experience, creating the need for programmatic advertising. In turn, advances in programmatic\ntechnologies have enabled publishers to auction their ad inventory to more buyers, simultaneously, and in real time through a process referred to as header bidding. Header\nbidding has also provided advertisers with transparent access to ad impressions. As advertisers keep pace with ongoing changes in the way that consumers view and interact\nwith digital media we anticipate further innovation and expect that header bidding will be extended into new areas such as OTT/CTV. We believe our focus on publishers and\nbuyers has allowed us to understand their needs and our ongoing innovation has enabled us to quickly adapt to changes in the industry, develop new solutions and do so cost\neffectively. Our performance depends on our ability to keep pace with industry changes such as header bidding and the evolving needs of our publishers and buyers while\ncontinuing our cost efficiency.\n32\nTable of Contents\nSeasonality\nIn the advertising industry, companies commonly experience seasonal fluctuations in revenue. For example, in our sell-side advertising segment, many advertisers allocate\nthe largest portion of their budgets to the fourth quarter of the calendar year in order to coincide with increased holiday purchasing. We expect our sell-side revenue to continue\nto fluctuate based on seasonal factors that affect the advertising industry as a whole.\nBuy-side advertising business\nNew Customer Acquisitions\nOn the buy-side of our business, our customers consist of purchasers of programmatic advertising inventory (ad space) looking to place their advertisements. We serve the\nneeds of over 230 small and mid-sized clients, consisting of advertising space buyers, including small and mid-sized companies, large advertising holding companies (which\nmay manage several agencies), independent advertising agencies and mid-market advertising service organizations. We serve a variety of customers across multiple industries\nincluding travel/tourism (including destination marketing organizations (“DMOs”)), education, energy, consumer packaged goods, healthcare, financial services (including\ncryptocurrency technologies) and other industries.\nWe are focused on increasing the number of customers that use our buy-side advertising businesses as their advertising partner. Our long-term growth and results of\noperations will depend on our ability to attract more customers, including DMOs, across multiple geographies.\nExpand Sales to Existing Customers\nOur customers understand the independent nature of our platform and relentless focus on driving results based on return on investment (“ROI”). Our value proposition is\ncomplete alignment across our entire digital supply platform beginning with the first dollar in and last dollar out. We are technology, DSP and media agnostic, and we believe\nour clients trust us to provide the best opportunity for success of their brands and businesses. As a result, our clients have been loyal, with approximately 88% client retention\namongst the clients that represent approximately 80% of our revenue during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. In addition, we cultivate client relationships through\nour pipeline of managed and moderate serve clients that conduct campaigns through our platform. The managed services delivery model allows us to combine our technology\nwith a highly personalized offering to strategically design and manage advertising campaigns.\nShift to Digital Advertising\nMedia has increasingly become more digital as a result of three key ongoing developments:\n• Advances in technology with more sophisticated digital content delivery across multiple platforms;\n• Changes in consumer behavior, including spending longer portions of the day using mobile and other devices; and\n• Better audience segmentation with more efficient targeting and measurable results.\nThe resulting shift has enabled a variety of options for advertisers to efficiently target and measure their advertising campaigns across nearly every media channel and\ndevice. These efforts have been led by big-budgeted, large, multi-national corporations incentivized to cast a broad advertising net to support national brands.\nIncreased Adoption of Digital Advertising by Small-and Mid-Sized Companies\nOnly recently have small and mid-sized businesses begun to leverage the power of digital media in meaningful ways, as emerging technologies have enabled advertising\nacross multiple channels in a highly localized nature. Campaign efficiencies yielding measurable results and higher advertising ROI have prompted these companies to begin\nutilizing digital advertising on an accelerated pace. We believe this market is rapidly expanding, and that small-to-mid-sized advertisers will continue to increase their digital\nspend.\nSeasonality\nIn the advertising industry, companies commonly experience seasonal fluctuations in revenue. Historically, for our buy-side advertising segment, the second and third\nquarters of the year reflect our highest levels of advertising activity and\n33\nTable of Contents\nthe first quarter reflects the lowest level of such activity. We expect our buy-side revenue to continue to fluctuate based on seasonal factors that affect the advertising industry as\na whole.\nComponents of Our Results of Operations\nRevenue\nFor the sell-side advertising segment, we generate revenue by selling advertising inventory (digital ad units) that we purchase from publishers to advertisers through a\nprocess of monetizing ad impressions on our proprietary sell-side programmatic platform operating under the trademarked banner Colossus SSP. For the buy-side advertising\nsegment, we generate revenue from customers that enter into agreements with us to provide managed advertising campaigns, which include digital marketing and media\nservices to purchase digital advertising space, data and other add-on features.\nIn connection with our analysis of principal vs agent considerations, we have evaluated the specified goods or services and we considered whether we control the goods or\nservices before they are provided to the customer including the three indicators of control. Based upon this analysis and our specific facts and circumstances, we concluded that\nwe are a principal for the goods or services sold through both our sell-side advertising segment and our buy-side segment because we control the specified good or service\nbefore it is transferred to the customer and we are the primary obligor in the agreement with the customer. Therefore, we report revenue on a gross basis inclusive of all supplier\ncosts. We pay suppliers for the cost of digital media, advertising inventory, data and any add-on services or features.\nOur revenue recognition policies are discussed in more detail under “—Critical Accounting Estimates and Related Policies” set forth in our Annual Report on Form 10-K\nfor the year ended December 31, 2023.\nCost of revenues\nFor cost of revenues for our sell-side advertising segment, we pay publishers a fee, which is typically a percentage of the value of the ad impressions monetized through\nour platform. Cost of revenues consists primarily of publisher media fees and data center co-location costs. Media fees include the publishing and real time bidding costs to\nsecure advertising space. For the buy-side advertising segment, cost of revenues consists primarily of digital media fees, third-party platform access fees, and other third-party\nfees associated with providing services to our customers.\nOperating expenses\nOperating expenses consist of compensation expenses related to our executive, sales, finance and administrative personnel (including salaries, commissions, stock-based\ncompensation, bonuses, benefits and taxes); general and administrative expenses (including rent expense, professional fees, independent contractor costs, selling and marketing\nfees, administrative and operating system subscription costs, insurance, amortization expense related to our intangible assets); and other expenses (including transactions that\nare unusual in nature or which are occurring infrequently).\nOther income (expense), net\nOther income. Other income includes income associated with recovery of receivables and other miscellaneous credit card rebates.\nInterest expense. Interest expense is mainly related to our debt as further described below in “—Liquidity and Capital Resources.”\nLoss on early termination of line of credit. In January 2023, we entered into a Loan and Security Agreement (the “Loan Agreement”), by and among Silicon Valley Bank\n(“SVB”), which provided for a revolving credit facility (the “Credit Facility”). In March 2023, we issued a notice of termination and recognized a loss on the write-off of the\ndeferred financing fees.\nDerecognition of tax receivable agreement liability. The Company derecognized its tax receivable agreement liability in connection with the full valuation allowance\nrecorded on the Company's deferred tax assets.\n34\nTable of Contents\nResults of Operations\nComparison of the Three and Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023\nThe following tables set forth our condensed consolidated results of operations for the periods presented (in thousands).

Sell-side advertising revenue decreased $49.4 million, or 96%, primarily due to a decrease in impression inventory. This decrease was primarily caused by\none of the Company’s sell-side customers pausing its connection to the Company during the second quarter while it investigated allegations made against the Company in a\ndefamatory article / blog post which the Company believes was part of a coordinated misinformation campaign. This customer reconnected the Company on May 22, 2024 and\nsell-side volumes have resumed but not yet at the levels experienced prior to the pause in May 2024, which affected the entirety of the quarter ended September 30, 2024. The\nCompany sold approximately 0.2 billion average monthly impressions over the three months ended September 30, 2024, a decrease of 97% from the prior period. Buy-side\nrevenue decreased $1.0 million, or 12%, over the three months ended September 30, 2023 due to a $0.7 million decrease in spending from our existing customer base, a $0.7\nmillion decrease from completion of certain one-time campaigns in 2023 partially offset by growth from existing and new customers.\nOur revenues of $53.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 decreased by $62.9 million, or 54%, from $116.1 million for the nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2023. Sell-side advertising revenue decreased $56.0 million, or 63%, primarily due to a decrease in impression inventory, resulting from the customer\nsuspension that occurred during May 2024, which negatively affected revenue in the second and third quarters of 2024. The Company sold approximately 1.4 billion average\nmonthly impressions over the nine months ended September 30, 2024, a decrease of 64% from the prior period. Buy-side revenue decreased $6.9 million, or 25%, over the nine\nmonths ended September 30, 2023 due to a $4.5\n35\nTable of Contents\nmillion decrease in spending from our existing customer base and a $3.6 million decrease from completion of certain one-time campaigns in 2023 partially offset by growth\nfrom existing and new customers.\nCost of revenues\nConsistent with the overall decrease in revenues, cost of revenues of $5.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 decreased by $42.2 million, or 88%, from\n$47.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Sell-side advertising cost of revenues decreased $42.0 million, to $2.7 million, or 121% of revenue for the three\nmonths ended September 30, 2024, compared to $44.6 million, or 86% of revenue, for the same period in 2023. The decrease in costs was primarily due to the related decrease\nin revenue, while the increase as a percentage of revenue was due to fixed costs remaining at a level consistent with the prior year. Buy-side advertising cost of revenues\ndecreased $0.2 million, to $2.9 million, or 42% of revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to $3.1 million, or 40% of revenue, for the same period in\n2023.\nConsistent with the overall decrease in revenues, cost of revenues of $38.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 decreased by $49.1 million, or 56% from\n$87.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Sell-side advertising cost of revenues decreased $46.5 million, to $30.7 million, or 93% of revenue for the nine\nmonths ended September 30, 2024, compared to $77.2 million, or 87% of revenue, for the same period in 2023. The decrease in costs was primarily due to the related decrease\nin revenue, while the 6% increase as a percentage of revenue was due to an increase in fixed costs of approximately $0.5 million related to an increase in server capacity and\napproximately $1.1 million related to new analytic and technology-related costs to support the growth as well as the mix and concentration of publishers and the related costs.\nBuy-side advertising cost of revenues decreased $2.6 million, to $8.1 million, or 40% of revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to $10.7 million, or\n39% of revenue, for the same period in 2023.\nGross profit\nGross profit was $3.5 million, or 39% of revenue, for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to $11.8 million, or 20% of revenue, for the same period in\n2023, reflecting a decrease of $8.2 million, or 70%. The change in margin for the three months ended September 30, 2024 is attributable to the mix in revenue between our\nbusiness segments as our sell-side segment has higher cost of revenues compared to our buy-side segment, as well as the consistent level of fixed costs not covered by current\nperiod sell-side revenue.\nSell-side advertising gross profit decreased $7.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same period in 2023, primarily due to a\nconsistent level of fixed costs not covered by current period sell-side revenue. Sell-side advertising gross margin was (21)% and 14% for the three months ended September 30,\n2024 and 2023, respectively. Buy-side advertising gross profit decreased $0.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the same period in the\nprior year, primarily due to the decrease in revenue. Buy-side advertising gross margin was 58% and 60% for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023,\nrespectively.\nGross profit was $14.4 million, or 27% of revenue, for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to $28.3 million, or 24% of revenue, for the same period in\n2023, reflecting a decrease of $13.8 million or 49%. The change in margin for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 is attributable to the mix in revenue between our\nbusiness segments as our sell-side segment has higher cost of revenues compared to our buy-side segment, as well as the additional sell-side fixed costs related to an increase in\nserver capacity and new analytic and technology-related costs.\nSell-side advertising gross profit decreased $9.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same period in 2023, primarily due to the\nincrease in fixed costs of approximately $1.6 million related to our servers and analytic and technology-related costs and the decrease in revenues. Sell-side advertising gross\nmargin was 7% and 13% for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Buy-side advertising gross profit decreased $4.3 million for the nine months\nended September 30, 2024, as compared to the same period in the prior year, primarily due to the decrease in revenue. Buy-side advertising gross margin was 60% and 61% for\nthe nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\n36\nTable of Contents\nOperating expenses\nThe following table sets forth the components of operating expenses for the periods presented (in thousands):\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended September\nSeptember 30, Change 30, Change\n2024 2023 Amount % 2024 2023 Amount %\nCompensation, tax and benefits $ 3,526 $ 4,747 $ (1,221) (26)% $ 12,216 $ 12,934 $ (718) (6)%\nGeneral and administrative 3,646 2,512 1,134 45 % 10,757 8,718 2,039 23 %\nTotal operating expenses $ 7,172 $ 7,259 $ (87) (1)% $ 22,973 $ 21,652 $ 1,321 6 %\nCompensation, taxes and benefits\nCompensation, taxes and benefits of $3.5 million, decreased by $1.2 million, or 26%, for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from $4.7 million for the same period\nin 2023. The decrease is due primarily to a decrease in bonus and commissions expense related to the decrease in revenue. Sequentially, compensation, taxes and benefits\ndecreased by $0.6 million, or 15%, from $4.2 million for the three months ended June 30, 2024 primarily due to lower payroll costs resulting from headcount reductions made\neffective July 1, 2024.\nCompensation, taxes and benefits of $12.2 million, decreased by $0.7 million, or 6%, for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from $12.9 million for the same\nperiod in 2023. The decrease is primarily due to a decrease in bonus and commission expense related to the decrease in revenue.\nOn July 1, 2024, we executed an internal reorganization plan that included a staff reduction, a pause on hiring and cost savings measures, which we anticipate will lower\ncertain ongoing expenses, especially as the Company incurs additional one-time expenses to regain compliance with respect to delinquent SEC filings.\nGeneral and administrative expenses\nGeneral and administrative (“G&A”) expenses of $3.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 increased from $2.5 million for the same period in 2023.\nG&A expenses as a percentage of revenue was 40% and 4% for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. During the three months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024, we incurred $1.1 million in costs to regain compliance with respect to delinquent SEC filings as well as $0.3 million higher legal expenses compared to\nthe prior year. Sequentially, G&A expenses decreased by $0.2 million, or 5%, from $3.8 million for the three months ended June 30, 2024 primarily due to lower sales and\nmarketing expenses, travel and franchise tax expense, partially offset by $0.9 million of higher compliance and legal costs.\nGeneral and administrative (“G&A”) expenses of $10.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased from $8.7 million for the same period in 2023.\nG&A expenses as a percentage of revenue was 20% and 8% for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. During the nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024, we incurred $1.3 million in costs to regain compliance with respect to delinquent SEC filings, $0.4 million higher legal expenses and $0.4 million higher\nfranchise tax expense.\nWe expect to continue to invest in and incur additional expenses associated with our operation as a public company, including increased professional fees, investment in\nautomation, and compliance costs associated with developing the requisite infrastructure required for internal controls. However, on July 1, 2024, we executed an internal\nreorganization plan that included a staff reduction, a pause on hiring and cost savings measures, which we anticipate will lower certain ongoing expenses, especially as the\nCompany ceases incurring additional one-time expenses to regain compliance with respect to delinquent SEC filings, which have now all been filed.\n37\nTable of Contents\nOther income (expense), net\nThe following table sets forth the components of other income (expense), net for the periods presented (in thousands).\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended September\nSeptember 30, Change 30, Change\n2024 2023 Amount % 2024 2023 Amount %\nInterest expense $ (1,413) $ (1,060) $ (353) 33 % $ (4,068) $ (3,104) $ (964) 31 %\nOther income 99 83 16 19 % 190 175 15 9 %\nLoss on early termination of line of credit — — — nm — (300) 300 nm\nDerecognition of tax receivable agreement liability 5,201 — 5,201 nm 5,201 — 5,201 nm\nTotal other income (expense), net $ 3,887 $ (977) $ 4,864 nm $ 1,323 $ (3,229) $ 4,552 nm\nnm – not meaningful\nOther income (expense), net primarily includes $5.2 million relating to the derecognition of tax receivable agreement liability in connection with the full valuation\nallowance recorded on the Company’s deferred tax assets during the three months ended September 30, 2024. Other income (expense), net for the three months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024 and 2023 also consists of $1.4 million and $1.1 million, respectively, of interest expense. Interest expense increased by $0.4 million due to additional net\nborrowings of $12.7 million under the Company’s credit facilities, as well as higher interest rates.\nOther income (expense), net for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 primarily includes $5.2 million relating to the derecognition of tax receivable agreement\nliability in connection with the full valuation allowance recorded on the Company’s deferred tax assets. Other income (expense), net also consists of $4.1 million and $3.1\nmillion, respectively, of interest expense. Interest expense increased by $1.0 million due to additional net borrowings of $12.7 million under the Company’s credit facilities, as\nwell as higher interest rates. Lastly, other income (expense), net for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 also includes $0.3 million related to the loss on early\ntermination of the line of credit with SVB.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nGoing Concern\nAs discussed in Note 9 to the condensed consolidated financial statements, on May 10, 2024, the Company was the subject of a defamatory article / blog post which the\nCompany believes was part of a coordinated misinformation campaign. In connection with this post, one of the Company’s sell-side customers paused its connection to the\nCompany for a couple of weeks in May 2024, which reduced sell-side sales volumes. As of the date of this report, sell-side volumes related to this customer have resumed but\nnot yet at the levels experienced prior to the pause in May 2024 which has created significant disruption in the Company’s sell-side business. The Company is actively working\nwith its partners to achieve prior volume levels. However, there can be no assurance that the Company will be able to achieve prior volume levels with its partners or on the\ntiming of achieving such volume levels. Additionally, the Company (1) incurred a net loss of $13.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 reflecting the impact\nof the sell-side disruption described above and a decrease in customer spend on the buy-side, (2) reported an accumulated deficit of $6.6 million as of September 30, 2024, (3)\nreported cash and cash equivalents of $4.1 million as of September 30, 2024, (4) has borrowed $9.7 million and $8.7 million, respectively, as of September 30, 2024 and the\ndate of this report, under the Credit Agreement which matures in July 2025, (5) was notified on April 17, 2024 that the Company’s auditor had resigned, (6) was unable to\ntimely file its 2023 annual report and quarterly reports for the first two quarters of 2024 and (7) was notified by Nasdaq on October 18, 2024 that it was not in compliance with\nNasdaq's minimum stockholders' equity requirement. The delay in filing the Company’s annual and quarterly reports disrupted existing capital-raising efforts and created\nadditional audit, legal and other expenses. These factors raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern over the next twelve months.\nThe Company anticipates sources of liquidity to include cash on hand and cash flow from operations and has taken several actions to address liquidity concerns. These\nactions include (1) a plan to reduce expenses through a staff reduction, a pause on hiring and cost savings measures that were executed on July 1, 2024, (2) working with\nlenders to provide temporary various relief from debt covenants (see Note 3 — Long-Term Debt in the condensed consolidated financial statements) while rebuilding sell-side\nvolumes, (3) putting in place a program to raise capital through an equity reserve facility (see Note 4 - Stockholders' Deficit and Stock-Based Compensation in the condensed\nconsolidated financial statements), (4) regaining compliance with respect to delinquent SEC filings on October 15, 2024 which will allow the Company to access the capital\nmarkets as well as other financing sources and (5) a plan to achieve compliance with\n38\nTable of Contents\nNasdaq's minimum stockholders' equity requirement. There can be no assurance that the Company’s actions will be successful or that additional financing will be available\nwhen needed or on acceptable terms.\nSources of Liquidity\nThe following table summarizes our cash and cash equivalents, working capital, and availability under our Credit Agreement (as defined below) on September 30, 2024\nand December 31, 2023 (in thousands):\nSeptember 30, 2024 December 31, 2023\nCash and cash equivalents $ 4,087 $ 5,116\nWorking capital (1) $ (33,813) $ 3,280\nAvailability under Credit Agreement $ 300 $ 7,000\n(1) Working capital as of September 30, 2024 includes all amounts owed to Lafayette Square, which is shown as current portion of long term debt until a waiver or amendment is finalized with Lafayette\nSquare. See Note 3 — Long-Term Debt in the notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements.\nTo fund our operations and service our debt thereafter and depending on our growth and results of operations, we may raise additional capital through the issuance of\nadditional equity and/or debt, which could have the effect of diluting our stockholders. Any future equity or debt financings may be on terms which are not favorable to us. As\nour credit facilities become due, we will need to repay, extend or replace such indebtedness. Our ability to do so will be subject to future economic, financial, business and other\nfactors, many of which are beyond our control.\nCredit Facilities\nThe terms and conditions of the various credit facilities we entered into are further described in Note 3 — Long-Term Debt in the notes to the condensed consolidated\nfinancial statements.\nEquity Reserve Facility\nThe terms and conditions of the equity reserve facility we entered into with New Circle are further described in Note 4 — Stockholders’ Deficit and Stock-Based\nCompensation in the notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements.\nHistorical Cash Flows:\nThe following table sets forth our cash flows for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 (in thousands):\nNine Months Ended September 30,\n2024 2023\nNet cash (used in) provided by operating activities $ (7,095) $ 4,481\nNet cash used in investing activities (17) (137)\nNet cash provided by (used in) financing activities 6,083 (2,909)\nNet (decrease) increase in cash and cash equivalents $ (1,029) $ 1,435\nOur cash and cash equivalents at September 30, 2024 were held for working capital and general corporate purposes. The decrease in cash and cash equivalents compared\nwith September 30, 2023, primarily resulted from $7.1 million in cash flows used in operating activities partially offset by $6.1 million in cash flows provided by financing\nactivities.\nOperating Activities\nFor the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023\nCash provided by operating activities has typically been generated from net income and by changes in our operating assets and liabilities, particularly in the areas of\naccounts receivable and accounts payable and accrued expenses, adjusted for certain non-cash and non-operating expense items such as depreciation, amortization, stock-based\ncompensation and deferred income taxes.\nFor the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net cash flows used in operating activities were $7.1 million and consisted of net loss of $13.3 million, offset by\n$4.1 million in adjustments for non-cash and non-operating items and\n39\nTable of Contents\n$2.1 million of cash inflows from working capital. Adjustments for non-cash and non-operating items mainly consisted of depreciation and amortization expense of\n$2.3 million, stock-based compensation expense of $0.8 million and deferred tax expense of $6.1 million partially offset by $5.2 million of derecognition of tax receivable\nagreement liability in connection with the full valuation allowance recorded on the Company’s deferred tax assets. The $2.1 million increase in cash resulting from changes in\nworking capital primarily consisted of a $30.9 million decrease in accounts receivable, partially offset by a $27.5 million decrease in accounts payable and a $1.5 million\ndecrease in accrued expenses such as payroll and payroll related expenses. The decrease in accounts payable and accounts receivable is mainly due to the May 2024 temporary\ndisconnection by a significant customer as a result of a customer investigating a defamatory article / blog post against the Company, as well as a payment of $8.8 million to a\nfew publishers associated with a charge recorded in 2023 related to a disputed short pay from a customer.\nFor the nine months ended September 30, 2023, net cash flows provided by operating activities were $4.5 million and mainly consisted of net income of $3.2 million and\n$3.2 million in adjustments for noncash and non-operating items, partially offset by $2.0 million of cash outflows from working capital. Adjustments for non-cash and non-\noperating items primarily consisted of depreciation and amortization expense of $2.2 million, stock-based compensation expense of $0.5 million and loss on early termination\nof line of credit of $0.3 million. The $2.0 million decrease in cash resulting from changes in working capital consisted primarily of a $28.4 million increase in accounts\nreceivable and a $0.8 million decrease in accrued liabilities, offset by a $27.3 million increase in accounts payable. The increase in accounts receivable and accounts payable is\nmainly due to the seasonal nature of the sell-side segment of the business.\nInvesting Activities\nFor the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023\nOur investing activities to date have consisted primarily of purchases of software, office furniture and leasehold improvements. For the nine months ended September 30,\n2024 and 2023, net cash flows used in investing activities of less than $0.1 million and $0.1 million, respectively, were primarily related to office furniture and leasehold\nimprovements.\nFinancing Activities\nFor the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023\nFor the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net cash provided by financing activities was $6.1 million mainly resulting from $6.7 million of proceeds from line of\ncredit and $0.2 million proceeds from warrants exercised partially offset by $0.6 million for payments on shares withheld for taxes and $0.4 million paid on term loan.\nFor the nine months ended September 30, 2023, net cash used in financing activities was $2.9 million mainly resulting from $2.0 million for distributions paid to LLC\nholders, $0.5 million paid on the term loan and $0.4 million for deferred financing costs.\nContractual Obligations and Future Cash Requirements\nAs of September 30, 2024, our principal contractual obligations expected to give rise to material cash requirements consist of the 2021 Credit Facility, the Credit\nAgreement and non-cancelable leases for our various facilities. After giving effect to the October 2024 amendments to the Company's debt facilities, we anticipate that the\nfuture minimum payments related to our current indebtedness over the next five years will be $1.0 million in 2024, $8.7 million in 2025, $28.2 million in 2026, less than\n$0.1 million in 2027, less than $0.1 million in 2028, and $0.1 million thereafter, assuming we do not refinance our indebtedness, enter into a new revolving credit facility or\nmake any further draws under the revolving facility. The leases will require minimum payments of $0.1 million in 2024, $0.3 million in 2025, $0.3 million in 2026, $0.3 million\nin 2027, $0.2 million in 2028, and $0.2 million thereafter. As of September 30, 2024, we had cash and cash equivalents of $4.1 million.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nIn addition to our results determined in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”), including, in particular operating income, net cash\nprovided by operating activities, and net income, we believe that earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, as adjusted for loss on early termination of line\nof credit, derecognition of tax receivable agreement liability and stock-based compensation (“Adjusted EBITDA”), a non-GAAP measure, is useful in evaluating our operating\nperformance. The most directly comparable GAAP measure to Adjusted EBITDA is net income.\n40\nTable of Contents\nThe following table presents a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to net (loss) income for each of the periods presented (in thousands):\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nNet (loss) income $ (6,377) $ 3,351 $ (13,338) $ 3,212\nAdd back (deduct):\nInterest expense 1,413 1,060 4,068 3,104\nAmortization of intangible assets 488 488 1,465 1,465\nStock-based compensation 149 242 811 546\nDepreciation and amortization of property, equipment and software 67 64 205 185\nLoss on early termination of line of credit — — — 300\nIncome tax expense 6,606 166 6,132 166\nDerecognition of tax receivable agreement liability (5,201) — (5,201) —\nAdjusted EBITDA $ (2,855) $ 5,371 $ (5,858) $ 8,978\nIn addition to operating income and net income, we use Adjusted EBITDA as a measure of operational efficiency. We believe that this non-GAAP financial measure is\nuseful to investors for period-to-period comparisons of our business and in understanding and evaluating our operating results for the following reasons:\n• Adjusted EBITDA is widely used by investors and securities analysts to measure a company’s operating performance without regard to items such as depreciation and\namortization, interest expense, provision for income taxes, stock-based compensation, derecognition of tax receivable agreement liability, and certain one-time items\nsuch as acquisition transaction costs, losses from early termination or redemption of credit agreements or preferred units and gains from settlements or loan\nforgiveness that can vary substantially from company to company depending upon their financing, capital structures and the method by which assets were acquired;\n• Our management uses Adjusted EBITDA in conjunction with GAAP financial measures for planning purposes, including the preparation of our annual operating\nbudget, as a measure of operating performance and the effectiveness of our business strategies and in communications with our board of directors concerning our\nfinancial performance; and\n• Adjusted EBITDA provides consistency and comparability with our past financial performance, facilitates period-to-period comparisons of operations, and also\nfacilitates comparisons with other peer companies, many of which use similar non-GAAP financial measures to supplement their GAAP results.\nOur use of this non-GAAP financial measure has limitations as an analytical tool, and you should not consider it in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our financial\nresults as reported under GAAP.\nCritical Accounting Estimates and Related Policies\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets,\nliabilities and disclosure of contingent liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Actual\nresults could differ from these estimates. The Company bases its estimates on past experiences, market conditions, and other assumptions that the Company believes are\nreasonable under the circumstances, and the Company evaluates these estimates on an ongoing basis.\nThere have been no material changes to our critical accounting estimates and related policies as compared to the critical accounting estimates and related policies described\nin our \"Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\" set forth in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2023.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nSee Note 2 to our condensed consolidated financial statements for accounting pronouncements recently adopted and accounting pronouncements not yet adopted.\n41\nTable of Contents\nITEM 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\nAs a “smaller reporting company,” we are not required to provide the information required by this Part I, Item 3.\nITEM 4. Controls and Procedures\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nThe Company maintains disclosure controls and procedures (“Disclosure Controls”) as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act that\nare designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our Exchange Act reports is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified\nin the SEC rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including the Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”) and Chief Financial\nOfficer (“CFO”) as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. The Company conducted an evaluation (the “Evaluation”), under the supervision and\nwith the participation of the CEO and CFO, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our Disclosure Controls as of September 30, 2024 pursuant to the Rules 13a-5(b)\nand 15d-15(b) of the Exchange Act. In designing and evaluating the Disclosure Controls, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well\ndesigned and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives and management was required to apply judgement in evaluating its\ncontrols and procedures. Based on this Evaluation, due to the material weaknesses described below, the CEO and CFO concluded that the Company’s Disclosure Controls were\nnot effective as of September 30, 2024.\nMaterial Weaknesses\nWe identified previously material weaknesses in our controls over the journal entry processes, information technology general controls (“ITGC”) and the technical\nevaluation of accounting matters that existed as of December 31, 2023. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal controls over financial\nreporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely\nbasis. The material weaknesses are a result of our processes and related controls not operating effectively related to journal entry processes, ITGC and the technical evaluation\nof accounting matters. As further detailed in Note 13 – Restatement (Unaudited) of the Company's consolidated financial statements included in our Annual Report on Form 10-\nK for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, the Company identified prior year accounting errors in the Company’s previously reported unaudited interim consolidated\nfinancial statements beginning March 31, 2022 resulting from the incorrect (1) accounting for and presentation of noncontrolling interests (\"NCI\"), (2) recognition of an\norganizational transaction, (3) presentation of earnings per share considering the effect of certain features of the Company's warrants and the impact of correcting the\naccounting for, and presentation of NCI, and (4) timing of the recording of the 2023 redemption of warrants. The Company’s management and the audit committee of the\nCompany’s Board of Directors concluded that it was appropriate to restate the quarterly unaudited consolidated financial statements for the quarterly periods ended March 31,\n2023, June 30, 2023, and September 30, 2023.\nOther than the described above, there were no material misstatements as a result of these material weaknesses; however, it could have resulted in a material misstatement\nto the annual or interim financial statements that would not have been prevented or detected on a timely basis.\nManagement’s Plan to Remediate the Previously Reported Material Weaknesses\nManagement has implemented remediation steps to address the material weaknesses and to improve our internal controls. Specifically, in late 2023, the Company\nengaged consultants to assist with identifying and testing the design of controls over business processes as well as ITGC. The first phase of the project was completed in the\nfirst quarter of 2024. We are now in the process of enhancing the design of certain internal control procedures and implementing new internal controls over (1) the segregation\nof duties within the journal entry process, (2) the access to program and change management within our information technology environment, and (3) the evaluation of\ntechnical accounting matters. These controls are planned to be tested for design and operating effectiveness in future periods. The Company will continue the engagement with\noutside consultants to review the revised control processes and procedures.\nWhile the Company has implemented remediation steps, the material weaknesses cannot be considered fully remediated until the improved controls have been in place\nand operate for a sufficient period of time. However, our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has concluded that, notwithstanding\nthe identified material weaknesses in our internal controls over financial reporting, the financial statements fairly present, in all material respects, our financial condition, results\nof operations and cash flows for the periods presented in conformity with U.S. GAAP.\n42\nTable of Contents\nChanges in Internal Controls Over Financial Reporting\nOther than as discussed above, there were no changes in internal controls over financial reporting during the three months ended September 30, 2024 that have materially\naffected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal controls system over financial reporting.\nPART II. Other Information\nITEM 1. Legal Proceedings\nWe may from time to time be subject to various legal or administrative claims and proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business. As of the date hereof, except as\nset forth below, we are not a party to any material legal or administrative proceedings nor are there any proceedings in which any of our directors, executive officers or\naffiliates, or any registered or beneficial stockholder, is an adverse party or has a material interest adverse to our interest. Litigation or any other legal or administrative\nproceeding, regardless of the outcome, is likely to result in substantial cost and diversion of our resources, including our management’s time and attention.\nOn May 10, 2024, the Company was the subject of a defamatory article / blog post which the Company believes was part of a coordinated misinformation campaign. In\nconnection with this post, one of the Company’s sell-side customers paused its connection to the Company while the allegations were investigated. This customer reconnected\nthe Company on May 22, 2024 and sell-side volumes have resumed but not yet at the levels experienced prior to the pause in May 2024. The Company is actively working with\nits partners to achieve prior volume levels. On May 14, 2024, the Company filed a lawsuit against the author of the defamatory article and is vigorously pursuing its rights. The\nCompany cannot make any predictions about the final outcome of this litigation matter or the timing thereof.\nOn May 23, 2024, an alleged stockholder, purportedly on behalf of the persons or entities who purchased or acquired publicly traded securities of the Company between\nApril 2023 and March 2024, filed a putative class action against the Company, certain of our officers and directors, and other defendants in the U.S. District Court for the\nSouthern District of Texas, alleging violations of federal securities laws related to alleged false or misleading disclosures made by the Company in its public filings. On July 9,\n2024, another alleged stockholder filed a similar securities class action against the Company, certain of our officers and directors, also in the Southern District of Texas. The\ntwo actions have been consolidated. Each of these complaints seeks unspecified damages, plus costs, fees, and attorneys’ fees. The Company cannot make any predictions about\nthe final outcome of this matter or the timing thereof.\nITEM 1A. Risk Factors\nAs of the date of this Quarterly Report, other than the below, there have not been any material changes to the information related to the ITEM 1A. “Risk Factors”\ndisclosure in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023. Our business involves significant risks. You should carefully consider\nthe risks and uncertainties described in our Annual Report, together with all of the other information in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, as well as our audited consolidated\nfinancial statements and related notes as disclosed in our Annual Report. The risks and uncertainties described below and in our Annual Report are not the only ones we face.\nAdditional risks and uncertainties that we are unaware of or that we deem immaterial may also become important factors that adversely affect our business. The realization of\nany of these risks and uncertainties could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, business, financial condition, results of operations, growth and future prospects as\nwell as our ability to accomplish our strategic objectives. In that event, the market price of our common stock could decline and you could lose part or all of your investment.\nIf we fail to satisfy applicable listing standards, including compliance with the rules requiring that our stockholders’ equity be at least $2.5 million, our common stock may\nbe delisted from the Nasdaq Capital Market.\nOn October 18, 2024, we received the Letter from the Staff of Nasdaq notifying the Company that it was not in compliance with the minimum stockholders’ equity requirement\nfor continued listing on The Nasdaq Capital Market under Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(b)(1). Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(b)(1) requires companies listed on The Nasdaq Capital\nMarket to maintain stockholders’ equity of at least $2.5 million. The Company’s Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the periods ended June 30, 2024 and September 30, 2024\nreported stockholders’ equity of negative $8.8 million and negative $13.3 million, respectively. The Letter further noted that as of the letter date, the Company did not have a\nmarket value of listed securities of $35 million, or net income from continued operations of $500,000 in the most recently completed fiscal year or in two of the last three most\nrecently completed fiscal years, the alternative quantitative standards for continued listing on The Nasdaq Capital Market.\n43\nTable of Contents\nNeither the notice from Nasdaq nor the Company’s non-compliance with the stockholders’ equity requirement has an immediate effect on the listing or trading of the\nCompany’s securities on Nasdaq, which currently continues to trade on The Nasdaq Capital Market under the symbol “DRCT.”\nThere can be no assurances, however, that we will be successful in regaining compliance with the continued listing requirements and maintaining the listing of our common\nstock on the Nasdaq Capital Market. Delisting from the Nasdaq could adversely affect our ability to raise additional financing through the public or private sale of equity\nsecurities, would significantly affect the ability of investors to trade our securities and would negatively affect the value and liquidity of our common stock. Delisting could also\nhave other negative results, including the potential loss of confidence by employees, the loss of institutional investor interest and fewer business development opportunities. If\nour common stock is delisted by the Nasdaq, the price of our common stock may decline and our common stock may be eligible to trade on the OTC Markets or other over-the-\ncounter quotation system, where an investor may find it more difficult to dispose of their common stock or obtain accurate quotations as to the market value of our common\nstock. Further, if we are delisted, we would incur additional costs under requirements of state “blue sky” laws in connection with any sales of our securities. These requirements\ncould severely limit the market liquidity of our common stock and the ability of our stockholders to sell our common stock in the secondary market.\nITEM 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds\nUnregistered Sales of Equity Securities\nNone.\nUse of Proceeds\nNone.\nPurchases of Equity Securities by the Issuer\nNone.\nITEM 3. Defaults Upon Senior Securities\nNone.\nITEM 4. Mine Safety Disclosures\nNot applicable.\nITEM 5. Other Information\nRule 10b5-1 Trading Plans\nDuring the nine months ended September 30, 2024, no director or officer of the Company adopted or terminated a “Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement” or “non-Rule\n10b5-1 trading arrangement,” as each term is defined in Item 408(a) of Regulation S-K.\n44\nTable of Contents\nITEM 6.

Upon the occurrence of any Event of Default, Agent shall have the right to exercise any and all rights and remedies\nprovided for herein, under the Other Documents, under the Uniform Commercial Code and at law or equity generally, including\n[Different first page setting changed from on in original to off in modified.].\n136\n159823.01008/130146990v.3\n159823.01008/150720893v.5\n[Different first page setting changed from on in original to off in modified.].\nthe right to foreclose the security interests granted herein and to realize upon any Collateral by any available judicial procedure and/or to take\npossession of and sell any or all of the Collateral with or without judicial process. Agent may enter any of any Credit Party’s premises or other\npremises without legal process and without incurring liability to any Credit Party therefor, and Agent may thereupon, or at any time thereafter, in\nits discretion without notice or demand, take the Collateral and remove the same to such place as Agent may deem advisable and Agent may\nrequire the Credit Parties to make the Collateral available to Agent at a convenient place. With or without having the Collateral at the time or place\nof sale, Agent may sell the Collateral, or any part thereof, at public or private sale, at any time or place, in one or more sales, at such price or\nprices, and upon such terms, either for cash, credit or future delivery, as Agent may elect. Except as to that part of the Collateral which is\nperishable or threatens to decline speedily in value or is of a type customarily sold on a recognized market, Agent shall give Borrowing Agent\nreasonable notification of such sale or sales, it being agreed that in all events written notice mailed to Borrowing Agent at least ten (10) days prior\nto such sale or sales is reasonable notification. At any public sale Agent or any Lender may bid (including credit bid) for and become the\npurchaser, and Agent, any Lender or any other purchaser at any such sale thereafter shall hold the Collateral sold absolutely free from any claim or\nright of whatsoever kind, including any equity of redemption and all such claims, rights and equities are hereby expressly waived and released by\neach Credit Party. In connection with the exercise of the foregoing remedies, including the sale of Inventory, Agent is granted a perpetual\nnonrevocable, royalty free, nonexclusive license and Agent is granted permission to use all of each Credit Party’s (y) trademarks, trade styles,\ntrade names, patents, patent applications, copyrights, service marks, licenses, franchises and other proprietary rights which are used or useful in\nconnection with Inventory for the purpose of marketing, advertising for sale and selling or otherwise disposing of such Inventory and\n(z) Equipment for the purpose of completing the manufacture of unfinished goods. The cash proceeds realized from the sale of any Collateral shall\nbe applied to the Obligations in the order set forth in Section 11.5 hereof. Noncash proceeds will only be applied to the Obligations as they are\nconverted into cash. If any deficiency shall arise, the Credit Parties shall remain liable to Agent and Lenders therefor.\n(b) To the extent that Applicable Law imposes duties on Agent to exercise remedies in a commercially reasonable manner, each\nCredit Party acknowledges and agrees that it is not commercially unreasonable for Agent (i) to fail to incur expenses reasonably deemed\nsignificant by Agent to prepare Collateral for disposition or otherwise to complete raw material or work in process into finished goods or other\nfinished products for disposition, (ii) to fail to obtain third party consents for access to Collateral to be disposed of, or to obtain or, if not required\nby other law, to fail to obtain governmental or third party consents for the collection or disposition of Collateral to be collected or disposed of,\n(iii) to fail to exercise collection remedies against Customers or other Persons obligated on Collateral or to remove Liens on or any adverse claims\nagainst Collateral, (iv) to exercise collection remedies against Customers and other Persons obligated on Collateral directly or through the use of\ncollection agencies and other collection specialists, (v) to advertise dispositions of Collateral through publications or media of general circulation,\nwhether or not the Collateral is of a specialized nature, (vi) to contact other Persons, whether or not in the same business as the Credit Parties (or\nany of them), for\n[Different first page setting changed from on in original to off in modified.].\n137\n159823.01008/130146990v.3\n159823.01008/150720893v.5\n[Different first page setting changed from on in original to off in modified.].\nexpressions of interest in acquiring all or any portion of such Collateral, (vii) to hire one or more professional auctioneers to assist in the\ndisposition of Collateral, whether or not the Collateral is of a specialized nature, (viii) to dispose of Collateral by utilizing internet sites that\nprovide for the auction of assets of the types included in the Collateral or that have the reasonable capacity of doing so, or that match buyers and\nsellers of assets, (ix) to dispose of assets in wholesale rather than retail markets, (x) to disclaim disposition warranties, such as title, possession or\nquiet enjoyment, (xi) to purchase insurance or credit enhancements to insure Agent against risks of loss, collection or disposition of Collateral or\nto provide to Agent a guaranteed return from the collection or disposition of Collateral, or (xii) to the extent deemed appropriate by Agent, to\nobtain the services of other brokers, investment bankers, consultants and other professionals to assist Agent in the collection or disposition of any\nof the Collateral. Each Credit Party acknowledges that the purpose of this Section 11.1(b) is to provide non-exhaustive indications of what actions\nor omissions by Agent would not be commercially unreasonable in Agent’s exercise of remedies against the Collateral and that other actions or\nomissions by Agent shall not be deemed commercially unreasonable solely on account of not being indicated in this Section 11.1(b). Without\nlimitation upon the foregoing, nothing contained in this Section 11.1(b) shall be construed to grant any rights to any Credit Party or to impose any\nduties on Agent that would not have been granted or imposed by this Agreement or by Applicable Law in the absence of this Section 11.1(b).\n(c) Without limiting any other provisions hereof:\n(i) (i) At any bona fide public sale, and to the extent permitted by Applicable Law, at any private sale, Agent shall be\nfree to purchase all or any part of the Investment Property.

Agent will not be obligated to make any sale if it determines not to do so, regardless of the fact that notice of the sale may\nhave been given. Agent may adjourn any sale and sell at the time and place to which the sale is adjourned. If the Investment Property is\ncustomarily sold on a recognized market or threatens to decline speedily in value, Agent may sell such Investment Property at any time without\ngiving prior notice to any Credit Party or other Person.\n(ii) (ii) Each Credit Party recognizes that Agent may be unable to effect or cause to be effected a public sale of the\nInvestment Property by reason of certain prohibitions of the Securities Act, so that Agent may be compelled to resort to one or more private sales\nto a restricted group of purchasers who will be obligated to agree, among other things, to acquire the Investment Property for their own account,\nfor investment and without a view to the distribution or resale thereof. Each Credit Party understands that private sales so made may be at prices\nand on other terms less favorable to the seller than if the Investment Property were sold at public sales, and agrees that Agent has no obligation to\ndelay or agree to delay the sale of any of the Investment Property for the period of time necessary to permit the\n[Different first page setting changed from on in original to off in modified.].\n138\n159823.01008/130146990v.3\n159823.01008/150720893v.5\n[Different first page setting changed from on in original to off in modified.].\nissuer of the securities which are part of the Investment Property (even if the issuer would agree), to register such securities for sale under the\nSecurities Act. Each Credit Party agrees that private sales made under the foregoing circumstances shall be deemed to have been made in a\ncommercially reasonable manner.\n(iii) (iii) The net cash proceeds arising from the disposition of the Investment Property after deducting expenses incurred\nby Agent will be applied to the Obligations pursuant to Section 11.5 hereof. If any excess remains after the discharge of all of the Obligations, the\nsame will be paid to the applicable Credit Party or to any other Person that may be legally entitled thereto.\n(iv) (iv) At any time after the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default (A) Agent may transfer any\nor all of the Investment Property into its name or that of its nominee and, after providing the Borrowers with one (1) Business Days prior written\nnotice, may exercise all voting rights with respect to the Investment Property, but no such transfer shall constitute a taking of such Investment\nProperty in satisfaction of any or all of the Obligations, and (B) Agent shall be entitled to receive, for application to the Obligations, all cash or\nstock dividends and distributions, interest and premiums declared or paid on the Investment Property.\nXI.2 Agent’s Discretion\n. Agent shall have the right in its sole discretion to determine which rights, Liens, security interests or remedies Agent may at any time\npursue, relinquish, subordinate, or modify, which procedures, timing and methodologies to employ, and what any other action to take with respect\nto any or all of the Collateral and in what order, thereto and such determination will not in any way modify or affect any of Agent’s or Lenders’\nrights hereunder as against the Credit Parties or each other.\nXI.3 Setoff\n. Subject to Section 14.12, in addition to any other rights which Agent or any Lender may have under Applicable Law, upon the occurrence\nof an Event of Default hereunder, Agent and such Lender shall have a right, immediately and without notice of any kind, to apply any Credit\nParty’s property held by Agent and such Lender or any of their Affiliates to reduce the Obligations and to exercise any and all rights of setoff\nwhich may be available to Agent and such Lender with respect to any deposits held by Agent or such Lender.\nXI.4 Rights and Remedies not Exclusive\n. The enumeration of the foregoing rights and remedies is not intended to be exhaustive and the exercise of any rights or remedy shall not\npreclude the exercise of any other right or remedies provided for herein or otherwise provided by law, all of which shall be cumulative and not\nalternative.\n[Different first page setting changed from on in original to off in modified.].\n139\n159823.01008/130146990v.3\n159823.01008/150720893v.5\n[Different first page setting changed from on in original to off in modified.].\nXI.5 Allocation of Payments After Event of Default\n.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary\ncontained in this Agreement, Agent shall act or refrain from acting or exercise any discretion (and shall be fully protected in so acting or refraining\nfrom acting) only with the consent of the Required Lenders; provided, however, that Agent shall not be required to take any action which exposes\nAgent to liability or which is contrary to this Agreement or the Other Documents or Applicable Law unless Agent is furnished with an\nindemnification reasonably satisfactory to Agent with respect thereto.\nXIV.2 Nature of Duties\n.

Lender will provide reasonable notice to Borrowers\nof such replacement rate, which will be effective on the date of the earliest event set forth in clauses (i)-(v) of this paragraph.

If there is any ambiguity as to the date of occurrence of any such event, Lender’s judgment will be dispositive. Lender\ndoes not warrant or accept responsibility for, and shall not have any liability with respect to (a) the administration of, submission of, calculation of or\nany other matter related to any replacement rate, any component definition thereof or rates referenced in the definition thereof or any alternative,\ncomparable or successor rate thereto, including whether the composition or characteristics of any such alternative, comparable or successor rate will be\nsimilar to, or produce the same value or economic equivalence of, or have the same volume or liquidity as the immediately preceding interest index rate\nor any other interest rate index, or (b) the effect, implementation or composition of any Conforming Changes.\n(c) Default Interest Rate.

The relationship between Borrowers and Lender is solely that of debtor and creditor, and Lender has no fiduciary or\nother special relationship with Borrowers, and no term or condition of any of the Loan Documents shall be construed so as to deem the relationship between\nBorrowers and Lender to be other than that of debtor and creditor.\nXI.6 Equitable Relief. Borrowers recognizes that in the event Borrowers fail to pay, perform, observe, or discharge any or all of the Obligations,\nany remedy at law may prove to be inadequate relief to Lender. Borrowers therefore agree that Lender, if Lender so requests, shall be entitled to temporary and\npermanent injunctive relief in any such case without the necessity of proving actual damages.\nXI.7 No Waiver; Cumulative Remedies. No failure on the part of Lender to exercise and no delay in exercising, and no course of dealing with\nrespect to, any right, power, or privilege under this Agreement shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any right, power, or\nprivilege under this Agreement preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, power, or privilege. The rights and remedies\nprovided for in this Agreement and the other Loan Documents are cumulative and not exclusive of any rights and remedies provided by law.\nXI.8 Successors and Assigns. This Agreement is binding upon and shall inure to the benefit of Lender and Borrowers and their respective\nsuccessors and assigns, except that Borrowers may not assign or transfer any of its rights or obligations under this Agreement without the prior written consent\nof Lender.\nXI.9 Survival. All representations and warranties made in this Agreement or any other Loan Document or in any document, statement, or certificate\nfurnished in connection with this Agreement shall survive the execution and delivery of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, and no investigation by\nLender or any closing shall affect the representations and warranties or the right of Lender to rely upon them. Without prejudice to the survival of any other\nobligation of Borrowers hereunder, the obligations of Borrowers under Sections 11.01 and 11.02 shall survive repayment of the Notes and termination of the\nCommitment.\n48\n4864-\n5069-\n8851 v.9\nXI.10 ENTIRE AGREEMENT; AMENDMENT.

IF, FOR ANY REASON, A\nCOURT OF COMPETENT JURISDICTION DETERMINES THAT TEXAS LAW SHOULD NOT APPLY TO THE PROVISIONS OF THE LOAN\nDOCUMENTS PERTAINING TO THE CREATION, PERFECTION, ENFORCEMENT, OR VALIDITY OF THE LIENS AND SECURITY INTERESTS\nCREATED PURSUANT TO THE APPLICABLE LOAN DOCUMENTS, THEN SUCH PROVISIONS (BUT ONLY THOSE PROVISIONS) SHALL BE\nGOVERNED BY, CONSTRUED, AND INTERPRETED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAWS OF THE STATE WHERE THE APPLICABLE\nCOLLATERAL IS LOCATED. THIS AGREEMENT HAS BEEN ENTERED INTO IN DALLAS COUNTY, TEXAS, AND IS PERFORMABLE FOR ALL\nPURPOSES IN DALLAS COUNTY, TEXAS. THE PARTIES HEREBY AGREE THAT ANY LAWSUIT, ACTION, OR PROCEEDING THAT IS BROUGHT\n(WHETHER IN CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE) ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO ANY OF THE LOAN DOCUMENTS, THE\nTRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED THEREBY, OR THE ACTS, CONDUCT, OR OMISSIONS OF LENDER OR ANY OF ITS AGENTS, SUCCESSORS\nOR ASSIGNS OR OF ANY OF THE OBLIGATED PARTIES IN THE NEGOTIATION, ADMINISTRATION OR ENFORCEMENT OF ANY OF THE\nLOAN DOCUMENTS SHALL BE\n49\n4864-\n5069-\n8851 v.9\nBROUGHT IN A STATE OR FEDERAL COURT OF COMPETENT JURISDICTION LOCATED IN DALLAS COUNTY, TEXAS. EACH BORROWER\nHEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY (A) SUBMITS TO THE EXCLUSIVE JURISDICTION OF SUCH COURTS, (B) WAIVES ANY\nOBJECTION IT MAY NOW OR HEREAFTER HAVE AS TO THE VENUE OF ANY SUCH LAWSUIT, ACTION, OR PROCEEDING BROUGHT IN ANY\nSUCH COURT, AND (C) FURTHER WAIVES ANY CLAIM THAT IT MAY NOW OR HEREAFTER HAVE THAT ANY SUCH COURT IS AN\nINCONVENIENT FORUM.

Each actual or proposed participant or assignee, as the case may be, shall be entitled to receive\nall information received by Lender regarding Borrowers and the Subsidiaries, including, without limitation, information required to be disclosed to a participant\nor assignee pursuant to Banking Circular 181 (Rev., August 2, 1984), issued by the Comptroller of the Currency (whether the actual or proposed participant or\nassignee is subject to the circular or not).\nXI.17 Construction. Borrowers and Lender acknowledge that each of them has had the benefit of legal counsel of its own choice and has been\nafforded an opportunity to review this Agreement and the other Loan Documents with its legal counsel and that this Agreement and the other Loan Documents\nshall be construed as if jointly drafted by Borrowers and Lender.\nXI.18 Independence of Covenants. All covenants hereunder shall be given independent effect so that if a particular action or condition is not\npermitted by any of such covenants, the fact that it would be permitted by an exception to, or be otherwise within the limitations of, another covenant shall not\navoid the occurrence of a Default if such action is taken or such condition exists.\nXI.19 WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL. TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, EACH BORROWER HEREBY\nIRREVOCABLY AND EXPRESSLY WAIVES ALL RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION, PROCEEDING, OR COUNTERCLAIM\n(WHETHER BASED UPON CONTRACT, TORT, OR OTHERWISE) ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO ANY OF THE LOAN DOCUMENTS OR THE\nTRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED\n50\n4864-\n5069-\n8851 v.9\nTHEREBY OR THE ACTIONS OF LENDER IN THE NEGOTIATION, ADMINISTRATION, OR ENFORCEMENT THEREOF. EACH PARTY HERETO\n(A) CERTIFIES THAT NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PERSON HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR\nOTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PERSON WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER AND\n(B) ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT AND THE OTHER PARTIES HERETO HAVE BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT AND THE\nOTHER LOAN DOCUMENTS BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS SECTION 11.19.\nXI.20 Additional Interest Provision. It is expressly stipulated and agreed to be the intent of Borrowers and Lender at all times to comply strictly\nwith the applicable Texas law governing the maximum rate or amount of interest payable on the indebtedness evidenced by any Note, any Loan Document, and\nthe Related Indebtedness (or applicable United States federal law to the extent that it permits Lender to contract for, charge, take, reserve or receive a greater\namount of interest than under Texas law). If the applicable law is ever judicially interpreted so as to render usurious any amount (i) contracted for, charged,\ntaken, reserved or received pursuant to any Note, any of the other Loan Documents or any other communication or writing by or between Borrowers and\nLender related to the transaction or transactions that are the subject matter of the Loan Documents, (ii) contracted for, charged, taken, reserved or received by\nreason of Lender’s exercise of the option to accelerate the maturity of any Note and/or any and all indebtedness paid or payable by Borrowers to Lender\npursuant to any Loan Document other than any Note (such other indebtedness being referred to in this Section as the “Related Indebtedness”), or\n(iii) Borrowers will have paid or Lender will have received by reason of any voluntary prepayment by Borrowers of any Note and/or the Related Indebtedness,\nthen it is Borrowers’ and Lender’s express intent that all amounts charged in excess of the Maximum Lawful Rate shall be automatically canceled, ab initio, and\nall amounts in excess of the Maximum Lawful Rate theretofore collected by Lender shall be credited on the principal balance of any Note and/or the Related\nIndebtedness (or, if any Note and all Related Indebtedness have been or would thereby be paid in full, refunded to Borrowers), and the provisions of any Note\nand the other Loan Documents shall immediately be deemed reformed and the amounts thereafter collectible hereunder and thereunder reduced, without the\nnecessity of the execution of any new document, so as to comply with the applicable law, but so as to permit the recovery of the fullest amount otherwise called\nfor hereunder and thereunder; provided, however, if any Note has been paid in full before the end of the stated term of any such Note, then Borrowers and\nLender agree that Lender shall, with reasonable promptness after Lender discovers or is advised by Borrowers that interest was received in an amount in excess\nof the Maximum Lawful Rate, either refund such excess interest to Borrowers and/or credit such excess interest against such Note and/or any Related\nIndebtedness then owing by Borrowers to Lender. Borrowers hereby agree that as a condition precedent to any claim seeking usury penalties against Lender,\nBorrowers will provide written notice to Lender, advising Lender in reasonable detail of the nature and amount of the violation, and Lender shall have sixty (60)\ndays after receipt of such notice in which to correct such usury violation, if any, by either refunding such excess interest to Borrowers or crediting such excess\ninterest against the Note to which the alleged violation relates and/or the Related Indebtedness then owing by Borrowers to Lender. All sums contracted for,\ncharged, taken, reserved or received by Lender for the use, forbearance or detention of any debt evidenced by any Note and/or the Related Indebtedness shall, to\nthe extent permitted by applicable law, be amortized or spread, using the actuarial method, throughout the stated term of such Note and/or the Related\nIndebtedness (including any and all renewal and extension periods) until payment in full so that the rate or amount of interest on account of any Note and/or the\nRelated Indebtedness does not exceed the Maximum Lawful Rate from time to time in effect and applicable to such Note and/or the Related Indebtedness for so\nlong as debt is outstanding. In no event shall the provisions of Chapter 346 of the Texas Finance Code (which regulates certain revolving credit loan accounts\nand revolving triparty\n51\n4864-\n5069-\n8851 v.9\naccounts) apply to this Note and/or any of the Related Indebtedness. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein or in any of the other Loan\nDocuments, it is not the intention of Lender to accelerate the maturity of any interest that has not accrued at the time of such acceleration or to collect unearned\ninterest at the time of such acceleration.\nXI.21 Ceiling Election. To the extent that Lender is relying on Chapter 303 of the Texas Finance Code to determine the Maximum Lawful Rate\npayable on any such Note and/or any other portion of the Obligations, Lender will utilize the weekly ceiling from time to time in effect as provided in such\nChapter 303, as amended. To the extent United States federal law permits Lender to contract for, charge, take, receive or reserve a greater amount of interest\nthan under Texas law, Lender will rely on United States federal law instead of such Chapter 303 for the purpose of determining the Maximum Lawful Rate.\nAdditionally, to the extent permitted by applicable law now or hereafter in effect, Lender may, at its option and from time to time, utilize any other method of\nestablishing the Maximum Lawful Rate under such Chapter 303 or under other applicable law by giving notice, if required, to Borrowers as provided by\napplicable law now or hereafter in effect.\nXI.22 USA Patriot Act Notice. Lender hereby notifies Borrowers that pursuant to the requirements of the Patriot Act, it is required to obtain, verify\nand record information that identifies Borrowers, which information includes the names and addresses of Borrowers and other information that will allow\nLender to identify Borrowers in accordance with the Patriot Act. Borrowers shall, promptly following a request by Lender, provide all documentation and other\ninformation that Lender requests in order to comply with its ongoing obligations under applicable “know your customer” and anti-money laundering rules and\nregulations, including the Patriot Act. Lender will require the legal entity to provide identifying information about each beneficial owner and/or individuals who\nhave significant responsibility to control, manage or direct the legal entity.\nXI.23 Confidentiality\n. LENDER ACKNOWLEDGES THAT INFORMATION RECEIVED FROM ANY BORROWER RELATING TO SUCH BORROWER OR ANY\nSUBSIDIARY OR THEIR BUSINESSES OR THE COLLATERAL FURNISHED TO SUCH PERSON PURSUANT TO THIS AGREEMENT MAY\nINCLUDE MATERIAL NON-PUBLIC INFORMATION CONCERNING SUCH BORROWER, ITS SUBSIDIARIES AND ITS OTHER AFFILIATES AND\nTHEIR RESPECTIVE SECURITIES, AND CONFIRMS THAT IT HAS DEVELOPED COMPLIANCE PROCEDURES REGARDING THE USE OF\nMATERIAL NON-PUBLIC INFORMATION AND THAT IT WILL HANDLE SUCH MATERIAL NON-PUBLIC INFORMATION IN ACCORDANCE\nWITH THOSE PROCEDURES AND APPLICABLE LAW, INCLUDING FEDERAL AND STATE SECURITIES LAWS. ALL INFORMATION,\nINCLUDING REQUESTS FOR WAIVERS AND AMENDMENTS, FURNISHED BY ANY BORROWER PURSUANT TO, OR IN THE COURSE OF\nADMINISTERING, THIS AGREEMENT MAY CONTAIN MATERIAL NON-PUBLIC INFORMATION CONCERNING THE BORROWERS, THEIR\nSUBSIDIARIES AND THEIR OTHER AFFILIATES AND THEIR RESPECTIVE SECURITIES. ACCORDINGLY, LENDER REPRESENTS TO THE\nBORROWER THAT SUCH PERSON HAS IDENTIFIED A CREDIT CONTACT WHO MAY RECEIVE INFORMATION THAT MAY CONTAIN SUCH\nMATERIAL NON-PUBLIC INFORMATION IN ACCORDANCE WITH ITS COMPLIANCE PROCEDURES AND APPLICABLE LAW, INCLUDING\nFEDERAL AND STATE SECURITIES LAWS.\nXI.24 Intercreditor Legend. Anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding, the Liens and security interests securing the obligations evidenced by\nthis agreement, the exercise of any right or\n52\n4864-\n5069-\n8851 v.9\nremedy with respect hereto and certain of the rights of the holder hereof are subject to the provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement, dated as July 7, 2023 (as\namended, restated, supplemented, substituted, replaced or otherwise modified from time to time, the “Intercreditor Agreement”), by and between Lafayette\nSquare Loan Servicing, LLC (in its capacity as agent for the LS Facility Lenders and together with its successors and assigns, the “LS Facility Agent”), for and\non behalf of the LS Facility Creditors and each other LS Facility Claimholder (each as defined in the Intercreditor Agreement) from time to time, and East West\nBank, acting on behalf of each A/R Facility Claimholder (each as defined in the Intercreditor Agreement).

(the “Company”) is filing this Annual Report on Form 10-K as of and for the year ended December 31,\n2023, which includes a restatement of the Company’s interim financial statements (collectively, the “Prior Period Financial Statements”) as\nof the periods ended March 31, 2023, June 30, 2023, September 30, 2023, and for the three months ended March 31, 2023, the three and six\nmonths ended June 30, 2023 and the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 (collectively, the “Non-Reliance Periods”).\nBackground of Restatement\nDuring the preparation of Company’s consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company\nidentified prior period accounting errors resulting from the incorrect (1) accounting for, and presentation of, noncontrolling interests\n(“NCI”), (2) recognition of an organizational transaction in connection with the Company’s initial public offering, (3) presentation of\nearnings per share considering the effect of certain features of the Company’s warrants and the impact of correcting the accounting for, and\npresentation of, NCI, and (4) timing of the recording of the 2023 redemption of warrants. As a result, on October 14, 2024, the Audit\nCommittee, in consultation with management, determined that the Prior Period Financial Statements for the Non-Reliance Periods should\nno longer be relied upon. Management and the Audit Committee have determined that these errors in the unaudited interim consolidated\nfinancial statements for the Non-Reliance Periods noted above required a restatement of the Prior Period Financial Statements (the\n“Restatement”).\nPreviously filed quarterly reports on Form 10-Q for the Prior Period Financial Statements have not been amended. Accordingly,\ninvestors should no longer rely upon the Company’s previously released financial statements for these periods and any earnings releases or\nother communications relating to these periods, and, for these periods, investors should rely solely on the financial statements and other\nfinancial data for the relevant periods included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. See Note 13, “Restatement (Unaudited),” for the\nimpact of these adjustments on each of the first three quarters of fiscal 2023.\nInternal Control Considerations\nIn connection with the restatement, management has assessed the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting as of\nDecember 31, 2023. Based on this assessment, management identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting\nas of December 31, 2023 and determined that the Company’s internal controls were not effective. In addition, management determined that\nthe Company’s disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of December 31, 2023. Management is taking steps to remediate\nthe material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures, as described in Part II, Item\n9A, “Controls and Procedures.”\nTable of Contents\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nPage\nPART I.\nITEM 1.

Business\nCompany Overview\nWe are an end-to-end, full-service advertising and marketing platform primarily focused on providing advertising technology, data-\ndriven campaign optimization and other solutions to help brands, agencies, middle market businesses deliver successful marketing results\nthat drive return on investment (\"ROI\") across both the sell- and buy-side of the digital advertising ecosystem. Direct Digital\nHoldings, Inc., incorporated as a Delaware corporation on August 23, 2021, is the holding company for DDH LLC, the business formed by\nour founders in 2018 through the acquisitions of Colossus Media and Huddled Masses. Colossus Media operates our proprietary sell-side\nprogrammatic platform (“SSP”) operating under the trademarked banner of Colossus SSP™, which provides advertisers of all sizes a\nprogrammatic advertising platform that automates the sale of ad inventory between advertisers and agencies leveraging proprietary\ntechnology. Our platform offers extensive reach within both general market and multicultural media partners to help Fortune 500 brands\nand agencies scale to reach highly sought after audiences and helps publishers find the right brands for their readers, as well as drive\nadvertising yields across all channels: web, mobile, and connected TV (\"CTV\").\nBoth buy-side advertising businesses, Orange 142 and Huddled Masses, provide technology-enabled advertising solutions and\nconsulting services to clients through multiple leading demand side platforms (“DSPs”), across multiple industry verticals such as travel,\neducation, healthcare, financial services, consumer products and other sectors with particular emphasis on small and mid-sized businesses\ntransitioning into digital with growing digital media budgets. In February 2022, we completed our initial public offering and certain\norganizational transactions which resulted in our current structure.\nIn the digital advertising space, buyers, particularly small and mid-sized businesses, can potentially achieve significantly higher ROI\non their advertising spend compared to traditional media advertising by leveraging data-driven over-the-top/connected TV (“OTT/CTV”),\nvideo and display, in-app, native and audio advertisements that are delivered both at scale and on a highly targeted basis.\nProgrammatic Marketplace Transaction\nThe Sell-Side\nOn the sell-side of the digital supply chain, the supply side platform (“SSP”), is an ad technology platform used by publishers to sell,\nmanage and optimize the ad inventory on their websites in an automated and effective way. The SSPs help the publishers monetize the\ndisplay ads, video ads, and native ads on their websites and mobile apps. The SSPs have enhanced their functionalities over the years and\nhave included ad exchange mechanisms to efficiently manage their ad\n5\nTable of Contents\ninventory. Also, SSPs allow the publishers to connect to DSPs directly instead of connecting through ad exchanges. The SSP allows\npublishers’ inventory to be opened up and made available to advertisers they may not be able to directly connect with. SSPs sell ad\ninventories in many ways — for example, directly to ad networks, via direct deals with DSPs, and most commonly via real-time bidding\n(“RTB”) auctions. The publisher makes its ad inventory available on an SSP and the SSP invites advertisers to bid based on the user’s data\nreceived. Each time the publisher’s web page loads, an ad request is sent to multiple ad exchanges and, in some cases, to the demand side\nplatform directly from the SSP. In the case of RTB media buys, many DSPs place bids for the impressions being offered by the publisher\nduring the auction. The advertiser that bids a higher amount compared to other advertisers will win the bid and, in most cases, pay the\nsecond highest price plus $0.01 and in a few cases pay the highest price for the winning impression to serve the ads.\nThe Sell-Side Platform: Colossus SSP\nColossus Media, which has been in operation since 2017, owns and operates our proprietary sell-side programmatic platform operating\nunder the trademarked banner of Colossus SSP™. The Company’s platform allows the Company to sell, in real time, ad impressions from\npublishers to buyers and provides automated inventory management and monetization tools to publishers across various device types and\ndigital ad formats. In 2023, our platform processed over 326 billion average monthly impressions, and served approximately 115,000\nbuyers. Each impression or transaction occurs in a fraction of a second. Given that most transactions take place in an auction/bidding\nformat, we continue to make investment across the platform to further reduce the processing time. In addition to the robust infrastructure\nsupporting our platform, it is also critical that we align with key industry partners in the digital supply chain.\nColossus SSP is agnostic to any specific DSP. To that end, Colossus SSP is integrated into several leading DSPs including but not\nlimited to The Trade Desk, Google 360, Zeta Global, Xandr, Beeswax, Basis and Stirista. We continue to add new DSP partners especially\nwhere we believe the DSP might offer a unique advertising base seeking to target both our multicultural and general market audiences at\nscale. We help our advertiser clients efficiently reach multicultural and diverse communities including African Americans, Hispanic/Latin,\nAsian Americans and LGBTQIA+ customers in highly targeted campaigns. This business began as a trading desk supporting advertisers’\ndesires to reach diverse audiences and we have evolved into the preeminent ad tech platform to support this goal. We partner with\npublishers that range from small to large in scale across both general and multicultural markets such as Hearst, MediaVine, Gannett, Ebony\nMagazine, Blavity, La Nacion and many others.\nColossus SSP partners with publishers to sell advertising inventory to our Colossus Media-curated clients and the open markets\n(collectively referred to as “buyers”) seeking to access the general market as well as unique multi-cultural audiences. Buyers may include\nsmall and mid-sized buyers as well as larger, Fortune 500 industry leading brands and multinational agencies, along with intermediaries\nthat sit between Colossus SSP and the end buyers.\nOur proprietary Colossus SSP was custom developed with a view towards the specific challenges facing small and mid-sized\npublishers with the belief that smaller publishers often offer a more engaged, highly-valued, unique following but experience technological\nand budgetary constraints on the path to monetization. Our business strategy on the sell-side also presents significant growth potential, as\nwe believe we are well positioned to be able to bring underserved multicultural publishers into the advertising ecosystem, thereby\nincreasing our value proposition across all clients including our large clients. We believe that our technology curates unique, highly\noptimized audiences informed by data analytics, artificial intelligence and algorithmic machine-learning technology, resulting in increased\ncampaign performance.\nThe Buy-Side\nOn the buy-side of the digital supply chain, digital advertising is the practice of delivering promotional content to users through\nvarious online and digital channels and leveraging multiple channels, platforms such as social media, email, search engines, mobile\napplications and websites to display advertisements and messages to audiences. Traditional (non-digital) advertising follows the “spray and\npray” approach to reach out to the public, but the ROI is mostly unpredictable. On the other hand, digital advertising is heavily data-driven\nand can give real-time details of advertising campaigns and outcomes across an omni channel approach. The availability of user data and\nrich targeting capabilities makes digital advertising an effective and important tool for businesses to connect with their audiences.\n6\nTable of Contents\nWe have aligned our business strategy to capitalize on significant growth opportunities due to fundamental market shifts and industry\ninefficiencies in serving the small and medium sized middle market companies that are the backbone of America. Several trends, happening\nin parallel, continue to revolutionize the way that advertising is purchased and sold. Specifically, the rise of the internet has led to a\nwholesale change in the way that media is consumed and monetized, as ads can be digitally delivered on a 1-to-1 basis. In traditional\nmethods of advertising, such as broadcast TV, ads can target a specific network, program, or geography, but not a single household or\nindividual as digital and OTT/CTV ads can. Additionally, we expect that the continued destabilization, including any potential phase out of\ndigital “cookies” in the future, will (i) create more opportunities for technology companies that provide next-generation CTV and digital\nsolutions, (ii) potentially minimize performance disruption for advertisers and agencies and (iii) potentially drive more small-to-mid sized\nbusinesses to pursue digital advertising goals through buy side businesses like ours rather than on their own.\nThe Buy-Side Business: Huddled Masses & Orange 142\nThe buy-side segment is operated through Orange 142, which has been in operation since 2013, and Huddled Masses, which has been\nin operation since 2012. The buy-side segment allows us to facilitate the procurement of digital advertising inventory (ad space) on behalf\nof our clients, as well as offer a comprehensive suite of end-to-end media solutions. We specialize in tailoring strategies that enhance\nvisibility, engage target audiences, and drive quantifiable Key Performance Indicators (“KPIs”) and tangible business outcomes.\nThe landscape of advertising is rapidly evolving, with digital channels gaining prominence over traditional advertising placements.\nOur buy-side platform is equipped with cutting-edge technology for first-party data management, media procurement, campaign execution,\nand analytics. This technological foundation empowers our clients to achieve enhanced ROI across a diverse range of digital media\nchannels. Our platform interfaces with prominent programmatic DSPs, social media networks, and search engines, granting us the ability to\nharness customer insights across multiple channels. This cross-channel approach optimizes campaign performance and ROI for our clients.\nBy adopting a platform-agnostic stance, our buy-side division offers extensive market access, enabling clients to purchase advertisements\nseamlessly across various mediums such as desktop, mobile, connected TV, streaming audio, social media, and digital billboards.\nA distinctive feature of our technology is its visibility across inventory, facilitating the creation of customized audience segments at\nscale. Based on client objectives and selected advertising channels, our buy-side platform offers forecasting and in-depth market insights.\nThese tools empower our clients to enhance their Return on Advertising Spend (“ROAS”) across channels. Our buy-side segment primarily\ncaters to small-to-mid-sized businesses, empowering them to leverage advanced advertising technology for targeted engagement. Our\ntechnology allows for direct, one-on-one interactions with potential customers, tailored to local markets, media devices, and footprints.\nLeveraging data analytics, we assess potential buyers' decision-making processes and optimize campaign strategies accordingly.\nWe understand that small and mid-sized businesses often operate within constrained marketing budgets and localized footprints. Our\nobjective is to deliver precise, ROI-focused advertising solutions that offer measurable campaign success. For the fiscal year ended\nDecember 31, 2023, we served approximately 234 small-to-mid-sized clients through our buy-side segment. Our buy-side leverages\nleading DSPs and advertising channels such as The Trade Desk, Xandr, Google DV360, Basis, Beeswax, Meta, among others. This\ncollaboration empowers us to drive increased advertising ROI and reduce customer acquisition costs for our clients. Through effective\nmarketing strategies tailored to local markets, we aim to level the playing field for our buy-side customers, allowing them to compete\neffectively with larger advertisers. We believe our competitive advantage lies in our data-driven technology, enabling us to offer front-end,\nbuy-side planning for small-to-mid-sized clients. Coupled with our access to multiple DSPs and advertising channels, we strive to deliver\nsuperior ROI.\nThroughout this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we use the terms \"client\" and \"customer\" interchangeably to refer to the businesses we\nserve.\n7\nTable of Contents\nOur Industry and Trends\nThere are several key industry trends that continue to revolutionize the way that advertising is purchased and sold. We believe that we\nare well positioned to take advantage of the rapidly evolving industry trends in digital marketing and shifts in consumer behavior,\nincluding:\nShift to Digital Advertising. Media has increasingly become more digital as a result of three key ongoing developments:\n● Advances in technology with more sophisticated digital content delivery across multiple platforms;\n● Changes in consumer behavior, including spending longer portions of the day using mobile and other devices; and\n● Better audience segmentation with more efficient targeting and measurable results.\nThe resulting shift has enabled a variety of options for advertisers to efficiently target and measure their advertising campaigns across\nnearly every media channel and device. These efforts have been led by big-budgeted, large, multi-national corporations incentivized to cast\na broad advertising net to support national brands.\nShift from Linear Broadcast to OTT/CTV. According to Emarketer, combined Linear TV and CTV ad spend will grow every year\nthrough to the end of 2027, when it will reach nearly $100 billion. CTV will account for all of the growth, with spend expecting to increase\nby $5.5 billion year over year in 2024 to $42.4 billion by end of 2027.\nThe increase in video streaming has led to online sources becoming the default for TV viewing for a majority of TV viewers with\nbroadband at home. Consumers increasingly want the flexibility and freedom to consume content on their own terms resulting in access to\npremium content at lower prices and with fewer interruptions. Advertisers are recognizing these trends and reallocating their ad budgets\naccordingly to those companies that can access audiences through a variety of existing and new channels.\nIncreased Adoption of Digital Advertising by Small and Mid-Sized Companies. Only recently have small and mid-sized businesses\nbegun to leverage the power of digital media in meaningful ways, as emerging technologies have enabled advertising across multiple\nchannels in a highly localized nature. Campaign efficiencies yielding measurable results and higher advertising ROI, as well as the needs\nnecessitated by the global economic and supply chain challenges, have prompted these companies to begin utilizing digital advertising on\nan accelerated pace. We believe this market is rapidly expanding, and that small to-mid-sized advertisers will continue to increase their\ndigital spend.\nSignificant Increase in Multicultural Audience and Targeted Content. As digital media has grown and emerging marketing channels\ncontinue to gain adoption, audience segmentation, including on multicultural lines, has become more granular. A growing and increasing\nsegment of those audiences is the multicultural audience, which has been traditionally underserved in the industry. According to the U.S.\nCensus Bureau, racial minority and multi-racial consumers represent 41% of the U.S. population and are projected to be the numerical\nmajority in the U.S. by 2044. When we expand the definition of multicultural to include LGBTQIA+ customers, the numbers are\nsignificantly greater. Advertisers and publishers alike face the same challenge. Advertisers are seeking new avenues and opportunities to\nconnect with multicultural audiences in their natural media consumption environments while publishers are producing unique content to\nattract loyal consumers. The advantage will go to those innovative companies able to directly connect both sides to those audiences and\nleverage the insights flowing from those connections.\nLocal Ad Buying Becoming More Programmatic. Programmatic advertising enables advertisers to precisely target local audiences\nand increasingly an “audience of one.” Large amounts of inventory have been consolidated, allowing local advertisers to then be more\nselective about where, when and to whom they show their ads. The technology behind programmatic advertising, such as geotargeting, IP\naddress identification, 1-3-5 radius store location advertising, has provided the opportunity for targeted local advertising to smaller\nadvertisers, which technologies in the past have been more easily available to larger national advertisers. We believe being able to go into a\nprogrammatic platform and target\n8\nTable of Contents\nthe same audience across all digital inventory is a major competitive advantage. Additionally, we also believe that the ability to customize\naudiences to the needs of local providers is a significant benefit for local advertisers since they are able to deviate from the broad audience\nsegments defined by national advertisers. Higher customer engagement translates into higher retention and extended customer lifecycle\nrepresenting the opportunity to sell and upsell customers. We believe the local advertising market remains in the early stages of\nunderstanding and leveraging these capabilities.\nPotential Death of Cookies Could Destabilize Small-to-Mid-Size Business Ad Market. As the advertising industry faces a potential\nphase out of third-party cookies, small-to-mid-sized business are starting to face greater challenges in the adoption and transition to digital.\nWhile first- party data driven by first-party cookies will still have broad-based advertising support, more robust advertising efforts could\nexperience some level of performance degradation. Specifically, the inability to tie ad impressions to an identity could add to the list of\nchallenges already being faced by small-to-mid-sized businesses. However, we expect that any destabilization will create significant\nopportunities for next-generation technology companies, including us, that can provide media buying solutions and minimize performance\ndisruption for advertisers and agencies.\nOur Customers\nOn the sell-side of our business, our customers (or buyers) include DSPs, agencies and individual advertisers. We have broad exposure\nto the ecosystem of buyers, reaching on average approximately 115,000 advertisers per month in 2023 compared to approximately 114,000\nin 2022. As spending on programmatic advertising increasingly becomes a larger share of the overall ad spend, advertisers and agencies are\nseeking greater control of their digital advertising supply chains. To take advantage of this industry shift, we have entered into Supply Path\nOptimization (“SPO”) agreements directly with customers which address acceptable advertisements and data usage. As part of these\nagreements, we provide advertisers and agencies with benefits ranging from custom data and workflow integrations, product features,\nvolume-based business terms, and visibility into campaign performance data and methodology. As a result of these direct relationships, our\nexisting advertisers and agencies are incentivized to allocate an increasing percentage of their advertising budgets to our platform.\nOn the buy-side of our business, our customers consist of purchasers of digital advertising inventory (ad space). We serve the needs of\nover 230 small and mid-sized clients, consisting of advertising buyers, including small and mid-sized companies, large advertising holding\ncompanies (which may manage several agencies), independent advertising agencies and mid-market advertising service organizations.\nMany advertising agencies and advertising holding companies have a decision-making function that is generally highly decentralized, such\nthat purchasing decisions are made, and relationships with advertisers are located, at the agency, local branch or division level. We serve a\nvariety of customers across multiple industries including travel/tourism (including destination marketing organizations or “DMOs”),\neducation, energy, consumer packaged goods (“CPG”) healthcare, financial services (including cryptocurrency technologies) and other\nindustries. Some of the significant brands we work with on the buy-side include Visit Virginia Beach, Pigeon Forge, Emory University and\nCity of Colorado Springs.\nOur Competitive Strengths\nWe believe the following attributes and capabilities form our core strengths and provide us with competitive advantages:\n● End-to-End, Technology-Driven Solution Focused on Providing Higher Value to Underserved Markets. Our small and\nmid-sized client base is seeking high ROI, low customer acquisition costs and measurable results that grow their topline.\nBecause we focus exclusively on the first and last miles of media delivery, we engage clients at the front-end of the digital\nsupply chain with the first dollar of spend, in many cases prior to agency involvement, and drive data-driven results across\nthe digital advertising ecosystem to optimize ROI. We offer an end-to-end solution that enables us to set and carry- out the\ndigital campaign strategy of our clients in full, in a more efficient and less expensive manner than some of our competitors.\nSmall and mid-sized companies are looking for partners that can drive results across the entire digital supply chain. On the\nColossus SSP, we offer a wide range of niche and general market publishers an opportunity to maximize advertising revenue\ndriven by technology-enabled targeted advertising to multicultural and other\n9\nTable of Contents\naudiences. We believe our technology’s ability to tailor our efforts to our client-specific needs and inform those efforts with\ndata and algorithmic learnings is a long-term advantage to serving this end of the market.\n● Comprehensive Processes Enhance Ad Inventory Quality and Reduce Invalid Traffic (“IVT”). We operate what we\nbelieve to be one of the most comprehensive processes in the digital advertising ecosystem to enhance ad inventory quality.\nIn the advertising industry, inventory quality is assessed in terms of IVT, which can be impacted by fraud such as “fake\neyeballs” generated by automated technologies set up to artificially inflate impression counts. Through our platform design\nand proactive IVT mitigation efforts, including our accredited verification partners, we address IVT on a number of fronts,\nincluding sophisticated technology, which detects and avoids IVT on the front end; direct publisher and inventory\nrelationships, for supply path optimization; and ongoing campaign and inventory performance review, to ensure inventory\nquality and brand protection controls are in place.\n● Curated Data-Driven Sell-Side Platform to Support Customers. The Colossus SSP enables us to gather data to build and\ndevelop unique product offerings for our clients. The SSP works with strategic data partners to allow for audience curation.\nThe ability to curate our supply allows us to serve a broad range of clients with challenging and unique advertising needs and\noptimize campaign performance in a way that our siloed competitors are unable to do. This model, together with our\ninfrastructure solutions and ability to quickly access excess server capacity, helps us scale up efficiently and allows us to\ngrow our business at a faster pace than a pure buy-side solution would.\n● High Client Retention Rate and Cross Selling Opportunities. During 2023, we had approximately 115,000 buyers on the\nsell-side and approximately 234 clients on the buy-side. They understand the independent nature of our platform and\nrelentless focus on driving ROI-based results. Our value proposition is complete alignment across our entire digital supply\nplatform beginning with the first dollar in and last dollar out. We are technology and media agnostic, and our clients trust us\nto provide the best opportunity for success of their brands and businesses. As a result, our clients have been loyal, with\napproximately 90% client retention amongst the clients that represent approximately 80% of our revenues for the fiscal years\nended December 31, 2023 and 2022. In addition, we cultivate client relationships through our pipeline of managed and\nmoderate serve clients that conduct campaigns through our platform. The managed services delivery model allows us to\ncombine our technology with a highly personalized offering to strategically design and manage advertising campaigns.\n● Growing and Profitable Business Model. For 2022 and 2023, we grew our revenue steadily and have increased our gross\nprofit, which we believe demonstrates the power of our technology platform, the strength of our client relationships and the\nleverage inherent to our business model. For the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, our revenue was $157.1 million\nand $89.4 million, respectively. For the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, our gross profit was $37.6 million and\n$29.3 million, respectively.\n● Solutions for the Potential Destabilization of Advertising. As the advertising industry faces a potential phase out of third-\nparty cookies in the future, we have begun integrating identity resolution solutions in order to provide our clients with\naccurate, targeted advertising without cookies. We will be investing in artificial intelligence and machine learning technology\nto further build out our data graph from first-party and third-party data sources and will facilitate matches and relations\nbetween the disparate sets of data.\n● Experienced Management Team. Our management team, led by our two founders, has significant experience in the digital\nadvertising industry and with identifying and integrating acquired businesses. Specifically, our two founders, Chairman and\nChief Executive Officer Mark Walker and President Keith Smith, have over 45 years of combined experience. The team has\nled digital marketing efforts for companies both large and small, with unique experience leading small and mid-sized\ncompanies through the challenges of transitioning platforms into the programmatic advertising space. Our Chief Technology\nOfficer, Anu Pillai, is experienced in developing digital platforms on both the sell-side and buy-side, ranging from consumer-\npackaged goods (“CPG”) companies focused on e-commerce to publishers seeking to monetize their ad inventory. Our Chief\nFinancial Officer, Diana Diaz, a former audit senior manager at Deloitte &\n10\nTable of Contents\nTouche LLP, has significant experience working as CFO of a high growth microcap public company for more than ten years\nas well as other CFO and leadership roles at public and nonpublic companies. Our Chief Growth Officer, Maria Lowrey, was\nnamed a top 100 Diversity Leader in Energy and has over 20 years of senior level leadership experience working across\nenergy, home services, and steel sectors.\n● ESG-Centered Strategy. We believe our business strategy promotes the ideals of a business focused on environmental,\nsocial and governance (“ESG”) issues, with particular focus on social and governance issues. Our unique focus has already\nresulted in numerous partnerships with both large and small advertisers as the multicultural market continues to grow and\nexpand. In addition, we have been designated as a top minority owned business and National Minority Supplier Diversity\nCouncil (“NMSDC”) certified to work with top Fortune 500 companies, brands and agencies to help them reach their social\ndiversity, equity and inclusion (“DEI”) objectives and budget commitments across our media and advertising platform.\nDiversity\nWe believe it is essential for our organization, from top to bottom, to understand and relate to the issues our clients face on both the\nsell-side and buy-side. Our founders are of African-American descent and founded our Company on multicultural principles designed to\nalleviate the challenges that buyers and publishers face accessing an expansive multicultural market. Our management team reflects the\ntone and tenor of our multicultural audiences and our policies on gender equality and gender pay. More than 70% of our management are\nwomen and/or identify as being from a diverse background, including all five of our executive officers. We manage our hiring processes in\nfull compliance with applicable laws and regulations, including anti-discrimination statutes.\nEnvironmental\nOur platform requires significant amounts of information to be stored across multiple servers and we anticipate those amounts to\nincrease significantly as we grow. We are committed to ensuring that we incorporate environmental excellence in our business mindset.\nEnergy use, recycling practices and resource conservation are a few of the factors we take into consideration in building our technological\ninfrastructure, selecting IT partners, and utilizing key suppliers. In the first half of 2023, we transitioned our server platform to HPE\nGreenlake, which is centered on environmentally-friendly operations and marketed as “Greenlake-as-a-service,” through which we promote\nits energy conservation principles. We opted for HPE GreenLake’s as-a-service model because it represents a shift towards supplier\nresponsibility for the elimination of wasted infrastructure and processing capacity. Our needs are metered and monitored, providing insights\nthat can lead to significant resource and energy efficiencies by avoiding overprovisioning and optimizing the IT refresh cycle. This enables\nus to bring existing equipment to the highest levels of utilization and to eliminate idling equipment that drains energy and resources,\nyielding both environmental and financial savings.\nOur Growth Strategy\nWe have a multi-pronged growth strategy designed to continue to build upon the momentum we have generated so far in order to\ncreate opportunities. Our key growth strategies include our plans to:\n● Continue to expand our highly productive “on the ground” sell-side and buy-side sales teams throughout the United States,\nwith a particular focus on markets where we believe our client base is underserved.\n● Utilize management’s experience to identify and close additional acquisition opportunities to accelerate expansion into new\nindustry verticals, grow market share and enhance platform innovation capabilities.\n● Leverage our end-to-end product offering as a differentiating factor to win new business and cross- sell to existing clients.\n11\nTable of Contents\n● Aggressively grow the Colossus SSP advertising inventory, including both multicultural and general inventory. We aim to\nincrease our omni-channel capabilities to focus on highest growth content formats such as OTT/CTV audio (such as podcasts,\netc.), in-app and others.\n● Continue to innovate and develop our data management platform and proprietary data graph and collect first-party data to\ninform decision-making and optimize client campaigns.\n● Invest in further optimization of our infrastructure and technology solutions to maximize revenue and operating efficiencies.\nRevenues\nWe generate revenues through a broad range of offerings throughout our technology platforms. On the sell-side of our business,\nthrough our proprietary Colossus SSP, we generate revenues by enabling programmatic media buyers to buy ad inventory from our host of\npublishers and content creators aggregated to provide access to buyers at scale. Advertisers and agencies often have a large portfolio of\nbrands requiring a variety of campaign types and support for a wide array of inventory formats and devices, including OTT/CTV, video and\ndisplay, in-app, native and audio. Our omni-channel proprietary technology platform is designed to maximize these various advertising\nchannels, which we believe is a further driver of efficiency for our buyers. As of December 31, 2023, the platform is comprised of\npublishers across multiple channels including OTT/CTV, display, native, in-app, online video (“OLV”), audio and digital out-of-home\n(“DOOH”). Through our platform during 2023, we processed approximately 326 billion monthly impressions across many unique\naudiences including multicultural audiences at scale with 41 billion, or 13%, of those impressions being diverse and multicultural- focused,\nincluding African Americans, Latin Americans, Asian Americans and LGBTQIA+ customers. We provide our publishers with access to a\nhost of media buyers on a daily basis. Our publishers, through our platform, had access to approximately 115,000 buyers of ad inventory in\nDecember 2023. We have a sales team working on behalf of our publishers to enlist more ad buyers across all media channels to generate\nmore revenue for our publishers. The Colossus SSP continues to expand its capabilities to give our content providers more avenues to\ndistribute ad inventory such as OTT/CTV, digital audio, DOOH, etc. and inform our publishers to enhance their ad selling needs by\ndistributing content in various forms to meet the rising demands of the ad buying community.\nOn the buy-side of our business, our team of savvy digital strategists, skilled software developers, experienced ad buyers or traders,\nexpert technicians and data analysts drives the execution of advertising strategies across an array of digital channels including\nprogrammatic advertising, social, paid search, mobile, native, email, video advertising, OTT/CTV, audio, DOOH and more. In the world’s\nconstantly shifting and expanding digital landscape, where it is easy for “set it and leave it” mentalities and impersonal algorithms to steer\ndigital advertising campaigns, our data-driven approach enables customized ROI-focused outcomes for our clients.\nWe have a wide variety of small and mid-sized companies representing numerous industry verticals such as travel, education,\nhealthcare, financial services, and consumer goods and services. We are typically engaged on an “insertion order” or master services\nagreement, with the typical engagement driven by the campaign goals of the client. For our mid- sized clients, we typically engage on a\nlong-term contractual basis ranging from one to five years, while our smaller clients tend to engage on a shorter duration of less than one\nyear despite the fact that many of our smaller clients have been long-term clients well in excess of one year.\nMarketing, Sales, and Distribution\nOur sales organization focuses on marketing our technology solution to increase the adoption of our products by existing and new\nsellers and buyers. We market our products and services to sellers and buyers through our national sales team that operates from various\nlocations across the United States. This team leverages market knowledge and expertise to demonstrate the benefits of programmatic\nadvertising and how we can drive better performance and results for our clients. We are focused on expanding our national sales presence\nprimarily by growing our sales personnel presence in certain states and regions around the country in which we currently operate and/or are\nseeking to establish a presence. We typically seek to add experienced sales personnel with an established track record and/or verifiable\nbook of business and client relationships.\n12\nTable of Contents\nFor Colossus SSP, our professional services team manages each new DSP or publisher/seller integration while the buyer team focuses\non the unique challenges and issues arising with our inventory buys. For the buy-side platform, our sales team has three fundamental\ncomponents: (1) a consulting services team that advises clients on a more enterprise level in the design and implementation of a digital\nmedia strategy; (2) a professional services team with each seller integration to assist sellers in getting the most value from our solution; and\n(3) our client services team that works closely with clients to manage and/or support campaigns.\nOur marketing initiatives are focused on managing our brand, increasing market awareness and driving advertising spend to our\nplatform. We often present at industry conferences, create custom events and invest in public relations. In addition, our marketing team\nadvertises online and in other forms of media, creates case studies, sponsors research, writes whitepapers, publishes marketing collateral,\ngenerates blog posts and undertakes client research studies.\nCompetition\nSell-Side Competition\nOn the sell-side of the digital advertising industry, competition is robust but more limited in that there were approximately 80 SSPs in\noperation including Pubmatic, Magnite and Acuity Ads. We continue to refine our offering so that it remains competitive in scope, ease of\nuse, scalability, speed, data access, price, inventory quality, brand security, customer service, identity protection and other technological\nfeatures that help sellers monetize their inventory and buyers increase the return on their advertising investment. While our industry is\nevolving rapidly and becoming increasingly competitive, we believe that our solution enables us to compete favorably on these factors. We\nachieve this by ensuring that we have the right integrations and implementations in place. Our traffic verification partner is directly\nintegrated within our exchange to ensure inventory quality on a real-time basis. We partner with an accredited Media Rating Council\nvendor to provide an added layer of security through sophisticated IVT detection and filtration. We believe that our verification with the\nTrustworthy Accountability Group indicates our status as a trusted player in the digital advertising ecosystem. Through our direct\nintegration with The Media Trust’s Creative Quality Assurance (QA) product, we detect and eliminate the serving of malicious ads in real\ntime, and by transacting on a universal cookie ID, consumers are served more relevant ads, advertisers reach more valuable users and\npublishers can match their audience data. In the end, we believe these factors enable our sales team to promote the advantages of our\nplatform and drive greater adoption of Colossus SSP.\nBuy-Side Competition\nThe buy-side digital advertising industry is a very competitive, fast-paced industry with ongoing technological changes, new market\nentrants and behavioral changes in content consumption. Over time, digital advertising expenditure has predominantly flowed through a\nselect group of major corporations, notably Google, Meta, and Amazon, all of which maintain their advertising inventory. These entities\nrepresent formidable competition as we compete for digital advertising inventory and market demand.\nDespite the dominance of large companies, there is still a large addressable market that is highly fragmented and includes many\nproviders of transaction services with which we compete. There has been rapid evolution and consolidation in the advertising technology\nindustry, and we expect these trends to continue, thereby increasing the capabilities and competitive posture of larger companies,\nparticularly those that are already dominant in various ways, and enabling new or stronger competitors to emerge. Based on the current\nfocus of our competitors, there is even more pronounced opportunity for engagement in the underserved and multicultural markets on\nwhich we focus our Company’s efforts today.\nSeasonality in Our Business\nIn the advertising industry, companies commonly experience seasonal fluctuations in revenue. For example, in our sell-side advertising\nsegment, many advertisers allocate the largest portion of their budgets to the fourth quarter of the calendar year in order to coincide with\nincreased holiday purchasing. Historically, for our buy-side advertising segment, the second and third quarters of the year reflect our\nhighest levels of advertising activity and the first quarter reflects the\n13\nTable of Contents\nlowest level of such activity. We expect our revenue to continue to fluctuate based on seasonal factors that affect the advertising industry as\na whole.\nHuman Capital Resources\nAs of December 31, 2023, we had 90 employees, the majority of whom are full-time employees. None of our employees are currently\ncovered by a collective bargaining agreement. We have not experienced any labor-related work stoppages and believe our relations with our\nemployees are good. We promote a diverse workforce and believe that it fosters innovation and cultivates an environment filled with\nunique perspectives. As a result, in compliance with applicable laws and regulations, diversity and inclusion are part and parcel of our\nability to meet the needs of our customers. Respect for human rights and a commitment to ethical business conduct are fundamental to our\nbusiness model. In addition, we measure employee engagement on an ongoing basis, as we believe an engaged workforce leads to a more\ninnovative, productive and profitable company. We obtain feedback from our employees to implement programs and processes designed to\nkeep our employees connected with the Company.\nIntellectual Property\nThe protection of our technology and intellectual property is an important component of our success. We rely on intellectual property\nlaws, including trade secret, copyright and trademark laws in the U.S. and abroad, and use contracts, confidentiality procedures, non-\ndisclosure agreements, employee disclosure and invention assignment agreements and other contractual rights to protect our intellectual\nproperty.\nWe own intellectual property related to our owned sites. We acquired the license to our proprietary Colossus SSP platform in 2022\nfrom our third-party developer. As of December 31, 2023, we owned approximately four websites and URLs in varying stages of\ndevelopment to support our marketers advertising efforts. We also hold eight U.S. registered trademarks.\nAvailable Information\nWe file annual, quarterly and current reports, proxy statements and other information with the Securities and Exchange Commission\n(“SEC”) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (“Exchange Act”).

Risk Factors\nSummary of Material Risk Factors\nThe following is a summary of some of the risks and uncertainties that could materially adversely affect our business, financial\ncondition and results of operations and could make an investment in our Company speculative or risky. You should be aware that these risk\nfactors and other information may not describe every risk facing our Company. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us\nmay also materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and/or results of operations. You should read this summary together\nwith the more detailed description of each risk factor contained below. Some of these material risks include:\n● Our credit facilities subject us to operating restrictions and financial covenants that impose risk of default and may restrict\nour business and financing activities.\n14\nTable of Contents\n● The substantial doubt raised about our ability to continue as a going concern, which may hinder our ability to obtain future\nfinancing;\n● We may not be able to secure additional financing on favorable terms, or at all, to meet our future capital needs, which may in\nturn impair our growth.\n● We are currently ineligible to file new short-form registration statements on Form S-3, which may impair our ability to raise\ncapital on terms favorable to us, in a timely manner or at all.\n● If we fail to satisfy applicable listing standards, including compliance with the rules requiring timely filing of our periodic\nreports with the SEC, our common stock may be delisted from the Nasdaq Capital Market;\n● The restatement of our consolidated financial statements for the quarterly periods in the year ended December 31, 2023 has\nsubjected us to a number of additional costs, risks and uncertainties;\n● High customer concentration exposes us to various risks faced by our major customers and may subject us to significant\nfluctuations or declines in revenues.\n● We are subject to payment-related risks and, if our clients do not pay or dispute their invoices, our business, financial\ncondition and operating results may be adversely affected.\n● If we fail to detect advertising fraud, we could harm our reputation and hurt our ability to execute our business plan.\n● Operational and performance issues with our platform, whether real or perceived, including a failure to respond to\ntechnological changes or to upgrade our technology systems, may adversely affect our business, operating results and\nfinancial condition.\n● If the use of third-party “cookies,” mobile device IDs or other tracking technologies is restricted without similar or better\nalternatives, our platform’s effectiveness could be diminished and our business, results of operations, and financial condition\ncould be adversely affected.\n● Unfavorable publicity and negative public perception about our industry, particularly concerns regarding data privacy and\nsecurity relating to our industry’s technology and practices, and perceived failure to comply with laws and industry self-\nregulation, could adversely affect our business and operating results.\n● Failure to manage our growth effectively could cause our business to suffer and have an adverse effect on our business,\noperating results and financial condition.\n● Future acquisitions or strategic investments could be difficult to identify and integrate, divert the attention of management,\nand could disrupt our business, dilute stockholder value and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial\ncondition.\n● Changes in legislative, judicial, regulatory or cultural environments relating to information collection, use and processing\nmay limit our ability to collect, use and process data. Such developments could cause revenue to decline, increase the cost of\ndata, reduce the availability of data and adversely affect the demand for our products and services.\n● Our buy-side clients include destination marketing organizations (“DMOs”), which often operate as public/private\npartnerships involving a national, provincial, state and local governmental entity.\n● The requirements of being a public company may strain our resources and divert our management’s attention.\n15\nTable of Contents\n● The digital advertising industry is intensely competitive, and if we do not effectively compete against current and future\ncompetitors, our business, results of operations, and financial condition could be harmed.\n● A significant inadvertent disclosure or breach of confidential and/or personal information we hold, or of the security of our or\nour customers’, suppliers’ or other partners’ computer systems, could be detrimental to our business, reputation and results of\noperations.\n● We are a holding company and our principal asset is our equity interest in DDH LLC, and, accordingly, we depend on\ndistributions from DDH LLC to pay our taxes, expenses and dividends.\n● DDH is controlled by DDM, whose interests may differ from those of our public stockholders.\n● If we fail to maintain or implement effective internal controls, we may not be able to report financial results accurately or on\na timely basis, or to detect fraud, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and the per share price of our\nClass A Common Stock.\nRisks Related to our Business\nOur credit facilities subject us to operating restrictions and financial covenants that impose risk of default and may restrict our business\nand financing activities.\nOur credit facilities, as defined in Note 3 – Long-Term Debt in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, contain affirmative and\nnegative covenants that, among other things, require us to maintain a maximum net leverage ratio of 3.50 to 1.00, a minimum fixed charge\ncoverage ratio of 1.50 (or 1.25) to 1.00, a maximum total funded debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 3.50 to 1.00 and a minimum liquidity of\n$1,000,000. The maximum net leverage ratio changes to 3.25 to 1.00 in 2024 and changes to 3.00 to 1.00 in 2025 with additional\nincremental tightening of the ratio to 2.50 to 1.00 on June 30, 2026 and thereafter until maturity of the credit facilities. The maximum total\nfunded debt-to-EBITDA ratio changes to 3.25 to 1.00 in March 2024 and changes to 3.00 to 1.00 on June 30, 2025. These covenants may\nlimit the amount of our borrowing available under the credit facilities, affect our ability to operate our business and may limit our ability to\nhave sufficient funding or otherwise to take advantage of potential business opportunities as they arise.\nOur ability to comply with the covenants and restrictions contained in the credit facilities may be affected by events beyond our\ncontrol, including prevailing economic, financial, and industry conditions. If the market or other economic conditions deteriorate, our\nability to comply with these covenants may be impaired. A failure to comply with these provisions could result in a default or an event of\ndefault. Upon an event of default, unless waived, the lenders could elect to terminate commitments, cease making further loans, cause its\nloans to become due and payable in full and force us into bankruptcy or liquidation. If the payment of our debt is accelerated, our assets\nmay be insufficient to repay such debt in full, and the holders of our stock could experience a partial or total loss of their investment.\nOur ability to (1) renew our existing term credit facility, which matures on December 3, 2026, (2) renew our existing revolving credit\nfacility, which matures on July 7, 2025 or (3) enter into any new credit facility may be limited due to various factors, including the status of\nour business, global credit market conditions and perceptions of our business or industry by sources of financing. In addition, if credit is\navailable, lenders may seek more restrictive covenants and higher interest rates that may reduce our borrowing capacity, increase our costs\nand reduce our operating flexibility.\nThere is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern, which may hinder our ability to obtain future financing.\nOur audited consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2023 have been prepared under the assumption that we will continue\nas a going concern for the next twelve months. As of December 31, 2023, we had cash and cash equivalents of $5.1 million and an\naccumulated deficit of $2.5 million. We do not believe that our cash and cash equivalents are sufficient for the next twelve months. As a\nresult of our financial condition and other factors described herein, there is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going\nconcern. Among these factors include the May 2024 pause by a\n16\nTable of Contents\nsell-side customer of its connection to the Colossus SSP resulting from allegations contained in a defamatory article / blog post, which we\nbelieve was part of coordinated misinformation campaign. Our ability to continue as a going concern will depend on our ability to\nsuccessfully manage costs after executing a reorganization plan on July 1, 2024, work with partners to achieve prior volume levels of sells-\nside revenue and obtain additional funding, as to which no assurances can be given. We continue to analyze various alternatives, including\npotentially obtaining additional or expanded lines of credit, debt or equity financings, or other arrangements. Our future success depends on\nour ability to raise capital and/or implement the various strategic alternatives discussed above. We cannot be certain that these initiatives or\nraising additional capital, whether through selling additional debt or equity securities or obtaining a line of credit or other loan, will be\navailable to us or, if available, will be on terms acceptable to us. If we issue additional securities after the closing of this offering to raise\nfunds, these securities may have rights, preferences, or privileges senior to those of our common stock, and our current shareholders may\nexperience dilution. If we are unable to obtain funds when needed or on acceptable terms, we may be required to modify our business plans\nand operations, further cut operating costs, forego future development and other opportunities, or even terminate our operations.\nWe may not be able to secure additional financing on favorable terms, or at all, to meet our future capital needs, which may in turn\nimpair our growth.\nWe intend to continue to grow our business, which may require additional capital to develop new features or enhance our platform,\nimprove our operating infrastructure, finance requirements or acquire complementary businesses and technologies. Accordingly, we may\nneed to engage in additional equity or debt financings to secure additional capital. If we raise additional funds through future issuances of\nequity or convertible debt securities, our existing stockholders could suffer significant dilution, and any new equity securities we issue\ncould have rights, preferences and privileges superior to those of holders of our Class A Common Stock. Any debt financing that we secure\nin the future could involve restrictive covenants relating to our capital raising activities and other financial and operational matters, which\nmay make it more difficult for us to obtain additional capital and to pursue business opportunities. If we are unable to secure additional\nfunding on favorable terms, or at all, when we require it, our ability to continue to grow our business to react to market conditions could be\nimpaired and our business may be harmed.\nAs a result of our failure to timely file our Annual Report on Form 10-K for year ended December 31, 2023, and our Quarterly\nReports on Form 10-Q for the quarters ended March 31, 2024 and June 30, 2024, we are currently ineligible to file new short-form\nregistration statements on Form S-3, which may impair our ability to raise capital on terms favorable to us, in a timely manner or at all.\nForm S-3 permits eligible issuers to conduct registered offerings using a short-form registration statement that allows the issuer to\nincorporate by reference its past and future filings and reports made under the Exchange Act. In addition, Form S-3 enables eligible issuers\nto conduct primary offerings “off the shelf” under Rule 415 of the Securities Act. The shelf registration process, combined with the ability\nto forward incorporate information, allows issuers to avoid delays and interruptions in the offering process and to access the capital markets\nin a more expeditious and efficient manner than raising capital in a standard registered offering pursuant to a Registration Statement on\nForm S-1.\nAs a result of the delayed filing of several of our periodic reports with the SEC, we will not be eligible to register the offer and sale of\nour securities using a registration statement on Form S-3 until one year from the date we regained and maintain status as a current filer.\nShould we wish to register the offer and sale of our securities to the public prior to the time we are eligible to use Form S-3, both our\ntransaction costs and the amount of time required to complete the transaction could increase, making it more difficult to execute any such\ntransaction successfully and potentially harming our financial condition.\nFurthermore, the Company has several employee and director equity plans that are registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as\namended, pursuant to Form S-8. Under SEC regulations, the Company’s failure to file its periodic and annual reports with the SEC resulted\nin the suspension of the availability of these insider equity plans during the time that these reports were not on file. For that reason,\nemployees and directors have not been permitted to liquidate any preexisting holdings of the Company’s common stock, nor has the\nCompany been able to issue equity retention or incentive awards. These restrictions may have adverse effects on the Company’s employees\nand business, which could affect our future prospects and operations.\n17\nTable of Contents\nThe restatement of our consolidated financial statements for the quarterly periods in the year ended December 31, 2023 has\nsubjected us to a number of additional costs, risks and uncertainties.\nAs discussed elsewhere in this Annual Report, our management determined that our consolidated financial statements for the quarterly\nperiods in the years ended December 31, 2023 should be restated due to accounting errors resulting from the incorrect (1) accounting for,\nand presentation of, noncontrolling interests (“NCI”), (2) recognition of an organizational transaction in connection with the Company’s\ninitial public offering, (3) presentation of earnings per share considering the effect of certain features of the Company’s warrants and the\nimpact of correcting the accounting for, and presentation of NCI, and (4) timing of the recording of the 2023 redemption of warrants. The\nrestatement of our consolidated financial statements and the ongoing process of remediating the material weaknesses has caused us to incur\nsubstantial expenses for legal, accounting, and other professional services and has diverted our management’s attention from our business\nand could continue to do so. As a result of the restatement and the change in our registered public accounting firm, we have been delayed in\nfiling this Annual Report on Form 10-K and our Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for each of the periods ended March 31, 2024 and June\n30, 2024, and there can be no assurance that we will be able to timely file our required reports for future periods. In addition, as a result of\nthe restatement and associated non-reliance on previously issued quarterly financial statements, investors may lose confidence in our\nfinancial reporting and the price of our common stock could decline. We could also be subject to regulatory, stockholder or other actions in\nconnection with the restatement and/or the associated material weaknesses, which would, regardless of the outcome, consume\nmanagement’s time and attention and may result in additional legal, accounting and other costs. If such proceedings arise and we do not\nprevail in such proceedings, we could be required to pay damages or settlement costs. The restatement and related matters could impair our\nreputation or could cause our stockholders or other counterparties to lose confidence in us. Any of these occurrences could adversely affect\nour business, financial condition and results of operations.\nHigh customer concentration exposes us to various risks faced by our major customers and may subject us to significant fluctuations or\ndeclines in revenues.\nThere is an inherent concentration of credit risk associated with accounts receivable arising from revenue from major customers on\nboth the sell-side and buy-side of the business. For the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, one customer of the sell-side business\nrepresented 73% and 63% of revenues, respectively. As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, one customer of the sell-side business accounted\nfor 83% and 80%, respectively, of accounts receivable. In 2024, we experienced a short-pay notice from this customer resulting in\nreduction of our 2023 revenue to the reported amount of $157 million. The Company has not been provided with information as to the\nreason for the short pay, and therefore has disputed it. In conjunction with the short pay, the Company recorded a charge of $8.8 million for\npayments made to a few publishers, primarily because of the Company’s inability to charge back the publishers for the short pay given the\nlack of information and related documentation supporting such transaction. We do not expect these amounts to recur in any material\nfashion, although there is no assurance that this or other customers will not take such action in the future.\nAdditionally, although we continually seek to diversify our customer base, we cannot assure you that the proportion of the revenue\ncontribution from this customer to our total revenues will decrease in the near future. Dependence on a limited number of major customers\nwill expose us to the risks of substantial losses and may increase our accounts receivable and extend its turn-over days if any of them\nreduces or even ceases business with us. Specifically, any one of the following events, among others, may cause material fluctuations or\ndeclines in our revenues and have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects:\n● an overall decline in the business of one or more of our significant customers;\n● the decision by one or more of our significant customers to switch to our competitors;\n● the reduction in the prices for our services agreed by one or more of our significant customers; or\n● the failure or inability of any of our significant customers to make timely payment for our services.\n18\nTable of Contents\nWe are subject to payment-related risks and, if our clients do not pay or dispute their invoices, our business, financial condition and\noperating results may be adversely affected.\nMany of our contracts with advertising agencies provide that if the advertiser does not pay the agency, the agency is not liable to us,\nand we must seek payment solely from the advertiser. Similarly, on the sell-side of our business, we contract directly with our publishers\nfor the right to sell digital ad units, and as such we are contractually required to pay the publisher a fixed rate for digital ad units we sell to\nadvertisers or advertising agencies, regardless of whether we are paid by the advertisers or agencies. Contracting with these parties, which\nin some cases have or may develop higher-risk credit profiles, may subject us to greater credit risk than if we were to contract directly with\nother parties such as advertisers or agencies. This credit risk may vary depending on various factors, including the nature of an advertising\nagency’s aggregated advertiser base. We may also be involved in disputes with agencies and their advertisers over the operation of our\nplatform, the terms of our agreements or our billings for purchases made by them through our platform. If we are unable to collect or make\nadjustments to bills to clients, we could incur write-offs for bad debt, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of\noperations for the periods in which the write-offs occur. In the future, bad debt may exceed reserves for such contingencies and our bad\ndebt exposure may increase over time. Any increase in write-offs for bad debt could have a materially negative effect on our business,\nresults of operations, and financial condition. Even if we are not paid by our clients on time or at all, we are still obligated to pay for the\nadvertising we have purchased for the advertising campaign, and as a consequence, our results of operations and financial condition would\nbe adversely impacted.\nFurthermore, we are generally contractually required to pay suppliers of advertising inventory and data within a negotiated period of\ntime, regardless of whether our customers pay us on time, or at all. While we attempt to negotiate long payment periods with our suppliers\nand shorter periods from our customers, we are not always successful. As a result, our accounts payable are often due on shorter cycles than\nour accounts receivables, requiring us to remit payments from our own funds, and accept the risk of bad debt.\nIf we fail to detect advertising fraud, we could harm our reputation and hurt our ability to execute our business plan.\nWe may be subject to fraudulent or malicious activities undertaken by persons seeking to use our sell-side or buy-side platform for\nimproper purposes, which could materially affect us. For example, our sell-side platform could be used to divert or artificially inflate\nadvertiser purchases, or to disrupt or divert the operation of our systems and the devices of our publishers and their consumers in order to\nmisappropriate information, generate fraudulent billings, stage cyberattacks, or for other illicit purposes. In addition, the success of our\nbuy-side advertising business depends on our ability to deliver effective digital advertising campaigns to publishers, advertisers and\nagencies. Some of those campaigns may experience fraudulent and other invalid impressions, clicks or conversions that advertisers may\nperceive as undesirable, such as non-human traffic generated by computers designed to simulate human users and artificially inflate user\ntraffic on websites. These activities could overstate the performance of our business, including any given digital advertising campaign, and\ncould harm our reputation. It may be difficult for us to detect fraudulent or malicious activity because we do not own content and rely in\npart on our digital media properties to control such activity. Industry self- regulatory bodies, the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (the\n“FTC”) and certain influential members of Congress have increased their scrutiny and awareness of, and have taken recent actions to\naddress, advertising fraud and other malicious activity. If we fail to detect or prevent fraudulent or other malicious activity, the affected\nadvertisers may experience or perceive a reduced return on their investment and our reputation may be harmed. High levels of fraudulent or\nmalicious activity could lead to dissatisfaction with our solutions, refusals to pay, refund or future credit demands or withdrawal of future\nbusiness, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects or results of operations.\nOperational and performance issues with our platform, whether real or perceived, including a failure to respond to technological\nchanges or to upgrade our technology systems, may adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition.\nWe depend upon the sustained and uninterrupted performance of our platform to manage our advertising inventory supply; acquire\nadvertising inventory for each campaign; collect, process and interpret data; and optimize campaign performance in real time and provide\nbilling information to our financial systems. If our platform cannot scale to meet demand, if there are errors in our execution of any of these\nfunctions on our platform, or if we experience outages, then our business may be harmed.\n19\nTable of Contents\nOur platform is complex and multifaceted. Operational and performance issues could arise from the platform itself or from outside\nfactors, such as cyberattacks or other third-party attacks. Errors, failures, vulnerabilities or bugs have been found in the past, and may be\nfound in the future. Our platform also relies on third-party technology and systems to perform properly. It is often used in connection with\ncomputing environments utilizing different operating systems, system management software, equipment and networking configurations,\nwhich may cause errors in, or failures of, our platform or such other computing environments. Operational and performance issues with our\nplatform could include the failure of our user interface, outages, errors during upgrades or patches, discrepancies in costs billed versus costs\npaid, unanticipated volume overwhelming our databases, server failure or catastrophic events affecting one or more server facilities. While\nwe have built redundancies in our systems, full redundancies do not exist. Some failures will shut our platform down completely, others\nonly partially. We provide service-level agreements to some of our customers, and if our platform is not available for specified amounts of\ntime or if there are failures in the interaction between our platform, partner platform and third-party technologies, we may be required to\nprovide credits or other financial compensation to our customers.\nAs we grow our business, we expect to continue to invest in technology services and equipment. Without these improvements, our\noperations might suffer from unanticipated system disruptions, slow transaction processing, unreliable service levels, impaired quality or\ndelays in reporting accurate information regarding transactions in our platform, any of which could negatively affect our reputation and\nability to attract and retain customers. In addition, the expansion and improvement of our systems and infrastructure may require us to\ncommit substantial financial, operational and technical resources, with no assurance our business will grow. If we fail to respond to\ntechnological change or to adequately maintain, expand, upgrade and develop our systems and infrastructure in a timely fashion, our\ngrowth prospects and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nOperational and performance issues with our platform could also result in negative publicity, damage to our brand and reputation, loss\nof or delay in market acceptance of our platform, increased costs or loss of revenue, loss of the ability to access our platform, loss of\ncompetitive position or claims by customers for losses sustained by them. Alleviating problems resulting from such issues could require\nsignificant expenditures of capital and other resources and could cause interruptions, delays or the cessation of our business, any of which\nmay adversely affect our operating results and financial condition.\nIf the use of third-party “cookies,” mobile device IDs or other tracking technologies is restricted without similar or better alternatives,\nour platform’s effectiveness could be diminished and our business, results of operations, and financial condition could be adversely\naffected.\nWe use “cookies,” which are small text files placed on consumer devices when an internet browser is used, and mobile device\nidentifiers, to gather data that enables our platform to be more effective. Our cookies and mobile device IDs do not identify consumers\ndirectly, but record information such as when a consumer views or clicks on an advertisement, when a consumer uses a mobile app, the\nconsumer’s location, consumer demographic, psychographic interest and browser or other device information. Publishers and partners may\nalso choose to share their information about consumers’ interests or give us permission to use their cookies and mobile device IDs. We use\ndata from cookies, mobile device IDs, and other tracking technologies to help advertisers decide whether to bid on, and how to price, an ad\nimpression in a certain location, at a given time or for a particular consumer. Without cookies, mobile device IDs and other tracking\ntechnology data, transactions processed through our platform would be executed with less insight into consumer activity, reducing the\nprecision of advertisers’ decisions about which impressions to purchase for an advertising campaign. This could make placement of\nadvertising through our platform less valuable and harm our revenue. If our ability to use cookies, mobile device IDs or other tracking\ntechnologies is limited, we may be required to develop or obtain additional applications and technologies to compensate for the lack of\ncookies, mobile device IDs and other tracking technology data, which could be time consuming or costly to develop, less effective and\nsubject to additional regulation.\nSome consumers also download free or paid “ad blocking” software on their computers or mobile devices, not only for privacy\nreasons, but also to counteract the adverse effect advertisements can have on the consumer experience, including increased load times, data\nconsumption and screen overcrowding. Ad- blocking technologies and other global privacy controls may prevent some third-party cookies,\nor other tracking technologies, from being stored on a consumer’s computer or mobile device. If more consumers adopt these measures, our\nbusiness, results of operations, and financial condition could be adversely affected. Ad-blocking technologies could have an adverse effect\non our business, results of\n20\nTable of Contents\noperations and financial condition if they reduce the volume or effectiveness and value of advertising. In addition, some ad-blocking\ntechnologies block only ads that are targeted through use of third-party data, while allowing ads based on first-party data (i.e., data owned\nby the publisher). These ad blockers could place us at a disadvantage because we rely on third-party data, while some large competitors\nhave a significant amount of first-party data they use to direct advertising. Other technologies allow ads that are deemed “acceptable,”\nwhich could be defined in ways that place us or our publishers at a disadvantage, particularly if such technologies are controlled or\ninfluenced by our competitors. Even if ad blockers do not ultimately have an adverse effect on our business, investor concerns about ad\nblockers could cause our stock price to decline.\nAdditionally, in July 2022, Alphabet Inc.’s Google subsidiary (“Alphabet”) announced that it would delay its Chrome web browser\ntimeline for the depreciation of cookies to 2024. In March 2021, Alphabet announced that it would not build alternate identifiers to track\nindividuals as they browse across the web, nor would Google use them in its products. In July 2024, Google announced that it no longer\nplans to deprecate third-party cookies and will offer new ways to elevate user choice. These changes, and other privacy controls that may\nbe put in place by other web companies in the future, have the potential to have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and\nfinancial condition if they reduce the volume or effectiveness and value of advertising.\nUnfavorable publicity and negative public perception about us or our industry, particularly concerns regarding data privacy and\nsecurity relating to our industry’s technology and practices, and perceived failure to comply with laws and industry self-regulation,\ncould adversely affect our business and operating results.\nRecently our organization has been the subject of intentionally false, misleading and inaccurate statements attempting to discredit the\nperformance and operations of the Company. We have filed a lawsuit alleging, among other things, defamation against the publisher of\nthese statements. While we are vigorously pursuing this action, there can be no assurance that it will be resolved in our favor or that the\nreputation of the Company will not be materially impacted, causing clients and customers to stop conducting business with our\norganization, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nIn addition, with the growth of digital advertising, there is increasing awareness and concern among the general public, privacy\nadvocates, mainstream media, governmental bodies and others regarding marketing, advertising and data privacy matters, particularly as\nthey relate to individual privacy interests and the global reach of the online marketplace. Concerns about industry practices with regard to\nthe collection, use and disclosure of personal information, whether or not valid and whether driven by applicable laws and regulations,\nindustry standards, customer or inventory provider expectations, defamatory statements, or the broader public, may harm our reputation,\nresult in loss of goodwill and inhibit the use of our platform by current and future customers. Any unfavorable publicity or negative public\nperception about us, our industry, including our competitors, or even other data-focused industries, can affect our business and results of\noperations, and may lead to digital publishers or our customers changing their business practices or additional regulatory scrutiny or\nlawmaking that affects us or our industry. For example, in recent years, consumer advocates, mainstream media and elected officials have\nincreasingly and publicly criticized the data and marketing industry for its collection, storage and use of personal data. Additional public\nscrutiny may lead to general distrust of our industry, consumer reluctance to share and permit use of personal data, increased consumer opt-\nout rates or increased private class actions, any of which could negatively influence, change or reduce our current and prospective\ncustomers’ demand for our products and services, subject us to liability and adversely affect our business and operating results.\nFailure to manage our growth effectively could cause our business to suffer and have an adverse effect on our business, operating\nresults and financial condition.\nWe have experienced significant growth in a short period of time. To manage our growth effectively, we must continually evaluate and\nevolve our organization. We must also manage our employees, operations, finances, technology and development and capital investments\nefficiently. Our efficiency, productivity and the quality of our platform and customer service may be adversely impacted if we do not train\nour new personnel, particularly our sales and support personnel, quickly and effectively, or if we fail to appropriately coordinate across our\norganization. Additionally, our rapid growth may place a strain on our resources, infrastructure and ability to maintain the quality of our\nplatform. You should not consider our revenue growth and levels of profitability in recent periods as indicative of future performance. In\nfuture\n21\nTable of Contents\nperiods, our revenue or profitability could decline or grow more slowly than we expect. Failure to manage our growth effectively could\ncause our business to suffer and have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition.\nFuture acquisitions or strategic investments could be difficult to identify and integrate, divert the attention of management, and could\ndisrupt our business, dilute stockholder value and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nAs part of our growth strategy, we may acquire or invest in other businesses, assets or technologies that are complementary to and fit\nwithin our strategic goals. Any acquisition or investment may divert the attention of management and require us to use significant amounts\nof cash, issue dilutive equity securities or incur debt. There can be no assurance that we will successfully identify suitable candidates in the\nfuture for strategic transactions at acceptable prices or be able to consummate any desired transactions. Our failure to identify suitable\ncandidates or close transactions with potential acquisition targets for which we have invested significant time and resources could have a\nmaterial adverse effect on our financial condition and cash flows. In addition, even if consummated, the anticipated benefits of any\nacquisition or investment may not be realized, and we may be exposed to unknown risks, any of which could adversely affect our business,\nresults of operations and financial condition, including risks arising from:\n● difficulties in integrating the operations, technologies, product or service offerings, administrative systems and personnel of\nacquired businesses, especially if those businesses operate outside of our core competency or geographies in which we\ncurrently operate;\n● ineffectiveness or incompatibility of acquired technologies or solutions;\n● potential loss of key employees of the acquired business;\n● inability to maintain key business relationships and reputation of the acquired business;\n● diversion of management attention from other business concerns;\n● litigation arising from the acquisition or the activities of the acquired business, including claims from terminated employees,\ncustomers, former stockholders or other third parties;\n● assumption of contractual obligations that contain terms that are not beneficial to us, require us to license or waive\nintellectual property rights, or increase our risk of liability;\n● complications in the integration of acquired businesses or diminished prospects;\n● failure to generate the expected financial results related to an acquisition on a timely manner or at all; and\n● failure to accurately forecast the impact of an acquisition transaction; and implementation or remediation of effective\ncontrols, procedures, and policies for acquired businesses.\nTo fund future acquisitions, we may pay cash or issue additional shares of our Class A Common Stock or securities convertible into or\nexchangeable for shares of our Class A Common Stock, which could dilute our stockholders or diminish our cash reserves. Borrowing to\nfund an acquisition would result in increased fixed obligations and could also subject us to covenants or other restrictions that could limit\nour ability to effectively run our business.\nChanges in legislative, judicial, regulatory or cultural environments relating to information collection, use and processing may limit\nour ability to collect, use and process data. Such developments could cause revenue to decline, increase the cost of data, reduce the\navailability of data and adversely affect the demand for our products and services.\nWe receive, store and process personal information and other data from and about consumers in addition to personal information and\nother data from and about our customers, employees and services providers. Our handling of this data is\n22\nTable of Contents\nsubject to a wide variety of federal, state and foreign laws and regulations and is subject to regulation by various government authorities\nand consumer actions. Our data handling is also subject to contractual obligations and may be deemed to be subject to industry standards.\nThe U.S. federal and various state and foreign governments have adopted or proposed laws relating to the collection, disclosure,\nprocessing, use, storage and security of data relating to individuals and households, including the use of contact information and other data\nfor marketing, advertising and other communications with individuals and businesses. In the U.S., various laws and regulations apply to the\ncollection, disclosure, processing, use, storage and security of certain types of data. Additionally, the FTC, many state attorneys general and\nmany courts are interpreting federal and state consumer protection laws as imposing standards for the collection, disclosure, process, use,\nstorage and security of data. The regulatory framework for data privacy issues worldwide is complex, continually evolving and often\nconflicting, and is likely to remain uncertain for the foreseeable future. As a result, further restrictions could be placed upon the collection,\ndisclosure, processing, use, storage and security of information, which could result in a material increase in the cost of obtaining certain\nkinds of data and could limit the ways in which we may collect, disclose, process, use, store or secure information.\nWhile our platform and people-based framework operates primarily in the United States, some of our operations may subject us to data\nprivacy laws outside the United States, such as the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”) or similar legislation\nin the region, which prescribe a complex data protection regime including principles, rights and obligations with extraterritorial reach of\nEU, UK and data protection authorities of other jurisdictions. The costs of complying with (or paying any fines or penalties under) the\nGDPR and other foreign data privacy regulatory regimes may make our expansion into these markets less profitable or uneconomical,\nlimiting our potential growth, and potentially adversely affecting our business, prospectus and results of operations.\nIn addition to government regulation, self-regulatory standards and other industry standards may legally or contractually apply to us or\nbe argued to apply to us, or we may elect to comply with such standards or to facilitate our customers’ compliance with such standards.\nSome of these self-regulatory bodies have the ability to discipline members or participants, which could result in fines, penalties, and/or\npublic censure of our publishers, which could in turn cause reputational harm to us.\nOur legal risk depends in part on our customers’ or other third parties’ adherence to privacy laws and regulations and their use of our\nservices in ways consistent with end user expectations. We rely on representations made to us by customers and data suppliers that they will\ncomply with all applicable laws, including all relevant privacy and data protection regulations. Although we make reasonable efforts to\nenforce such representations and contractual requirements, we do not fully audit our customers’ or data suppliers’ compliance with our\nrecommended disclosures or their adherence to privacy laws and regulations. If our customers or data suppliers fail to adhere to our\nexpectations or contracts in this regard, we and our customers or data suppliers could be subject to adverse publicity, damages, and related\npossible investigation or other regulatory activity.\nFurthermore, the costs of compliance with, and other burdens imposed by, the laws, regulations, standards and policies that are applicable\nto the businesses of our customers may limit the use and adoption of, and reduce the overall demand for, our platform. Privacy concerns,\nwhether valid or not valid, may inhibit market adoption of our platform particularly in certain industries and foreign countries.\nOur buy-side clients include destination marketing organizations (“DMOs”), which often operate as public/private partnerships\ninvolving a national, provincial, state and local governmental entity.\nOur work for DMOs carries various risks inherent in the government contracting process. These risks include, but are not limited to,\nthe following:\n● Government entities typically fund projects through appropriated monies and demand is affected by public sector budgetary\ncycles and funding authorizations.\n23\nTable of Contents\n● Government contracts are subject to heightened reputational and contractual risks compared to contracts with commercial\nclients, including additional scrutiny and publicity.\n● Government contracts can be challenged by other interested parties and such challenges, even if unsuccessful, can increase\ncosts, cause delays and defer project implementation and revenue recognition.\n● U.S. government contracting regulations impose strict contractual, compliance and disclosure obligations. Disclosure is\nrequired if certain company personnel have knowledge of “credible evidence” of a violation of federal criminal laws\ninvolving fraud, conflict of interest, bribery or improper gratuity, a violation of the civil U.S. False Claims Act or receipt of a\nsignificant overpayment from the government. Failure to make required disclosures could be a basis for suspension and/or\ndebarment from federal government contracting in addition to breach of the specific contract and could also impact\ncontracting beyond the U.S. federal level. Reported matters also could lead to audits or investigations and other civil, criminal\nor administrative sanctions.\nThe occurrences or conditions described above could affect not only our business with the DMOs and related government entities\ninvolved, but also our business with other entities of the same or other governmental bodies or with certain commercial clients and could\nhave a material and adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nThe requirements of being a public company may strain our resources, divert our management’s attention.\nAs a public company, we are subject to the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act, and are required to comply with the applicable\nrequirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, the listing requirements of\nThe Nasdaq Capital Market, and other applicable securities rules and regulations. Compliance with these rules and regulations increases\nour legal and financial compliance costs, makes some activities more difficult, time-consuming or costly and increases demand on our\nsystems and resources. Among other things, the Exchange Act requires that we file annual, quarterly and current reports with respect to our\nbusiness and operating results and maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal controls over financial reporting.\nSignificant resources and management oversight is required to maintain and, if required, improve our disclosure controls and procedures\nand internal controls over financial reporting to meet this standard. As a result, management’s attention may be diverted from other\nbusiness concerns, which could harm our business and operating results. Although we have already hired additional employees to comply\nwith these requirements, we may need to hire even more employees in the future, which will increase our costs and expenses.\nThe digital advertising industry is intensely competitive, and if we do not effectively compete against current and future competitors, our\nbusiness, results of operations, and financial condition could be harmed.\nWe operate in a highly competitive and rapidly changing industry that is subject to changing technology and customer demands and\nthat includes many companies providing competing solutions. With the introduction of new technologies and the influx of new entrants into\nthe market, we expect competition to persist and intensify in the future, which could harm our ability to increase revenue and maintain\nprofitability. New technologies and methods of buying advertising present a dynamic competitive challenge, as market participants offer\nmultiple new products and services aimed at capturing advertising spend.\nOn the sell-side, we compete with smaller, privately-held companies and with public companies such as Pubmatic, Magnite, and\nAcuity Ads. Our current and potential competitors may have significantly more financial, technical, marketing and other resources than we\nhave, allowing them to devote greater resources to the development, promotion, sale and support of their products and services. They may\nalso have more extensive customer bases and broader supplier relationships than we have. As a result, these competitors may be better able\nto respond quickly to new technologies, develop deeper marketer relationships or offer services at lower prices. Increased competition may\nresult in reduced pricing for our platform, increased sales and marketing expense, longer sales cycles or a decrease of our market share, any\nof which could negatively affect our revenue and future operating results and our ability to grow our business. These companies may also\nhave greater brand recognition than we have, actively seek to serve our market, and have the power to significantly change the nature of the\nmarketplace to their advantage. Some of our larger competitors have substantially\n24\nTable of Contents\nbroader product offerings and may leverage their relationships based on other products or incorporate functionality into existing products to\ngain business in a manner that may discourage customers from using our platform, including through selling at zero or negative margins or\nproduct bundling with other services they provide at reduced prices. Customers may prefer to purchase advertising on their own or through\nanother platform without leveraging our buy-side business. Potential customers may also prefer to leverage larger sell-side platforms rather\nthan a new platform regardless of product performance or features. These larger competitors often have broader product lines and market\nfocus and may therefore not be as susceptible to downturns in a particular market. We may also experience negative market perception as a\nresult of being a smaller company than our larger competitors.\nWe may also face competition from companies that we do not yet know about or do not yet exist. If existing or new companies\ndevelop, market or resell competitive high-value marketing products or services, acquire one of our existing competitors or form a strategic\nalliance with one of our competitors, our ability to compete effectively could be significantly compromised and our results of operations\ncould be harmed.\nA significant inadvertent disclosure or breach of confidential and/or personal information we hold, or of the security of our or our\ncustomers’, suppliers’ or other partners’ computer systems, could be detrimental to our business, reputation and results of operations.\nPortions of our business require the storage, transmission and utilization of data, including access to personal information, much of\nwhich must be maintained on a confidential basis. These activities may in the future make us a target of cyber-attacks by third parties\nseeking unauthorized access to the data we maintain and to which we provide access, including our customer data, or to disrupt our ability\nto provide service through the Colossus SSP. In addition, we may be subject to any flaws in or breaches of our customers systems. Based\non the types and volume of personal data on our systems, we believe that we are a particularly attractive target for such breaches and\nattacks.\nThird parties could attempt to gain entry to our systems for the purpose of stealing data or disrupting the systems. In addition, our\nsecurity measures may also be breached due to employee error, malfeasance, system errors or vulnerabilities, including vulnerabilities of\nour vendors, suppliers, their products or otherwise. Third parties may also attempt to fraudulently induce employees or customers into\ndisclosing sensitive information such as usernames, passwords or other information to gain access to our customers’ data or our data,\nincluding intellectual property and other confidential business information.\nWe currently serve the majority of Colossus SSP functions from third-party data center hosting facilities. While we and our third-party\ncloud providers have implemented security measures designed to protect against security breaches, these measures could fail or may be\ninsufficient, particularly as techniques used to sabotage or obtain unauthorized access to systems change frequently and generally are not\nrecognized until launched against a target, resulting in the unauthorized disclosure, modification, misuse, destruction or loss of our or our\ncustomers’ data or other sensitive information. Any failure to prevent or mitigate security breaches and improper access to or disclosure of\nthe data we maintain, including personal information, could result in operational disruptions, litigation, indemnity obligations, regulatory\nenforcement actions, investigations, fines, penalties, mitigation and remediation costs, disputes, reputational harm, diversion of\nmanagement’s attention, and other liabilities and damage to our business.\nFederal, state and foreign governments continue to consider and implement laws and regulations addressing data privacy,\ncybersecurity, and data protection laws, which include provisions relating to breaches. For example, statutory damages may be available to\nusers through a private right of action for certain data breaches under the California Consumer Privacy Act (the “CCPA”), and potentially\nother states’ laws. In any event, a significant security breach could materially harm our business, operating results and financial condition.\nThe effects of macroeconomic conditions and geopolitical events, such as economic downturns and market conditions beyond our\ncontrol, have had, and could in the future have, an adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur business depends on the overall demand for advertising and on the economic health of advertisers and publishers that benefit from\nour platform. Economic downturns or unstable market conditions, such as those potentially created by\n25\nTable of Contents\nhigh price inflation, increasing interest rates, health pandemics or geopolitical instability may cause advertisers to decrease their advertising\nbudgets, which could reduce spend though our platform and adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition. As\nwe explore new countries into which we can expand our business, economic downturns or unstable market conditions in any of those\ncountries could result in our investments not yielding the returns we anticipate. Additionally, actual events involving limited liquidity,\ndefaults, non-performance or other adverse developments that affect financial institutions, transactional counterparties or other companies\nin the financial services industry or the financial services industry generally, or concerns or rumors about any events of these kinds or other\nsimilar risks, have recently and may in the future lead to market-wide liquidity problems, which could also lead advertisers to decrease\ntheir advertising budgets and/or reduce their spend though our platform. This uncertainty regarding liquidity concerns in the financial\nservices industry could adversely impact our business, our business partners, or industry as a whole in ways that we cannot predict at this\ntime.\nOur success and revenue growth are dependent on adding new customers, effectively educating and training our existing customers on\nhow to make full use of our platform and increasing usage of our platform by our customers.\nOur success is dependent on regularly adding new customers and increasing our customers’ usage of our platform. Our contracts and\nrelationships with customers generally do not include long-term or exclusive obligations requiring them to use our platform or maintain or\nincrease their use of our platform. Our customers typically have relationships with numerous providers and can use both our platform and\nthose of our competitors without incurring significant costs or disruption. Our customers may also choose to decrease their overall\nadvertising spend for any reason. Accordingly, we must continually work to win new customers and retain existing customers, increase\ntheir usage of our platform and capture a larger share of their advertising spend. We may not be successful at educating and training\ncustomers, particularly our newer customers, on how to use our platform, in particular our advanced reporting tools, in order for our\ncustomers to get the most benefit from our platform and increase their usage. If these efforts are unsuccessful or customers decide not to\ncontinue to maintain or increase their usage of our platform for any other reason, or if we fail to attract new customers, our revenue could\nfail to grow or decline, which would materially and adversely harm our business, results of operations, and financial condition. We cannot\nassure you that our customers will continue to use and increase their spend on our platform or that we will be able to attract a sufficient\nnumber of new customers to continue to grow our business and revenue. If customers representing a significant portion of our business\ndecide to materially reduce their use of our platform or cease using our platform altogether, our revenue could be significantly reduced,\nwhich could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition. We may not be able to replace\ncustomers who decrease or cease their usage of our platform with new customers that will use our platform to the same extent.\nThe market growth forecasts included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K may prove to be inaccurate and, even if the market in which\nwe compete achieves forecasted growth, we cannot assure you our business will grow at similar rates, if at all.\nMarket growth forecasts are subject to significant uncertainty and are based on assumptions and estimates that may not prove to be\naccurate. The forecasts in this Annual Report on Form 10-K relating to expected growth in the digital advertising and programmatic ad\nmarkets may prove to be inaccurate. Even if these markets experience the forecasted growth, we may not grow our business at similar rates,\nor at all. Our growth is subject to many factors including our success in implementing our business strategy, which is subject to many risks\nand uncertainties. The failure of either the market in which we operate or our business to grow as forecasted could have a material adverse\neffect on our business, prospects or results of operations.\nThe market for programmatic advertising campaigns is relatively new and evolving. If this market develops slower or differently than\nwe expect, our business, growth prospects and results of operations would be adversely affected.\nThe substantial majority of our revenue has been derived from customers that programmatically purchase or sell advertising inventory\nthrough our platform. We expect that spending on programmatic ad buying and selling will continue to be our primary source of revenue\nfor the foreseeable future, and that our revenue growth will largely depend on increasing spend through our platform. The market for\nprogrammatic ad buying is an emerging market, and our current and potential customers may not shift quickly enough to programmatic ad\nbuying from other buying methods, reducing\n26\nTable of Contents\nour growth potential. Because our industry is relatively new, we will encounter risks and difficulties frequently encountered by early-stage\ncompanies in similarly rapidly evolving industries, including the need to:\n● Maintain our reputation and build trust with advertisers and digital media property owners;\n● Offer competitive pricing to publishers, advertisers and digital media agencies;\n● Maintain quality and expand quantity of our advertising inventory;\n● Continue to develop, launch and upgrade the technologies that enable us to provide our solutions;\n● Respond to evolving government regulations relating to the internet, telecommunications, mobile, privacy, marketing and\nadvertising aspects of our business;\n● Identify, attract, retain and motivate qualified personnel; and\n● Cost-effectively manage our operations.\nIf the market for programmatic ad buying deteriorates or develops more slowly than we expect, it could reduce demand for our\nplatform, and our business, growth prospects and financial condition would be adversely affected.\nIn addition, revenue may not necessarily grow at the same rate as spend on our platform. Growth in spend may outpace growth in our\nrevenue as the market for programmatic advertising matures due to a number of factors including quantity discounts and product, media,\ncustomer and channel mix shifts. A significant change in revenue as a percentage of spend could result in an adverse change in our business\nand growth prospectus. In addition, any such fluctuations, even if they reflect our strategic decisions, could cause our performance to fall\nbelow the expectations of securities analysts and investors, and adversely affect the price of our Class A Common Stock.\nWe often have long sales cycles, which can result in significant time between initial contact with a prospect and execution of a customer\nagreement, making it difficult to project when, if at all, we will obtain new customers and when we will generate revenue from those\ncustomers.\nOur sales cycle, from initial contact to contract execution and implementation, can take significant time. Our sell-side sales cycle often\nhas a duration of six-to-12 months, while our buy-side business sales cycle often has a duration of three-to-nine months. As part of our\nsales cycle, we may incur significant expenses before we generate any revenue from a prospective customer. We have no assurance that the\nsubstantial time and money spent on our sales efforts will generate significant revenue. If conditions in the marketplace, generally or with a\nspecific prospective customer, change negatively, it is possible that we will be unable to recover any of these expenses. Our sales efforts\ninvolve educating our customers about the use, technical capabilities and benefits of our platform, and working through technical\nconnections and troubleshooting technical issues with prospective customers. Some of our customers undertake an evaluation process that\nfrequently involves not only our platform but also the offerings of our competitors. As a result, it is difficult to predict when we will obtain\nnew customers and begin generating revenue from these new customers. Even if our sales efforts result in obtaining a new customer, the\ncustomer controls when and to what extent it uses our platform and therefore the amount of revenue we generate, and it may not\nsufficiently justify the expenses incurred to acquire the customer and the related training support. As a result, we may not be able to add\ncustomers, or generate revenue, as quickly as we may expect, which could harm our growth prospects.\nFailure to maintain the brand security features of our solution could harm our reputation and expose us to liabilities.\nAdvertising is bought and sold through our solution in automated transactions that occur in milliseconds. It is important to sellers that\nthe advertising placed on their media be of high quality, consistent with applicable seller standards, not conflict with existing seller\narrangements, and be compliant with applicable legal and regulatory requirements. It is important to buyers that their advertisements be\nplaced on appropriate media, in proximity with appropriate content, that\n27\nTable of Contents\nthe impressions for which they are charged be legitimate, and that their advertising campaigns yield their desired results. We use various\nmeasures, including technology, internal processes and protocols in an effort to store, manage and process rules set by buyers and sellers\nand to ensure the quality and integrity of the results delivered to sellers and advertisers through our solution. If we fail to properly\nimplement or honor rules established by buyers and sellers, improper advertisements may be placed through our platform, which can result\nin harm to our reputation as well as the need to pay refunds and potential legal liabilities.\nOur business is subject to the risk of catastrophic events such as pandemics, earthquakes, flooding, fire and power outages, and to\ninterruption by man-made problems such as terrorism.\nOur business is vulnerable to damage or interruption from pandemics, earthquakes, flooding, fire, power outages, telecommunications\nfailures, terrorist attacks, acts of war, human errors, break-ins and similar events. A significant natural disaster could have a material\nadverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition, and our insurance coverage may be insufficient to compensate\nus for losses that may occur. In addition, acts of terrorism could cause disruptions in our or our publishers’ and partners’ businesses or the\neconomy as a whole. Our servers may also be vulnerable to computer viruses, break-ins, denial-of-service attacks and similar disruptions\nfrom unauthorized tampering with our computer systems, which could lead to interruptions, delays and the loss of critical data. We may not\nhave sufficient protection or recovery plans in some circumstances. As we rely heavily on our data center facilities, computer and\ncommunications systems and the internet to conduct our business and provide high-quality customer service, these disruptions could\nnegatively impact our ability to run our business and either directly or indirectly disrupt publishers’ and partners’ businesses, which could\nhave an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nOur revenue and operating results are highly dependent on the overall demand for advertising. Factors that affect the amount of\nadvertising spending, such as economic downturns and seasonality, can make it difficult to predict our revenue and could adversely\naffect our business.\nOur business depends on the overall demand for advertising and on the economic health of our current and prospective sellers and\nadvertisers. If advertisers reduce their overall advertising spending, our revenue and results of operations are directly affected. For Colossus\nSSP, many advertisers devote a disproportionate amount of their advertising budgets to the third and fourth quarters of the calendar year to\ncoincide with the annual holiday purchasing season, and buyers may spend more on advertising campaigns in the second and third quarters\nfor seasonality and budget reasons. As a result, if any events occur to reduce the amount of advertising spending during the second, third or\nfourth quarters, or reduce the amount of inventory available to advertisers during that period, such as adverse economic conditions or\neconomic uncertainty, it could have a disproportionate adverse effect on our revenue and operating results for that fiscal year. Economic\ndownturns or instability in political or market conditions generally may cause current or new advertisers to reduce their advertising\nbudgets. Reductions in inventory due to loss of sellers would make our solution less robust and attractive to buyers. Adverse economic\nconditions and general uncertainty about economic recovery are likely to affect our business prospects. In particular, uncertainty regarding\nthe impacts of inflation, increasing interest rates and the war in Ukraine on the economy in the United States may cause general business\nconditions in the United States and elsewhere to deteriorate or become volatile, which could cause advertisers to delay, decrease or cancel\npurchases of our solution, and expose us to increased credit risk on advertiser orders. Moreover, any changes in the favorable tax treatment\nof advertising expenses and the deductibility thereof would likely cause a reduction in advertising demand.\nIf the non-proprietary technology, software, products and services that we use are unavailable, have future terms we cannot agree to, or\ndo not perform as we expect, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be harmed.\nWe depend on various technology, software, products and services from third parties or available as open source, including for critical\nfeatures and functionality of our platform and technology, payment processing, payroll and other professional services. Identifying,\nnegotiating, complying with and integrating with third-party terms and technology are complex, costly and time-consuming matters.\nFailure by third-party providers to maintain, support or secure their technology either generally or for our accounts specifically, or\ndowntime, errors or defects in their products or services, could materially and adversely impact our platform, our administrative obligations\nor other areas of our business. Having to replace any third-party providers or their technology, products or services could result in outages\nor difficulties in our\n28\nTable of Contents\nability to provide our services, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nMarket pressure may reduce our revenue per impression.\nOur revenue may be affected by market changes, new demands by publishers and buyers, removal of cookies usage from the existing\nvalue chain, new solutions and competitive pressure. Our solutions may be priced too high or too low, either of which may carry adverse\nconsequences. We may receive requests from publishers for discounts, fee revisions, rebates and refunds, or from DSPs, agencies and\nadvertisers for volume discounts, fee revisions and rebates. We may assume responsibility for satisfying or facilitating the satisfaction of\nsome of these requirements through the contracts we enter into with publishers, buyers, and partners. In addition, we may have\nresponsibility for some acts or omissions of publishers, buyers, or partners transacting business through our platform under our contracts or\nunder applicable laws or regulations. These responsibilities could expose us to significant liabilities, perhaps without the ability to impose\neffective mitigating controls upon, or to recover from, publishers and buyers. Any of these developments could adversely affect our\nbusiness, results of operations or financial condition. Any failure for our pricing approaches to gain acceptance could adversely affect our\nbusiness, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe face potential liability and harm to our business based on the human factor of inputting information into our platform.\nWe set up campaigns on our platform using a number of available variables. While our platform includes several checks and balances,\nit is possible for human error to result in significant over- spending. We offer a number of protections such as daily or overall spending\ncaps. However, despite these protections, the risk of overspend exists. For example, campaigns which last for a period of time can be set to\npace evenly or as quickly as possible. If a customer with a high credit limit enters an incorrect daily cap with a campaign set to a rapid\npace, it is possible for a campaign to accidently go significantly over budget. While our customer contracts state that customers are\nresponsible for media purchased through our platform, we are ultimately responsible for paying the inventory providers and we may be\nunable to collect when such errors occur.\nIf we are unable to successfully execute our strategies and continue to develop and sell the services and solutions our customers\ndemand, our business, results of operations and financial condition may suffer.\nWe must adapt to rapidly changing customer demands and preferences in order to successfully execute our strategies. This requires us\nto anticipate and respond to customer demands and preferences, address business model shifts, optimize our go-to-market execution by\nimproving our cost structure, align sales coverage with strategic goals, improve channel execution and strengthen our services and\ncapabilities in our areas of strategic focus. Any failure to successfully execute our strategies, including any failure to invest in strategic\ngrowth areas, could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe have a limited operating history and, as a result, our past results may not be indicative of future operating performance.\nWe have a limited operating history with the current scale of our business, which makes it difficult to forecast our future results. You\nshould not rely on our past quarterly or annual results of operations as indicators of future performance. You should consider and evaluate\nour prospects in light of the risks and uncertainty frequently encountered by companies like ours. Some of these uncertainties relate to the\nfact that we operate in a rapidly evolving industry, which may present challenges forecasting accuracy, determining appropriate nature and\nlevels of investments, predicting adequate future headcount, assessing appropriate returns on investments, achieving market acceptance of\nour existing and future offerings, managing client implementations and developing new solutions. If our assumptions regarding these\nuncertainties, which we regularly use and update to plan our business, are incorrect or change in reaction to changes in our markets, or if\nwe do not address these risks successfully, our operating and financial results could differ materially from our expectations and our\nbusiness could suffer.\n29\nTable of Contents\nThe loss, modification or delay of large or multiple contracts may negatively impact our financial performance.\nOur contracts have generally been for terms of relatively short duration. Additionally, our clients generally will have the ability to\ndelay the execution of services, reduce the number of hours that services require, and terminate their contracts with us upon a short notice\nfor convenience and upon the occurrence of certain defined events, such as “for cause.” The loss or delay of a large contract or multiple\ncontracts could adversely and materially affect our operating results.\nWe invest significantly in development, and to the extent our development investments do not translate into new solutions or material\nenhancements to our current solutions, or if we do not use those investments efficiently, our business and results of operations would be\nharmed.\nA key element of our strategy is to invest significantly in our development efforts to improve and develop our software and the features\nand functionality for our platform. If we do not spend our development budget efficiently or effectively, our business may be harmed and\nwe may not realize the expected benefits of our strategy. Moreover, development projects can be technically challenging, time-consuming\nand expensive. The nature of these development cycles may cause us to experience delays between the time we incur expenses associated\nwith development and the time we are able to offer compelling platform updates and generate revenue, if any, from such investment.\nAdditionally, anticipated enterprise demand for solutions we are developing could decrease after the development cycle has commenced,\nand we would nonetheless be unable to avoid substantial costs associated with the development of any such solutions. If we expend a\nsignificant amount of resources on development and our efforts do not lead to the successful introduction or improvement of solutions that\nare competitive in our current or future markets, our business and results of operations would be adversely affected.\nWe must provide value to both publishers and buyers of advertising without being perceived as favoring one over the other or being\nperceived as competing with them through our service offerings.\nWe provide a platform that intermediates between publishers seeking to sell advertising space and buyers seeking to purchase that\nspace. If we were to be perceived as favoring one side of the transaction to the detriment of the other, or presenting a competitive challenge\nto their own businesses, demand for our platform from publishers or buyers would decrease and our business, results of operations and\nfinancial condition would be adversely affected.\nWe rely on highly skilled personnel and if we are unable to attract, retain or motivate substantial numbers of qualified personnel or\nexpand and train our sales force, we may not be able to grow effectively.\nWe rely on highly skilled personnel and if we are unable to attract, retain or motivate substantial numbers of qualified personnel or\nexpand and train our sales force, we may not be able to grow effectively. Our success largely depends on the talents and efforts of key\ntechnical, sales and marketing employees and our future success depends on our continuing ability to identify, hire, develop, motivate and\nretain highly skilled personnel for all areas of our organization. Competition in our industry is intense and often leads to increased\ncompensation and other personnel costs. In addition, competition for employees with experience in our industry can be intense where our\ndevelopment operations are concentrated and where other technology companies compete for management and engineering talent. Our\ncontinued ability to compete and grow effectively depends on our ability to attract substantial numbers of qualified new employees and to\nretain and motivate our existing employees.\nWe are, and may continue to be, subject to securities litigation, which is expensive and could divert management’s attention, cause\nharm to our reputation and result in significant damages for which we could be responsible.\nWe are subject to securities class action litigation, which is expensive and could divert our management’s attention, harm our\nreputation, and leave us liable for substantial damages. For example, on May 23, 2024, an alleged stockholder, purportedly on behalf of the\npersons or entities who purchased or acquired publicly traded securities of the Company between April 2023 and March 2024, filed a\nputative class action against the Company, certain of our officers and directors, and other defendants in the U.S. District Court for the\nSouthern District of Texas, alleging violations of federal securities laws related to alleged false or misleading disclosures made by the\nCompany in its public filings. On July 9, 2024, another alleged stockholder filed a similar securities class action against the Company,\ncertain of our officers and\n30\nTable of Contents\ndirectors, also in the Southern District of Texas. These two actions have now been consolidated. Each of these complaints seeks unspecified\ndamages, plus costs, fees, and attorneys’ fees. As these actions are still in the early stages, the Company cannot predict the outcome of these\nmatters.\nLitigation of this type could result in substantial costs and diversion of management’s attention and resources, which could adversely\nimpact our business. Any adverse determination in litigation could also subject us to significant liabilities, all of which could have a\nmaterial adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nRisks Related to Legal and Regulatory Matters\nOur business is subject to numerous legal and regulatory requirements and any violation of these requirements or any misconduct by\nour employees, subcontractors, agents or business partners could harm our business and reputation.\nIn addition to government contract procurement laws and regulations, we are subject to numerous other federal, state and foreign legal\nrequirements on matters as diverse as data privacy and protection, employment and labor relations, immigration, taxation, anti-corruption,\nimport/export controls, trade restrictions, internal and disclosure control obligations, securities regulation and anti-competition. Compliance\nwith diverse and changing legal requirements is costly, including related to domestic and international anti-bribery and similar laws, time-\nconsuming and requires significant resources. Violations of one or more of these requirements in the conduct of our business could result in\nsignificant fines and other damages, criminal sanctions against us or our officers, prohibitions on doing business and damage to our\nreputation. Violations of these regulations or contractual obligations related to regulatory compliance in connection with the performance of\ncustomer contracts could also result in liability for significant monetary damages, fines and/or criminal prosecution, unfavorable publicity\nand other reputational damage, restrictions on our ability to compete for work and allegations by our customers that we have not performed\nour contractual obligations.\nMisconduct by our employees, subcontractors, agents or business partners could subject us to fines and penalties, restitution or other\ndamages, loss of security clearance, loss of current and future customer contracts and suspension or debarment from contracting with\nfederal, state or local government agencies, any of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nSuch misconduct could include fraud or other improper activities such as falsifying time or other records, failure to comply with our\npolicies and procedures or violations of applicable laws and regulations.\nWe rely on licenses to use the intellectual property rights of third parties to conduct our business.\nWe rely on products, technologies and intellectual property that we license from third parties for use in operating our business. We\ncannot assure you that these third-party licenses, or support for such licensed products and technologies, will continue to be available to us\non commercially reasonable terms, if at all. We cannot be certain that our licensors are not infringing the intellectual property rights of\nothers or that our suppliers and licensors have sufficient rights to the technology in all jurisdictions in which we may operate. Some of our\nlicense agreements may be terminated by our licensors for convenience. If we are unable to obtain or maintain rights to any of this\ntechnology because of intellectual property infringement claims brought by third parties against our suppliers and licensors or against us, or\nif we are unable to continue to obtain the technology or enter into new agreements on commercially reasonable terms, our ability to operate\nand expand our business could be harmed.\nRisks Related to Our Organizational Structure\nWe are a holding company and our principal asset is our equity interest in DDH LLC, and, accordingly, we depend on distributions\nfrom DDH LLC to pay our taxes, expenses and dividends.\nWe are a holding company and have no material assets other than our ownership of LLC Units of DDH LLC. As such, we have no\nindependent means of generating net sales or cash flow, and our ability to pay our taxes and operating expenses or declare and pay\ndividends in the future, if any, are dependent upon the financial results and cash flows of DDH LLC and its subsidiaries and distributions\nwe receive from DDH LLC. DDH LLC and its subsidiaries may not generate\n31\nTable of Contents\nsufficient cash flow to distribute funds to us and applicable state law and contractual restrictions, including negative covenants in our debt\ninstruments, may not permit such distributions.\nWe anticipate that DDH LLC will continue to be treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes and, as such, generally\nwill not be subject to any entity-level U.S. federal income tax. Instead, taxable income will be allocated to holders of LLC Units, including\nus. Accordingly, we will incur income taxes on our allocable share of any net taxable income of DDH LLC and will also incur expenses\nrelated to our operations, including payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement, described below, which could be significant. See\nItem 13 “Certain Relationships and Related Person Transactions, and Director Independence” for additional information. Furthermore, our\nallocable share of DDH LLC’s net taxable income will increase over time as DDM redeems or exchanges its LLC Units for shares of our\nClass A Common Stock.\nWe intend, as its managing member, to cause DDH LLC to make cash distributions to the owners of LLC Units, including us, in an\namount sufficient to (i) fund their or our tax obligations in respect of allocations of taxable income from DDH LLC and (ii) cover our\noperating expenses, including payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement. However, DDH LLC’s ability to make such distributions\nmay be subject to various limitations and restrictions, such as restrictions on distributions that would either violate any contract or\nagreement to which DDH LLC is then a party, including debt agreements, or any applicable law. In addition, liability for adjustments to a\npartnership’s tax return for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017, can be imposed on the partnership itself in certain\ncircumstances, absent an election to the contrary. DDH LLC could be subject to material liabilities pursuant to adjustments to its\npartnership tax returns if, for example, its calculations or allocations of taxable income or loss are incorrect, which also could limit its\nability to make distributions to us.\nIf we do not have sufficient funds to pay taxes or other liabilities or to fund our operations, we may have to borrow funds, which could\nadversely affect our liquidity and financial condition and subject us to various restrictions imposed by any such lenders. To the extent that\nwe are unable to make payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement for any reason, such payments generally will be deferred and will\npossibly accrue interest until paid; provided, however, that nonpayment for a specified period may constitute a material breach of a material\nobligation under the Tax Receivable Agreement and therefore accelerate payments due thereunder. See Item 13 “Certain Relationships and\nRelated Person Transactions, and Director Independence” for more information. In addition, if DDH LLC does not have sufficient funds to\nmake distributions, our ability to declare and pay cash dividends will also be restricted or impaired.\nDDH is controlled by DDM, whose interests may differ from those of our public stockholders.\nDDM, a holding company indirectly owned by our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and our President, controls approximately\n75.8% of the combined voting power of our common stock through its ownership of Class B Common Stock. DDM is and will, for the\nforeseeable future, be able to substantially influence, through its ownership position, our corporate management and affairs, and is able to\ncontrol virtually all matters requiring stockholder approval. DDM is able to, subject to applicable law, elect a majority of the members of\nour board of directors and control actions to be taken by us and our board of directors, including amendments to our certificate of\nincorporation and bylaws and approval of significant corporate transactions, including mergers and sales of substantially all of our assets.\nThe directors have the authority, subject to the terms of our indebtedness and applicable rules and regulations, to issue additional stock,\nimplement stock repurchase programs, declare dividends and make other decisions. It is possible that the interests of DDM may in some\ncircumstances conflict with our interests and the interests of our other stockholders, including you. For example, DDM may have different\ntax positions from us, especially in light of the Tax Receivable Agreement, which could influence our decisions regarding whether and\nwhen to dispose of assets, whether and when to incur new or refinance existing indebtedness, and whether and when DDH should terminate\nthe Tax Receivable Agreement and accelerate its obligations thereunder. In addition, the determination of future tax reporting positions and\nthe structuring of future transactions may take into consideration DDM’s tax or other considerations, which may differ from the\nconsiderations of us or our other stockholders. See Item 13 “Certain Relationships and Related Person Transactions, and Director\nIndependence” for more information.\n32\nTable of Contents\nThe Tax Receivable Agreement with DDM and DDH LLC requires us to make cash payments to them in respect of certain tax benefits\nto which we may become entitled. In certain circumstances, payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement may be accelerated and/or\nsignificantly exceed the actual tax benefits we realize.\nAs a party to the Tax Receivable Agreement with DDH LLC and DDM, we are required to make cash payments to DDM equal to 85%\nof the tax benefits, if any, that we actually realize, or in certain circumstances, are deemed to realize (calculated using certain assumptions)\nas a result of (i) increases in the tax basis of assets of DDH LLC resulting from (a) any future redemptions or exchanges of LLC Units\ndescribed under Item 13 “Certain Relationships and Related Person Transactions, and Director Independence” and (b) payments under the\nTax Receivable Agreement and (ii) certain other tax benefits arising from payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement. See Item 13\n“Certain Relationships and Related Person Transactions, and Director Independence” for more information. While the actual amount and\ntiming of any payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement will vary depending upon a number of factors, including the timing of\nexchanges, the price of shares of our Class A Common Stock at the time of the redemption or exchange, the extent to which such\nredemptions or exchanges are taxable, future tax rates, and the amount and timing of our taxable income (prior to taking into account the\ntax depreciation or amortization deductions arising from the basis adjustments), we expect that, as a result of the size of the increases in the\ntax basis of the tangible and intangible assets of DDH LLC attributable to our interests in DDH LLC, during the expected term of the Tax\nReceivable Agreement, the payments that we may make to DDM could be significant.\nPayments under the Tax Receivable Agreement are based on the tax reporting positions that we determine, and the Internal Revenue\nService (the “IRS”) or another tax authority may challenge all or part of the tax basis increases, as well as other related tax positions we\ntake, and a court could sustain such challenge. DDM will not reimburse us for any payments previously made under the Tax Receivable\nAgreement if such basis increases or other benefits are subsequently disallowed, except that any excess payments made by us to DDM\nunder the Tax Receivable Agreement will be netted against future payments that we might otherwise be required to make to DDM under\nthe Tax Receivable Agreement.\nFinally, the Tax Receivable Agreement also provides that, upon certain mergers, asset sales or other forms of business combination or\ncertain other changes of control, our (or our successor’s) obligations with respect to tax benefits would be based on certain assumptions,\nincluding that we (or our successor) would have sufficient taxable income to utilize the benefits arising from the increased tax deductions\nand tax basis and other benefits covered by the Tax Receivable Agreement. Consequently, it is possible, in these circumstances, that the\nactual cash tax savings realized by us may be significantly less than the corresponding Tax Receivable Agreement payments. Our\naccelerated payment obligations and/or assumptions adopted under the Tax Receivable Agreement in the case of a change of control may\nimpair our ability to consummate a change of control transaction or negatively impact the value received by owners of our Class A\nCommon Stock in a change of control transaction.\nOur organizational structure, including the Tax Receivable Agreement, confers certain benefits upon DDM that do not benefit the\nClass A Common stockholders to the same extent as they benefit DDM.\nOur organizational structure, including the Tax Receivable Agreement, confers certain benefits upon DDM that do not benefit the\nholders of our Class A Common Stock to the same extent. The Tax Receivable Agreement we entered into with DDH LLC and DDM\nprovides for the payment by us to DDM of 85% of the amount of tax benefits, if any, that we actually realize, or in some circumstances are\ndeemed to realize, as a result of the Tax Attributes. Due to the uncertainty of various factors, we cannot precisely quantify the likely tax\nbenefits we will realize as a result of purchases of LLC Units and LLC Unit exchanges and the resulting amounts we are likely to pay out to\nDDM pursuant to the Tax Receivable Agreement; however, we estimate that such payments may be substantial. See Item 13 “Certain\nRelationships and Related Person Transactions, and Director Independence” for more information. Although we retain 15% of the amount\nof such tax benefits that are actually realized, this and other aspects of our organizational structure may adversely impact the future trading\nmarket for the Class A Common Stock. In addition, our organizational structure, including the Tax Receivable Agreement, imposes\nadditional compliance costs and requires a significant commitment of resources that would not be required of a company with a simpler\norganizational structure.\n33\nTable of Contents\nWe may not be able to realize all or a portion of the tax benefits that are currently expected to result from the Tax Attributes covered by\nthe Tax Receivable Agreement and from payments made under the Tax Receivable Agreement.\nOur ability to realize the tax benefits that we currently expect to be available as a result of the Tax Attributes, the payments made\npursuant to the Tax Receivable Agreement, and the interest deductions imputed under the Tax Receivable Agreement all depend on a\nnumber of assumptions, including that we earn sufficient taxable income each year during the period over which such deductions are\navailable and that there are no adverse changes in applicable law or regulations. Additionally, if our actual taxable income were insufficient\nor there were additional adverse changes in applicable law or regulations, we may be unable to realize all or a portion of the expected tax\nbenefits and our cash flows and stockholders’ equity could be negatively affected. See Item 13 “Certain Relationships and Related Person\nTransactions, and Director Independence” for more information.\nIf we were deemed to be an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the “1940 Act”), as a result\nof our ownership of DDH LLC, applicable restrictions could make it impractical for us to continue our business as contemplated and\ncould adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nUnder Sections 3(a)(1)(A) and (C) of the 1940 Act, a company generally will be deemed to be an “investment company” for purposes\nof the 1940 Act if (i) it is, or holds itself out as being, engaged primarily, or proposes to engage primarily, in the business of investing,\nreinvesting or trading in securities or (ii) it engages, or proposes to engage, in the business of investing, reinvesting, owning, holding or\ntrading in securities and it owns or proposes to acquire investment securities having a value exceeding 40% of the value of its total assets\n(exclusive of U.S. government securities and cash items) on an unconsolidated basis. We do not believe that we are an “investment\ncompany,” as such term is defined in either of those sections of the 1940 Act.\nAs the sole managing member of DDH LLC, we control and operate DDH LLC. On that basis, we believe that our interest in DDH\nLLC is not an “investment security” as that term is used in the 1940 Act. However, if we were to cease participation in the management of\nDDH LLC, our interest in DDH LLC could be deemed an “investment security” for purposes of the 1940 Act.\nWe and DDH LLC intend to conduct our operations so that we will not be deemed an investment company. However, if we were to be\ndeemed an investment company, restrictions imposed by the 1940 Act, including limitations on our capital structure and our ability to\ntransact with affiliates, could make it impractical for us to continue our business as contemplated and could adversely affect our business,\nresults of operations and financial condition.\nRisks Related to Owning our Securities\nWe have identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, which could, if not remediated, result in\nmaterial misstatements in our financial statements.\nThe Company is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as defined in Rule\n13a-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. As disclosed in Item 9A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the Company\nidentified material weaknesses in its internal control over the completeness of revenue in 2022 (the “2022 Material Weakness”) and over a\ncombination of deficiencies related to journal entry processes, information technology general controls (“ITGC”), and the technical\nevaluation of accounting matters in 2023 (the “2023 Material Weaknesses”). A material weakness is defined as a deficiency, or combination\nof deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the\nCompany’s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. As a result of these material\nweaknesses, the Company concluded that its internal control over financial reporting was not effective as of December 31, 2022 and 2023.\nIn response to the 2022 Material Weakness discussed above related to 2022, the Company implemented remediation actions during\n2023 that included improving its review process including the reconciliation and documentation of the demand-side platform reports to the\nsell-side platform data, improving contract management and review processes, engaging outside consultants to review business process\nanalysis and flow of data to the accounting software platform and\n34\nTable of Contents\nfinancial reporting, identifying and documenting the risk assessment and internal controls, and testing the effectiveness of the design of our\ninternal controls. Upon completion of these efforts, the Company concluded that the 2022 Material Weakness had been remediated as of\nDecember 31, 2023.\nIn 2023, the Company engaged consultants to assist with identifying and testing the design of control over business processes as well\nas ITGC. This project was completed in the first quarter of 2024. Upon completion of its testing of the design and operation of key internal\ncontrols, the Company also performed an assessment of whether any identified control deficiencies in 2023 were significant individually or\non an aggregate basis. The Company determined that a combination of control deficiencies related to journal entry processes, ITGC and the\ntechnical evaluation of accounting matters indicated that material weaknesses existed as of the end of December 31, 2023.\nThe Company has begun the process of designing and implementing effective internal control measures to improve its internal controls\nover the journal entry processes, ITGC and the technical evaluation of accounting matters associated with the 2023 Material Weaknesses\nand remediate these material weaknesses. If these remedial measures are insufficient to address the 2023 Material Weaknesses, or if\nadditional material weaknesses in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting are discovered or occur in the future, the\nCompany’s consolidated financial statements may contain material misstatements, and the Company could be required to restate its\nfinancial results. In addition, if we are unable to successfully remediate the 2023 Material Weaknesses, our ability to produce timely and\naccurate financial statements, and comply with applicable laws and regulations will be impaired. If we are unable to report our results in a\ntimely and accurate manner, we may not be able to comply with the applicable covenants in our financing arrangements and may be\nrequired to seek additional amendments or waivers under these financing arrangements, which could adversely impact our liquidity and\nfinancial condition. Failure to produce timely and accurate financial statements could also impair our access to the capital markets and/or\nmaterially and adversely impact the trading price of our Class A Common Stock.\nFurthermore, as we grow our business, our disclosure controls and internal controls will become more complex, and we may require\nsignificantly more resources to ensure the effectiveness of these controls. If we are unable to continue upgrading our financial and\nmanagement controls, reporting systems, information technology and procedures in a timely and effective fashion, we may need to devote\nadditional management and other resources to assist in compliance with the disclosure and financial reporting requirements and other rules\nthat apply to reporting companies, which could adversely affect our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf we fail to maintain or implement effective internal controls, we may not be able to report financial results accurately or on a timely\nbasis, or to detect fraud, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and the per share price of our Class A Common\nStock.\nThe Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires, among other things, that we maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal\ncontrol over financial reporting. We are continuing to develop and refine our disclosure controls and other procedures that are designed to\nensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file with the SEC is recorded, processed, summarized and\nreported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms. We are also continuing to improve our internal control over financial\nreporting. We have expended, and anticipate that we will continue to expend, significant resources in order to maintain and improve the\neffectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting.\nOur current controls and any new controls that we develop may become inadequate because of changes in conditions in our business.\nFurther, weaknesses in our disclosure controls or our internal control over financial reporting may be discovered in the future. Any failure\nto develop or maintain effective controls, or any difficulties encountered in their implementation or improvement, could harm our operating\nresults or cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations and may result in a restatement of our financial statements for prior periods. Any\nfailure to implement and maintain effective internal control over financial reporting could also adversely affect the results of management\nreports and independent registered public accounting firm audits of our internal control over financial reporting that we are required to\ninclude in our periodic reports that are filed with the SEC. Ineffective disclosure controls and procedures, and internal control over\nfinancial reporting could also cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial and other information, which would likely have a\nnegative effect on the market price of our Class A Common Stock. In addition, if we are unable to continue to meet these requirements, we\nmay not be able to remain listed on The Nasdaq Capital Market.\n35\nTable of Contents\nOur independent registered public accounting firm is not required to audit the effectiveness of our internal control over financial\nreporting until after we are no longer an “emerging growth company,” as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012. At\nsuch time, our independent registered public accounting firm may issue a report that is adverse in the event it is not satisfied with the level\nat which our internal control over financial reporting is documented, designed or operating.\nAny failure to maintain effective disclosure controls and internal control over financial reporting could have a material and adverse\neffect on our business and operating results and cause a decline in the market price of our Class A Common Stock.\nIf we fail to satisfy applicable listing standards, including compliance with the rules requiring timely filing of our periodic reports\nwith the SEC, our common stock may be delisted from the Nasdaq Capital Market.\nOn April 17, 2024, May 21, 2024 and August 21, 2024, we received notices from the Listing Qualifications Department of The Nasdaq\nStock Market LLC (“Nasdaq”) regarding the Company’s failure to timely file its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2023, its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended March 31, 2024 and its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q\nfor the fiscal quarter ended June 30, 2023 (such reports, “Delinquent Filings”), respectively, with the SEC. The Company submitted a plan\nto Nasdaq to regain compliance with respect to the Delinquent Filings, and Nasdaq granted the Company an exception until October 14,\n2024 to evidence compliance with the rule requiring filing of our periodic reports. Neither the notices from Nasdaq nor the Company’s non-\ncompliance with the rule has an immediate effect on the listing or trading of the Company’s securities on Nasdaq, which currently\ncontinues to trade on The Nasdaq Capital Market under the symbol “DRCT.” The Company continues to work diligently to complete and\nfile the Delinquent Filings with the SEC and thereby regain compliance with the Rule as soon as practicable.\nThere can be no assurances, however, that we will be successful in regaining compliance with the continued listing requirements and\nmaintaining the listing of our common stock on the Nasdaq Capital Market. Delisting from the Nasdaq could adversely affect our ability to\nraise additional financing through the public or private sale of equity securities, would significantly affect the ability of investors to trade\nour securities and would negatively affect the value and liquidity of our common stock. Delisting could also have other negative results,\nincluding the potential loss of confidence by employees, the loss of institutional investor interest and fewer business development\nopportunities. If our common stock is delisted by the Nasdaq, the price of our common stock may decline and our common stock may be\neligible to trade on the OTC Markets or other over-the-counter quotation system, where an investor may find it more difficult to dispose of\ntheir common stock or obtain accurate quotations as to the market value of our common stock. Further, if we are delisted, we would incur\nadditional costs under requirements of state “blue sky” laws in connection with any sales of our securities. These requirements could\nseverely limit the market liquidity of our common stock and the ability of our stockholders to sell our common stock in the secondary\nmarket.\nWe may experience fluctuations in our operating results, which could make our future operating results difficult to predict or cause our\noperating results to fall below analysts’ and investors’ expectations.\nOur quarterly and annual operating results have fluctuated in the past and we expect our future operating results to fluctuate due to a\nvariety of factors, many of which are beyond our control. Fluctuations in our operating results could cause our performance to fall below\nthe expectations of analysts and investors, and adversely affect the price of our Class A Common Stock. Because our business is changing\nand evolving rapidly, our historical operating results may not be necessarily indicative of our future operating results. Factors that may\ncause our operating results to fluctuate include the following:\n● changes in demand for our platform, including related to the seasonal nature of spending on digital advertising campaigns;\n● changes in our pricing policies, the pricing policies of our competitors and the pricing or availability of inventory, data or of\nother third-party services;\n36\nTable of Contents\n● changes in our customer base and platform offerings;\n● the addition or loss of customers;\n● changes in advertising budget allocations, agency affiliations or marketing strategies;\n● changes to our product, media, customer or channel mix;\n● changes and uncertainty in the regulatory environment for us, advertisers or publishers;\n● changes in the economic prospects of advertisers or the economy generally, which could alter advertisers’ spending priorities,\nor could increase the time or costs required to complete advertising inventory sales;\n● changes in the availability of advertising inventory through real-time advertising exchanges or in the cost of reaching end\nconsumers through digital advertising;\n● disruptions or outages on our platform or by or through third party intermediaries used by our platform;\n● the introduction of new technologies or offerings by our competitors;\n● changes in our capital expenditures as we acquire the hardware, equipment and other assets required to support our business;\n● timing differences between our payments for advertising inventory and our collection of related advertising revenue;\n● the length and unpredictability of our sales cycle; and\n● costs related to acquisitions of businesses or technologies, or employee recruiting.\nBased upon the factors above and others beyond our control, we have a limited ability to forecast our future revenue, costs and\nexpenses, and as a result, our operating results may, from time to time, fall below our estimates or the expectations of analysts and\ninvestors.\nThe trading price of the shares of our Class A Common Stock has been volatile, and purchasers of our Class A Common Stock could\nincur substantial losses.\nTechnology stocks historically have experienced high levels of volatility. The trading price of our Class A Common Stock may\nfluctuate substantially. These fluctuations could cause you to incur substantial losses, including all of your investment in our Class A\nCommon Stock. Factors that could cause fluctuations in the trading price of our Class A Common Stock include the following: volatility in\nthe market price of companies in our industry; announcements of new solutions or technologies by us or our competitors; overall stock\nmarket fluctuations; changes in customer or investor perception; litigation or regulatory activity; or departures of key employees.\nWe are a “controlled company” for purposes of the Nasdaq Marketplace Rules and, as a result, qualify for, and may rely on, exemptions\nand relief from certain corporate governance requirements. If we rely on these exemptions, our stockholders will not have the same\nprotections afforded to stockholders of companies that are subject to such requirements.\nDDM, a holding company indirectly owned by our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and our President, beneficially owns\napproximately 75.8% of the combined voting power of our Class A and Class B Common Stock. As a result, we are a “controlled\ncompany” within the meaning of the Nasdaq corporate governance standards. Under these corporate governance standards, a company of\nwhich more than 50% of the voting power in the election of directors is\n37\nTable of Contents\nheld by an individual, group or another company is a “controlled company” and may elect not to comply with certain corporate governance\nrequirements. For example, controlled companies are not required to have:\n● a board that is composed of a majority of “independent directors,” as defined under the Nasdaq rules;\n● a compensation committee that is composed entirely of independent directors; and\n● director nominations be made, or recommended to the full board of directors, by its independent directors, or by a\nnominations/governance committee that is composed entirely of independent directors.\nWhile we do not intend to rely on the exemptions related to being a “controlled company” within the meaning of the Nasdaq rules, we\nmay utilize these exemptions for as long as we continue to qualify as a “controlled company.” Accordingly, our stockholders may not have\nthe same protections afforded to stockholders of companies that are subject to all of the corporate governance requirements of The Nasdaq\nCapital Market. Investors may find our Class A Common Stock less attractive as a result of our reliance on these exemptions. If some\ninvestors find our Class A Common Stock less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our Class A Common\nStock and our stock price may be more volatile.\nOur charter documents and Delaware law could discourage takeover attempts and other corporate governance changes.\nOur certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that could delay or prevent a change in control of our Company. These\nprovisions could also make it difficult for stockholders to elect directors that are not nominated by the current members of our board of\ndirectors or take other corporate actions, including effecting changes in our management. These provisions include certain provisions that:\n● permit the board of directors to establish the number of directors and fill any vacancies and newly created directorships;\n● provide that, after a removal for cause, vacancies on our board of directors may be filled only by a majority of directors then\nin office, even though less than a quorum;\n● prohibit cumulative voting in the election of directors;\n● require the affirmative vote of the holders of 66 2/3% of the voting power of our outstanding common stock to amend certain\nprovisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws;\n● authorize the issuance of “blank check” preferred stock that our board of directors could use to implement a stockholder\nrights plan;\n● restrict the forum for certain litigation against us to Delaware or federal courts;\n● permit our board of directors to alter our bylaws without obtaining stockholder approval; and\n● establish advance notice requirements for nominations for election to our board of directors or for proposing matters that can\nbe acted upon by stockholders at annual stockholder meetings.\nIn addition, as a Delaware corporation, we are subject to Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law (the “DGCL”). These\nprovisions may prohibit large stockholders, in particular those owning 15% or more of our outstanding voting stock, from merging or\ncombining with us for a period of time without the approval of our board of directors. In addition, our credit facilities include, and other\ndebt instruments we may enter into in the future may include, provisions entitling the lenders to demand immediate repayment of all\nborrowings upon the occurrence of certain change of control events relating to us, which also could discourage, delay or prevent a business\ncombination transaction.\n38\nTable of Contents\nBecause we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our Class A Common Stock in the foreseeable future, capital appreciation,\nif any, will be your sole source of gains.\nWe have never declared or paid any dividends on our Class A Common Stock. We currently intend to retain any earnings to finance the\noperation and expansion of our business, and we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future. Any determination\nto pay dividends in the future will be at the discretion of our board of directors. In addition, the terms of our existing debt arrangements\npreclude us from paying dividends and our future debt agreements, if any, may contain similar restrictions. As a result, you may only\nreceive a return on your investment in our Class A Common Stock if the market price of our Class A Common Stock increases.\nGeneral Risks\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish research or reports about our business or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research\nreports about our business, our share price and trading volume could decline.\nThe trading market for our Class A Common Stock partially depends on the research and reports that securities or industry analysts\npublish about us or our business. We do not have any control over these analysts. If one or more of the analysts who cover us should\ndowngrade our shares or change their opinion of our business prospects, our share price would likely decline. If one or more of these\nanalysts ceases coverage of us or fails to regularly publish reports on us, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which could\ncause our share price or trading volume to decline.\nOur reported financial results may be adversely affected by changes in accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. If\nour estimates or judgments relating to our critical accounting policies prove to be incorrect, our results of operations could be adversely\naffected.\nU.S. GAAP are subject to interpretation by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”), the SEC and various bodies formed\nto promulgate and interpret appropriate accounting principles. A change in these principles or interpretations could have a significant effect\non our reported results of operations and could affect the reporting of transactions already completed before the announcement of a change.\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that\naffect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities and disclosure of contingent liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the\nreported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period as shown in the financial statements and accompanying notes\nappearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Actual results could differ from these estimates. We base our estimates on past\nexperiences, market conditions, and other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, and we evaluate these\nestimates on an ongoing basis. We use estimates to determine many reported amounts, including but not limited to gross vs net assessment\nin revenue recognition, recoverability of goodwill and long-lived assets, useful lives used in amortization of intangibles, income taxes and\nvaluation allowances and fair values of assets and liabilities acquired in business combinations. Our results of operations may be adversely\naffected if our assumptions change or if actual circumstances differ from those in our assumptions, which could cause our results of\noperations to fall below the expectations of securities analysts and investors, resulting in a decline in the market price of our Class A\nCommon Stock.\nIf our estimates or judgments relating to our critical accounting policies are erroneous or based on assumptions that change or prove to\nbe incorrect, our operating results could fall below the expectations of securities analysts and investors, resulting in a decline in our\nstock price.\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect\nthe amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. We base our estimates on our best judgment,\nhistorical experience, information derived from third parties and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the\ncircumstances, as discussed in the section titled “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of\nOperations,” the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets, liabilities, equity, revenue and\nexpenses that are not readily apparent from other sources. Our operating results may be adversely affected if our judgments prove to be\nwrong, assumptions change\n39\nTable of Contents\nor actual circumstances differ from those in our assumptions, which could cause our operating results to fall below the expectations of\nsecurities analysts and investors, resulting in a decline in our stock price. Significant assumptions and estimates used in preparing our\nconsolidated financial statements include those related to revenue recognition, stock-based compensation and income taxes.\nITEM 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments\nNone.\nITEM 1C. Cybersecurity\nCybersecurity Risk Management and Strategy\nAll companies utilizing technology are subject to cybersecurity threats. We recognize the importance of assessing, identifying, and\nmanaging material risks associated with cybersecurity threats. These risks include, among other things: operational risks, extortion, harm to\nemployees or customers and violation of data privacy or security laws. We aim to incorporate best practices throughout our cybersecurity\nprogram. Identifying and assessing cybersecurity risk is integrated into our overall risk management systems and processes. We have\nprocesses in place to assess, identify, manage, and address material cybersecurity threats and incidents. These include, among other things:\nannual and ongoing security awareness training for employees to help identify, avoid, and mitigate cybersecurity threats; policy regarding\ncybersecurity; mechanisms to detect and monitor unusual network activity; and containment and incident response procedures. Third\nparties also play a role in our cybersecurity. We engage third-party services to conduct evaluations of our security controls, whether through\nindependent audits or consulting on best practices to address new challenges. These evaluations include testing both the design and\noperational effectiveness of security controls.\nIn the event of an incident, we intend to follow our detailed incident response policy and procedure, which outlines the steps to be\nfollowed from incident detection to mitigation, including notifying functional areas (e.g. legal), as well as senior leadership and the board\nof directors, as appropriate. Notwithstanding the approach we take to cybersecurity, we may not be successful in preventing or mitigating a\ncybersecurity incident that could have a material adverse effect on us. Any significant disruption to our service or access to our systems\ncould affect our business and results of operations. Further, a penetration of our systems or a third-party’s systems or other\nmisappropriation or misuse of personal information could subject us to business, regulatory, litigation and reputation risk, which could have\na negative effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. For more information regarding risks surrounding\ncybersecurity, please see “Risk Factors” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nIn the past two fiscal years, we have not identified any risks from cybersecurity threats that have materially affected (or are\nreasonably likely to materially affect) our business, results of operations, or financial condition. We can provide no assurance that there will\nnot be incidents in the future or that they will not materially affect us, including our business, results of operations, or financial condition.\nCybersecurity Governance\nCybersecurity is an important part of our risk management processes and an area of focus for our board of directors and\nmanagement team. Our board of directors have ultimate oversight regarding our cybersecurity with our audit committee specifically\nassisting the board of directors in the role of risk oversight by regularly reviewing cybersecurity matters and reporting to the board of\ndirectors. The Company’s Chief Technology Officer is responsible for developing and implementing our information security program and\nreporting on cybersecurity matters. Cybersecurity risk matters are reflected on reports and updates to operations management, senior\nmanagement and our audit committee on a quarterly basis. This includes existing and new cybersecurity risks, status on how management\nis addressing and/or mitigating those risks, cybersecurity and data privacy incidents (if any) and status on key information security\ninitiatives. To aid the board of directors with its cybersecurity and data privacy oversight responsibilities, the board of directors periodically\nhosts experts for presentations on these topics. For example, in 2023, management hosted an expert during the annual board of directors’\nretreat to discuss developments in the cybersecurity threat landscape. Our board of directors also engage in ad\n40\nTable of Contents\nhoc conversations with management on cybersecurity-related news events and discuss any updates to our cybersecurity risk management\nand strategy programs.\nAnu Pillai, our Chief Technology Officer, leads our cybersecurity efforts. She has been serving in her current role since March\n2021. Anu has over 20 years of experience serving companies across multiple industries in senior management roles, within information\ntechnology and as such has developed substantial experience in cybersecurity, among other areas. Team members who support our Chief\nTechnology Officer have similar broad experience and expertise in information security, including cybersecurity.\nITEM 2. Properties\nOur headquarters are located in Houston, Texas, where we occupy a facility with approximately 7,400 square feet under a lease that\nexpires in February 2030. We have permanent offices and/or a co-work office presence in two other office locations across the United\nStates: Austin and New York. These offices or workspaces are leased, and we do not own any real property. We believe that our current\nfacilities are adequate to meet our needs for the immediate future, and that, should it be needed, suitable additional space will be available\nto accommodate any expansion of our operations.\nITEM 3. Legal Proceedings\nWe may from time to time be subject to various legal or administrative claims and proceedings arising in the ordinary course of\nbusiness. As of the date hereof, except as set forth below, we are not a party to any material legal or administrative proceedings nor are\nthere any proceedings in which any of our directors, executive officers or affiliates, or any registered or beneficial stockholder, is an\nadverse party or has a material interest adverse to our interest. Litigation or any other legal or administrative proceeding, regardless of the\noutcome, is likely to result in substantial cost and diversion of our resources, including our management’s time and attention.\nOn May 23, 2024, an alleged stockholder, purportedly on behalf of the persons or entities who purchased or acquired publicly traded\nsecurities of the Company between April 2023 and March 2024, filed a filed a putative class action against the Company, certain of our\nofficers and directors, and other defendants in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Texas, alleging violations of federal\nsecurities laws related to alleged false or misleading disclosures made by the Company in its public filings. On July 9, 2024, another\nalleged stockholder filed a similar securities class action against the Company, certain of our officers and directors, also in the Southern\nDistrict of Texas. The two actions have been consolidated. Each of these complaints seeks unspecified damages, plus costs, fees, and\nattorneys’ fees. The Company cannot make any predictions about the final outcome of this matter or the timing thereof but believes that\nplaintiffs’ claims lack merit and intends to vigorously defend these lawsuits.\nOn May 10, 2024, the Company was the subject of a defamatory article / blog post which the Company believes was part of a\ncoordinated misinformation campaign. In connection with this post, one of the Company’s sell-side customers paused its connection to the\nCompany while the allegations were investigated. This customer reconnected the Company on May 22, 2024 and sell-side volumes have\nresumed but not yet at the levels experienced prior to the pause in May 2024. The Company is actively working with its partners to achieve\nprior volume levels. On May 14, 2024, the Company filed a lawsuit against the author of the defamatory article and is vigorously pursuing\nits rights. The Company cannot make any predictions about the final outcome of this litigation matter or the timing thereof.\nITEM 4.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nYou should read the following discussion together with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere\nin this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This discussion contains forward-looking statements based upon current expectations that involve\nrisks and uncertainties. Our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of\nvarious factors, including those set forth under the section titled “Risk Factors” or in other parts of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. See\n“– Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” below. Our historical results are not necessarily indicative of the results that\nmay be expected for any period in the future.\nCautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\nThis Annual Report on Form 10-K contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of federal securities laws that are subject\nto certain risks, trends and uncertainties. We use words such as “could,” “would,” “may,” “might,” “will,” “expect,” “likely,” “believe,”\n“continue,” “anticipate,” “estimate,” “intend,” “plan,” “project” and other similar expressions to identify forward-looking statements, but\nnot all forward-looking statements include these words. All of our forward-looking statements involve estimates and uncertainties that\ncould cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in or implied by the forward-looking statements. Accordingly, any such\nstatements are qualified in their entirety by reference to the information described under the caption “Risk Factors” and elsewhere in this\nAnnual Report on Form 10-K.\nThe forward-looking statements contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K are based on assumptions that we have made in light of\nour industry experience and our perceptions of historical trends, current conditions, expected future developments and other factors we\nbelieve are appropriate under the circumstances. As you read and consider this Annual Report on Form 10-K, you should understand that\nthese statements are not guarantees of performance or results. They involve risks, uncertainties (many of which are beyond our control) and\nassumptions.\nAlthough we believe that these forward-looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions, you should be aware that many\nfactors could affect our actual operating and financial performance and cause our performance to differ materially from the performance\nexpressed in or implied by the forward-looking statements. We believe these factors include, but are not limited to, the following:\n● the restrictions and covenants imposed upon us by our credit facilities;\n● the substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern, which may hinder our ability to obtain future financing;\n● our ability to secure additional financing to meet our capital needs;\n● ineligibility to file short-form registration statements on Form S-3, which may impair our ability to raise capital;\n● failure to satisfy applicable listing standards of the Nasdaq Capital Market resulting in a potential delisting of our common\nstock;\n● costs, risks and uncertainties related to the restatement of certain prior period financial statements;\n● any significant fluctuations caused by our high customer concentration;\n● risks related to non-payment by our clients;\n● reputational and other harms caused by our failure to detect advertising fraud;\n44\nTable of Contents\n● operational and performance issues with our platform, whether real or perceived, including a failure to respond to\ntechnological changes or to upgrade our technology systems;\n● restrictions on the use of third-party “cookies,” mobile device IDs or other tracking technologies, which could diminish our\nplatform’s effectiveness;\n● unfavorable publicity and negative public perception about our industry, particularly concerns regarding data privacy and\nsecurity relating to our industry’s technology and practices, and any perceived failure to comply with laws and industry self-\nregulation;\n● our failure to manage our growth effectively;\n● the difficulty in identifying and integrating any future acquisitions or strategic investments;\n● any changes or developments in legislative, judicial, regulatory or cultural environments related to information collection, use\nand processing;\n● challenges related to our buy-side clients that are destination marketing organizations and that operate as public/private\npartnerships;\n● any strain on our resources or diversion of our management’s attention as a result of being a public company;\n● the intense competition of the digital advertising industry and our ability to effectively compete against current and future\ncompetitors;\n● any significant inadvertent disclosure or breach of confidential and/or personal information we hold, or of the security of our\nor our customers’, suppliers’ or other partners’ computer systems;\n● as a holding company, we depend on distributions from Direct Digital Holdings, LLC (“DDH LLC”) to pay our taxes,\nexpenses (including payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement) and any amount of any dividends we may pay to the\nholders of our common stock;\n● the fact that DDH LLC is controlled by DDM, whose interest may differ from those of our public stockholders;\n● any failure by us to maintain or implement effective internal controls or to detect fraud; and\n● other factors and assumptions discussed in this Annual Report on Form 10-K under “Risk Factors,” and elsewhere in this\nAnnual Report on Form 10-K.\nShould one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize, or should any of these assumptions prove to be incorrect, our actual\noperating and financial performance may vary in material respects from the performance projected in these forward-looking statements.\nFurther, any forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date on which it is made, and except as required by law, we undertake no\nobligation to update any forward-looking statement contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K to reflect events or circumstances after\nthe date on which it is made or to reflect the occurrence of anticipated or unanticipated events or circumstances. New factors that could\ncause our business not to develop as we expect emerge from time to time, and it is not possible for us to predict all of them. Further, we\ncannot assess the impact of each currently known or new factor on our results of operations or the extent to which any factor, or\ncombination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements.\n45\nTable of Contents\nOverview\nDirect Digital Holdings, Inc. and its subsidiaries (collectively the “Company,” “DDH,” “we,” “us” and “our”), headquartered in\nHouston, Texas, is an end-to-end, full-service programmatic advertising platform primarily focused on providing advertising technology,\ndata-driven campaign optimization and other solutions intended for underserved and less efficient markets on both the sell- and buy-side of\nthe digital advertising ecosystem.

This customer reconnected the Company on May 22, 2024 and sell-side volumes have\nresumed but not yet at the levels experienced prior to the pause in May 2024. The Company is actively working with its partners to achieve\nprior volume levels. On May 14, 2024, the Company filed a lawsuit against the author of the defamatory article and is vigorously pursuing\nits rights. The Company cannot make any predictions about the final outcome of this litigation matter or the timing thereof.\nKey Factors Affecting Our Performance\nWe believe our growth and financial performance are dependent on many factors, including those described below.\nSell-side advertising business\nIncreasing revenue from customers through increased advertising spend from buyers\nColossus Media operates our proprietary sell-side programmatic platform operating under the trademarked banner of Colossus SSP.\nOur customers (or buyers) include ad exchanges, DSPs, agencies and individual advertisers. We have broad exposure to the ecosystem of\nbuyers, reaching on average approximately 115,000 advertisers per month in 2023 compared to approximately 114,000 in 2022. As\nspending on programmatic advertising increasingly becomes a larger share of the overall ad spend, advertisers and agencies are seeking\ngreater control of their digital advertising supply chains. To take advantage of this industry shift, we have entered into Supply Path\nOptimization agreements directly with customers which address acceptable advertisements and data usage. As part of these agreements, we\nprovide advertisers and agencies with benefits ranging from custom data and workflow integrations, product features, volume-based\nbusiness terms, and\n47\nTable of Contents\nvisibility into campaign performance data and methodology. As a result of these direct relationships, our existing advertisers and agencies\nare incentivized to allocate an increasing percentage of their advertising budgets to our platform.\nWe also strive to retain existing publishers and add new publishers. Establishing multiple header bidding integrations by leveraging our\ntechnology capabilities allows us to maximize our access to publishers’ ad formats, devices and various properties that a publisher may\nown. We may also up-sell additional products including our header bidding management, identity, and audience solutions. We enter into\nmaster service agreements with our publishers which, among other terms, set a fixed rate for content to be sold on Colossus SSP. Our\nstrategy on the sell-side advertising business represents growth potential, and we believe we are well positioned to be able to bring\nunderserved multicultural publishers into the advertising ecosystem, thereby increasing our value proposition across all customers,\nincluding large advertisers and agencies.\nMonetizing ad impressions for publishers and buyers\nWe curate advertisers and increase access to publishers with valuable ad impressions. We focus on monetizing digital impressions by\ncoordinating daily real-time auctions and bids. The publisher makes its ad inventory available on Colossus SSP and invites advertisers to\nbid based on the user’s data received. Each time the publisher’s web page loads, an ad request is sent to multiple ad exchanges and, in some\ncases, to the demand side platform directly from Colossus SSP. In case of real-time bidding (“RTB”) media buys, many DSPs would place\nbids to the impressions being offered by the publisher during the auction. The advertiser that bids a higher amount compared to other\nadvertisers will win the bid and pay the second highest price for the winning impression to serve the ads. We continuously review our\navailable inventory from existing publishers across every format (mobile, desktop, digital video, OTT, CTV, and rich media). The factors\nwe consider when determining which impressions we process include transparency, viewability, and whether or not the impression is\nhuman sourced. By consistently applying these criteria, we believe the ad impressions we process will be valuable and marketable to\nadvertisers.\nEnhancing ad inventory quality\nIn the advertising industry, inventory quality is assessed in terms of invalid traffic (“IVT”) which can be impacted by fraud such as\n“fake eyeballs” generated by automated technologies set up to artificially inflate impression counts. Through our platform design and\nproactive IVT mitigation efforts, we address and minimize IVT on a number of fronts, including sophisticated technology, which detects\nand avoids IVT on the front end; direct publisher and inventory relationships, for supply path optimization; and ongoing campaign and\ninventory performance review, to ensure inventory quality and brand protection controls are in place.\nGrowing access to valuable ad impressions\nOur recent growth has been driven by a variety of factors including increased access to mobile web (display and video) and mobile app\n(display and video) impressions and desktop video impressions. Our performance is affected by our ability to maintain and grow our access\nto valuable ad impressions from current publishers as well as through new relationships with publishers. For the year ended December 31,\n2023, we processed approximately 7.9 trillion bid requests, up 134% from 2022 when we processed 3.4 trillion bid requests.\nExpanding and managing investments\nEach impression or transaction occurs in a fraction of a second. Given that most transactions take place in an auction/bidding format,\nwe continue to make investments across the platform to further reduce the processing time. In addition to the robust infrastructure\nsupporting our platform, it is also critical that we align with key industry partners in the digital supply chain. The Colossus SSP is agnostic\nto any specific demand side platform.\nWe automate workflow processes whenever feasible to drive predictable and value-added outcomes for our customers and increase\nproductivity of our organization. In the first half of 2023, we transitioned our server platform to HPE Greenlake, which provides increased\ncapacity, faster response time, and expansion capabilities to align with growth in our business.\n48\nTable of Contents\nManaging industry dynamics\nWe operate in the rapidly evolving digital advertising industry. Due to the scale and complexity of the digital advertising ecosystem,\ndirect sales via manual, person-to-person processes are insufficient for delivering a real-time, personalized ad experience, creating the need\nfor programmatic advertising. In turn, advances in programmatic technologies have enabled publishers to auction their ad inventory to\nmore buyers, simultaneously, and in real time through a process referred to as header bidding. Header bidding has also provided advertisers\nwith transparent access to ad impressions. As advertisers keep pace with ongoing changes in the way that consumers view and interact with\ndigital media we anticipate further innovation and expect that header bidding will be extended into new areas such as OTT/CTV. We\nbelieve our focus on publishers and buyers has allowed us to understand their needs and our ongoing innovation has enabled us to quickly\nadapt to changes in the industry, develop new solutions and do so cost effectively. Our performance depends on our ability to keep pace\nwith industry changes such as header bidding and the evolving needs of our publishers and buyers while continuing our cost efficiency.\nSeasonality\nIn the advertising industry, companies commonly experience seasonal fluctuations in revenue. For example, in our sell-side advertising\nsegment, many advertisers allocate the largest portion of their budgets to the fourth quarter of the calendar year in order to coincide with\nincreased holiday purchasing. We expect our sell-side revenue to continue to fluctuate based on seasonal factors that affect the advertising\nindustry as a whole.\nBuy-side advertising business\nNew Customer Acquisitions\nOn the buy-side of our business, our customers consist of purchasers of programmatic advertising inventory (ad space) looking to\nplace their advertisements. We serve the needs of approximately 234 small and mid-sized clients, consisting of advertising space buyers,\nincluding small and mid-sized companies, large advertising holding companies (which may manage several agencies), independent\nadvertising agencies and mid-market advertising service organizations. We serve a variety of customers across multiple industries including\ntravel/tourism (including destination marketing organizations (“DMOs”)), education, energy, consumer packaged goods, healthcare,\nfinancial services (including cryptocurrency technologies) and other industries.\nWe are focused on increasing the number of customers that use our buy-side advertising businesses as their advertising partner. Our\nlong-term growth and results of operations will depend on our ability to attract more customers, including DMOs, across multiple\ngeographies.\nExpand Sales to Existing Customers\nOur customers understand the independent nature of our platform and relentless focus on driving results based on return on investment\n(“ROI”). Our value proposition is complete alignment across our entire digital supply platform beginning with the first dollar in and last\ndollar out. We are technology, DSP and media agnostic, and we believe our clients trust us to provide the best opportunity for success of\ntheir brands and businesses. As a result, our clients have been loyal, with approximately 90% client retention amongst the clients that\nrepresent approximately 80% of our revenue during the year ended December 31, 2023. In addition, we cultivate client relationships\nthrough our pipeline of managed and moderate serve clients that conduct campaigns through our platform. The managed services delivery\nmodel allows us to combine our technology with a highly personalized offering to strategically design and manage advertising campaigns.\nShift to Digital Advertising\nMedia has increasingly become more digital as a result of three key ongoing developments:\n● Advances in technology with more sophisticated digital content delivery across multiple platforms;\n49\nTable of Contents\n● Changes in consumer behavior, including spending longer portions of the day using mobile and other devices; and\n● Better audience segmentation with more efficient targeting and measurable results.\nThe resulting shift has enabled a variety of options for advertisers to efficiently target and measure their advertising campaigns across\nnearly every media channel and device. These efforts have been led by big- budgeted, large, multi-national corporations incentivized to cast\na broad advertising net to support national brands.\nIncreased Adoption of Digital Advertising by Small-and Mid-Sized Companies\nOnly recently have small and mid-sized businesses begun to leverage the power of digital media in meaningful ways, as emerging\ntechnologies have enabled advertising across multiple channels in a highly localized nature. Campaign efficiencies yielding measurable\nresults and higher advertising ROI have prompted these companies to begin utilizing digital advertising on an accelerated pace. We believe\nthis market is rapidly expanding, and that small-to-mid-sized advertisers will continue to increase their digital spend.\nSeasonality\nIn the advertising industry, companies commonly experience seasonal fluctuations in revenue. Historically, for our buy-side advertising\nsegment, the second and third quarters of the year reflect our highest levels of advertising activity and the first quarter reflects the lowest\nlevel of such activity. We expect our buy-side revenue to continue to fluctuate based on seasonal factors that affect the advertising industry\nas a whole.\nComponents of Our Results of Operations\nRevenues\nFor the sell-side advertising segment, we generate revenue by selling advertising inventory (digital ad units) that we purchase from\npublishers to advertisers through a process of monetizing ad impressions on our proprietary sell-side programmatic platform operating\nunder the trademarked banner Colossus SSP. For the buy-side advertising segment, we generate revenue from customers that enter into\nagreements with us to provide managed advertising campaigns, which include digital marketing and media services to purchase digital\nadvertising space, data and other add-on features.\nIn connection with our analysis of principal vs agent considerations, we have evaluated the specified goods or services and we\nconsidered whether we control the goods or services before they are provided to the customer including the three indicators of control.\nBased upon this analysis and our specific facts and circumstances, we concluded that we are a principal for the goods or services sold\nthrough both our sell-side advertising segment and our buy-side segment because we control the specified good or service before it is\ntransferred to the customer and we are the primary obligor in the agreement with the publisher (sell-side) or customer (buy-side).\nTherefore, we report revenue on a gross basis inclusive of all supplier costs. We pay suppliers for the cost of digital media, advertising\ninventory, data and any add-on services or features.\nOur revenue recognition policies are discussed in more detail under “Critical Accounting Estimates and Related Policies.”\nCost of revenues\nFor cost of revenues for our sell-side advertising segment, we pay publishers a fee, which is typically a percentage of the value of the\nad impressions monetized through our platform. Cost of revenues consists primarily of publisher media fees and data center co-location\ncosts. Media fees include the publishing and real time bidding costs to secure advertising space. For the buy-side advertising segment, cost\nof revenues consists primarily of digital media fees, third-party platform access fees, and other third-party fees associated with providing\nservices to our customers.\n50\nTable of Contents\nOperating expenses\nOperating expenses consist of compensation expenses related to our executive, sales, finance and administrative personnel (including\nsalaries, commissions, stock-based compensation, bonuses, benefits and taxes); general and administrative expenses (including rent\nexpense, professional fees, independent contractor costs, selling and marketing fees, administrative and operating system subscription\ncosts, insurance, and amortization expense related to our intangible assets); and other expense (including transactions that are unusual in\nnature or which are occurring infrequently).\nOther expense, net\nOther income. Other income includes income associated with recovery of receivables and other miscellaneous credit card rebates.\nInterest expense. Interest expense is mainly related to our debt as further described below in “—Liquidity and Capital Resources.” In\nconnection with the acquisition of Orange 142, we issued mandatorily redeemable non-participating preferred A and B units, and in\naccordance with Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 480, Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity, the value of these units was\nclassified as a liability, and the corresponding distributions were recognized as interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2022. The\npreferred A and B units were dully redeemed as of February 2022.\nLoss on early termination of line of credit. In January 2023, we entered into a Loan and Security Agreement (the “Loan Agreement”),\nby and among Silicon Valley Bank (“SVB”), which provided for a revolving credit facility (the “Credit Facility”). In March 2023, we\nissued a notice of termination and recognized a loss on the write-off of the deferred financing fees.\nLoss on redemption of non-participating preferred units. In February 2022, we redeemed the non-participating Class B Preferred Units\nand recognized a loss on the redemption of $0.6 million in connection with the write-off of the fair value associated with the units.\nForgiveness of Paycheck Protection Program Loan. During the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021, we obtained loans pursuant to\nthe Paycheck Protection Program (“PPP”), administered by the U.S. Small Business Administration (“SBA”). Forgiveness of PPP loans is\nrecognized as a gain in the period it is granted. In March 2021, DDH LLC received the proceeds of $0.3 million. On April 11, 2022, this\nbalance was forgiven.\n51\nTable of Contents\nResults of Operations\nComparison of the Years Ended December 31, 2023 and 2022\nThe following tables set forth our consolidated results of operations for the periods presented (in thousands).

Sell-side advertising revenue\nincreased $62.4 million, or 104%, while buy-side revenue increased $5.3 million, or 18%, over fiscal year 2022. The increase in our sell-\nside advertising revenue was primarily due to a continued increase in impression inventory, as well as increased publisher engagement\nacross both general market and underrepresented publisher communities. This was partially offset by a short-pay notice we received from a\ncustomer, resulting in a reduction of our 2023 revenue to the reported amount of $157 million. The Company has not been provided with\ninformation as to the reason for the short pay, and therefore has disputed it. In conjunction with the short pay, the Company recorded a\ncharge of $8.8 million for payments made to a few publishers, primarily because of the Company’s inability to charge back the publishers\nfor the short pay given the lack of information and related documentation supporting such transaction. We do not expect these amounts to\nrecur in any material fashion, although there is no assurance that customers will not take such action in the future. The Company sold\napproximately 4.2 billion average monthly impressions over the year ended December 31, 2023, an increase of 272% from the prior period.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company processed approximately 326 billion average monthly impressions through its sell-\nside advertising segment, an increase of 193% from the prior period. The increase in our buy-side advertising revenue was due to expanded\nspending from our existing customer base.\n52\nTable of Contents\nCost of Revenues\nConsistent with the increase in gross sales across both platforms, cost of revenues of $119.5 million in 2023 increased by $59.5\nmillion, or 99% from $60.0 million in 2022. Sell-side advertising cost of revenues increased $56.1 million, to $105.7 million, or 86% of\nrevenue for the year ended December 31, 2023, compared to $49.6 million, or 83% of revenue, for the same period in 2022. The increase in\ncosts was primarily due to the related increase in revenue, while the 3% increase as a percentage of revenue was due to an increase in fixed\ncosts of approximately $1.6 million related to an increase in server capacity to support the growth as well as the mix and concentration of\npublishers and the related costs. We expect these higher costs to continue in future fiscal periods. Buy-side advertising cost of revenues\nincreased $3.4 million, to $13.8 million, or 40% of revenue for the year ended December 31, 2023, compared to $10.4 million, or 36% of\nrevenue, for the same period in 2022.\nGross Profit\nGross profit was $37.6 million in 2023, or 24% of revenue, compared to $29.3 million, or 33% of revenue, in 2022, reflecting an\nincrease of $8.3 million or 28%. The change in margin for the year ended December 31, 2023 is attributable to the mix in revenue between\nour business segments as our faster-growing sell-side segment has higher cost of revenues compared to our buy-side segment, as well as the\nadditional fixed costs related to an increase in server capacity.\nSell-side advertising gross profit increased $6.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2023 as compared to prior year, primarily due\nto the increase in revenue. Sell-side advertising gross margin was 14% and 17% for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022,\nrespectively. Sell-side gross margin in 2023 was negatively impacted by additional fixed costs of approximately $1.6 million incurred in the\nyear ended December 31, 2023, related to an increase in server capacity to support our growth. About half of these incremental costs are\nexpected to continue through March 2024. Buy-side advertising gross profit increased $2.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2023,\nas compared to the same period in the prior year, primarily due to the increase in revenue. Buy-side advertising gross margin was 60% and\n64% for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Buy-side gross margin decreased in 2023 to a level the Company\nbelieves is sustainable reflecting strategic efforts by the Company to ensure customer retention and increase revenue per customer.\nOperating Expenses\nThe following table sets forth the components of operating expenses for the periods presented (in thousands):\nYear Ended December 31, Change\n2023 2022 Amount Percentage\nCompensation, taxes and benefits $ 17,730 $ 14,124 $ 3,606 26%\nGeneral and administrative 13,199 7,219 5,980 83%\nOther expense 8,830 — 8,830 nm%\nTotal operating expenses $ 39,759 $ 21,343 $ 18,416 86%\nnm – not meaningful\nCompensation, taxes and benefits\nCompensation, taxes and benefits of $17.7 million, increased by $3.6 million in 2023, or 26%, from $14.1 million in 2022. The\nincrease is due to headcount additions primarily in our operations area to support our growth as well as in our shared services to support our\npublic company infrastructure, bonus expense and severance of $0.3 million. In connection with our initial public offering, the Company\nadopted the 2022 Omnibus Incentive Plan (“2022 Omnibus Plan”) to facilitate the grant of equity awards to our employees, consultants and\nnon-employee directors. On June 10, 2022, March 20, 2023 and June 10, 2023, our board of directors granted stock options and restricted\nstock units (“RSUs”) to certain of our employees and non-employee directors. The increase in compensation, taxes and benefits expense\nrelated to stock options and RSUs granted was $2.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, including $1.4 million accrued but not\n53\nTable of Contents\nyet granted stock-based compensation associated with the 2023 bonus program. We expect to continue to invest in corporate infrastructure\nand incur additional expenses associated with our transition to and operation as a public company, including increased compensation\nassociated with additional headcount to support our sales initiatives.\nGeneral and administrative\nGeneral and administrative (“G&A”) expenses of $13.2 million in 2023 increased from $7.2 million in 2022. G&A expenses as a\npercentage of revenue was 8% for both 2023 and 2022. The increase in G&A costs during the year ended December 31, 2023 was primarily\ndue to costs associated with our transition to and operation as a public company beginning in February 2022. During the year ended\nDecember 31, 2023, we incurred higher professional fees, sales and marketing expenses and travel expenses. We also completed the\ntransition of our servers for Colossus Media to HPE Greenlake and incurred higher consulting and transition costs for this one-time project.\nThis project contributed to $0.3 million of the increase in G&A costs during the year ended December 31, 2023. We expect to continue to\ninvest in and incur additional expenses associated with our transition to operating as a public company, including increased professional\nfees, investment in automation and compliance costs associated with developing the requisite infrastructure required for internal controls.\nOther expense\nThe Company received a short pay notice from a sell-side customer in 2024 resulting in reduction of our 2023 revenue to the reported\namount of $157 million. In conjunction with the short pay, the Company recorded a charge of $8.8 million for payments made to a few\npublishers. The Company has not been provided with information as to the reason for the short pay, and therefore has disputed the short\npay. We do not expect these amounts to recur in any material fashion, although there is no assurance that customers will not take such\naction in the future.\nOther Expense, Net\nThe following table sets forth the components of other expense, net for the periods presented (in thousands):\nYear Ended December 31, Change\n2023 2022 Amount Percentage\nInterest expense $ (4,378) $ (3,231) $ (1,147) 35%\nLoss on early termination of line of credit (300) — (300) nm%\nRevaluation of tax receivable agreement liability 331 — 331 nm%\nLoss on redemption of non-participating preferred units — (590) 590 nm%\nForgiveness of Paycheck Protection Program loan — 287 (287) nm%\nOther income 256 48 208 433%\nTotal other expense, net $ (4,091) $ (3,486) $ (605) 17%\nnm – not meaningful\nOther expense, net for the year ended December 31, 2023 primarily consists of $4.4 million of interest expense and $0.3 million\nrelated to the loss on early termination of the line of credit with SVB, partially offset by the non-cash revaluation of the tax receivable\nagreement liability and other income. Other expense, net for the year ended December 31, 2022 is comprised of $3.2 million of interest\nexpense and $0.6 million associated with the loss on the early redemption of DDH LLC’s previously outstanding Class B Preferred Units\npartially offset by forgiveness of the PPP loan and other income.\nInterest expense increased for the year ended December 31, 2023 to $4.4 million, compared to $3.2 million for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2022. The increase in interest expense in the period is due to additional net borrowings of $5.8 million in 2023 under the\nCompany’s credit facilities, as well as higher interest rates.\n54\nTable of Contents\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nGoing Concern\nAs discussed in Note 9 of our consolidated financial statements, on May 10, 2024, the Company was the subject of a defamatory\narticle / blog post which the Company believes was part of a coordinated misinformation campaign. In connection with this post, one of the\nCompany’s sell-side customers paused its connection to the Company for a couple of weeks in May 2024, which reduced sell-side sales\nvolumes. As of the date of this report, sell-side volumes related to this customer have resumed but not yet at the levels experienced prior to\nthe pause in May 2024 which has created significant disruption in the Company’s sell-side business. The Company is actively working with\nits partners to achieve prior volume levels. However, there can be no assurance that the Company will be able to achieve prior volume\nlevels with its partners or on the timing of achieving such volume levels. Additionally, the Company (1) incurred a net loss of $6.8 million\nin 2023 primarily related to payments made to a few publishers of $8.8 million associated with a disputed short payment from a customer,\n(2) reported an accumulated deficit of $2.5 million as of December 31, 2023, (3) reported cash and cash equivalents of $5.1 million as of\nDecember 31, 2023, (4) has borrowed $3.0 million and $9.7 million as of December 31, 2023 and the date of this report, respectively, under\nthe Credit Agreement which matures in July 2025, (5) was notified on April 17, 2024 that the Company’s auditor had resigned and (6) was\nunable to timely file its 2023 annual report and quarterly reports for the first two quarters of 2024. The delay in filing the Company’s\nannual and quarterly reports disrupted existing capital-raising efforts and created additional audit, legal and other expenses. These factors\nraise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern over the next twelve months.\nThe Company anticipates sources of liquidity to include cash on hand and cash flow from operations and has taken several actions\nto address liquidity concerns. These actions include (1) a plan to reduce expenses through a staff reduction, a pause on hiring and cost\nsavings measures that were executed on July 1, 2024, (2) working with lenders to provide temporary relief from debt covenants (see Note 3\n– Long-Term Debt to the Company’s audited financial statements) while rebuilding sell-side volumes, (3) raising capital through\narrangements with various providers, and (4) regaining compliance with respect to delinquent SEC filings which will allow the Company to\naccess the capital markets as well as other financing sources. There can be no assurance that the Company’s actions will be successful or\nthat additional financing will be available when needed or on acceptable terms.\nSources of Liquidity\nThe following table summarizes our cash and cash equivalents, working capital, and availability under our Credit Agreement (as\ndefined below) on December 31, 2023 and 2022 (in thousands):\nDecember 31,\n2023 2022\nCash and cash equivalents $ 5,116 $ 4,047\nWorking capital $ 3,280 $ 6,712\nAvailability under Credit Agreement $ 7,000 $ —\nTo fund our operations and service our debt thereafter and depending on our growth and results of operations, we may raise additional\ncapital through the issuance of additional equity and/or debt, which could have the effect of diluting our stockholders. Any future equity or\ndebt financings may be on terms which are not favorable to us. As our credit facilities become due, we will need to repay, extend or replace\nsuch indebtedness. Our ability to do so will be subject to future economic, financial, business and other factors, many of which are beyond\nour control.\nCredit Facilities\nLafayette Square\nOn December 3, 2021, the Company entered into the Term Loan and Security Agreement (the “2021 Credit Facility”) with Lafayette\nSquare Loan Services, LLC (“Lafayette Square”) as administrative agent, and the various lenders thereto. The term loan under the 2021\nCredit Facility initially provided for a term loan in the principal amount of up to $32.0\n55\nTable of Contents\nmillion, consisting of a $22.0 million closing date term loan (the “Term Loan”) and an up to $10.0 million delayed draw term loan (the\n“Delayed Draw Loan”). The loans under the 2021 Credit Facility originally bore interest at LIBOR plus the applicable margin minus any\napplicable impact discount. The applicable margin under the 2021 Credit Facility was determined based on the consolidated total net\nleverage ratio of the Company and its consolidated subsidiaries, at a rate of 6.50% per annum if the consolidated total net leverage ratio is\nless than 2.00 to 1.00 and up to 9.00% per annum if the consolidated total net leverage ratio was greater than 4.00 to 1.00. On June 1, 2023,\nas originally contemplated under the 2021 Credit Facility, the Company entered into an agreement with Lafayette Square to convert the\nexisting LIBOR based rate to a Term Secured Overnight Financing Rate (“SOFR”) with a credit spread of 0.15% per annum for the interest\nperiods of three months and providing for a credit spread adjustment of 0.10%, 0.15% or 0.25% per annum for interest periods of one\nmonth, three months or six months, respectively. The loans under the 2021 Credit Facility bear interest at SOFR plus the applicable credit\nspread adjustment plus the applicable margin minus any applicable impact discount. Prior to entering into the Fifth Amendment (as defined\nbelow), the applicable margin under the 2021 Credit Facility was based on the consolidated total net leverage ratio of the Company at a rate\nof 7.00% per annum if the consolidated total net leverage ratio was less than or equal to 1.00 to 1.00 with gradual increases as the ratio\nincreased up to 10.00% per annum if the consolidated total net leverage ratio was greater than 3.50 to 1.00. The maturity date of the 2021\nCredit Facility is December 3, 2026.\nOn July 28, 2022, the Company entered into the Second Amendment and Joinder to Term Loan and Security Agreement and received\nproceeds of $4.3 million borrowed under the Delayed Draw Loan to pay the balance owed on the common unit redemption as well as costs\nassociated with the transaction.\nSubsequently, on October 3, 2023, the Company entered into the Fourth Amendment to the 2021 Credit Facility (the “Fourth\nAmendment”) and received proceeds of $3.6 million borrowed under the Delayed Draw Loan to make payments in connection with the\nconsummation of the 2023 warrant tender offer and fees and expenses incurred as described in Note 4 – Stockholders’ Equity and Stock-\nBased Compensation in the notes to the consolidated financial statements. In connection with the Fourth Amendment, the Company agreed\nit would not be permitted to request any additional funds under the Delayed Draw Loan, and Lafayette Square would not be obligated to\nfund any such requests.\nQuarterly installment payments on the Term Loan and the Delayed Draw Loan, due on the last day of each fiscal quarter, began March\n31, 2022 with a final installment due December 3, 2026 for remaining balances outstanding under each loan. Each quarterly installment\npayment under the closing date term loan was $137,000 from January 1, 2022 through December 31, 2023, and each installment payment\nthereafter until maturity is $275,000. Each quarterly installment payment under the Delayed Draw Loan was 0.625% of the amount of the\nDelayed Draw Loan through December 31, 2023, and each installment payment thereafter until maturity is 1.25% of the amount of the\nDelayed Draw Loan.\nUnder the 2021 Credit Facility, dividends and distributions by DDH LLC to the Company and any shareholders of the Company are\npermitted so long as (i) no default or event of default is continuing or would occur after giving pro forma effect to such dividends and\ndistributions under the 2021 Credit Facility, (ii) the Company, on a pro forma basis, maintains a consolidated senior net leverage ratio of\nnot greater than 1.5 to 1.0, and (iii) the Company, on a pro forma basis, maintains liquidity of not less than $15,000,000.\nThe obligations under the 2021 Credit Facility are secured by senior, first-priority liens on all or substantially all assets of the\nCompany. As of December 31, 2023, the Company owed a balance on the 2021 Credit Facility of $28.6 million. Additional deferred\nfinancing costs of less than $0.1 million and $0.5 million were incurred during the year ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nUnamortized deferred financing costs as of December 31, 2023 and 2022 were $1.7 million and $2.1 million, respectively. Accrued and\nunpaid interest was $0 as of December 31, 2023 and 2022. The 2021 Credit Facility contains customary affirmative and negative\ncovenants. Prior to entering into the Fifth Amendment, the Company was required to maintain a net leverage ratio of no more than 3.50 to\n1.00 as of December 31, 2021 and the last day of each fiscal quarter through December 31, 2023, 3.25 to 1.00 as of March 31, 2024 and the\nlast day of each fiscal quarter through March 31, 2025, 3.00 to 1.00 as of June 30, 2025 and September 30, 2025, with incremental\ntightening of the ratio to 2.50 to 1.00 as of June 30, 2026 and thereafter through maturity. Prior to entering to the Fifth Amendment, the\n2021 Credit Facility also required the Company to maintain a fixed charge coverage ratio of not less than 1.50 to 1.00 as of the last day of\neach fiscal quarter, as well as restrictions on the ability to incur indebtedness, create certain liens, make certain investments, make certain\ndividends and other types of distributions, and enter into or undertake certain mergers,\n56\nTable of Contents\nconsolidations, acquisitions and sales of certain assets and subsidiaries. The Company was in compliance with all the financial covenants\nunder the 2021 Credit Facility as of December 31, 2023. With the Fifth Amendment, the Company expects to be in compliance with all\namended covenants for at least one year from the balance sheet date in this annual report.\nOn October 15, 2024, with an effective date of June 30, 2024, the Company and Lafayette Square entered into the Fifth Amendment to\nthe Term Loan and Security Agreement (the “Fifth Amendment”) which among other things, (1) defers quarterly installment payments on\nthe Term Loan and the Delayed Draw Loan for the periods from June 30, 2024 through December 31, 2025, (2) requires that the Company\npay a commitment fee of 50 basis points or an amount of $0.1 million to Lafayette Square, (3) allows proceeds from future equity raises by\nthe Company, if any, to cure potential financial covenant noncompliance, (4) provides for one-month and three-month interest periods, (5)\nreplaces the calculation of the consolidated total net leverage ratio with a consolidated total leverage ratio for purposes of calculating the\napplicable margin and the financial covenant and (6) replaces the financial covenants under the 2021 Credit Facility (effective as of June\n30, 2024) with the following:\nMinimum TTM* Maximum\nEBITDA ($ in Minimum Liquidity ($ Consolidated Total Minimum Fixed\nAs of millions) in millions) Leverage Ratio Charge Coverage Ratio\nJune 30, 2024 n/a n/a n/a n/a\nSeptember 30, 2024 $5.0 $1.5 n/a n/a\nDecember 31, 2024 $3.5 $1.5 n/a n/a\nMarch 31, 2025 $5.5 $2.0 n/a n/a\nJune 30, 2025 $7.5 $2.0 n/a 1.50 to 1.00\nSeptember 30, 2025 n/a $2.0 4.25 to 1.0 1.50 to 1.00\nDecember 31, 2025 n/a $2.0 4.00 to 1.0 1.50 to 1.00\nMarch 31, 2026 n/a $2.0 3.75 to 1.0 1.50 to 1.00\nJune 30, 2026 n/a $2.0 3.50 to 1.0 1.50 to 1.00\nSeptember 30, 2026 n/a $2.0 3.25 to 1.0 1.50 to 1.00\n*TTM = Trailing Twelve Months\n2023 Revolving Line of Credit - East West Bank\nOn July 7, 2023, the Company entered into a Credit Agreement (as amended, the “Credit Agreement”), with East West Bank (“EWB”),\nas lender. The Credit Agreement provides for a revolving credit facility in the principal amount of up to $10 million, subject to a borrowing\nbase determined based on eligible accounts, and an up to $5 million uncommitted incremental revolving facility. Loans under the Credit\nAgreement mature on July 7, 2025 (the “Maturity Date”), unless the Credit Agreement is otherwise terminated pursuant to the terms of the\nCredit Agreement.\nBorrowings under the Credit Agreement bear interest at a rate per annum equal to the one-month Term SOFR rate and as determined\nby EWB on the first day of the applicable interest period, plus 0.10% (10 basis points), plus 3.00% per annum (the “Loan Rate”); provided,\nthat, in no event shall the Loan Rate be less than 0.50% of the Loan Rate effective as of the date of the Credit Agreement nor more than the\nmaximum rate of interest allowed under applicable law. Upon an event of default under the Credit Agreement, the outstanding principal\namounts of any advances will accrue interest at a rate per annum equal to the Loan Rate plus five percent (5%), but in no event in excess of\nthe maximum rate of interest allowed under applicable law.\nAt the Company’s option, the Company may at any time prepay the outstanding principal balance of the Credit Agreement in whole or\nin part, without fee, penalty or premium. All accrued but unpaid interest on outstanding advances under the Credit Agreement are payable\nin monthly installments on the last day of each monthly interest period until the Maturity Date when the then-outstanding principal balance\nof the advances and all accrued but unpaid interest thereon\n57\nTable of Contents\nbecomes due and payable. The obligations under the Credit Agreement are secured by all or substantially all of the borrowers’ assets.\nPrior to entering into the Third Amendment (as defined below), the Company was required to maintain compliance at all times with the\nfollowing financial covenants on a consolidated basis: (i) a fixed charge coverage ratio of not less than 1.25 to 1.0, beginning with the fiscal\nquarter ended on June 30, 2023 and at the end of each fiscal quarter thereafter; (ii) a total funded debt-to-EBITDA ratio of no more than\n3.50 to 1.00 as of June 30, 2023 and the last day of each fiscal quarter through December 31, 2023, 3.25 to 1.00 as of March 31, 2024 and\nthe last day of each fiscal quarter through March 31, 2025 and 3.00 to 1.00 as of June 30, 2025 and thereafter through maturity; and (iii) a\nliquidity covenant requiring the Company to maintain minimum liquid assets at all times (calculated in the manner provided for in the\nCredit Agreement), in one or more accounts held with EWB plus Revolving Credit Availability in the amount of $1,000,000. Revolving\nCredit Availability is defined as an amount such that the ratio of the value of eligible accounts to the aggregate amount of all outstanding\nadvances under the credit agreement at such time is not less than 2.0 to 1.0. The Company was in compliance with all the financial\ncovenants under the Credit Agreement as of December 31, 2023. With the Third Amendment, the Company expects to be in compliance\nwith all amended covenants for at least one year from the balance sheet date in this annual report.\nOn October 15, 2024, with an effective date of June 30, 2024, the Company and EWB entered into the Third Amendment to the Credit\nAgreement (the “Third Amendment”) which, among other things, (1) provides that the Company will make prepayments of the outstanding\nprincipal balance of the Credit Agreement of $1.0 million upon execution of the Third Amendment, $1.0 million on or before January 15,\n2025 and $2.0 million on or before April 15, 2025, (2) requires the Company to file a registration statement with the SEC to establish an\nequity line of credit offering on or before October 31, 2024 and to use commercially reasonable efforts to cause such registration statement\nto become effective, (3) requires the net proceeds of a potential equity line of credit to be applied to the outstanding principal balance under\nthe Credit Agreement in an amount that would cause the ratio of the value of eligible accounts to the aggregate amount of revolving credit\nadvances to be not less than 1.00 to 1.00, (4) requires the consent of EWB prior to the ability of the Company to make certain restricted\npayments, including cash dividends, (5) requires the Company to make additional prepayments in the amount by which the outstanding\nloans under the Credit Agreement exceed the borrowing base between the calendar months ending November 30, 2024 and April 15, 2025,\nand (6) replaces the financial covenants under the Credit Agreement, effective as of June 30, 2024, with the following:\nMaximum Total\nMinimum TTM(1) Minimum Liquid Funded Debt to Minimum Fixed Revolving Credit\nEBITDA ($ in Assets ($ in EBITDA Leverage Charge Coverage Availability (as of\nAs of millions) millions) Ratio Ratio each month end)\nJune 30, 2024 n/a $1.0 n/a n/a n/a\nSeptember 30, 2024 $5.0 $1.5 n/a n/a n/a\nDecember 31, 2024 $3.5 $1.5 n/a n/a 1.0 to 1.0(2)\nMarch 31, 2025 $5.5 $2.0 n/a n/a 1.5 to 1.0(3)\nJune 30, 2025 $7.5 $2.0 n/a 1.25 to 1.00 2.0 to 1.0(4)\n(1) TTM = Trailing Twelve Months\n(2) Beginning November 30, 2024\n(3) Beginning January 31, 2025\n(4) Beginning April 15, 2025\nThe Credit Agreement contains customary representations and warranties and includes affirmative and negative covenants applicable\nto the borrowers and their respective subsidiaries. The affirmative covenants include, among others, covenants requiring the Company to\nmaintain its legal existence and governmental compliance, deliver certain financial reports and maintain insurance coverage. The negative\ncovenants include, among others, restrictions on indebtedness, liens, investments, mergers, dispositions, prepayment of other indebtedness\nand dividends and other distributions.\n58\nTable of Contents\nThe Credit Agreement also includes customary events of default, including, among other things, non-payment defaults, covenant\ndefaults, inaccuracy of representations and warranties, defaults under any of the loan documents, certain cross-defaults to other\nindebtedness, certain bankruptcy and insolvency events, invalidity of guarantees or grant of security interest, certain ERISA-related\ntransactions and events, certain orders of forfeiture, change of control, certain undischarged attachments, sequestrations, or similar\nproceedings, and certain undischarged or non-stayed judgments, in certain cases subject to certain thresholds and grace periods. The\noccurrence of an event of default could result in the acceleration of the obligations under the Credit Agreement of the Company or other\nborrowers. During the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company incurred $0.3 million of deferred financing costs associated with the\nCredit Agreement. As of December 31, 2023, there was $3.0 million outstanding under the Credit Agreement.\nThe collateral securing the obligations under the 2021 Credit Facility and the Credit Agreement is subject to intercreditor agreements\nbetween Lafayette Square and EWB.\nHistorical Cash Flows:\nThe following table sets forth our cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 (in thousands):\nYear Ended December 31,\n2023 2022\nNet cash provided by operating activities $ 2,558 $ 2,064\nNet cash used in investing activities (178) (688)\nNet cash used in financing activities (1,311) (2,013)\nNet increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents $ 1,069 $ (637)\nOur cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2023 were held for working capital and general corporate purposes. The increase in\ncash and cash equivalents compared with December 31, 2022, primarily resulted from $2.6 million in cash flows from operating activities\npartially offset by $0.2 million in cash flows used for investing activities and $1.3 million in cash flows used for financing activities.\nOperating Activities\nCash provided by operating activities has typically been generated from net income and by changes in our operating assets and\nliabilities, particularly in the areas of accounts receivable and accounts payable and accrued expenses, adjusted for certain non-cash and\nnon-operating expense items such as depreciation, amortization, stock-based compensation and deferred income taxes.\nIn 2023, net cash flows provided by operating activities were $2.6 million and consisted of net loss of $6.8 million, $4.7 million in\nadjustments for non-cash and non-operating items and $4.7 million of cash inflows from working capital. Adjustments for non-cash and\nnon-operating items mainly consisted of depreciation and amortization expense of $3.0 million, stock-based compensation expense of $0.7\nmillion and $0.6 million of deferred tax expense.\nThe $4.7 million increase in cash resulting from changes in working capital primarily consisted of $16.2 million increase in accounts\npayable partially offset by an $11.3 million increase in accounts receivable. The increase in accounts receivable and accounts payable is\nmainly due to growth in the business as well as the $8.8 million non-recurring publisher payment recorded as accounts payable as of\nDecember 31, 2023.\nIn 2022, net cash flows provided by operating activities were $2.1 million and consisted of net income of $4.2 million, $3.3 million in\nadjustments for noncash and non-operating items and $5.4 million of cash flows used for working capital. Adjustments for non-cash and\nnon-operating items primarily consisted of depreciation and amortization expense of $2.7 million, stock-based compensation expense of\n$0.2 million, loss on redemption of non-participating preferred units of $0.6 million, partially offset by $0.3 million from forgiveness of\nPPP loan.\nThe $5.2 million decrease in cash resulting from changes in working capital primarily consisted of a $18.5 million increase in accounts\nreceivable partially offset by a $2.6 million increase in accrued expenses such as payroll and payroll\n59\nTable of Contents\nrelated expenses and $11.0 million increase in accounts payable. The increase in accounts receivable and accounts payable is mainly due to\nthe growth in the business.\nInvesting Activities\nOur investing activities to date have consisted primarily of purchases of software, office furniture and leasehold improvements.\nIn 2023, net cash flows used in investing activities of $0.2 million were primarily related to development of internal-use software.\nIn 2022, net cash flows used in investing activities of $0.7 million were primarily related to acquiring the license to the Company’s\nproprietary Colossus SSP platform (see Note 10 – Property, equipment and software, net).\nFinancing Activities\nIn 2023, net cash used in financing activities was $1.3 million mainly resulting from $3.2 million of distributions to holders of LLC\nUnits, $3.5 million paid to acquire and redeem warrants, $0.7 million paid on term loan and $0.6 million deferred financing costs partially\noffset by $3.0 million net draws on the Credit Agreement and $3.6 million proceeds from 2021 Credit Facility utilized for the warrant\nredemption.\nIn 2022, net cash used in financing activities was $2.0 million mainly resulting from: $1.7 million of distributions to holders of LLC\nUnits, $7.0 million paid to redeem non-participating preferred units, $7.2 million paid to redeem common units, $1.0 million paid on term\nloan and line of credit partially offset by $11.1 million proceeds from issuance of common stock in the initial public offering and $4.3\nmillion proceeds from the 2021 Credit Facility.\nContractual Obligations and Future Cash Requirements\nAs of December 31, 2023, our principal contractual obligations expected to give rise to material cash requirements consist of the 2021\nCredit Facility, the Credit Agreement and non-cancelable leases for our various facilities. We anticipate that the future minimum payments\nrelated to our current indebtedness over the next five years will be $1.5 million in 2024, $4.5 million in 2025, $25.7 million in 2026, less\nthan $0.1 million in 2027, less than $0.1 million in 2028, and $0.1 million thereafter, assuming we do not refinance our indebtedness, enter\ninto a new revolving credit facility or make any further draws under the revolving facility. The leases will require minimum payments of\n$0.2 million in 2024, $0.2 million in 2025, $0.2 million in 2026, $0.2 million in 2027, $0.2 million in 2028 and $0.2 million thereafter. As\nof December 31, 2023, we had cash and cash equivalents of $5.1 million. Based on projections of revenue and operating results in the\ncoming year, the available cash held by the Company and the amounts the Company may borrow under the Credit Agreement, the\nCompany believes that it will have sufficient cash resources to finance its operations and service any maturing debt obligations for at least\nthe next twelve months following the issuance of these financial statements.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nIn addition to our results determined in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”), including, in\nparticular operating income, net cash provided by operating activities, and net income, we believe that earnings before interest, taxes,\ndepreciation and amortization, as adjusted for revaluation of tax receivable agreement liability, loss on early termination of line of credit,\nforgiveness of PPP loan, loss on redemption of non-participating preferred units, and stock-based compensation (“Adjusted EBITDA”), a\nnon-GAAP measure, is useful in evaluating our operating performance. The most directly comparable GAAP measure to Adjusted\nEBITDA is net income.\n60\nTable of Contents\nThe following table presents a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to net income for each of the periods presented (in thousands):\nYear Ended December 31,\n2023 2022\nNet (loss) income [1] $ (6,844) $ 4,167\nAdd back (deduct):\nInterest expense 4,378 3,231\nAmortization of intangible assets 1,954 1,954\nStock-based compensation 706 154\nStock-based compensation accrued but not yet granted 1,409 —\nDepreciation and amortization of property, equipment and software 253 34\nLoss on early termination of line of credit 300 —\nIncome tax expense 568 326\nRevaluation of tax receivable agreement liability (331) —\nForgiveness of Paycheck Protection Program loan — (287)\nLoss on redemption of non-participating preferred units — 590\nAdjusted EBITDA $ 2,393 $ 10,169\n__________________\n[1] During the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, we recorded one-time severance charges of approximately $0.3 million and\n$0.7 million, respectively. During the year ended December 31, 2023, we recorded a charge in the amount of $8.8 million for\npayments made in 2024 to a few publishers for which the related sell-side revenue for 2023 was short paid by a sell-side\ncustomer. See further discussion in Note 9 – Commitments and Contingencies in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nIn addition to operating income and net income, we use Adjusted EBITDA as a measure of operational efficiency. We believe that this\nnon-GAAP financial measure is useful to investors for period-to-period comparisons of our business and in understanding and evaluating\nour operating results for the following reasons:\n● Adjusted EBITDA is widely used by investors and securities analysts to measure a company’s operating performance without\nregard to items such as depreciation and amortization, interest expense, provision for income taxes, stock-based\ncompensation, revaluation of tax receivable agreement liability, and certain one-time items such as acquisition transaction\ncosts, losses from early termination or redemption of credit agreements or preferred units and gains from settlements or loan\nforgiveness that can vary substantially from company to company depending upon their financing, capital structures and the\nmethod by which assets were acquired;\n● Our management uses Adjusted EBITDA in conjunction with GAAP financial measures for planning purposes, including the\npreparation of our annual operating budget, as a measure of operating performance and the effectiveness of our business\nstrategies and in communications with our board of directors concerning our financial performance; and\n● Adjusted EBITDA provides consistency and comparability with our past financial performance, facilitates period-to-period\ncomparisons of operations, and also facilitates comparisons with other peer companies, many of which use similar non-\nGAAP financial measures to supplement their GAAP results.\nOur use of this non-GAAP financial measure has limitations as an analytical tool, and you should not consider it in isolation or as a\nsubstitute for analysis of our financial results as reported under GAAP.\nCritical Accounting Estimates and Related Policies\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that\naffect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities and disclosure of contingent liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the\nreported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from these estimates. The Company\nbases its estimates on past experiences, market conditions, and other\n61\nTable of Contents\nassumptions that the Company believes are reasonable under the circumstances, and the Company evaluates these estimates on an ongoing\nbasis. The Company uses estimates to determine many reported amounts, including but not limited to gross vs net assessment in revenue\nrecognition, recoverability of goodwill and long-lived assets, useful lives used in amortization of intangibles, income taxes and valuation\nallowances, stock-based compensation and fair values of assets and liabilities acquired in business combinations.\nRevenue recognition\nThe Company recognizes revenue using the following five steps: 1) identification of a contract with a customer; 2) identification of the\nperformance obligation(s) in the contract; 3) determination of the transaction price; 4) allocation of the transaction price to the performance\nobligation(s) in the contract; and 5) recognition of revenue when, or as, the performance obligation(s) are satisfied. The Company’s\nrevenues are derived primarily from two sources: sell-side advertising and buy-side advertising. Thus, the Company disaggregates the\nrevenue earned into these two segments. For additional segment disclosures, refer to Note 7 of our consolidated financial statements. The\nCompany maintains agreements with its customers in the form of written service agreements, which set out the terms of the relationship,\nincluding payment terms (typically 30 to 90 days) and access to its platform.\nFor the sell-side advertising segment, the Company generates revenue by selling advertising inventory (digital ad units) that the\nCompany purchases from publishers to advertisers through a process of monetizing ad impressions on the Company’s proprietary sell-side\nprogrammatic platform operating under the trademarked banner Colossus SSP. For the buy-side advertising segment, the Company\ngenerates revenue from customers that enter into agreements with the Company to provide managed advertising campaigns, which include\ndigital marketing and media services to purchase digital advertising space, data and other add-on features.\nIn connection with the Company’s analysis of principal vs agent considerations, the Company has evaluated the specified goods or\nservices and considered whether the Company controls the goods or services before they are provided to the customer, including the three\nindicators of control. Based upon this analysis and the Company’s specific facts and circumstances, the Company concluded that it is a\nprincipal for the goods or services sold through both the Company’s sell-side advertising segment and buy-side segment because the\nCompany controls the specified good or service before it is transferred to the customer and the Company is the primary obligor in the\nagreement with customers. Therefore, the Company reports revenue on a gross basis inclusive of all supplier costs and pays suppliers for\nthe cost of digital media, advertising inventory, data and any add-on services or features.\nSell-side advertising\nThe Company partners with publishers to sell advertising inventory to the Company’s Colossus Media-curated clients and the open\nmarkets (collectively referred to as “buyers”) seeking to access the general market as well as unique multi-cultural audiences. The\nCompany generates revenue from the delivery of targeted digital media solutions, enabling advertisers to connect intelligently with their\naudiences across online display, video, social and mobile mediums using its proprietary programmatic SSP. The Company refers to its\npublishers, app developers, and channel partners collectively as its “publishers”. The Company generates revenue through the monetization\nof publisher ad impressions on its platform. The Company’s platform allows the Company to sell, in real time, ad impressions from\npublishers to buyers and provides automated inventory management and monetization tools to publishers across various device types and\ndigital ad formats. The Company recognizes revenue at a point in time when an ad is delivered or displayed in response to a winning bid\nrequest from ad buyers.\nBuy-side advertising\nThe Company purchases media based on the budget established by its customers with a focus on leveraging data services, customer\nbranding, real-time market analysis and micro-location advertising. The Company offers its services on a fully managed basis, which is\nrecognized over time using the output method when the performance obligation is fulfilled. An “impression” is delivered when an\nadvertisement appears on pages viewed by users. The performance obligation is satisfied over time as the volume of impressions are\ndelivered up to the contractual maximum. Many customers run several different campaigns throughout the year to capitalize on different\nseasons, special events and other\n62\nTable of Contents\nhappenings at their respective regions and localities. The Company provides digital advertising and media buying capabilities with a focus\non generating measurable digital and financial life for its customers.\nRevenue arrangements are evidenced by a fully executed insertion order (“IO”) and/or a master service agreement (“MSA”) covering a\ncombination of marketing tactics. Generally, IOs specify the number and type of advertising impressions to be delivered over a specified\ntime at an agreed upon price and performance objectives for an ad campaign. Performance objectives are generally a measure of targeting,\nas defined by the parties in advance, such as number of ads displayed, consumer clicks on ads or consumer actions (which may include\nqualified leads, registrations, downloads, inquiries or purchases). These payment models are commonly referred to as CPM (cost per\nimpression), CPC (cost per click) and CPA (cost per action). The majority of the Company’s contracts are flat-rate, fee-based contracts.\nCash payments received prior to the Company’s delivery of its services are recorded to deferred revenue until the performance\nobligation is satisfied. The Company recorded deferred revenue (contract liabilities) to account for billings in excess of revenue recognized,\nprimarily related to contractual minimums billed in advance and customer prepayment, of $0.4 million and $0.5 million as of December 31,\n2023 and 2022, respectively. Revenue recognized during 2023 and 2022 from amounts included within the deferred revenue balances at the\nbeginning of each respective period amounted to $0.5 million and $1.3 million, respectively.\nASC 606 provides various optional practical expedients. The Company elected the use of the practical expedient relating to the\ndisclosure of remaining performance obligations within a contract and will not disclose remaining performance obligations for contracts\nwith an original expected duration of one year or less.\nGoodwill\nGoodwill is assessed for impairment at least annually (as of December 31) starting with a qualitative assessment to determine whether\nit is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit containing goodwill is less than its carrying value. This qualitative\nassessment may include, but is not limited to, reviewing factors such as macroeconomic conditions, industry and market considerations,\ncost factors, entity-specific financial performance and other events, such as changes in our management, strategy and primary user base. If\nthe Company determines that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value, then a\nquantitative goodwill impairment analysis is performed. Depending upon the results of the quantitative measurement, the recorded\ngoodwill may be written down and an impairment expense is recorded in the consolidated statements of operations when the carrying\namount of the reporting unit exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit. Goodwill is reviewed annually and tested for impairment upon the\noccurrence of a triggering event. The Company determined that there was no impairment of goodwill during the years ended December 31,\n2023 and 2022.\nIntangible assets, net\nIntangible assets consist of customer relationships, trademarks and non-compete agreements. Intangible assets are recorded at fair\nvalue at the time of their acquisition and are stated within the consolidated balance sheets net of accumulated amortization. Intangible\nassets are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives and recorded as amortization expense within general and\nadministrative expenses in the consolidated statements of operations. The Company’s intangible assets are being amortized over their\nestimated useful lives, using the straight-line method with non-compete agreements over 5 years and other intangibles over 10 years.\nImpairment of long-lived assets\nThe Company evaluates the recoverability of long-lived assets, including property, equipment and software costs and intangible assets\nif facts or circumstances indicate that any of those assets might be impaired. ASC 360-10-15 requires the Company to group assets and\nliabilities at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities and\nevaluate the asset group against the sum of the undiscounted future cash flows to determine if a write-down to fair value is necessary. No\nimpairment loss was recognized during the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022.\n63\nTable of Contents\nStock-based compensation\nStock-based compensation cost for options and restricted stock units (“RSU”) awarded to employees and directors is measured at the\ngrant date based on the calculated fair value of the award and is recognized as an expense over the requisite service period (generally the\nvesting period of the equity grant). Contingently issued awards with a requisite service period that precedes the grant date are measured and\nrecognized at the start of the requisite service period and remeasured each reporting period until the grant date.\nThe Company estimates the fair value of RSU’s based on the closing price of the Company’s common stock on the date of the grant.\nThe Company estimates the fair value of stock options using the Black-Scholes valuation model. Key input assumptions used to estimate\nthe fair value of stock options include the fair value of the Company’s common stock, as well as assumptions regarding the expected\ncommon stock price volatility over the term of the stock options, the expected term of the stock options, risk-free interest rates and the\nexpected dividend yield. Given the Company’s short history as a public company, the expected volatility is determined based on the trading\nhistory of several unrelated public companies within the industry that the Company considers to be comparable and the expected term is\ndetermined based on a combination of terms of the stock options and peer data. The risk-free interest rate is derived using the U.S. Treasury\nyield curve in effect at date of grant. Other assumptions are based on historical experience and activity. The Company considers an\nestimated forfeiture rate for stock options based on historical experience and the anticipated forfeiture rates during the future contract life.\nIncome taxes\nIn February 2022, concurrent with its organizational transactions, the Company entered into a tax receivable agreement (“Tax\nReceivable Agreement” or “TRA”) with DDH LLC and Direct Digital Management, LLC (“DDM”). The TRA provides for certain income\n(loss) allocations between the Company and DDH LLC under the agreement. DDH LLC is a limited liability company, is treated as a\npartnership for federal income tax purposes and generally is not subject to any entity-level U.S. federal income tax and certain state and\nlocal income taxes. Any taxable income or loss generated by the Company is allocated to holders of LLC units (“LLC Units”) in\naccordance with the Second Amended and Restated Limited Liability Company Agreement (“LLC Agreement”), and distributions to the\nowners of LLC Units in an amount sufficient to fund their tax obligations. The Company is subject to U.S. federal income taxes, in addition\nto state and local income taxes with respect to its allocable share of any taxable income or loss under the LLC Agreement. Pursuant to the\nCompany’s election under Section 754 of the Internal Revenue Code (the “Code”), the Company expects to obtain an increase in its share\nof the tax basis in the net assets of DDH, LLC when LLC Units are redeemed or exchanged by the members of DDH, LLC. The Company\nmade an election under Section 754 of the Code for each taxable year in which a redemption or exchange of LLC interest occurred.\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities\nand are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse. A valuation\nallowance is established when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The\nestablishment of a valuation allowance requires significant judgment and is impacted by various estimates. Both positive and negative\nevidence, as well as the objectivity and verifiability of that evidence, is considered in determining the appropriateness of recording a\nvaluation allowance on deferred tax assets.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nSee Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements for accounting pronouncements recently adopted and accounting pronouncements\nnot yet adopted.\nITEM 7A.

(the “Company”) as of December 31, 2023,\nthe related consolidated statements of operations, changes in stockholders’ (deficit) equity and cash flows for the year then ended, and the\nrelated notes (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements\npresent fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2023, and the results of its operations and\nits cash flows for the year then ended, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\nGoing Concern Uncertainty\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As\ndiscussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company has suffered significant disruption in its sell-side business and,\namong other things, has limited funds to meet certain upcoming obligations which, collectively, raise substantial doubt about its ability to\ncontinue as a going concern. Management’s plans in regard to these matters are also described in Note 2. The consolidated financial\nstatements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on\nthe Company’s consolidated financial statements based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company\nAccounting Oversight Board (United States) (\"PCAOB\") and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance\nwith the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to\nobtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or\nfraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As\npart of our audit we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing\nan opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.\nOur audit included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due\nto error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence\nregarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audit also included evaluating the accounting principles\nused and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements.\nWe believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\n/s/ BDO USA, P.C.\nWe have served as the Company’s auditor since 2024.\nNew York, New York\nOctober 15, 2024\n66\nTable of Contents\nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\nTo the Stockholders and Board of Directors of\nDirect Digital Holdings, Inc.\nOpinion on the Financial Statements\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of Direct Digital Holdings, Inc.

We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting\nOversight Board (United States) (\"PCAOB\") and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S.\nfederal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB and in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in\nthe United States of America. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the\nfinancial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we\nengaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audit we are required to obtain an understanding\nof internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's internal\ncontrol over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.\nOur audit included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or\nfraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the\namounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audit also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant\nestimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audit\nprovides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\n/s/ Marcum LLP\nMarcum LLP\nWe served as the Company’s auditor from 2021 to 2024.\nHouston, Texas\nApril 17, 2023, except for the effects of the revisions disclosed in Note 2 as to which the date is October 15, 2024\n67\nTable of Contents\nDIRECT DIGITAL HOLDINGS, INC.

Direct Digital Holdings, Inc. is the holding company for Direct Digital Holdings, LLC\n(“DDH LLC”), which is, in turn, the holding company for the business formed by DDH LLC’s founders in 2018 through the acquisition of\nColossus Media, LLC (“Colossus Media”) and Huddled Masses, LLC (“Huddled Masses®” or “Huddled Masses”). Colossus Media\noperates the Company’s proprietary sell-side programmatic platform operating under the trademarked banner of Colossus SSPTM\n(“Colossus SSP”). In late September 2020, DDH LLC acquired Orange142, LLC (“Orange 142”) to further bolster its overall\nprogrammatic buy-side advertising platform and to enhance its offerings across multiple industry verticals such as travel, healthcare,\neducation, financial services, consumer products, and other sectors with particular emphasis intended for small and mid-sized businesses\ntransitioning into digital with growing digital media budgets. In February 2022, Direct Digital Holdings, Inc. completed an initial public\noffering of its securities and, together with DDH LLC, effected a series of transactions (together, the “Organizational Transactions”)\nwhereby Direct Digital Holdings, Inc. became the sole managing member of DDH LLC, the holder of 100% of the voting interests of DDH\nLLC and the holder of 19.7% of the economic interests of DDH LLC, commonly referred to as an “Up-C” structure. (See Note 6 – Related\nParty Transactions). In these consolidated financial statements, the “Company,” “Direct Digital,” “Direct Digital Holdings,” “DDH,” “we,”\n“us” and “our” refer (i) following the completion of the Organizational Transactions, including the initial public offering, to Direct Digital\nHoldings, Inc., and, unless otherwise stated, all of its subsidiaries, including DDH LLC, and, unless otherwise stated, its subsidiaries, and\n(ii) on or prior to the completion of the Organizational Transactions, to DDH LLC and, unless otherwise stated, its subsidiaries. All of the\nsubsidiaries are incorporated in the state of Delaware, except for DDH LLC, which was formed under the laws of the State of Texas.\nThe subsidiaries of Direct Digital Holdings, Inc. are as follows:\nCurrent % Business\nSubsidiary Ownership Segment Date of Formation Date of Acquisition\nColossus Media, LLC 100.0% Sell-side September 8, 2017 June 21, 2018\nOrange142, LLC 100.0% Buy-side March 6, 2013 September 30, 2020\nHuddled Masses, LLC 100.0% Buy-side November 13, 2012 June 21, 2018\nDirect Digital Holdings, LLC (1) N/A June 21, 2018 February 15, 2022\n(1) DDH owns 100% of the voting interest in Direct Digital Holding, LLC. As of December 31, 2023, DDH owns 24.2% of the\neconomic interest in Direct Digital Holdings, LLC. See further discussion of the Up-C structure in Note 6 of our consolidated financial\nstatements.\nColossus SSP is a stand-alone platform intended to deliver targeted advertising to diverse and multicultural audiences as well as to\ngeneral audiences. Both buy-side subsidiaries, Orange 142 and Huddled Masses, offer technology-enabled advertising solutions and\nconsulting services to clients through demand side platforms (“DSPs”).\nProviding both the front-end, buy-side operations coupled with the Company’s proprietary sell-side operations enables the Company to\ncurate the first through the last mile in the ad tech ecosystem execution process to drive higher results.\n72\nTable of Contents\nNote 2 — Basis of Presentation and Consolidation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\nBasis of presentation and consolidation\nThe Company’s consolidated financial statements are presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the\nUnited States of America (“U.S. GAAP”) and reflect the financial position, results of operations and cash flows for all periods presented.\nThe consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Direct Digital Holdings, Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiaries. All material\nintercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.\nThe Company is an emerging growth company, as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (the “JOBS Act”).\nUnder the JOBS Act, emerging growth companies can delay adopting new or revised accounting standards otherwise applicable to public\ncompanies until such time as those standards apply to private companies. The Company has elected to use this extended transition period\nfor complying with new or revised accounting standards that have different effective dates for public and private companies until the earlier\nof the date that it (i) is no longer an emerging growth company or (ii) it affirmatively and irrevocably opts out of the extended transition\nperiod provided in the JOBS Act. As a result, these consolidated financial statements may not be comparable to companies that comply\nwith the new or revised accounting pronouncements as of public company effective dates. The adoption dates discussed below reflect this\nelection.\nRevenue recognition\nThe Company recognizes revenue using the following five steps: 1) identification of a contract with a customer; 2) identification of the\nperformance obligation(s) in the contract; 3) determination of the transaction price; 4) allocation of the transaction price to the performance\nobligation(s) in the contract; and 5) recognition of revenue when, or as, the performance obligation(s) are satisfied. The Company’s\nrevenues are derived primarily from two sources: sell-side advertising and buy-side advertising. Thus, the Company disaggregates the\nrevenue earned into these two segments. For additional segment disclosures, refer to Note 7 of our consolidated financial statements. The\nCompany maintains agreements with its customers in the form of written service agreements, which set out the terms of the relationship,\nincluding payment terms (typically 30 to 90 days) and access to its platform.\nFor the sell-side advertising segment, the Company generates revenue by selling advertising inventory (digital ad units) that the\nCompany purchases from publishers to advertisers through a process of monetizing ad impressions on the Company’s proprietary sell-side\nprogrammatic platform operating under the trademarked banner Colossus SSP. For the buy-side advertising segment, the Company\ngenerates revenue from customers that enter into agreements with the Company to provide managed advertising campaigns, which include\ndigital marketing and media services to purchase digital advertising space, data and other add-on features.\nIn connection with the Company’s analysis of principal vs agent considerations, the Company has evaluated the specified goods or\nservices and considered whether the Company controls the goods or services before they are provided to the customer, including the three\nindicators of control. Based upon this analysis and the Company’s specific facts and circumstances, the Company concluded that it is a\nprincipal for the goods or services sold through both the Company’s sell-side advertising segment and buy-side advertising segment\nbecause the Company controls the specified good or service before it is transferred to the customer and the Company is the primary obligor\nin the agreement with customers. Therefore, the Company reports revenue on a gross basis inclusive of all supplier costs and pays suppliers\nfor the cost of digital media, advertising inventory, data and any add-on services or features.\nSell-side advertising\nThe Company partners with publishers to sell advertising inventory to the Company’s Colossus Media-curated clients and the open\nmarkets (collectively referred to as “buyers”) seeking to access the general market as well as unique multi-cultural audiences. The\nCompany generates revenue from the delivery of targeted digital media solutions, enabling advertisers to connect intelligently with their\naudiences across online display, video, social and mobile mediums using its proprietary programmatic sell-side platform (“SSP”). The\nCompany refers to its publishers, app developers, and channel partners collectively as its “publishers.” The Company generates revenue\nthrough the monetization of publisher ad\n73\nTable of Contents\nimpressions on its platform. The Company’s platform allows the Company to sell, in real time, ad impressions from publishers to buyers\nand provides automated inventory management and monetization tools to publishers across various device types and digital ad formats. The\nCompany recognizes revenue at a point in time when an ad is delivered or displayed in response to a winning bid request from ad buyers.\nBuy-side advertising\nThe Company purchases media based on the budget established by its customers with a focus on leveraging data services, customer\nbranding, real-time market analysis and micro-location advertising. The Company offers its services on a fully managed basis, which is\nrecognized over time using the output method when the performance obligation is fulfilled. An “impression” is delivered when an\nadvertisement appears on pages viewed by users. The performance obligation is satisfied over time as the volume of impressions are\ndelivered up to the contractual maximum. Many customers run several different campaigns throughout the year to capitalize on different\nseasons, special events and other happenings at their respective regions and localities. The Company provides digital advertising and media\nbuying capabilities with a focus on generating measurable digital and financial life for its customers.\nRevenue arrangements are evidenced by a fully executed insertion order (“IO”) and/or a master service agreement (“MSA”) covering a\ncombination of marketing tactics. Generally, IOs specify the number and type of advertising impressions to be delivered over a specified\ntime at an agreed upon price and performance objectives for an ad campaign. Performance objectives are generally a measure of targeting,\nas defined by the parties in advance, such as number of ads displayed, consumer clicks on ads or consumer actions (which may include\nqualified leads, registrations, downloads, inquiries or purchases). These payment models are commonly referred to as CPM (cost per\nimpression), CPC (cost per click) and CPA (cost per action). The majority of the Company’s contracts are flat-rate, fee-based contracts.\nCash payments received prior to the Company’s delivery of its services are recorded to deferred revenue until the performance\nobligation is satisfied. The Company recorded deferred revenue (contract liabilities) to account for billings in excess of revenue recognized,\nprimarily related to contractual minimums billed in advance and customer prepayment, of $0.4 million and $0.5 million as of December 31,\n2023 and 2022, respectively. Revenue recognized during 2023 and 2022 from amounts included within the deferred revenue balances at the\nbeginning of each respective period amounted to $0.5 million and $1.3 million, respectively.\nAccounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 606 provides various optional practical expedients. The Company elected the use of the\npractical expedient relating to the disclosure of remaining performance obligations within a contract and will not disclose remaining\nperformance obligations for contracts with an original expected duration of one year or less.\nGoodwill\nAs of December 31, 2023 and 2022, goodwill was $6.5 million, which includes $2.4 million as a result of the acquisition of Huddled\nMasses and Colossus Media in 2018 and $4.1 million from the acquisition of Orange 142 in 2020. The Company expects to deduct\ngoodwill for tax purposes in future years. Goodwill is attributable to entry into new markets not previously accessible and generation of\nfuture growth opportunities. Goodwill is assessed for impairment at least annually (December 31) starting with a qualitative assessment to\ndetermine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit containing goodwill is less than its carrying value. This\nqualitative assessment may include, but is not limited to, reviewing factors such as macroeconomic conditions, industry and market\nconsiderations, cost factors, entity-specific financial performance and other events, such as changes in our management, strategy and\nprimary user base. If the Company determines that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying\nvalue, then a quantitative goodwill impairment analysis is performed. Depending upon the results of the quantitative measurement, the\nrecorded goodwill may be written down and an impairment expense is recorded in the consolidated statements of operations when the\ncarrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit. Goodwill is reviewed annually and tested for impairment\nupon the occurrence of a triggering event. The Company determined that there was no impairment of goodwill during the years ended\nDecember 31, 2023 and 2022.\n74\nTable of Contents\nIntangible assets, net\nIntangible assets consist of customer relationships, trademarks and non-compete agreements. Intangible assets are recorded at fair\nvalue at the time of their acquisition and are stated within the consolidated balance sheets net of accumulated amortization. Intangible\nassets are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives and recorded as amortization expense within general and\nadministrative expenses in the consolidated statements of operations. The Company’s intangible assets are being amortized over their\nestimated useful lives, using the straight-line method with non-compete agreements over 5 years and other intangibles over 10 years.\nImpairment of long-lived assets\nThe Company evaluates the recoverability of long-lived assets, including property, equipment and software costs and intangible assets\nif facts or circumstances indicate that any of those assets might be impaired. ASC 360-10-15 requires the Company to group assets and\nliabilities at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities and\nevaluate the asset group against the sum of the undiscounted future cash flows to determine if a write-down to fair value is necessary. No\nimpairment loss was recognized during the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022.\nStock-based compensation\nStock-based compensation cost for options and restricted stock units (“RSU”) awarded to employees and directors is measured at the\ngrant date based on the calculated fair value of the award and is recognized as an expense over the requisite service period (generally the\nvesting period of the equity grant). Contingently issued awards with a requisite service period that precedes the grant date are measured and\nrecognized at the start of the requisite service period and remeasured each reporting period until the grant date.\nThe Company estimates the fair value of RSU’s based on the closing price of the Company’s common stock on the date of the grant.\nThe Company estimates the fair value of stock options using the Black-Scholes valuation model. Key input assumptions used to estimate\nthe fair value of stock options include the fair value of the Company’s common stock, as well as assumptions regarding the expected\ncommon stock price volatility over the term of the stock options, the expected term of the stock options, risk-free interest rates and the\nexpected dividend yield. Given the Company’s short history as a public company, the expected volatility is determined based on the trading\nhistory of several unrelated public companies within the industry that the Company considers to be comparable and the expected term is\ndetermined based on a combination of terms of the stock options and peer data. The risk-free interest rate is derived using the U.S. Treasury\nyield curve in effect at date of grant. Other assumptions are based on historical experience and activity. The Company considers an\nestimated forfeiture rate for stock options based on historical experience and the anticipated forfeiture rates during the future contract life.\nThe fair value of the Company’s stock options was estimated on the grant date using the Black-Scholes option pricing model with the\nfollowing weighted-average input assumptions used by the Company were as follows:\nYear Ended December 31,\n2023 2022\nGrant date fair value $ 2.44 $ 1.01\nExpected term 6.0 6.0\nExpected volatility 69% 63%\nRisk-free interest rate 3.70% 3.25%\nExercise price $ 3.78 $ 1.68\nDividend yield — —\nEmployee benefit plans\nThe Company sponsors a safe harbor, defined contribution 401(k) and profit-sharing plan (the “Plan”) that allows eligible employees\nto contribute a percentage of their compensation. The Company matches employee contributions up to\n75\nTable of Contents\na maximum of 100% of the participant’s salary deferral, limited to 4% of the employee’s salary. For the years ended December 31, 2023\nand 2022, the Company’s matching contributions were $0.2 million and $0.2 million, respectively. Although the Company may make a\ndiscretionary profit-sharing contribution to the Plan, during the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, no profit-sharing contributions\nwere made.\nThe Company has an Employee Benefit Plan Trust (the “Trust”) to provide for the payment or reimbursement of all or a portion of\ncovered medical, dental and prescription expenses for the employees of the Company. The Trust is funded with contributions made by the\nCompany and participating employees at amounts sufficient to keep the Trust on an actuarially sound basis. The self-funded plan has an\nintegrated stop loss insurance policy for the funding of the Trust benefits in excess of the full funding requirements. As of December 31,\n2023 and 2022, the Company recorded an estimated liability for incurred but not recognized claims in accrued liabilities in an amount\nwhich was less than $0.1 million.\nThe Company also has an incentive plan for executives and employees of the Company which provides for performance based awards\npayable in cash or stock-based compensation as determined by the Compensation Committee of the Company’s Board of Directors. There\nwas $2.4 million and $2.3 million recognized during the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, for awards pursuant to this\nplan. $1.4 million of the 2023 awards was recorded as stock-based compensation in compensation, taxes and benefits with the remainder of\n2023 and all of 2022 recorded as compensation expense in compensation, taxes and benefits and payable in cash subsequent to the\napplicable year end.\nIncome taxes\nIn February 2022, concurrent with the Organizational Transactions, the Company entered into a tax receivable agreement (“Tax\nReceivable Agreement” or “TRA”) with DDH LLC and Direct Digital Management, LLC (“DDM”). The TRA provides for certain income\n(loss) allocations between the Company and DDH LLC under the agreement. DDH LLC is a limited liability company, is treated as a\npartnership for federal income tax purposes and generally is not subject to any entity-level U.S. federal income tax and certain state and\nlocal income taxes. Any taxable income or loss generated by the Company is allocated to holders of LLC units (“LLC Units”) in\naccordance with the Second Amended and Restated Limited Liability Company Agreement (“LLC Agreement”), and distributions to the\nowners of LLC Units in an amount sufficient to fund their tax obligations. The Company is subject to U.S. federal income taxes, in addition\nto state and local income taxes with respect to its allocable share of any taxable income or loss under the LLC Agreement. Pursuant to the\nCompany’s election under Section 754 of the Internal Revenue Code (the “Code”), the Company expects to obtain an increase in its share\nof the tax basis in the net assets of DDH, LLC when LLC Units are redeemed or exchanged by the members of DDH, LLC. The Company\nmade an election under Section 754 of the Code for each taxable year in which a redemption or exchange of LLC interest occurred. During\nthe years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, members of DDM exchanged 410,000 and 100,000 shares of Class B Common Stock into\nshares of Class A Common Stock, respectively.\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities\nand are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse. A valuation\nallowance is established when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The\nestablishment of a valuation allowance requires significant judgment and is impacted by various estimates. Both positive and negative\nevidence, as well as the objectivity and verifiability of that evidence, is considered in determining the appropriateness of recording a\nvaluation allowance on deferred tax assets. As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the Company recorded a valuation allowance of $0.5\nmillion and $0, respectively.\nAccounts receivable, net\nAccounts receivable primarily consists of billed amounts for products and services rendered to customers under normal trade terms.\nThe Company performs credit evaluations of its customers’ financial condition and generally does not require collateral. Accounts\nreceivable are stated at net realizable value. The Company insures a significant portion of its accounts receivable with unrelated third-party\ninsurance companies in an effort to mitigate any future write-offs and establishes provision for credit losses as deemed necessary for\naccounts not covered by this insurance. Management periodically reviews outstanding accounts receivable for reasonableness. If warranted,\nthe Company processes a claim\n76\nTable of Contents\nwith the third-party insurance company to recover uncollected balances, rather than writing the balances off to bad debt expense. The\nguaranteed recovery for the claim is approximately 90% of the original balance, and if the full amount is collected by the insurance\ncompany, the remaining 10% is remitted to the Company. If the insurance company is unable to collect the full amount, the Company\nrecords the remaining 10% to bad debt expense. The Company’s provision for credit losses reflects the current expected credit loss inherent\nin the accounts receivable considering the Company’s aging analysis, historical collection experience, customer creditworthiness, current\nand future economic conditions and market conditions. Accounts receivable balances are written off against the provision when the\nCompany believes it is probable the receivable will not be recovered. Bad debt expense was approximately $0.4 million and less than $0.1\nmillion for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nThe following table presents the changes in the provision for credit losses (in thousands):\nDecember 31,\n2023 2022\nBeginning balance $ 4 $ 41\nProvision for credit losses 369 10\nWrite-offs, net of recoveries (29) (47)\nEnding balance $ 344 $ 4\nConcentrations of customers and suppliers\nThere is an inherent concentration of credit risk associated with accounts receivable arising from revenue from major customers on\nboth the sell-side and buy-side of the business. For the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, one customer of the sell-side of the\nbusiness represented 73% and 63% of revenues, respectively. As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, one customer of the sell-side of the\nbusiness accounted for 83% and 80%, respectively, of accounts receivable.\nAs of December 31, 2023 and 2022, three sellers of advertising inventory each accounted for at least 10%, and collectively accounted\nfor 57% and 63%, respectively, of consolidated accounts payable.\nAccrued Liabilities\nThe components of accrued liabilities on the balance sheet as of December 31, 2023 and 2022 are as follows (in thousands):\nDecember 31,\n2023 2022\nAccrued compensation and benefits $ 2,789 $ 3,129\nAccrued expenses 631 207\nAccrued severance 189 —\nAccrued litigation settlement (1) 171 429\nAccrued interest 36 13\nTotal accrued liabilities $ 3,816 $ 3,778\n(1) In July 2022, the Company entered into a litigation settlement agreement with a vendor of Huddled Masses related to a delinquent\nbalance from 2019 and agreed to pay a total of $0.5 million with monthly installment payments over 24 months beginning\nSeptember 1, 2022.\nSegment information\nOperating segments are components of an enterprise for which separate financial information is available and evaluated regularly by\nthe Company’s chief operating decision maker (“CODM”) for purpose of allocating resources and assessing performance. The Company’s\nCODM is its Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. The Company operates two reportable segments: sell-side advertising, which includes\nthe results of Colossus Media, and buy-side advertising, which includes the results of Orange 142 and Huddled Masses. All of the\nCompany’s revenues are attributed to the United States.\n77\nTable of Contents\nCost of revenues\nSell-side advertising\nThe Company pays publishers a fee, which is typically a percentage of the value of the ad impressions monetized through the\nCompany’s platform. Cost of revenues consists primarily of publisher media fees and data center co-location costs. Media fees include the\npublishing and real-time bidding costs to secure advertising space.\nBuy-side advertising\nCost of revenues consists primarily of digital media fees, third-party platform access fees, and other third-party fees associated with\nproviding services to the Company’s customers.\nOperating expenses\nOperating expenses consist of compensation expenses related to our executive, sales, finance and administrative personnel (including\nsalaries, commissions, stock-based compensation, bonuses, benefits and taxes); general and administrative expenses (including rent\nexpense, professional fees, independent contractor costs, selling and marketing fees, administrative and operating system subscription\ncosts, insurance, and amortization expense related to our intangible assets); and other expense (including transactions that are unusual in\nnature or which are occurring infrequently). See further discussion of Other Expenses within Operating Expenses for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2023 in Note 9 of the consolidated financial statements.\nAdvertising costs\nThe Company expenses advertising costs as incurred. Advertising expense incurred during the years ended December 31, 2023 and\n2022 was $2.2 million and $0.9 million, respectively. These costs are included in general and administrative expenses in the consolidated\nstatements of operations.\nCash and cash equivalents\nCash and cash equivalents consist of funds deposited with financial institutions and highly liquid instruments with original maturities\nof three months or less. Such deposits may, at times, exceed federally insured limits. The risk of loss attributable to any uninsured balances\nis mitigated by depositing funds only in high credit quality financial institutions. The Company has not experienced any losses in such\namounts and believes it is not exposed to any significant credit risk to cash.\nProperty, equipment and software, net\nProperty and equipment are recognized in the consolidated balance sheets at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization. The\nCompany capitalizes purchases and depreciates its property and equipment using the straight-line method of depreciation over the\nestimated useful lives of the respective assets, generally ranging from three to five years. Leasehold improvements are amortized over the\nshorter of their useful lives or the remaining terms of the related leases. The Company capitalizes costs related to the development of\ninternal-use software. Costs incurred during the application development phase are capitalized and amortized using the straight-line method\nover the estimated useful life, estimated at three years.\nThe cost of repairs and maintenance are expensed as incurred. Major renewals or improvements that extend the useful lives of the\nassets are capitalized. When assets are retired or disposed of, the cost and accumulated depreciation thereon are removed, and any resulting\ngain or loss is recognized in the consolidated statements of operations.\n78\nTable of Contents\nLeases\nThe Company has operating leases for real estate. Operating leases are included in Operating Lease Right of Use (\"ROU\") Assets and\nOperating Lease Liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets. Operating lease asset and liability amounts are measured and recognized\nbased on discounted future cash flow payment amounts the Company expects to make over the expected term of the underlying leases,\nincluding renewal periods the Company is reasonably certain to exercise. The lease liability for leases expected to be settled in twelve-\nmonths or less are classified as current liabilities. The general terms of the Company’s lease agreements require monthly payments.\nBecause the Company does not generally have access to the rate implicit in its leases, the Company utilizes its incremental borrowing rate\nas the discount rate for measuring the lease liability. At commencement, the operating lease ROU asset and lease liability are the same, with\nadjustments to the ROU asset for lease incentives and initial direct costs incurred. The Company reviews all options to extend, terminate or\npurchase its ROU assets at the commencement of the lease and on an ongoing basis and accounts for these options when they are\nreasonably certain of being exercised. The Company evaluates lease modifications as they occur and records such as a separate lease or an\nadjustment to the existing ROU asset and lease liability as appropriate. Operating lease expense is recorded on a straight-line basis over the\nlease term with amortization of the ROU asset calculated as the difference between the straight-line operating lease expense and the\nimplied interest expense on the lease liability. On the statement of cash flows, operating lease expense is included in operating cash flows.\nDeferred offering costs\nThe Company records certain legal, accounting and other third-party fees that are directly associated with an offering to stockholders’\nequity or debt in the event that the Company completes an offering. Costs associated with debt offerings are amortized to interest expense\nusing the straight-line method over the life of the debt. As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, $1.7 million and $2.1 million, respectively, of\nunamortized deferred financing costs are netted against debt in the consolidated balance sheets.\nBusiness combinations\nThe Company includes the results of operations of the businesses that are acquired as of the respective dates of acquisition. The\nCompany allocates the fair value of the purchase price of acquisitions to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated\nfair values. The Company estimates and records the fair value of purchased intangible assets, which primarily consists of customer\nrelationships, trademarks, and non-compete agreements. The excess of the fair value of the purchase price over the fair values of these\nidentifiable assets, both tangible and intangible, and liabilities is recorded as goodwill.\nUse of estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that\naffect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities and disclosure of contingent liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the\nreported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from these estimates. The Company\nbases its estimates on past experiences, market conditions, and other assumptions that the Company believes are reasonable under the\ncircumstances, and the Company evaluates these estimates on an ongoing basis. The Company uses estimates to determine many reported\namounts, including but not limited to gross vs net assessment in revenue recognition, recoverability of goodwill and long-lived assets,\nuseful lives used in amortization of intangibles, income taxes and valuation allowances, stock-based compensation and fair values of assets\nand liabilities acquired in business combinations.\nFair value measurements\nThe Company employs a hierarchy which prioritizes the inputs used to measure recurring fair value into three distinct categories based\non the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. The methodology for\n79\nTable of Contents\ncategorizing assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value pursuant to this hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted\nprices in active markets and the lowest levels to unobservable inputs, summarized as follows:\n● Level 1 – Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.\n● Level 2 – Other significant observable inputs (including quoted prices in active markets for similar assets or liabilities).\n● Level 3 – Significant unobservable inputs (including our own assumptions in determining fair value).\nWe use the cost, income or market valuation approaches to estimate the fair value of our assets and liabilities when insufficient market-\nobservable data is available to support our valuation assumptions.\nFair value of financial instruments\nThe Company considers the fair value of all financial instruments, including cash, accounts receivable and accounts payable to\napproximate their carrying values at year-end due to their short-term nature. The carrying value of the Company’s debt approximates fair\nvalue due to the market rates of interest.\nNet income (loss) per share\nBasic net income (loss) per share excludes dilution and is determined by dividing net income (loss) by the weighted average number of\ncommon shares outstanding including participating securities during the period. Diluted net income (loss) per share reflects the potential\ndilution that could occur if securities and other contracts to issue common stock were exercised or converted into common stock.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nAccounting pronouncements adopted in 2023\nIn June 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the “FASB”) issued ASU No. 2016-13, Financial Instruments — Credit\nLosses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments (“ASU 2016-13”), which requires entities to estimate all\nexpected credit losses for certain types of financial instruments, including trade receivables, held at the reporting date based on historical\nexperience, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts. The updated guidance also expands the disclosure requirements to\nenable users of financial statements to understand the entity’s assumptions, models and methods for estimating expected credit losses over\nthe entire contractual term of the instrument from the date of initial recognition of that instrument. ASU 2016-13, as subsequently amended\nfor various technical issues, is effective for emerging growth companies following private company adoption dates for fiscal years, and for\ninterim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2022, with early adoption permitted. The Company adopted this\nASU effective January 1, 2023. The adoption of this ASU did not have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial\nstatements.\nAccounting pronouncements not yet adopted\nIn December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09, Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures, a final standard on improvements to\nincome tax disclosures. The standard requires disaggregated information about a reporting entity's effective tax rate reconciliation as well\nas information on income taxes paid. The standard is intended to benefit investors by providing more detailed income tax disclosures that\nwould be useful in making capital allocation decisions and applies to all entities subject to income taxes. The new standard is effective for\nemerging growth companies for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2025. This accounting standard is effective in the first quarter\nof the Company's fiscal year ending December 31, 2026. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adoption on our financial\ndisclosures.\nIn November 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic 280)-Improvements to Reportable Segment\nDisclosures. The ASU requires that an entity disclose significant segment expenses impacting profit and loss that are regularly provided to\nthe CODM. The update is required to be applied retrospectively to prior periods presented, based on the significant segment expense\ncategories identified and disclosed in the period of adoption. The amendments in this\n80\nTable of Contents\nASU are required to be adopted for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after\nDecember 15, 2024. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adoption on our financial disclosures.\nOther accounting standards that have been issued or proposed by the FASB or other standards-setting bodies that do not require\nadoption until a future date are not expected to have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.\nLiquidity and capital resources\nGoing Concern\nThe Company evaluated whether relevant conditions or events, considered in the aggregate, raise substantial doubt about the\nCompany’s ability to continue as a going concern. Substantial doubt exists when conditions and events, considered in the aggregate,\nindicate it is probable that a company will not be able to meet its obligations as they become due within one year after the issuance date of\nits financial statements. Management’s assessment is based on the relevant conditions that are known or reasonably knowable as of the date\nthese consolidated financial statements were issued or were available to be issued.\nAs discussed in Note 9, one of the Company’s sell-side customers paused its connection to the Company for a couple of weeks in May\n2024, which reduced sell-side sales volumes. As of the date of this report, sell-side volumes related to this customer have resumed but not\nyet at the levels experienced prior to the pause in May 2024 which has created significant disruption in the Company’s sell-side business.\nThe Company is actively working with its partners to achieve prior volume levels. However, there can be no assurance that the Company\nwill be able to achieve prior volume levels with its partners or on the timing of achieving such volume levels. Additionally, the Company\n(1) incurred a net loss of $6.8 million in 2023 primarily related to payments made to a few publishers of $8.8 million associated with a\ndisputed short payment from a customer, (2) reported an accumulated deficit of $2.5 million as of December 31, 2023, (3) reported cash\nand cash equivalents of $5.1 million as of December 31, 2023, (4) has borrowed $3.0 million and $9.7 million as of December 31, 2023\nand the date of this report, respectively, under the Credit Agreement which matures in July 2025, (5) was notified on April 17, 2024 that the\nCompany’s auditor had resigned and (6) was unable to timely file its 2023 annual report and quarterly reports for the first two quarters of\n2024. The delay in filing the Company’s annual and quarterly reports disrupted existing capital-raising efforts and created additional audit,\nlegal and other expenses. These factors raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern over the next\ntwelve months.\nThe Company anticipates sources of liquidity to include cash on hand and cash flow from operations and has taken several actions to\naddress liquidity concerns. These actions include (1) a plan to reduce expenses through a staff reduction, a pause on hiring and cost savings\nmeasures that were executed on July 1, 2024, (2) working with lenders to provide temporary relief from debt covenants (see Note 3 –\nLong-Term Debt) while rebuilding sell-side volumes, (3) raising capital through arrangements with various providers, and (4) regaining\ncompliance with respect to delinquent SEC filings which will allow the Company to access the capital markets as well as other financing\nsources. There can be no assurance that the Company’s actions will be successful or that additional financing will be available when needed\nor on acceptable terms.\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming the Company will continue to operate as a going\nconcern, which contemplates the realization of assets and settlement of liabilities in the normal course of business, and do not include any\nadjustments to reflect the possible future effects on the recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts and classifications of\nliabilities that may result from uncertainty related to its ability to continue as a going concern.\nCorrection of Immaterial Errors in Prior Consolidated Financial Statements\nFor the quarter ended September 30, 2023, the Company identified a prior period accounting error in the Company’s previously\nreported unaudited interim consolidated financial statements beginning June 30, 2022 resulting from the incorrect accounting for granted\nbut unvested restricted stock units. For the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company\n81\nTable of Contents\nidentified prior year accounting errors in the Company’s previously reported unaudited interim consolidated financial statements beginning\nMarch 31, 2022 resulting from the incorrect (1) accounting for and presentation of noncontrolling interests (NCI), (2) recognition of an\norganizational transaction, and (3) presentation of earnings per share considering the effect of certain features of the Company’s warrants\nand the impact of correcting the accounting for, and presentation of, NCI. Based on management’s evaluation of the errors in consideration\nof the SEC Staff’s Accounting Bulletins Topic 1.M, Materiality and Topic 1.N, Considering the Effects of Misstatements when Quantifying\nMisstatements in the Current Year Financial Statements and interpretations therewith, the Company concluded these errors are not material\nto the Company’s previously reported financial statements included in the 2022 Form 10-K filed on April 17, 2023.\nThe following tables reflect the impact of the correction of these immaterial errors (in thousands):\nConsolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2022 As Reported As Revised\nAccrued liabilities $ 4,778 $ 3,778\nTotal current liabilities $ 25,572 $ 24,572\nTotal liabilities $ 53,531 $ 52,531\nClass A Common Stock Units 3,253 2,900\nClass A Common Stock Amount $ 3 $ 3\nAdditional paid-in capital $ 8,224 $ 2,611\nAccumulated deficit $ (3,643) $ (344)\nTotal stockholders’ equity attributable to Direct Digital Holdings, Inc. $ 4,595 $ 2,281\nNoncontrolling interest $ — $ 3,314\nTotal stockholders’ equity $ 4,595 $ 5,595\nConsolidated Statement of Operations for the Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2022 As Reported As Revised\nNet income attributable to non-controlling interests $ — $ 3,962\nNet income attributable to Direct Digital Holdings, Inc. $ 4,167 $ 205\nBasic net income per share $ 0.33 $ 0.11\nDiluted net income per share $ 0.33 $ 0.11\nWeighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding - basic 12,638 2,848\nWeighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding - dilutive 12,638 2,891\nConsolidated Statement of Changes in Stockholders' Equity as of December 31, 2022 As Reported As Revised\nClass A Common Stock Units 3,253 2,900\nClass A Common Stock Amount $ 3 $ 3\nAdditional Paid-in Capital $ 8,224 $ 2,611\nAccumulated Deficit $ (3,643) $ (344)\nNoncontrolling Interest $ — $ 3,314\nTotal Stockholders’ Equity $ 4,595 $ 5,595\nConsolidated Statement of Changes in Stockholders' Equity for the Twelve Months Ended\nDecember 31, 2022\nDistributions to members (Accumulated Deficit) $ (3,141) $ —\nDistributions to holders of LLC Units (NCI) $ — $ (3,141)\nIssuance of restricted stock units 378 —\nRestricted stock forfeitures units (25) —\nNet loss prior to Organizational Transactions $ — $ (464)\nNet income (Accumulated Deficit) $ 4,167 $ 669\nNet income (NCI) $ — $ 3,962\n82\nTable of Contents\nNote 3 — Long-Term Debt\nAt December 31, 2023 and 2022, long-term debt consisted of the following (in thousands):\nDecember 31,\n2023 2022\n2021 Credit Facility $ 28,594 $ 25,684\nCredit Agreement 3,000 —\nEconomic Injury Disaster Loan 150 150\nTotal long-term debt 31,744 25,834\nLess: deferred financing costs (1,688) (2,115)\nTotal long-term debt, net of deferred financing costs 30,056 23,719\nLess: current portion (1,478) (655)\nTotal long-term debt, net of current portion $ 28,578 $ 23,064\nLafayette Square\nOn December 3, 2021, the Company entered into the Term Loan and Security Agreement (the “2021 Credit Facility”) with Lafayette\nSquare Loan Services, LLC (“Lafayette Square”) as administrative agent, and the various lenders thereto. The term loan under the 2021\nCredit Facility initially provided for a term loan in the principal amount of up to $32.0 million, consisting of a $22.0 million closing date\nterm loan (the “Term Loan”) and an up to $10.0 million delayed draw term loan (the “Delayed Draw Loan”). The loans under the 2021\nCredit Facility originally bore interest at LIBOR plus the applicable margin minus any applicable impact discount. The applicable margin\nunder the 2021 Credit Facility was determined based on the consolidated total net leverage ratio of the Company and its consolidated\nsubsidiaries, at a rate of 6.50% per annum if the consolidated total net leverage ratio is less than 2.00 to 1.00 and up to 9.00% per annum if\nthe consolidated total net leverage ratio was greater than 4.00 to 1.00. On June 1, 2023, as originally contemplated under the 2021 Credit\nFacility, the Company entered into an agreement with Lafayette Square to convert the existing LIBOR based rate to a Term Secured\nOvernight Financing Rate (“SOFR”) with a credit spread of 0.15% per annum for the interest periods of three months and providing for a\ncredit spread adjustment of 0.10%, 0.15% or 0.25% per annum for interest periods of one month, three months or six months, respectively.\nThe loans under the 2021 Credit Facility bear interest at SOFR plus the applicable credit spread adjustment plus the applicable margin\nminus any applicable impact discount. Prior to entering into the Fifth Amendment (as defined below), the applicable margin under the 2021\nCredit Facility was based on the consolidated total net leverage ratio of the Company at a rate of 7.00% per annum if the consolidated total\nnet leverage ratio was less than or equal to 1.00 to 1.00 with gradual increases as the ratio increased up to 10.00% per annum if the\nconsolidated total net leverage ratio was greater than 3.50 to 1.00. The maturity date of the 2021 Credit Facility is December 3, 2026.\nOn July 28, 2022, the Company entered into the Second Amendment and Joinder to Term Loan and Security Agreement and received\nproceeds of $4.3 million borrowed under the Delayed Draw Loan to pay the balance owed on the common unit redemption as well as costs\nassociated with the transaction.\nSubsequently, on October 3, 2023, the Company entered into the Fourth Amendment to the 2021 Credit Facility (the “Fourth\nAmendment”) and received proceeds of $3.6 million borrowed under the Delayed Draw Loan to make payments in connection with the\nconsummation of the 2023 warrant tender offer and fees and expenses incurred as described in Note 4 – Stockholders’ Equity and Stock-\nBased Compensation in the notes to the consolidated financial statements. In connection with the Fourth Amendment, the Company agreed\nit would not be permitted to request any additional funds under the Delayed Draw Loan, and Lafayette Square would not be obligated to\nfund any such requests.\nQuarterly installment payments on the Term Loan and the Delayed Draw Loan, due on the last day of each fiscal quarter, began March\n31, 2022 with a final installment due December 3, 2026 for remaining balances outstanding under each loan. Each quarterly installment\npayment under the closing date term loan was $137,000 from January 1, 2022 through December 31, 2023, and each installment payment\nthereafter until maturity is $275,000. Each quarterly installment payment under the Delayed Draw Loan was 0.625% of the amount of the\nDelayed Draw Loan through December 31, 2023, and each installment payment thereafter until maturity is 1.25% of the amount of the\nDelayed Draw Loan.\n83\nTable of Contents\nUnder the 2021 Credit Facility, dividends and distributions by DDH LLC to the Company and any shareholders of the Company are\npermitted so long as (i) no default or event of default is continuing or would occur after giving pro forma effect to such dividends and\ndistributions under the 2021 Credit Facility, (ii) the Company, on a pro forma basis, maintains a consolidated senior net leverage ratio of\nnot greater than 1.5 to 1.0, and (iii) the Company, on a pro forma basis, maintains liquidity of not less than $15,000,000.\nThe obligations under the 2021 Credit Facility are secured by senior, first-priority liens on all or substantially all assets of the\nCompany. As of December 31, 2023, the Company owed a balance on the 2021 Credit Facility of $28.6 million. Additional deferred\nfinancing costs of less than $0.1 million and $0.5 million were incurred during the year ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nUnamortized deferred financing costs as of December 31, 2023 and 2022 were $1.7 million and $2.1 million, respectively. Accrued and\nunpaid interest was $0 as of December 31, 2023 and 2022. The 2021 Credit Facility contains customary affirmative and negative\ncovenants. Prior to entering into the Fifth Amendment, the Company was required to maintain a net leverage ratio of no more than 3.50 to\n1.00 as of December 31, 2021 and the last day of each fiscal quarter through December 31, 2023, 3.25 to 1.00 as of March 31, 2024 and the\nlast day of each fiscal quarter through March 31, 2025, 3.00 to 1.00 as of June 30, 2025 and September 30, 2025, with incremental\ntightening of the ratio to 2.50 to 1.00 as of June 30, 2026 and thereafter through maturity.

The Company has recorded a deferred tax asset primarily from the outside basis difference in the partnership\ninterest of $6.2 million and $5.2 million as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Payments of less than $0.1 million were made\nduring the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022. The payments under the TRA will not be conditional on holder of rights under the\nTRA having a continued ownership interest in either DDH LLC or the Company. The Company may elect to defer payments due under the\nTRA if the Company does not have available cash to satisfy its payment obligations under the TRA. Any such deferred payments under the\nTRA generally will accrue interest from the due date for such payment until the payment date. The Company accounts for any amounts\npayable under the TRA in accordance with ASC Topic 450, Contingencies, and recognizes subsequent period changes to the measurement\nof the liability from the TRA in the statement of operations as a component of income before taxes. For the year ended December 31, 2023,\n$0.3 million was recorded as income in other expense, net for such change.\nThe term of the TRA commenced upon completion of the initial public offering and will continue until all tax benefits that are subject\nto the TRA have been utilized or expired, unless the Company exercises its right to terminate the TRA. If the Company elects to terminate\nthe TRA early (or it is terminated early due to changes in control), the obligations under the TRA would accelerate and the Company would\nbe required to make an immediate payment equal to the present value of the anticipated future payments to be made by the Company under\nthe TRA.\nIncome Taxes\nThrough the Organizational Transactions completed in February 2022, the Company formed an Up-C structure which allows DDM to\ncontinue to realize tax benefits associated with owning interests in an entity that is treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax\npurposes. Under the Up-C structure, the Company is subject to corporation income tax on the variable ownership changes that occurred in\nthe first and third quarters of 2022, and in the fourth quarter of 2023. As a result, the Company recorded a provision for federal and state\ndeferred income tax of $0.6 million primarily attributed to valuation allowances of $0.5 million recorded against deferred taxes associated\nwith loss carryforwards and interest expense for which the realization of such deferred taxes is uncertain. Prior to 2022, the Company was\ntreated as a partnership, and therefore no income tax expense was recognized. For the year ended December 31, 2022, income taxes\n92\nTable of Contents\non the financial statements include income taxes of $0.2 million as shown in the following table as well as $0.1 million of non-income\nrelated franchise taxes. The components of income tax expense are as follows (in thousands):\nYear Ended December 31,\n2023 2022\nCurrent:\nFederal $ — $ 107\nState — 34\nTotal current: — 141\nDeferred:\nFederal $ 205 $ 85\nState 363 20\nTotal deferred: 568 105\nTotal income tax expense $ 568 $ 246\nA reconciliation of the statutory federal income tax rate to the Company’s effective tax rate is as follows:\nYear Ended December 31,\n2023 2022\nFederal income tax expense at statutory rate 21.0% 21.0%\nState income tax expense 0.6% 1.1%\nPartnership income not taxed (17.0)% (16.6)%\nValuation allowance (7.3)% —%\nDeferred tax remeasurement (6.5)%\nOther 0.1% —%\nEffective income tax rate (9.1)% 5.5%\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities reflect the net tax effects of net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards and temporary differences\nbetween the carrying amount of assets and liabilities for financial reporting and the amounts used for tax purposes. The components of\ndeferred tax assets are as follows (in thousands):\nDecember 31,\n2023 2022\nDeferred tax assets related to:\nPartnership basis difference, net of valuation allowance $ 5,852 $ 5,165\nNet operating loss carryforwards 280 —\nDeferred tax assets, net $ 6,132 $ 5,165\nAs of December 31, 2023, the Company had federal net operating loss carryforwards of $1.1 million that can be carried forward\nindefinitely.\nThe Company files income tax returns in the United States federal jurisdiction and various state jurisdictions. In the normal course of\nbusiness, the Company can be examined by various tax authorities, including the Internal Revenue Service in the United States. There are\ncurrently no federal or state audits in process. The Company analyzes its tax filing positions in all of the U.S. federal, state and local tax\njurisdictions where it is required to file income tax returns, as well as for all open tax years in these jurisdictions. Federal and various states\nreturns for the years ended December 2022 and 2021 remain open as of December 31, 2023. The Company evaluates tax positions taken or\nexpected to be taken in the course of preparing an entity’s tax returns to determine whether it is “more-likely-than-not” that each tax\nposition will be sustained by the applicable tax authority. As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the Company had no uncertain tax positions.\nAccordingly, the Company has not recognized any penalty, interest or tax impact related to uncertain tax positions.\n93\nTable of Contents\nNote 6 — Related Party Transactions\nRelated Party Transactions\nMember Payable\nAs of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the Company’s balances with members related to the timing of distributions to holders of LLC\nUnits were a receivable of $1.7 million and payable of $1.4 million, respectively, which are included as a related party receivable and\npayable, respectively, on the consolidated balance sheets.\nUp-C Structure\nIn February 2022, the Company completed an initial public offering of its securities, and through the Organizational Transactions,\nformed an Up-C structure, which is often used by partnerships and limited liability companies and allows DDM, a Delaware limited\nliability company indirectly owned by Mark Walker (“Walker”) and Keith Smith (“Smith”), to retain its equity ownership in DDH LLC and\nto continue to realize tax benefits associated with owning interests in an entity that is treated as a partnership, or “pass-through” entity, for\nU.S. federal income tax purposes. DDM holds economic nonvoting LLC Units in DDH LLC and holds noneconomic voting equity\ninterests in the form of the Class B Common Stock in Direct Digital Holdings (See Note 4 – Stockholders’ Equity and Stock-Based\nCompensation). One of the tax benefits to DDM associated with this structure is that future taxable income of DDH LLC that is allocated to\nDDM will be taxed on a pass-through basis and therefore will not be subject to corporate taxes at the entity level. Additionally, DDM may,\nfrom time to time, redeem or exchange its LLC Units for shares of the Company’s Class A Common Stock on a one-for-one basis. The Up-\nC structure also provides DDM with potential liquidity that holders of non-publicly traded limited liability companies are not typically\nafforded. If the Company ever generates sufficient taxable income to utilize the tax benefits, DDH expects to benefit from the Up-C\nstructure because, in general, the Company expects cash tax savings in amounts equal to 15% of certain tax benefits arising from such\nredemptions or exchanges of DDM's LLC Units for Class A Common Stock or cash and certain other tax benefits covered by the TRA.\n(See Note 5 - Tax Receivable Agreement and Income Taxes).\nThe aggregate balance of tax receivable liabilities as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, is as follows (in thousands):\nDecember 31,\n2023 2022\nLiability related to tax receivable agreement:\nShort term $ 41 $ 183\nLong term 5,201 4,150\nTotal liability related to tax receivable agreement $ 5,242 $ 4,333\nBoard Services and Consulting Agreement\nOn September 30, 2020, the Company entered into board services and consulting agreements with Walker, Smith and Leah Woolford\n(“Woolford”). Walker, Smith and Woolford were then all members of DDH LLC. Walker now serves as Chairman of the Board of Directors\nand Chief Executive Officer of the Company. Smith now serves as a director on the Board of Directors and President of the Company.\nWoolford previously served as a Manager on the Board of Managers of DDH LLC and Senior Advisor of DDH LLC. In connection with\nthe Organizational Transactions, the consulting agreements were canceled, and, for the year end December 31, 2023, no fees were paid to\nWalker, Smith and Woolford. For the year end December 31, 2022, total fees paid to Walker, Smith and Woolford were $0.1 million, $0.1\nmillion, and less than $0.1 million, respectively.\n94\nTable of Contents\nNote 7 — Segment Information\nRevenue by business segment is as follows (in thousands):\nYear Ended December 31,\n2023 2022\nSell-side advertising $ 122,434 $ 60,011\nBuy-side advertising 34,676 29,349\nTotal revenues $ 157,110 $ 89,360\nOperating (loss) income by business segment reconciled to (loss) income before income taxes is as follows (in thousands):\nYear Ended December 31,\n2023 2022\nSell-side advertising $ 4,874 $ 8,318\nBuy-side advertising 7,792 6,992\nCorporate office expenses (14,851) (7,331)\n(Loss) income from operations (2,185) 7,979\nCorporate other expense (4,091) (3,486)\n(Loss) income before income taxes $ (6,276) $ 4,493\nTotal assets by business segment are as follows (in thousands):\nDecember 31,\n2023 2022\nSell-side advertising $ 34,354 $ 25,512\nBuy-side advertising 22,539 25,686\nCorporate office 13,779 6,928\nTotal assets $ 70,672 $ 58,126\nNote 8 — Net (Loss) Income Per Share\nThe Company has two classes of common stock, Class A and Class B. Shares of the Company’s Class B Common Stock do not share\nin the earnings or losses attributable to Direct Digital Holdings, Inc. and are therefore not participating securities. The Company uses the\ntwo-class method to calculate basic and diluted earnings per share as a result of\n95\nTable of Contents\noutstanding participating securities in the form of warrants. The following table sets forth the computation of the Company’s basic and\ndiluted (loss) income per share (in thousands, except per share amounts).\nYear Ended\nDecember 31,\n2023 2022\nNet (loss) income $ (2,194) $ 205\nLess: net loss prior to Organizational Transactions — (464)\nNet (loss) income attributable to Class A shareholders and participating securities (2,194) 669\nLess: net income allocated to participating securities — 353\nNet (loss) income allocated to Class A shareholders $ (2,194) $ 316\nWeighted average common shares outstanding - basic 2,988 2,848\nOptions to purchase common stock — —\nUnvested restricted stock units — 43\nWeighted average common shares outstanding - diluted 2,988 2,891\nNet (loss) income per share, basic $ (0.73) $ 0.11\nNet (loss) income per share, diluted $ (0.73) $ 0.11\nThe following weighted-average outstanding shares of common stock equivalents were excluded from the computation of diluted net\n(loss) income per share attributable to common stockholders for the periods presented because including them would have been anti-\ndilutive (in thousands):\nYear Ended\nDecember 31,\n2023 2022\nClass B Common Stock 11,249 11,330\nRestricted stock units 511 189\nOptions to purchase common stock 347 —\nTotal excludable from net (loss) income per share attributable to common stockholders -\ndiluted 12,107 11,519\nNote 9 — Commitments and Contingencies\nLitigation\nWe may from time to time be subject to various legal or administrative claims and proceedings arising in the ordinary course of\nbusiness. As of the date hereof, except as set forth below, we are not a party to any material legal or administrative proceedings nor are\nthere any proceedings in which any of our directors, executive officers or affiliates, or any registered or beneficial stockholder, is an\nadverse party or has a material interest adverse to our interest. Litigation or any other legal or administrative proceeding, regardless of the\noutcome, is likely to result in substantial cost and diversion of our resources, including our management’s time and attention.\nOn May 23, 2024, an alleged stockholder, purportedly on behalf of the persons or entities who purchased or acquired publicly traded\nsecurities of the Company between April 2023 and March 2024, filed a putative class action against the Company, certain of our officers\nand directors, and other defendants in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Texas, alleging violations of federal securities\nlaws related to alleged false or misleading disclosures made by the Company in its public filings. On July 9, 2024, another alleged\nstockholder filed a similar securities class action against the Company, certain of our officers and directors, also in the Southern District of\nTexas. The two actions have been consolidated. Each of these complaints seeks unspecified damages, plus costs, fees, and attorneys’ fees.\nThe Company cannot make any predictions about the final outcome of this matter or the timing thereof but believes that plaintiffs’ claims\nlack merit and intends to vigorously defend these lawsuits.\n96\nTable of Contents\nOn May 10, 2024, the Company was the subject of a defamatory article / blog post. In connection with this post, one of the Company’s\nsell-side customers paused its connection to the Company while the allegations were investigated. This customer reconnected the Company\non May 22, 2024 and sell-side volumes have resumed but not yet at the levels experienced prior to the pause in May 2024. The Company is\nactively working with its partners to achieve prior volume levels. On May 14, 2024, the Company filed a lawsuit against the author of the\ndefamatory article and is vigorously pursuing its rights. The Company cannot make any predictions about the final outcome of this\nlitigation matter or the timing thereof.\nOther Expense (within Operating Expenses)\nTypically, short payments received from our customers are charged back to our publishers, in accordance with our contracts with the\npublishers. In January 2024, we received notice from one of our sell-side customers that it would be short paying the Company’s invoices.\nThe Company has requested, but has not yet received, an explanation from the customer for the short payment, and therefore the Company\ndisputed it. Because this information has not been received, the Company paid $8.8 million to a few publishers related to these charges. As\na result, for the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company has not recognized revenue related to the short payments and recognized $8.8\nmillion in other expense related to the payments made to the publishers. Although the Company is attempting to recover these amounts,\nrecovery is neither estimable or probable and there can be no assurance that the Company will recover any amounts associated with this\nmatter. We do not expect these amounts to recur in any material fashion, although there is no assurance that customers will not take such\naction in the future.\nOperating Leases\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, the Company incurred fixed rent expense associated with operating leases for\nreal estate of $0.3 million and $0.3 million, respectively. The Company did not have any finance leases, short-term leases nor variable\nleases over this time period.

The Company records amortization expense on\na straight-line basis over the life of the identifiable intangible assets. For the years ended December 30, 2023 and 2022, amortization\nexpense was $2.0 million and $2.0 million, respectively.

Class B Preferred Units were mandatorily redeemable for $7.1 million on September 30, 2024,\nwith 7% preferred annual returns paid on a quarterly basis. Due to the mandatory redemption feature, the Class B Preferred Units were\nclassified as a liability rather than as a component of equity, with the preferred annual returns being accrued and recorded as interest\nexpense.\nIn February 2022, DDH LLC redeemed the Class B Preferred Units and recognized a loss on the redemption of $0.6 million in\nconnection with the write-off of the fair value associated with the units. The Company recorded interest expense relating to the Class B\nPreferred Units of less than $0.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2022.\nNote 13 — Restatement (Unaudited)\nDuring the preparation of the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company\nidentified prior period accounting errors in the Company’s previously reported unaudited interim consolidated financial statements\nbeginning March 31, 2022 resulting from the incorrect (1) accounting for, and presentation of, NCI, (2) recognition of an organizational\ntransaction in connection with the Company’s initial public offering, (3) presentation of earnings per share considering the effect of certain\nfeatures of the Company’s warrants and the impact of correcting the accounting for, and presentation of, NCI, and (4) timing of the\nrecording of the 2023 redemption of warrants. The Company’s management and the audit committee of the Company’s Board of Directors\ndetermined that these errors in the unaudited interim consolidated financial statements for the quarterly periods ended March 31, 2023,\nJune 30, 2023 and September 30, 2023 required a restatement of these prior period financial statements.\n99\nTable of Contents\nIn addition, certain prior year amounts have been revised in the consolidated statement of cash flows.

Changes in and Disagreement with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure\nNone.\nITEM 9A. Controls and Procedures\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nThe Company maintains disclosure controls and procedures (“Disclosure Controls”) as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and\n15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our Exchange Act reports is\nrecorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC rules and forms, and that such information is\naccumulated and communicated to management, including the Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”) and Chief Financial Officer (“CFO”) as\nappropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. The Company conducted an evaluation (the “Evaluation”), under the\nsupervision and with the participation of the CEO and CFO, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our Disclosure Controls as\nof December 31, 2023 pursuant to the Rules 13a-5(b) and 15d-15(b) of the Exchange Act. In designing and evaluating the Disclosure\nControls, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only\nreasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives and management was required to apply judgement in evaluating its\ncontrols and procedures. Based on this Evaluation, due to the material weaknesses described below, the CEO and CFO concluded that the\nCompany’s Disclosure Controls were not effective as of December 31, 2023.\nManagement's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nThe Company’s management, including the Company’s CEO and CFO, is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate\ninternal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f). The Company’s internal\ncontrol over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance to our management and board of directors regarding\nthe reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting\nprinciples generally accepted in the United States.\nThe internal control over financial reporting includes policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in\nreasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect transactions and dispositions of assets of the Company; (ii) provide reasonable assurances\nthat transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally\naccepted in the United States, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of\nmanagement and directors of the Company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized\nacquisition, use or disposition of the Company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal controls over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. All internal\ncontrol systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations, including the possibility of human error and the circumvention of\noverriding controls. Accordingly, even effective internal control over financial reporting can provide only reasonable assurance with respect\nto financial statement preparation. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls\nmay become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nThe Company’s management assessed the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31,\n2023. In making this assessment, management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway\nCommission in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013). Based on this evaluation, management concluded that the Company’s\ninternal control over financial reporting was not effective as of December 31, 2023 due to the material weaknesses described below.\nWe identified material weaknesses in our controls over the journal entry processes, information technology general controls (“ITGC”)\nand the technical evaluation of accounting matters that existed as of December 31, 2023. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a\ncombination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a\nmaterial misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or\n115\nTable of Contents\ndetected on a timely basis. The material weaknesses are a result of our processes and related controls not operating effectively related to\njournal entry processes, ITGC and the technical evaluation of accounting matters. As further detailed in Note 13 – Restatement (Unaudited)\nto the Company’s audited financial statements, the Company identified prior year accounting errors in the Company’s previously reported\nunaudited interim consolidated financial statements beginning March 31, 2022 resulting from the incorrect (1) accounting for and\npresentation of NCI, (2) recognition of an organizational transaction in connection with the Company’s initial public offering, (3)\npresentation of earnings per share considering the effect of certain features of the Company’s warrants and the impact of correcting the\naccounting for, and presentation of, NCI, and (4) timing of the recording of the 2023 redemption of warrants. The Company’s management\nand the audit committee of the Company’s Board of Directors concluded that it was appropriate to restate the quarterly unaudited\nconsolidated financial statements for the quarterly periods ended March 31, 2023, June 30, 2023, and September 30, 2023.\nOther than the described above, there were no material misstatements as a result of this material weakness; however, it could have\nresulted in a material misstatement to the annual or interim financial statements that would not have been prevented or detected on a timely\nbasis. Due to the material weakness, we have concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was not effective as of\nDecember 31, 2023.\nManagement’s Plan to Remediate the Material Weakness\nManagement has implemented remediation steps to address the material weaknesses and to improve our internal control environment.\nSpecifically, in late 2023, the Company engaged consultants to assist in identifying and testing the design of control over business\nprocesses as well as ITGC. The first phase of this project was completed in the first quarter of 2024. We are in the process of enhancing the\ndesign of certain internal control procedures and implementing new internal controls over (1) the segregation of duties within the journal\nentry process, (2) the access to program and change management within our information technology environment, and (3) the evaluation of\ntechnical accounting matters. These controls are planned to be tested for design and operating effectiveness in future periods. The Company\nwill continue the engagement with outside consultants to review the revised control processes and procedures.\nWhile the Company has implemented remediation steps, the material weakness cannot be considered fully remediated until the\nimproved controls have been in place and operate for a sufficient period of time. However, our management, including our Chief Executive\nOfficer and Chief Financial Officer, has concluded that, notwithstanding the identified material weaknesses in our internal control over\nfinancial reporting, the financial statements fairly present, in all material respects, our financial condition, results of operations and cash\nflows for the periods presented in conformity with U.S. GAAP.\nRemediation of Previously Reported Material Weakness\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company completed its efforts to remediate the material weakness identified in 2022 in\nour controls over completeness of revenue. Upon completion of those efforts, the Company concluded that the material weakness had been\nremediated as of December 31, 2023. As part of those remediation efforts, the Company implemented remediation actions during 2023 that\nincluded improving its review process including the reconciliation and documentation of the demand-side platform reports to the sell-side\nplatform data, improving contract management and review processes, engaging outside consultants to review business process analysis and\nflow of data to the accounting software platform and financial reporting, identifying and documenting the risk assessment and internal\ncontrols, and testing the effectiveness of the design of our internal controls.\nChanges in Internal Controls Over Financial Reporting\nOther than as discussed above, there were no changes in internal control over financial reporting during the year ended December 31,\n2023 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal control system over financial\nreporting.\n116\nTable of Contents\nITEM 9B.

Executive Compensation\nWe have opted to comply with the executive compensation disclosure rules applicable to “smaller reporting companies,” as such term\nis defined in the rules promulgated under the Securities Act. In accordance with these rules, our “named executive officers” for fiscal year\n2023 were:\n● Mark Walker, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer;\n● Keith Smith, President and Director;\n● Diana P. Diaz, Chief Financial Officer; and\n● Susan Echard, former Chief Financial Officer.\n122\nTable of Contents\nSummary Compensation Table\nThe following table sets forth information concerning the compensation of our named executive officers for the fiscal years ended\nDecember 31, 2023 and 2022 below.\nNonequity\nincentive plan All other\nName and principal Salary compensation Stock awards Option awards compensation Total\nposition Year ($) ($) ($)(1) ($) ($) ($)\nMark Walker 2023 530,200 375,000 276,844 71,759 — 1,253,803\nChairman and Chief Executive Officer 2022 518,750 — 98,658 59,388 — 676,796\nKeith Smith 2023 530,200 375,000 276,844 71,759 — 1,253,803\nPresident 2022 518,750 — 98,658 59,388 — 676,796\nDiana P.

The assumptions used in calculating these values are described in Note 2 to the Company’s\nconsolidated financial statements contained herein.\n(2) Ms. Diaz was employed by Vaco, LLC, a consulting firm, to which we paid a total of $290,000 in fees for fiscal year 2023,\nprior to Ms. Diaz joining the Company in October 2023.\n(3) Ms. Echard’s employment with the Company ceased on June 5, 2023. As a result of that cessation, Ms. Echard become\nentitled to severance payments equal to 12 months of her base salary, subject to her continued compliance with restrictive\ncovenants. This amount represents the portion of those severance payments made to her in 2023. The remaining $257,000 in\nseverance payments were made to Ms. Echard in 2024.\nAnnual Incentive Program\nOur named executive officers are each eligible to participate in an annual incentive program. Under this program, each participating\nexecutive has a target annual incentive amount and may earn between zero and 90% of that target amount based on the Company’s\nachievement of specified performance goals. For 2022, Messrs. Walker and Smith and Ms. Echard had target annual incentive amounts\nequal to 75%, 75% and 50% of their base salaries, respectively, and based on 2022 corporate performance, they each earned annual\nincentive payouts equal to 150% of their target amounts. For 2023, Messrs. Walker and Smith and Ms. Diaz had target annual incentive\namounts equal to 75%, 75% and 50% of their base salaries, respectively, and based on 2023 corporate performance, they each earned\nannual incentive payouts equal to 85% of their target amounts. The earned annual incentive payouts in 2023 for 2022 performance are\nreported in the Summary Compensation Table above under the heading “Non-Equity Incentive Plan Compensation” and were paid in cash.\nThe earned annual incentive payouts for 2023 were paid in 2024 in the form of unrestricted shares of our common stock.\nExecutive Employment Agreements with our Named Executive Officers\nMessrs. Walker and Smith and Ms. Diaz have each entered into employment agreements with our subsidiary DDH LLC. The\nemployment agreements set forth their annual base salaries of $500,000, $500,000 and $350,000, respectively, their eligibility for annual\nbonuses and long-term incentive awards, the at-will nature of their employment, certain expense\n123\nTable of Contents\nreimbursements, and their eligibility to participate in our benefit plans generally. In addition, the employment agreements include\ncustomary non-competition, non-solicitation, non-disparagement, confidentiality, and intellectual property covenants.\nThe severance provisions of each executive’s employment agreement are substantially the same. If the executive’s employment ceases\nfor any reason, the executive will be entitled to receive (i) accrued but unpaid base salary through the termination date, (ii) reimbursement\nfor any unreimbursed and reasonable business expenses incurred through the termination date consistent with the expense reimbursement\npolicy of DDH LLC, (iii) payout of accrued but unpaid paid-time-off days, if required by applicable law; and (iv) any other payments,\nbenefits, or fringe benefits to which he or she is entitled as of the termination date under any applicable plan, program or grant.\nIn addition, if the executive’s employment is terminated without “cause” by DDH LLC or by the executive for “good reason”, in either\ncase prior to a “change in control” (as those terms are defined in the executive’s employment agreement), the executive will be entitled to\ncontinuation of his or her base salary for twelve months. However, if such termination without cause or resignation with good reason\noccurs upon or following a Change in Control, the executive’s period of base salary continuation will be extended from twelve to twenty-\nfour months and the executive will also be entitled to a lump sum payment equal to his or her target bonus for the year of separation. In\neach case, these severance payments will be conditioned on the executive’s execution of a general release of claims.\nEquity Awards\nEach of our named executive officers is also eligible to receive equity awards under our 2022 Omnibus Incentive Plan. The size and\nother terms of equity awards are determined by the compensation committee of our board of directors, in their discretion. In 2023, the\ncompensation committee made both restricted stock unit and stock option awards to our named executive officers. These restricted stock\nunit and stock option awards generally vest (subject to the continued service of the grantee) in three equal annual installments, although\nvesting may accelerate in connection with certain employment terminations or a change in control.\nOutstanding Equity Awards at Fiscal Year End\nEquity\nIncentive\nPlan\nNumber of Market Equity Awards:\nSecurities Number of Number of Value of Incentive Market or\nUnderlying Securities Shares of Shares or Plan Payout\nUnexercised Underlying Option/ Option/ Units of Units of Awards: Value of\nName and Options/ Unexercised Warrant Warrant Stock That Stock That Number or Unearned\nprincipal Warrant Options Exercise Expiration Have Not Have Not Unearned Shares\nposition Exercisable (#) Unexercisable (#)(1) Price ($) Date Vested (#)(2) Vested ($) Shares (#) ($)\n— —\nMark Walker Chairman and Chief Executive Officer 20,300 40,600 $ 1.62 6/10/2032 40,600 $ 65,772\n29,910 3.96 3/20/2033 60,910 276,844\n— —\nKeith Smith President 20,300 40,600 $ 1.62 6/10/2032 40,600 $ 65,772\n29,910 3.96 3/20/2033 60,910 276,844\n— — —\nDiana Diaz, Chief Financial Officer 18,650 2.46 10/16/2033 18,650 45,879\n— — — — — — — —\nSusan Echard, Former Chief Financial Officer $ $\n(1) Options vest in equal annual installments over the three years after the option grant date. Each option is subject to the condition that the optionee will have remained employed by the\nCompany, or any one or more of its subsidiaries, through such vesting dates, and each option is further subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the Company’s 2022 Omnibus\nIncentive Plan and in the applicable stock option agreement.\n(2) Restricted stock units vest in equal annual installments over the three years after the restricted stock unit grant date. Each restricted stock unit is subject to the condition that the recipient\nwill have remained employed by the Company, or any one or more of its subsidiaries, through such vesting dates, and each restricted stock unit is further subject to the terms and\nconditions set forth in the Company’s 2022 Omnibus Incentive Plan and in the applicable restricted stock unit agreement.\n124\nTable of Contents\nClawback Policy\nIn 2023, the Company adopted a clawback policy (the “Clawback Policy”) to comply with the requirements of the Exchange Act, SEC\nrules and the Nasdaq Stock Market’s listing rules, such that in the event of an accounting restatement due to the material noncompliance of\nthe Company with any financial reporting requirement under the securities laws, the Company is required to seek recoupment of certain\ncash and performance-based equity incentive compensation received or deemed to be received by the Company’s current or former\nexecutive officers to the extent such compensation is determined to have been erroneously paid. The recovery of such compensation applies\nregardless of whether an executive officer engaged in misconduct or otherwise caused or contributed to the requirement for a restatement.\nThe policy is administered by the Company’s Board of Directors or, if so designated by the Board of Directors, a committee of the Board of\nDirectors. Any determinations made by the Board of Directors or a committee to which the Board’s authority under the Clawback Policy\nhas been delegated shall be final and binding on all affected individuals.\nErroneously Awarded Compensation Analysis\nAs discussed below in the notes to the Company’s consolidated financial statements under the heading “Note 13 – Restatement,” the\nCompany is restating its quarterly unaudited interim financial statements as of March 31, 2023, June 30, 2023 and September 30, 2023, for\nthe three-month period ended March 31, 2023, the three- and six-month periods ended June 30, 2023 and for the three- and nine-month\nperiods ended September 30, 2023, as well as certain financial information from 2022. Under the Clawback Policy, in the event of an\naccounting restatement of financial statements due to the Company’s material noncompliance with any financial reporting requirement\nunder the securities laws, the amount of Covered Compensation (as defined in the Clawback Policy) subject to recovery from an executive\nofficer is the amount received in excess of the amount that would have been paid to the executive officer absent the restatement, calculated\non a pre-tax basis. The Clawback Policy defines “Covered Compensation” to include any non-equity incentive plan awards, bonuses paid\nfrom a bonus pool, cash awards, equity or equity-based awards, or proceeds received upon sale of shares acquired through an incentive\nplan, provided that such compensation is granted, earned, and/or vested based wholly or in part on the attainment of a financial\nperformance measure.\nUpon review and consideration, upon authority delegated by the Board of Directors, the Compensation Committee concluded that the\nrevisions to the Company’s previously issued financial statements did not impact any financial metric utilized to determine Covered\nCompensation during the relevant periods. As a result, the compensation committee determined that there was no erroneously awarded\ncompensation to be recovered under the Company’s Clawback Policy as a result of the restatements.\nDirector Compensation\nDirector compensation for the year ended December 31, 2023, which was pro-rated for board members who served less than the entire\nservice period during fiscal 2023, is shown in the table below:\nFees earned or Stock\npaid in cash awards\nName ($) ($)(1)(2) Total ($)\nRichard Cohen 40,000 80,000 120,000\nAntoinette R.

Under the policy each director who is not an employee is paid cash compensation as set forth below:\nAnnual Retainer\nBoard of Directors:\nAll non-employee members $ 30,000\nAdditional retainer for non-executive chairperson $ 20,000\nAudit Committee:\nMembers $ —\nAdditional retainer for chair $ 10,000\nCompensation Committee:\nMembers $ —\nAdditional retainer for chair $ 5,000\nNominating and Corporate Governance Committee:\nMembers $ —\nAdditional retainer for chair $ 3,500\nThese fees are payable in four equal quarterly installments, provided that the amount of such payment will be prorated for any portion\nof such quarter that the director is not serving on our board of directors or any committee of the board of directors. We also reimburse our\nnon-employee directors for reasonable travel and other expenses incurred in connection with attending our board of directors and\ncommittee meetings.\nEquity Awards\nWe have no fixed policy regarding the issuance of equity awards to our non-employee directors. However, our board of directors has\nin recent years approved annual awards of restricted stock units to our non-employee directors. Those awards generally vest (subject to the\ncontinued service of the grantee) in three equal annual installments, although vesting may accelerate in certain circumstances, such as in\nconnection with a change in control.\n2022 Omnibus Incentive Plan\nGeneral Information About the 2022 Plan\nOn January 17, 2022, our board of directors adopted and our stockholders approved the 2022 Plan. The purpose of the 2022 Plan is to\nenable the Company to attract, retain and motivate its employees by providing for or increasing their proprietary interests in the Company.\nThe 2022 Plan is a stock incentive plan under which we may offer securities of the Company to our employees. The 2022 Plan is not\nsubject to any provisions of the U.S. Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 and is not\n126\nTable of Contents\nqualified under Section 401(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”). The 2022 Plan permits the Company to\nsatisfy any awards under the 2022 Plan by distributing to participants (1) authorized and unissued shares of the Company’s common stock,\n(2) shares of common stock held in the Company treasury, (3) shares of the Company’s common stock purchased on the open market or (4)\nshares of the Company’s common stock acquired through private purchase.\nEligibility\nEmployees, directors, officers and consultants or advisors of the Company and its affiliates are eligible for awards under the 2022 Plan.\nThe Committee (as discussed below) has the sole and complete authority to determine who will be granted awards under the 2022 Plan.\nEligible individuals are not required to make contributions to the 2022 Plan in order to participate. However, as described below,\ndepending on what method is chosen to exercise any stock options granted, an individual may be required to make a cash payment to the\nCompany upon that exercise. In addition, the Company may require payment of some amount for the shares subject to a restricted stock\naward.\nAdministration\nThe 2022 Plan is administered by the Committee, which consists of the members of our compensation committee, or if our board of\ndirectors is acting as our compensation committee, the individuals constituting “eligible” directors of our board of directors. The\nCommittee administers the 2022 Plan, except in the case of awards to non-employee directors. Awards to non-employee directors are\nadministered by our board of directors. The Committee in its discretion may delegate any and all of its duties to officers of the Company.\nThe Committee or, in the case of awards to non-employee directors, our board of directors, has the authority to determine the terms and\nconditions of any agreements relating to awards granted under the 2022 Plan (agreements may differ among participants), and to adopt,\nalter and repeal rules, guidelines and practices relating to the 2022 Plan. The Committee or, in the case of awards to non-employee\ndirectors, our board of directors, has full discretion to administer and interpret the 2022 Plan, and to adopt whatever rules, regulations and\nprocedures it deems necessary or advisable. The Committee or, in the case of awards to non- employee directors, our board of directors,\nalso has full discretion to determine, among other things, the times at which the awards may be exercised and under what circumstances an\naward may be exercised.\nDuration; Plan Amendments\nThe 2022 Plan expires by its terms on the tenth anniversary of the effective date of the 2022 Plan. However, our board of directors may\nterminate the 2022 Plan before that date. No awards can be granted under the 2022 Plan after the 2022 Plan has terminated. However,\nawards granted prior to the date on which the 2022 Plan terminates will not be affected by the termination and the terms and conditions of\nthe 2022 Plan will continue to apply to those awards.\nOur board of directors has the right to amend, alter, suspend, or terminate the 2022 Plan, even before the date on which the 2022 Plan\nis otherwise scheduled to terminate. The Committee may also amend outstanding awards or cancel any award and provide a substitute\naward, subject to the participants’ consent. However, neither our board of directors nor the Committee may amend or terminate the 2022\nPlan or any outstanding awards in a manner that would impair rights of award holders without their written consent, unless the amendment\nis made to comply with applicable law, stock exchange rules, or accounting rules.\nShares Available for Awards\nShares Available for Issuance\nThe maximum number of shares of common stock that may be issued pursuant to awards granted under the 2022 Plan is 1,500,000,\nsubject to certain adjustments for corporate transactions, as described in the section entitled “— Additional Information — Adjustments”\nbelow. On termination, forfeiture, or expiration of an unexercised stock option grant or other award, in whole or in part, the number of\nshares of common stock subject to such unexercised stock option grant or other\n127\nTable of Contents\naward will become available again for grant under the 2022 Plan. Also, shares subject to a stock option grant or other award that are not\ndelivered to a participant because they are used to satisfy a tax withholding obligation or that are withheld to pay all or a portion of an\noption’s exercise price will again become available for grant under the 2022 Plan. In addition, shares of the Company’s common stock will\nnot be considered used if the award to which they relate is settled in cash. Further, shares subject to awards granted in assumption or\nsubstitution of outstanding awards of an acquired entity shall not be counted against the shares of our common stock available for issuance\nunder the 2022 Plan.\nAwards\nStock Options\nStock options may be granted under the 2022 Plan. The Committee sets the terms of the stock option grant at the time the grant is\nmade. These terms are described in a stock option award agreement.\nThe Committee, in its discretion, may designate stock options granted under the 2022 Plan as either nonqualified stock options or\nincentive stock options (“ISOs”). ISOs have certain unique tax characteristics discussed below. The stock option agreement will indicate\nwhether the stock options are nonqualified stock options or ISOs. Please note, however, that, even if all of the stock options are designated\nas ISOs, only those stock options so designated that first become vested and exercisable in a calendar year having an aggregate fair market\nvalue (determined at the date of grant) of $100,000 will be eligible to receive ISO tax treatment. Any additional stock options that first\nbecome vested during that calendar year will be treated as nonqualified stock options for tax purposes.\nOnce a stock option vests, holders of stock options granted pursuant to the 2022 Plan will be able to exercise that stock option for a\nperiod determined by the Committee and set forth in their stock option agreement. Although the period during which an option may be\nexercised may vary from award to award, the longest period of time for which an option will remain exercisable is ten years from the date it\nis granted. If a participant’s employment terminates, the period during which they can exercise their vested stock options may change\ndepending on the terms of their option agreement.\nRestricted Stock Awards\nRestricted stock awards may be granted under the 2022 Plan. The Committee will set the terms of the restricted stock award at the time\nof grant and will describe these terms in a restricted stock award agreement.\nIf the specified performance criteria are not achieved within the established time frame, the shares will be forfeited, unless the terms of\nthe applicable restricted stock award agreement also provide for service- based vesting, catch-up vesting or otherwise specifically alter this\ntreatment.\nRestricted Stock Units\nRestricted stock unit awards may be granted under the 2022 Plan. The Committee will set the terms of the restricted stock unit award\nat the time of grant and will describe these terms in a restricted stock unit agreement.\nStock Bonus Awards\nParticipants may receive under the 2022 Plan a grant of unrestricted shares of the Company’s common stock or other awards, including\nfully-vested deferred stock units, denominated in common stock, as determined by the Committee.\nCash Bonus Awards\nParticipants may also receive under the 2022 Plan a cash bonus award. Any such award may be subject to a performance period,\nperformance goals or such other terms and conditions as the Committee may designate in the applicable award agreement.\n128\nTable of Contents\nStock Appreciation Rights\nStock appreciation rights may be granted under the 2022 Plan. The Committee will set the terms of the stock appreciation right at the\ntime of grant and will describe these terms in the applicable award agreement.\nAdditional Information\nAdjustments\nThe 2022 Plan provides for appropriate adjustments in the number of shares of common stock subject to awards and available for\nfuture awards, the exercise price of outstanding awards, as well as the maximum award limits under the 2022 Plan, in the event of changes\nin our outstanding common stock by reason of a merger, stock split, reorganization, recapitalization or similar events. The Committee may\nalso make these types of adjustments if a change in law or circumstances would result in any substantial dilution or enlargement of the\nrights of participants under the 2022 Plan.\nRepricing\nRepricing of options and SARs (as defined in the 2022 Plan) is generally prohibited under the 2022 Plan without approval of our\nstockholders.\nChange in Control\nUnless the applicable award agreement provides otherwise, in the event of a “change in control” (as defined in the 2022 Plan),\n● if a participant’s employment or service with the Company is terminated by the Company without “cause” (as defined in the 2022\nPlan) or by the participant for “good reason” (as defined in the 2022 Plan) within twelve months of a change in control of the\nCompany or in contemplation of a change in control, all awards held by such participant become fully vested and immediately\nexercisable, and any applicable restricted period ends on the termination date;\n● all incomplete performance periods in effect on the date the change in control occurs will end on the date of the change in control,\nand the Committee will determine the extent to which performance goals with respect to each such award period have been met\nbased upon such audited or unaudited financial information then available as it deems relevant; and each participant will be paid\npartial or full awards with respect to performance goals for each relevant award period based upon the Committee’s determination\nof the degree of attainment of any performance goals;\n● the acquiring entity may choose to either (i) continue the terms and conditions of each award under the 2022 Plan, or (ii) replace\nthe outstanding awards with a substantially equivalent award with respect to the acquiring entity’s stock; and\n● if an excise tax under Code Section 4999 will be triggered by any payments owed to a participant in connection with or contingent\nupon the change in control, the Company will reduce the aggregate amount of the payments payable to the participant such that no\nexcise tax will be assessed, unless the after-tax payment, even with the excise tax, will be a greater value than the value resulting\nfrom the reduction and avoidance of the excise tax.\nIn the event of a change in control, the Committee may in its discretion also make adjustments to the stock options and restricted stock\nunits granted under the 2022 Plan. The Committee may substitute shares of the surviving entity or another corporation that is party to the\ntransaction for shares of Company common stock. In connection with such an event, the Committee may also determine that outstanding\nawards will be cancelled in return for a cash payment equal to the value of the cancelled awards. In the event that the Committee decides to\ncancel outstanding awards, holders of outstanding awards will receive reasonable advanced notice.\n129\nTable of Contents\nTax withholding\nParticipants, other than non-employee directors, in the 2022 Plan must make a cash payment to the Company, or make other\narrangements satisfactory to the Committee, to satisfy the tax withholding obligations that arise under applicable law with respect to a stock\noption or other award granted under the 2022 Plan, including without limitation any U.S. federal income and employment taxes and other\napplicable state and local taxes. Under certain circumstances, participants may be permitted to satisfy their tax withholding obligation, in\nwhole or in part, by having us withhold from the shares of common stock otherwise deliverable to them on the exercise of a stock option,\nrestricted stock unit or stock appreciation right, or by surrendering shares having a fair market value on the date of exercise equal to the\nexercise price.\nTransferability and assignment\nIn general, participants in the 2022 Plan can exercise an option or other award received under the 2022 Plan only during their lifetime.\nUnless the agreement under which the stock option or other award was granted provides otherwise, participants cannot transfer stock\noptions or other awards (except for shares that are not subject to a restricted period), except by will or the laws of descent and distribution\nor pursuant to a domestic relations order issued by a court of competent jurisdiction.\nAward Termination; Forfeiture\nThe Committee has full power and authority to determine whether, to what extent and under what circumstances any award will be\nterminated or forfeited. To the extent provided in the award agreement, if a participant is terminated for “cause” (as defined in the 2022\nPlan), then any stock options or restricted stock units granted to such participant may be cancelled. Awards granted under the 2022 Plan are\nalso subject to any clawback, compensation recovery policy or minimum stock holding period requirement adopted by the Company.\nITEM 12. Security Ownership of Certain Beneficial Owners and Management and Related Stockholder Matters\nThe following table sets forth the beneficial ownership of our Class A common stock and Class B common stock by:\n● each person, or group of affiliated persons, who is known to beneficially own more than 5% of either our Class A common stock\nor our Class B common stock;\n● each of our named executive officers for fiscal year 2023;\n● each of our current directors; and\n● all of our current directors and executive officers as a group.\nBeneficial ownership is determined in accordance with the rules of the SEC. These rules generally attribute beneficial ownership of\nsecurities to persons who possess sole or shared voting power or investment power with respect to such securities.\nAs described in Item 13 “Certain Relationships and Related Person Transactions, and Director Independence,” DDM is entitled to have\nits LLC Units redeemed for shares of Class A common stock on a one-for-one basis (subject to customary adjustments, including for stock\nsplits, stock dividends and reclassifications) in accordance with the terms of the DDH LLC Agreement; provided that, at Direct Digital\nHoldings’ election, Direct Digital Holdings may effect a direct exchange of such Class A common stock. In connection with our initial\npublic offering, we issued to DDM one share of Class B common stock for each LLC Unit it owns.\nThe percentage of beneficial ownership of our Class A common stock and our Class B common stock is based on 3,795,199 shares of\nClass A common stock and 10,868,000 shares of Class B common stock issued and outstanding as of October 11, 2024 (the “Measurement\nDate”).\n130\nTable of Contents\nDDM holds all of the issued and outstanding shares of our Class B common stock. The shares of Class B common stock have no\neconomic rights, but each share entitles the holder to one vote per share on all matters on which stockholders of Direct Digital Holdings are\nentitled to vote generally.

Certain Relationships and Related Person Transactions, and Director Independence\nThe following are summaries of certain provisions of transactions since the beginning of our last fiscal year to which we have been a\nparty, in which the amount involved exceeds or will exceed $120,000 and in which any of our directors, executive officers or holders of\nmore than 5% of our capital stock, or immediate family member thereof, had or will have a direct or indirect material interest, and are\nqualified in their entirety by reference to all of the provisions of such agreements.\nWe believe the terms obtained or consideration that we paid or received, as applicable, in connection with the transactions described\nbelow were comparable to terms available or the amounts that we would pay or receive, as applicable, in arm’s-length transactions.\nTax Receivable Agreement\nWe expect to obtain an increase in our share of the tax basis of the assets of DDH LLC when (as described below under “— DDH LLC\nAgreement — LLC Unit Redemption Right”) DDM (a) redeems or exchanges its LLC Units for newly issued shares of our Class A\ncommon stock on a one-for-one basis and (b) receives payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement (such basis increase, a “Basis\nAdjustment”). We intend to treat such redemptions or exchanges of LLC Units as the direct purchase of LLC Units by Direct Digital\nHoldings from DDM for U.S. federal income and other applicable tax purposes, regardless of whether such LLC Units are surrendered by\nDDM to DDH LLC for redemption or sold to Direct Digital Holdings upon the exercise of our election to acquire such LLC Units directly.\nA Basis Adjustment\n132\nTable of Contents\nmay have the effect of reducing the amounts that we would otherwise pay in the future to various tax authorities to the extent that we have\npositive taxable income in a future tax period that is offset by tax depreciation or amortization deductions arising from such Basis\nAdjustment. The Basis Adjustments may also decrease gains (or increase losses) on future dispositions of certain capital assets to the extent\ntax basis is allocated to those capital assets, which could also generate tax savings for us.\nWe entered into the Tax Receivable Agreement with DDH LLC and DDM. The Tax Receivable Agreement provides for our payment to\nDDM of 85% of the amount of tax benefits, if any, that we actually realize, or in some circumstances, are deemed to realize (calculated\nusing certain assumptions), as a result of any Basis Adjustments and certain other tax benefits arising from payments under the Tax\nReceivable Agreement. DDH LLC has, in effect, an election under Section 754 of the Code effective for each taxable year in which a\nredemption or exchange (including deemed exchange) of LLC Units for shares of our Class A common stock occurs. These Tax Receivable\nAgreement payments are not conditioned upon any continued ownership interest in either DDH LLC or us by DDMs. The rights of DDM\nunder the Tax Receivable Agreement are assignable to transferees of its LLC Units (other than Direct Digital Holdings as transferee\npursuant to subsequent redemptions (or exchanges) of the transferred LLC Units); provided, however, DDM may not, directly or indirectly,\nassign or otherwise transfer its rights under the Tax Receivable Agreement to any Person (as defined in the Tax Receivable Agreement)\n(other than to certain “Permitted Transferees” specified in the DDH LLC Agreement) without the express prior written consent of Direct\nDigital Holdings, and without such Person (including a permitted transferee) executing and delivering a joinder to the Tax Receivable\nAgreement agreeing to become a party to the Tax Receivable Agreement. We expect to benefit from the remaining 15% of tax benefits, if\nany, that we may realize. Actual tax benefits realized by us may differ from tax benefits calculated under the Tax Receivable Agreement as\na result of the use of certain assumption in the Tax Receivable Agreement, including the use of an assumed weighted-average state and\nlocal income tax rate to calculate tax benefits.\nThe Basis Adjustments, as well as any amounts paid to DDM under the Tax Receivable Agreement, will vary depending on a number\nof factors, including:\n● the timing of any subsequent redemptions or exchanges — for instance, the increase in any tax deductions will vary depending on\nthe fair value, which may fluctuate over time, of the depreciable or amortizable assets of DDH LLC at the time of each\nredemption or exchange;\n● the price of shares of our Class A common stock at the time of redemptions or exchanges — the Basis Adjustments, as well as any\nrelated increase in any tax deductions, are directly related to the price of shares of our Class A common stock at the time of each\nredemption or exchange;\n● the extent to which such redemptions or exchanges are taxable — if a redemption or exchange is not taxable for any reason,\nincreased tax deductions will not be available; and\n● the amount and timing of our taxable income (prior to taking into account the tax depreciation or amortization deductions arising\nfrom the Basis Adjustments) — the Tax Receivable Agreement generally requires Direct Digital Holdings to pay 85% of the tax\nbenefits as and when those benefits are treated as realized under the terms of the Tax Receivable Agreement. Except as discussed\nbelow, in cases of (i) a material breach of a material obligation under the Tax Receivable Agreement, (ii) a change of control or\n(iii) an early termination of the Tax Receivable Agreement, if Direct Digital Holdings does not have taxable income, it will\ngenerally not be required to make payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement for that taxable year because no tax benefits will\nhave been realized. However, any tax benefits that do not result in realized tax benefits in a given taxable year may generate tax\nattributes that may be utilized to generate tax benefits in future taxable years. The utilization of any such tax attributes will result\nin payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement.\n133\nTable of Contents\nThe aggregate balance of tax receivable liabilities owed to DDM as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, is as follows (in thousands):\nDecember 31,\n2023 2022\nLiability related to tax receivable agreement:\nShort term $ 41 $ 183\nLong term 5,201 4,150\nTotal liability related to tax receivable agreement $ 5,242 $ 4,333\nFor purposes of the Tax Receivable Agreement, cash savings in income tax is computed by comparing Direct Digital Holdings’ actual\nincome tax liability to the amount of such taxes that it would have been required to pay had there been no Basis Adjustments and had the\nTax Receivable Agreement not been entered into. The Tax Receivable Agreement generally applies to each of our taxable years. The actual\nand hypothetical tax liabilities determined in the Tax Receivable Agreement is calculated using the actual U.S. federal income tax rate in\neffect for the applicable period and an assumed, weighted-average state and local income tax rate based on apportionment factors for the\napplicable period (along with the use of certain other assumptions). There is no maximum term for the Tax Receivable Agreement;\nhowever, the Tax Receivable Agreement may be terminated by us pursuant to an early termination procedure that requires us to pay DDM\nan agreed upon amount equal to the estimated present value of the remaining payments to be made under the agreement (calculated based\non certain assumptions, including regarding tax rates and utilization of the Basis Adjustments).\nThe payment obligations under the Tax Receivable Agreement are obligations of Direct Digital Holdings and not of DDH LLC.\nAlthough the actual timing and amount of any payments that may be made under the Tax Receivable Agreement will vary, we expect that\nthe payments that we may be required to make to DDM could be significant. The actual increases in tax basis with respect to future taxable\nredemptions, exchanges or purchases of LLC Units, as well as the amount and timing of any payments we are required to make under the\nTax Receivable Agreement in respect of the acquisition of LLC Units from DDM in connection with future taxable redemptions, exchanges\nor purchases of LLC Units, may differ materially from the amounts set forth above because the potential future reductions in our tax\npayments, as determined for purposes of the Tax Receivable Agreement, and the payments we are required to make under the Tax\nReceivable Agreement, will each depend on a number of factors, including the market value of our Class A common stock at the time of\nredemption or exchange, the prevailing federal tax rates applicable to us over the life of the Tax Receivable Agreement (as well as the\nassumed combined state and local tax rate), the amount and timing of the taxable income that we generate in the future and the extent to\nwhich future redemptions, exchanges or purchases of LLC Units are taxable transactions.\nThere may be a material negative effect on our liquidity if, as described below, the payments made by us to DDM under the Tax\nReceivable Agreement exceed the actual benefits we receive in respect of the tax attributes subject to the Tax Receivable Agreement and/or\ndistributions to us by DDH LLC are not sufficient to permit us to make payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement. To the extent that\nwe are unable to make payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement for any reason, the unpaid amounts generally will be deferred and\nwill possibly accrue interest until paid by us. Decisions made by us in the course of running our business, such as with respect to mergers,\nasset sales, other forms of business combinations or other changes in control, may influence the timing and amount of payments that are\nreceived by DDM under the Tax Receivable Agreement. For example, the earlier disposition of assets following a transaction that results in\na Basis Adjustment will generally accelerate payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement and increase the present value of such\npayments.\nIn addition, although we are not aware of any issue that would cause the IRS to challenge the tax basis increases or other benefits\narising under the Tax Receivable Agreement, DDM will not reimburse us for any payments previously made if such tax basis increases or\nother tax benefits are subsequently disallowed, except that any excess payments made to DDM will be netted against future payments\notherwise to be made under the Tax Receivable Agreement, if any, after our determination of such excess. In addition, a challenge to any\ntax benefits initially claimed by us may not arise for a number of years following the initial time of such payment. As a result, in such\ncircumstances we could make payments to DDM under the Tax Receivable Agreement that are greater than our actual cash tax savings and\nmay not be able to recoup those payments, which could negatively impact our liquidity.\n134\nTable of Contents\nIn addition, the Tax Receivable Agreement provides that, upon certain mergers, asset sales or other forms of business combination or\ncertain other changes of control, our or our successor’s obligations with respect to tax benefits would be based on certain assumptions,\nincluding that we or our successor would have sufficient taxable income to fully utilize the benefits arising from the increased tax\ndeductions and tax basis and other benefits covered by the Tax Receivable Agreement. As a result, upon a change of control, we could be\nrequired to make payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement that are greater than or less than the specified percentage of our actual\ncash tax savings, which could negatively impact our liquidity.\nThis provision of the Tax Receivable Agreement may result in situations where DDM, a holding company indirectly owned by our\nChairman and Chief Executive Officer and our President, have interests that differ from or are in addition to those of our other\nstockholders. See “Risk Factors— Risks Related to Our Organizational Structure.” In addition, we could be required to make payments\nunder the Tax Receivable Agreement that are substantial and in excess of our, or a potential acquirer’s, actual cash savings in income tax.\nFinally, because we are a holding company with no operations of our own, our ability to make payments under the Tax Receivable\nAgreement is dependent on the ability of DDH LLC to make distributions to us. To the extent that we are unable to make payments under\nthe Tax Receivable Agreement for any reason, such payments will be deferred and will possibly accrue interest until paid.\nDDH LLC Agreement\nWe operate our business through DDH LLC and its subsidiaries. We and DDM entered into DDH LLC’s amended and restated limited\nliability company agreement, which we refer to as the “DDH LLC Agreement,” on February 15, 2022. The operations of DDH LLC, and\nthe rights and obligations of the holders of LLC Units, are set forth in the DDH LLC Agreement.\nAppointment as Manager and Voting Rights\nUnder the DDH LLC Agreement, we are a member and the sole manager of DDH LLC. As the sole manager, we are able to control all\nof the day-to-day business affairs and decision-making of DDH LLC. As such, we, through our officers and directors, are responsible for all\noperational and administrative decisions of DDH LLC and the day-to-day management of DDH LLC’s business. Pursuant to the terms of\nthe DDH LLC Agreement, we cannot, under any circumstances, be removed as the sole manager of DDH LLC except by our election. In\naddition, as a result of our 100% ownership of all of the voting interests in DDH LLC, we control the decision-making of any matter\nrequired to be approved by the members of DDH LLC as provided under the DDH LLC Agreement.\nCompensation\nWe are not entitled to compensation for our services as manager. We are entitled to reimbursement or capital contribution credit by\nDDH LLC for fees and expenses incurred on behalf of DDH LLC, including all expenses associated with maintaining our corporate\nexistence.\nDistributions\nThe DDH LLC Agreement requires “tax distributions” to be made by DDH LLC to its members, as that term is defined in the\nagreement. Tax distributions are made to members on a pro rata basis, including us, in amounts intended to be sufficient to allow the\nmembers, including us, to pay taxes owed in respect of income allocated by DDH LLC and to allow us to meet our obligations under the\nTax Receivable Agreement (as described above under “— Tax Receivable Agreement”). The DDH LLC Agreement also allows for\ndistributions to be made by DDH LLC to its members on a pro rata basis out of “distributable cash,” as that term is defined in the\nagreement. We expect DDH LLC may make distributions out of distributable cash periodically to the extent permitted by our agreements\ngoverning our indebtedness and necessary to enable us to cover our operating expenses and other obligations, including our tax liability and\nobligations under the Tax Receivable Agreement, as well as to make dividend payments, if any, to the holders of our Class A common\nstock.\n135\nTable of Contents\nLLC Unit Redemption Right\nThe DDH LLC Agreement provides a redemption right to DDM which entitles it to have its LLC Units redeemed, from time to time at\nits election (subject to the terms of the DDH LLC Agreement), for newly issued shares of our Class A common stock on a one-for-one basis\n(subject to customary adjustments, including for stock splits, stock dividends and reclassifications). Upon the exercise of the redemption\nright, DDM will surrender its LLC Units to DDH LLC for cancellation. The DDH LLC Agreement requires that we contribute shares of our\nClass A common stock to DDH LLC in exchange for an amount of newly issued LLC Units in DDH LLC that are issued to us equal to the\nnumber of LLC Units redeemed from DDM. DDH LLC will then distribute the shares of our Class A common stock to DDM to complete\nthe redemption. In the event of such a redemption election by DDM, Direct Digital Holdings may effect a direct exchange of Class A\ncommon stock. Whether by redemption or exchange, we are obligated to ensure that at all times the number of LLC Units that we own\nequals the number of shares of Class A common stock issued by us (subject to certain exceptions for treasury shares and shares underlying\ncertain convertible or exchangeable securities).\nIndemnification\nThe DDH LLC Agreement provides for indemnification of the manager, members and officers of DDH LLC and their respective\nsubsidiaries or affiliates.\nDirector Independence\nOur Class A common stock is listed on The Nasdaq Capital Market under the symbol “DRCT”. Under the rules of The Nasdaq Capital\nMarket, independent directors must comprise a majority of a listed company’s board of directors within a specified period of the\ncompletion of our initial public offering, which closed on February 15, 2022. In addition, the rules require that, subject to specified\nexceptions, each member of a listed company’s audit, compensation and nominating and corporate governance committees be independent.\nAudit committee members must also satisfy the independence criteria set forth in Rule 10A-3. Under the rules of The Nasdaq Capital\nMarket, a director will only qualify as an “independent director” if, in the opinion of that company’s board of directors, that person does not\nhave a relationship that would interfere with the exercise of independent judgment in carrying out the responsibilities of a director.\nTo be considered independent for purposes of Rule 10A-3, a member of an audit committee of a listed company may not, other than in\nhis or her capacity as a member of the audit committee, the board of directors or any other board committee: (1) accept, directly or\nindirectly, any consulting, advisory or other compensatory fee from the listed company or any of its subsidiaries; or (2) be an affiliated\nperson of the listed company or any of its subsidiaries.\nIn October 2024, our board of directors undertook a review of its composition, the composition of its committees and the independence\nof our directors and considered whether any director has a material relationship with us that could compromise his or her ability to exercise\nindependent judgment in carrying out his or her responsibilities. Based upon information requested from and provided by each director\nconcerning his or her background, employment and affiliations, including family relationships, our board of directors has determined that\nnone of our non-employee directors has a relationship that would interfere with the exercise of independent judgment in carrying out the\nresponsibilities of a director and that each of these non-employee directors is “independent” as that term is defined under the rules of The\nNasdaq Capital Market. In October 2024, our board of directors also determined that Mr. Cohen and Mses. Leatherberry and Locke, each of\nwhom sit on our audit committee, compensation committee and nominating and corporate governance committee, satisfy the independence\nstandards for those committees established by applicable SEC rules and the rules of The Nasdaq Capital Market. In making this\ndetermination, our board of directors considered the relationships that each non-employee director has with us and all other facts and\ncircumstances our board of directors deemed relevant in determining their independence, including the beneficial ownership of our capital\nstock by each non-employee director.\n136\nTable of Contents\nITEM 14.

The following description summarizes the material terms and provisions of the registered securities of Direct\nDigital Holdings, Inc. Because it is only a summary, it does not contain all the information that may be important to you. For a\ncomplete description of our capital stock, you should refer to our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation\n(“certificate of incorporation”) and our Amended and Restated Bylaws (“bylaws”), each as amended from time to time, and to\nthe provisions of applicable Delaware law.\nCommon Stock\nWe are authorized to issue 160,000,000 shares of Class A common stock, par value $0.001 per share, 20,000,000 shares of\nClass B common stock, par value $0.001 per share and 10,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par value $0.001 per share.\nClass A Common Stock\nVoting Rights\nHolders of our Class A common stock are be entitled to cast one vote per share. Holders of our Class A common stock are\nnot entitled to cumulate their votes in the election of directors. Generally, all matters to be voted on by stockholders must be\napproved by a majority (or, in the case of election of directors, by a plurality) of the votes entitled to be cast by all holders of\nClass A common stock and Class B common stock present in person or represented by proxy, voting together as a single class.\nExcept as otherwise provided by law, amendments to the certificate of incorporation must be approved by a majority of the\ncombined voting power of all shares of Class A common stock and Class B common stock, voting together as a single class.\nDividend Rights\nAny dividend or distribution paid or payable to the holders of shares of Class A common stock shall be paid pro rata, on\nan equal priority, pari passu basis; provided, however, that if a dividend or distribution is paid in the form of Class A common\nstock (or rights to acquire shares of Class A common stock), then the holders of the Class A common stock shall receive Class\nA common stock (or rights to acquire shares of Class A common stock).\nLiquidation Rights\nIn the event of our liquidation, dissolution or winding-up, upon the completion of the distributions required with respect to\nany series of redeemable convertible preferred stock that may then be outstanding, our remaining assets legally available for\ndistribution to stockholders shall be distributed on an equal priority, pro rata basis to the holders of Class A common stock,\nunless different treatment is approved by the majority of the voting power of the outstanding shares of Class A common stock\nand Class B common stock.\nOther Matters\nNo shares of Class A common stock are subject to redemption or have preemptive rights to purchase additional shares of\nClass A common stock. Holders of shares of our Class A common stock do not have\nsubscription, redemption or conversion rights. There are no redemption or sinking fund provisions applicable to the Class A\ncommon stock.\nClass B Common Stock\nIssuance of Class B Common Stock with LLC Units\nShares of Class B common stock will only be issued in the future to the extent necessary to maintain a one-to-one ratio\nbetween the number of economic nonvoting common units of Direct Digital Holdings, LLC (“LLC Units”) held by Direct\nDigital Management, LLC (“DDM LLC”) and the number of shares of Class B common stock issued to DDM LLC. Shares of\nClass B common stock are transferable only together with an equal number of LLC Units. Shares of Class B common stock\nwill be cancelled on a one-for-one basis if we, at the election of DDM LLC, redeem or exchange their LLC Units pursuant to\nthe terms of the Amended and Restated Limited Liability Agreement of DDH LLC, dated February 15, 2022, by and between\nus and DDM (the “DDH LLC Agreement”).\nVoting Rights\nHolders of Class B common stock are entitled to cast one vote per share, with the number of shares of Class B common\nstock held by DDM LLC being equivalent to the number of nonvoting LLC Units held by DDM LLC. Holders of our Class B\ncommon stock are not entitled to cumulate their votes in the election of directors. The voting power afforded to DDM LLC by\nits shares of Class B common stock will be automatically and correspondingly reduced as it redeems its LLC Units because an\nequal number of their shares of Class B common stock will be cancelled.\nGenerally, all matters to be voted on by stockholders must be approved by a majority (or, in the case of election of\ndirectors, by a plurality) of the votes entitled to be cast by all Class A and Class B stockholders present in person or\nrepresented by proxy, voting together as a single class. Except as otherwise provided by law, amendments to the certificate of\nincorporation must be approved by a majority of the combined voting power of all shares of Class A common stock and Class\nB common stock, voting together as a single class. There will be a separate vote of the Class B common stock in the following\ncircumstances:\n● if we amend, alter or repeal any provision of the certificate of incorporation or the bylaws in a manner that modifies\nthe voting, conversion or other powers, preferences, or other special rights or privileges, or restrictions of the Class B\ncommon stock;\n● if we reclassify any outstanding shares of Class A common stock into shares having rights as to dividends or\nliquidation that are senior to the Class B common stock or, in the case of Class A common stock, the right to more than\none vote for each share thereof; or\n● if we authorize any shares of preferred stock with rights as to dividends or liquidation that are senior to the Class B\ncommon stock or the right to more than one vote for each share thereof.\nDividend Rights\nThe shares of Class B common stock have no economic rights. Holders of shares of our Class B common stock do not\nhave any rights to receive dividends.\nLiquidation Rights\nOn our liquidation, dissolution or winding up, holders of Class B common stock will not be entitled to receive any\ndistribution of our assets.\nTransfers\nPursuant to the DDH LLC Agreement, each holder of Class B common stock agrees that:\n● the holder will not transfer any shares of Class B common stock to any person unless the holder transfers an equal\nnumber of LLC Units to the same person; and\n● in the event the holder transfers any LLC Units to any person, the holder will transfer an equal number of shares of\nClass B common stock to the same person.\nOther Matters\nNo shares of Class B common stock have preemptive rights to purchase additional shares of Class B common stock.\nHolders of shares of our Class B common stock do not have subscription, redemption or conversion rights. There are no\nredemption or sinking fund provisions applicable to the Class B common stock.\nPreferred Stock\nOur board of directors has the authority, subject to limitations prescribed by Delaware law, to issue up to 10,000,000\nshares of “blank check” preferred stock in one or more series, to establish from time to time the number of shares to be\nincluded in each series and to fix the designation, powers, preferences and rights of the shares of each series and any of its\nqualifications, limitations or restrictions, in each case without further vote or action by our stockholders. Our board of directors\ncan also increase or decrease the number of shares of any series of preferred stock, but not below the number of shares of that\nseries then outstanding, without any further vote or action by our stockholders. Our board of directors may authorize the\nissuance of preferred stock with voting or conversion rights that could adversely affect the voting power or other rights of the\nholders of our Class A common stock. The issuance of preferred stock, while providing flexibility in connection with possible\nacquisitions and other corporate purposes, could, among other things, have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a\nchange in control of our Company and might adversely affect the market price of our Class A common stock and the voting\nand other rights of the holders of our Class A common stock. We have no current plan to issue any shares of preferred stock.\nUnit Purchase Option\nIn connection with our initial public offering consummated in February 2022 (the “IPO”), we sold to the representatives\nof the underwriters a unit purchase option to purchase 5% of the total number of units sold in the IPO (including 5% of any\nsecurities sold upon the underwriters’ exercise of the over-allotment option). The unit purchase option has an exercise price\nequal to 120% of the price per unit in the IPO or, in the event of the purchase of an uneven number of shares of Class A\ncommon stock or warrants pursuant to the over-allotment option, at 120% of the IPO price per share or per warrant, as\napplicable, subject to standard anti-dilution adjustments for share splits and similar transactions. The unit purchase option\nbecame exercisable upon issuance at any time, and from time to time, in whole or in part, during the period commencing 180\ndays from the commencement of sales in the IPO, and expiring five years from the commencement of sales in the IPO. The\nunit purchase option is also exercisable on a cashless basis. The unit purchase option has been deemed compensation by the\nFinancial Industry Regulatory Authority, Inc., or FINRA, and is therefore subject to a 180-day lock-up pursuant to FINRA\nRule 5110(e)(1). Except as permitted by Rule 5110(e)(1), the underwriters (or permitted assignees under the Rule) was not\npermitted to sell, transfer, assign, pledge, or hypothecate the unit purchase option or the securities underlying the unit purchase\noption, nor will any of them engage in any hedging, short sale, derivative, put, or call transaction that would result in the\neffective economic disposition of the option or the underlying securities for a period of 180 days from the commencement of\nthe IPO.\nExhibit 10.11\nEXECUTIVE EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENT\nThis EXECUTIVE EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENT (“Agreement”) is made by and between Direct Digital Holdings, LLC, a\nTexas limited liability company (together with its successors and assigns, the “Company”), and Maria Lowery (“Executive”).\nThis Agreement shall be effective upon Executive’s start date with the Company, which will be August 22, 2022 unless otherwise\nagreed by the parties (the “Effective Date”).\nRECITALS\nWHEREAS, the Company desires to employ Executive pursuant to the terms in this Agreement, and Executive desires to be\nemployed by the Company pursuant to the terms in this Agreement.\nNOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing recitals, the mutual covenants and conditions herein, and other good\nand valuable consideration, the receipt and adequacy of which is hereby acknowledged, the parties hereby agree as follows:\nAGREEMENT\n1.

A termination of employment shall not be deemed to have occurred for purposes of any\nprovision of this Agreement providing for the payment of any amounts or benefits upon or following a termination of\nemployment that are considered “nonqualified deferred compensation” under Section 409A unless such termination is\nalso a “separation from service” within the meaning of Section 409A and, for purposes of any such provision of this\nAgreement, references to a “termination,” “Termination Date,” or like terms shall mean “separation from service.”\nNotwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, if Executive is a “specified employee” within the\nmeaning of Section 409A, any payments or arrangements due upon a termination of Executive’s employment under any\narrangement that constitutes a “nonqualified deferral of compensation” within the\n5\nmeaning of Section 409A and which do not otherwise qualify under the exemptions under Treas. Regs. Section 1.409A-\n1 (including without limitation, the short-term deferral exemption or the permitted payments under Treas. Regs. Section\n1.409A-1(b)(9)(iii)(A)), shall be delayed and paid or provided on the earlier of (a) the date which is six months after\nExecutive’s “separation from service” for any reason other than death, or (b) the date of Executive’s death. This\nAgreement may be amended without requiring Executive’s consent to the extent necessary (including retroactively) by\nthe Company in order to preserve compliance with Section 409A. The preceding shall not be construed as a guarantee\nof any particular tax effect for Executive’s compensation and benefits and the Company does not guarantee that any\ncompensation or benefits provided under this Agreement will satisfy the provisions of Section 409A.\n(c) After any Termination Date, Executive shall have no duties or responsibilities that are inconsistent with having a\n“separation from service” within the meaning of Section 409A as of the Termination Date and, notwithstanding\nanything in the Agreement to the contrary, distributions upon termination of employment of nonqualified deferred\ncompensation may only be made upon a “separation from service” as determined under Section 409A and such date\nshall be the Termination Date for purposes of this Agreement. Each payment under this Agreement or otherwise shall\nbe treated as a separate payment for purposes of Section 409A. In no event may Executive, directly or indirectly,\ndesignate the calendar year of any payment to be made under this Agreement which constitutes a “nonqualified deferral\nof compensation” within the meaning of Section 409A and to the extent an amount is payable within a time period, the\ntime during which such amount is paid shall be in the discretion of the Company.\n(d) All reimbursements and in-kind benefits provided under this Agreement shall be made or provided in accordance with\nthe requirements of Section 409A. To the extent that any reimbursements are taxable to Executive, such\nreimbursements shall be paid to Executive on or before the last day of Executive’s taxable year following the taxable\nyear in which the related expense was incurred. Reimbursements shall not be subject to liquidation or exchange for\nanother benefit and the amount of such reimbursements that Executive receives in one taxable year shall not affect the\namount of such reimbursements that Executive receives in any other taxable year.\n(e) If any payment, benefit, or distribution of any type to or for the benefit of Executive, whether paid or payable, provided\nor to be provided, or distributed or distributable pursuant to the terms of this Agreement or otherwise (collectively, the\n“Parachute Payments”) would (as determined by the Company) subject Executive to the excise tax imposed under\nSection 4999 of the Code (the “Excise Tax”), the Parachute Payments shall be reduced so that the maximum amount of\nthe Parachute Payments (after reduction) shall be one dollar less than the amount which would cause the Parachute\nPayments to be subject to the Excise Tax; provided that the Parachute Payments shall only be reduced to the extent the\nafter-tax value of amounts received by Executive after application of the above reduction would exceed the after-tax\nvalue of the amounts received without application of such reduction. For this purpose, the after-tax value of an amount\nshall be determined taking into account all federal, state, and local income, employment and excise taxes applicable to\nsuch amount. The Company\n6\nshall reduce or eliminate the Parachute Payments by first reducing or eliminating any cash Parachute Payments that do\nnot constitute deferred compensation within the meaning of Section 409A, then by reducing or eliminating any other\nParachute Payments that do not constitute deferred compensation within the meaning of Section 409A, then by\nreducing or eliminating all other Parachute Payments that do constitute deferred compensation within the meaning of\nSection 409A, beginning with those payments last to be paid, subject to and in accordance with all applicable\nrequirements of Section 409A\n7. Clawback. The compensation awarded to the Executive under this Agreement shall be subject, including on a retroactive\nbasis, to clawback, forfeiture or similar requirements (and such requirements shall be deemed incorporated by reference into\nthis Agreement) to the extent required or permitted by applicable law (including, without limitation, Section 304 of the\nSarbanes-Oxley Act and Section 954 of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act); provided that\nsuch requirement is in effect at the relevant time, and/or the rules and regulations of any applicable securities exchange or\ninter-dealer quotation system on which the shares of Company stock may be listed or quoted or if so required pursuant to a\nwritten policy adopted by the Company.\n8. Non-Compete, Non-Solicitation.\n(a) Non-Competition. Beginning on the date hereof and through the date that is 12 months following the Termination Date\n(the “Restricted Period”), Executive shall not, and shall cause Executive’s affiliates not to, directly or indirectly,\nthrough or in association with any third party, in any territory which the Company or any of its subsidiaries operates as\nof the Termination Date: (i) market, sell, or provide any products or services which are the same as or substantially\nsimilar to or otherwise competitive with the products and services sold or provided by the Company or any of its\nsubsidiaries as of the Termination Date; or (ii) own, acquire, or control any interest, financial or otherwise, in a third\nparty or business or manage, participate in, consult with, render services for or otherwise assist, any business, that in\nany case is engaged in selling or providing any products or services which are the same as or substantially similar to or\notherwise competitive with the products and services sold or provided by the Company or any of its subsidiaries as of\nthe Termination Date. However, it shall not be a breach of this section to own one percent or less of the equity of a\npublicly traded company.\n(b) Non-Solicitation. During the Restricted Period, Executive shall not, and shall cause Executive’s affiliates not to,\ndirectly or indirectly, through or in association with any third party: (i) call on, solicit, or service, engage or contract\nwith, or take any action which may interfere with, impair, subvert, disrupt, or negatively alter the relationship,\ncontractual or otherwise, between the Company or any of its subsidiaries and any customer, supplier, distributor,\ndeveloper, service provider, licensor, or licensee or other material business relation of the Company or any of its\nsubsidiaries as of the Termination Date; (ii) divert or take away the business or patronage (with respect to products or\nservices of the kind or type developed, produced, marketed, furnished, or sold by the Company or any of its\nsubsidiaries as of the Termination Date) of any of\n7\nthe clients, customers, or accounts of the Company or any of its subsidiaries as of the Termination Date; or (iii) attempt\nto do any of the foregoing, either for Executive’s own purposes or for any other third party.\n(c) Non-Raiding. During the Restricted Period, Executive shall not, and shall cause Executive’s affiliates not to, directly\nor indirectly, through or in association with any third party: (i) solicit, induce, recruit, or encourage any employees or\nindependent contractors of or consultants to the Company or any of its subsidiaries to terminate their relationship with\nthe Company or any of its subsidiaries or take away or hire such employees, independent contractors, or consultants; or\n(ii) attempt to do any of the foregoing, either for Executive’s own purposes or for any other third party.\n9. Confidential Information.\n(a) Executive acknowledges that: (i) the Confidential Information (as hereinafter defined) is a valuable, special, and unique\nasset of the Company, the unauthorized disclosure or use of which could cause substantial injury and loss of profits and\ngoodwill to the Company; (ii) Executive is in a position of trust and subject to a duty of loyalty to the Company, and\n(iii) by reason of Executive’s employment and service to the Company, Executive will have access to the Confidential\nInformation. Executive, therefore, acknowledges that it is in the Company’s legitimate business interest to restrict\nExecutive’s disclosure or use of Confidential Information for any purpose other than in connection with Executive’s\nperformance of Executive’s duties for the Company, and to limit any potential misappropriation of such Confidential\nInformation by Executive.\n(b) Executive will not disclose or use at any time, either during the Term or thereafter, any Confidential Information of\nwhich Executive is or becomes aware, whether or not such information is developed by Executive, except to the extent\nthat such disclosure or use is directly related to and required by Executive’s performance in good faith of duties\nassigned to Executive by the Company or has been expressly authorized by the Board; provided, however, that this\nsentence shall not be deemed to prohibit Executive from complying with any subpoena, order, judgment, or decree of a\ncourt or governmental or regulatory agency of competent jurisdiction (an “Order”); provided, further, however, that (i)\nExecutive agrees to provide the Company with prompt written notice of any such Order and to assist the Company, at\nthe Company’s expense, in asserting any legal challenges to or appeals of such Order that the Company in its sole\ndiscretion pursues, and (ii) in complying with any such Order, Executive shall limit Executive’s disclosure only to the\nConfidential Information that is expressly required to be disclosed by such Order. Executive will take all appropriate\nsteps to safeguard Confidential Information and to protect it against disclosure, misuse, espionage, loss, and theft.\nExecutive shall deliver to the Company at the Termination Date, or at any time the Company may request, all\nmemoranda, notes, plans, records, reports, electronic information, files and software, and other documents and data\n(and copies thereof) relating to the Confidential Information of the business of the Company which Executive may then\npossess or have under Executive’s control.\n(c) As used in this Agreement, the term “Confidential Information” means information that is not generally known to the\npublic and that is used, developed, or obtained by the\n8\nCompany or any of its subsidiaries in connection with their business, including, but not limited to, information,\nobservations, and data obtained by Executive while employed by the Company or any predecessors thereof (including\nthose obtained prior to the date of this Agreement) concerning (i) the business or affairs of the Company or any of its\nsubsidiaries (or such predecessors), (ii) products or services, (iii) fees, costs and pricing structures, (iv) designs, (v)\nanalyses, (vi) drawings, photographs and reports, (vii) computer software and hardware, including operating systems,\napplications and program listings, (viii) flow charts, manuals and documentation, (ix) databases and data, (x)\naccounting and business methods, (xi) inventions, devices, new developments, methods, and processes, whether\npatentable or unpatentable and whether or not reduced to practice, (xii) customers and clients (and all information with\nrespect to such persons) and customer or client lists, (xiii) suppliers (and all information with respect to such persons)\nor supplier lists, (xiv) other copyrightable works, (xv) all production methods, processes, technology, and trade secrets,\nand (xvi) all similar and related information in whatever form. Confidential Information will not include any\ninformation that has been published in a form generally available to the public prior to the date Executive proposes to\ndisclose or use such information. Confidential Information will not be deemed to have been published merely because\nindividual portions of the information have been separately published, but only if all material features comprising such\ninformation have been published in combination.\n(d) For the avoidance of doubt, this provision in no way limits Executive’s obligations or the Company’s rights under state\nor federal trade secrets statutes. Executive is advised and understands that the federal Defend Trade Secrets Act of\n2016 provides that an individual shall not be held criminally or civilly liable under any federal or state trade secret law\nfor the disclosure of a trade secret that: (i) is made (A) in confidence to a federal, state or local government official,\neither directly or indirectly, or to an attorney; and (B) solely for the purpose of reporting or investigating a suspected\nviolation of law; or (ii) is made in a complaint or other document filed in a lawsuit or other proceeding, if such filing is\nmade under seal.\n10.Intellectual Property.\n(a) Executive hereby assigns and agrees in the future to assign to the Company Executive’s full right, title and interest in\nall Developments (as defined below), including all Intellectual Property Rights (as defined below) associated therewith\nor embodied thereby. In addition, all copyrightable works that Executive has created or creates in the course of or\nrelated to Executive’s employment with the Company shall be considered “work made for hire” and shall be owned\nexclusively by the Company.\n(b) “Developments” means any invention, formula, process, development, design, work of authorship, discovery,\ncomputer program, innovation or improvement made, conceived or first reduced to practice by Executive, solely or\njointly with others, during Executive’s employment with the Company and that was developed using the equipment,\nsupplies, facilities or trade secret information of the Company or any of its subsidiaries or that relates at the time of\nconception or reduction to practice to: (a) the business of the Company or any of its subsidiaries, or (b) any work\nperformed by\n9\nExecutive for the Company or any of its subsidiaries. The term “Intellectual Property Rights” means all patent rights,\ntrademarks, copyrights, trade secret rights, and any other intellectual property or industrial rights in all countries and\nterritories worldwide. Executive acknowledges and agrees that any copyrightable works included in the Developments\nshall be considered “works made for hire” under the Copyright Act (17 U.S.C. §§ 101 et seq.) and that Company will\nbe considered the author and owner of such copyrightable works.\n(c) To the extent that any copyrightable Development is not recognized as a “work made for hire” as a matter of law,\nExecutive hereby assigns to Company any and all copyrights in and to such Development. To the extent any of the\nright, title and interest in and to any Development cannot be assigned by Executive to Company, Executive hereby\ngrants to Company an exclusive, royalty-free, fully paid-up, transferable, irrevocable, perpetual, worldwide license\n(with rights to sublicense through multiple tiers of sublicensees) to practice such non-assignable rights, title and\ninterest. Executive agrees to perform, during and after the Term, all acts deemed necessary or desirable by Company to\npermit and assist Company, at Company’s expense, in obtaining and enforcing the full benefits, enjoyment, rights and\ntitle throughout the world in the Developments assigned or licensed to Company under this Agreement.\n11.Non-Disparagement. Executive agrees that, during the Term and at any time thereafter, Executive will not make, or cause to\nbe made, any statement, observation, or opinion, or communicate any information (whether oral or written), to any person\nother than a member of the Board, that disparages the Company or is likely in any way to harm the business or the reputation\nof the Company, or any of its former, present, or future managers, directors, officers, members, stockholders, or employees.\n12.Enforcement. Because Executive’s services are special, unique, and extraordinary and because Executive has access to\nConfidential Information and Developments, the parties hereto agree that money damages would be an inadequate remedy\nfor any breach of this Agreement. Therefore, in the event of a breach or threatened breach of this Agreement, the Company,\nor any of its successors or assigns may, in addition to other rights and remedies existing in their favor at law or in equity,\napply to any court of competent jurisdiction for specific performance and/or injunctive or other relief in order to enforce, or\nprevent any violations of, the provisions hereof (without posting a bond or other security).\n13.Breach. In addition to the foregoing, and not in any way in limitation thereof, or in limitation of any right or remedy\notherwise available to the Company, if Executive violates any provision of this Agreement, any obligation of the Company to\npay Severance Payments shall be terminated and of no further force or effect, and Executive shall promptly repay to the\nCompany any Severance Payments previously made to Executive, in each case, without limiting or affecting Executive’s\nobligations under this Agreement the Company’s other rights and remedies available at law or equity.\n14.Government Agencies. Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the contrary, nothing in this Agreement limits\nyour right to file a charge with, to participate in a proceeding by, to give testimony to, or to communicate with a court,\nlegislative body, administrative agency, government agency or government official. In addition, nothing in\n10\nthis Agreement limits your right to make truthful statements or disclosures about alleged unlawful discrimination, harassment\nor retaliation.\n15.Assurances by Executive. Executive represents and warrants to the Company that Executive may enter into and fully\nperform all of Executive’s obligations under this Agreement and as an employee of the Company without breaching,\nviolating, or conflicting with (a) any judgment, order, writ, decree, or injunction of any court, arbitrator, government agency,\nor other tribunal that applies to Executive or (b) any agreement, contract, obligation, or understanding to which Executive is a\nparty or may be bound.\n16.Notices. Except as otherwise specifically provided herein, any notice, consent, demand, or other communication to be given\nunder or in connection with this Agreement shall be in writing and shall be deemed duly given when delivered personally,\nwhen transmitted by facsimile transmission, one day after being deposited with Federal Express or other nationally\nrecognized overnight delivery service, or three days after being mailed by first class mail, charges or postage prepaid,\nproperly addressed, if to the Company, at its principal office, and, if to Executive, at Executive’s home or office address.\nEither party may change such address from time to time by notice to the other.\n17.Governing Law; Venue. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed and interpreted in accordance with the laws of\nTexas, without giving effect to any choice of law rules or other conflicting provision or rule that would cause the laws of any\njurisdiction to be applied. Any litigation under this Agreement shall be brought by either of the parties exclusively in the state\nor federal courts located in Texas. As such, the parties irrevocably consent to the jurisdiction of and venue with the courts in\nTexas for all disputes related to this Agreement and irrevocably consent to service via nationally recognized overnight carrier,\nwithout limiting other service methods allowed by applicable law. Each of the parties irrevocably waives any right to a trial\nby jury in any action related to this Agreement. The parties acknowledge and agree that the Company is a Texas entity and\nthat the terms in this Section are material to this Agreement.\n18.Amendments; Waivers. This Agreement may not be modified or amended or terminated except by an instrument in writing,\nsigned by Executive and a duly authorized representative of the Company (other than Executive). By an instrument in writing\nsimilarly executed (and not by any other means), either party may waive compliance by the other party with any provision of\nthis Agreement that such other party was or is obligated to comply with or perform; provided, however, that such waiver shall\nnot operate as a waiver of, or estoppel with respect to, any other or subsequent failure. No failure to exercise and no delay in\nexercising any right, remedy, or power hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise of\nany right, remedy, or power hereunder preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right,\nremedy, or power provided herein or by law or in equity. To be effective, any written waiver must specifically refer to the\ncondition(s) or provision(s) of this Agreement being waived.\n19.Assignment. This Agreement is personal to Executive and without the prior written consent of the Company shall not be\nassignable by Executive. The obligations of Executive hereunder shall be binding upon Executive’s heirs, administrators,\nexecutors, assigns, and\n11\nother legal representatives. This Agreement shall be binding upon and shall inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the\nCompany’s successors and assigns.\n20.Voluntary Execution. Executive acknowledges that (a) Executive has consulted with or has had the opportunity to consult\nwith independent counsel of Executive’s own choosing concerning this Agreement and has been advised to do so by the\nCompany, and (b) Executive has read and understands this Agreement, is competent and of sound mind to execute this\nAgreement, is fully aware of the legal effect of this Agreement, and has entered into it freely based on Executive’s own\njudgment and without duress.\n21.Construction. The language used in this Agreement shall be deemed to be the language chosen by the parties to express their\nmutual intent, and no rule of strict construction shall be applied against any party.\n22.Survivorship. Except as otherwise set forth in this Agreement, the respective rights and obligations of the parties shall\nsurvive any termination of Executive’s employment.\n23.Severability. It is the desire and intent of the parties hereto that the provisions of this Agreement be enforced to the fullest\nextent permissible under the laws and public policies applied in each jurisdiction in which enforcement is sought.\nAccordingly, if any particular provision of this Agreement shall be adjudicated by a court of competent jurisdiction or\narbitrator to be invalid, prohibited, or unenforceable for any reason, such provision, as to such jurisdiction, shall be\nineffective, without invalidating the remaining provisions of this Agreement or affecting the validity or enforceability of such\nprovision in any other jurisdiction. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if such provision could be more narrowly drawn so as not\nto be invalid, prohibited, or unenforceable in such jurisdiction, it shall, as to such jurisdiction, be so narrowly drawn, without\ninvalidating the remaining provisions of this Agreement or affecting the validity or enforceability of such provision in any\nother jurisdiction.\n24.Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in any number of counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original,\nbut all such counterparts shall together constitute one and the same instrument. Signatures delivered by facsimile or PDF\nshall be effective for all purposes.\n25.Entire Agreement; Prior Agreements.

Covered accounting\nrestatements include those that either (a) correct an error in a previously issued financial statement that is material to such previously issued\nfinancial statement or (b) correct an error that is not material to a previously issued financial statement, but would result in a material\nmisstatement if left uncorrected in a current report or the error correction was not recognized in the current period.\nThe Excess to be recouped due to the accounting restatement will be the amount received in excess of the amount that would have\nbeen paid to the Executive absent the restatement, calculated on a pre-tax basis. If the Board or committee thereof cannot determine the\namount of Excess received by the Executive directly from the information in the accounting restatement, then it shall make its determination\nbased on a reasonable estimate of the effect of the accounting restatement.\nThe look-back period will be the three completed fiscal years immediately preceding the earlier of the date on which (a) the Board or\ncommittee thereof concludes or reasonably should have concluded that an accounting restatement is required or (b) a regulator directs a\nrestatement.\nRecoupment in the Event of Fraud or Misconduct\nIf the Board or committee thereof has determined that an Executive has engaged in fraudulent or intentional or negligent misconduct\nthat causes or might reasonably be expected to cause material reputational, financial or other harm to the Company, the Board, in its\ndiscretion, may seek recovery of any Recoverable Compensation received by the current or former employee during the during the three\ncompleted fiscal years immediately preceding the date on which the Board determined that the employee has engaged in such conduct. An\namount is “received” for these purposes in the three fiscal years completed before the date on which the Board makes its determination that\nmisconduct occurred even if the compensation is not actually paid until a later date and even if the compensation is subject to further service-\nbased vesting conditions after such period ends.\nClawback Method\nThe Board or a committee thereof may determine, in its sole discretion, the method for recouping Recoverable Compensation\nreasonably promptly hereunder which may include, without limitation: (a) requiring reimbursement of cash previously paid; (b) seeking\nrecoupment of any gain realized on the vesting, exercise, settlement, sale, transfer, or other disposition of any equity or equity-based awards;\n(c) offsetting the recouped amount from any compensation otherwise owed to the Executive; (d) cancelling outstanding vested or unvested\nequity or equity-based awards; (e) forfeiting any vested non-qualified deferred compensation account balances; and/or (f) taking any other\nremedial and recoupment action permitted by law, as determined by the Board or a committee thereof. The Company may enter into a\ndeferred payment plan with an Executive to effectuate recoupment to avoid unreasonable economic hardship.\nThe Board or a committee thereof shall not be required to seek to recoup covered compensation under this Policy if such recoupment\nwould be impracticable, violate home country laws, and/or involve tax qualified retirement plans, as determined by the Board or committee\nin accordance with the Nasdaq listing standards. Any such determination that recoupment is not required shall be documented by the Board\nor committee."
