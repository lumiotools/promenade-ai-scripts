(Nasdaq: CRDF), a clinical-stage biotechnology company leveraging PLK1 inhibition to develop novel therapies across a range of cancers, today announced the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) has issued to Cardiff Oncology U.S. patent No. 12,144,813 with an expected expiration date of no earlier than 2043. The claims of the patent cover the method of using onvansertib in combination with bevacizumab (bev) for the treatment of KRAS mutated metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) patients who have not previously been treated with bev.\n\n“We are pleased to announce the strengthening of our intellectual property portfolio for onvansertib, an important milestone in our mission to advance this innovative therapy to the first-line setting in combination with standard of care for RAS-mutated mCRC patients,” said Mark Erlander, Ph.D., Chief Executive Officer of Cardiff Oncology. “This newly issued patent underscores the groundbreaking nature of our discovery—demonstrating that onvansertib has the potential to significantly enhance treatment efficacy for KRAS mutated mCRC patients who have not been previously treated with bev.”\n\nOnvansertib, a PLK1 inhibitor, is currently being evaluated in a first-line Phase 2, randomized, open-label trial (CRDF-004) in combination with FOLFIRI and bev or FOLFOX and bev for the treatment of mCRC patients with a RAS mutation, and an initial data readout is expected by the end of 2024.\n\n**About Cardiff Oncology, Inc.**\n\nCardiff Oncology is a clinical-stage biotechnology company leveraging PLK1 inhibition, a well-validated oncology drug target, to develop novel therapies across a range of cancers. The Company's lead asset is onvansertib, a PLK1 inhibitor being evaluated in combination with standard of care (SoC) therapeutics in clinical programs targeting indications such as RAS-mutated metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC), as well as in ongoing and planned investigator-initiated trials in metastatic pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (mPDAC), small cell lung cancer (SCLC) and triple negative breast cancer (TNBC). These programs and the Company's broader development strategy are designed to target tumor vulnerabilities in order to overcome treatment resistance and deliver superior clinical benefit compared to the SoC alone.

(Nasdaq: CRDF), a clinical-stage biotechnology company leveraging PLK1 inhibition to develop novel therapies across a range of cancers, today announced financial results and recent highlights for the third quarter ended September 30, 2024.\n\n“This quarter has been exciting as our Phase 2 clinical trial in second-line KRAS-mutant mCRC was published in one of the most esteemed medical journals in the field of oncology, Journal of Clinical Oncology. Our findings demonstrated that onvansertib combined with FOLFIRI/bev was well-tolerated, and revealed a 7.7x greater clinical benefit in bev naïve patients compared to patients who were previously treated with bev,” said Mark Erlander, Ph.D., Chief Executive Officer of Cardiff Oncology. “We believe the results of our JCO publication validate our ongoing CRDF-004 trial evaluating onvansertib + chemo for the treatment of mCRC in the first-line setting, where all patients are bev naïve. Furthermore, we are pleased with the progress we have made in the trial as we leverage Pfizer’s resources and capabilities, and are grateful for the commitment from the patients and investigators at our trial sites across the U.S. As of today, the trial continues to generate patient data that will allow us to provide an initial data release by the end of the year. Overall, we are optimistic about onvansertib’s potential to become a meaningful treatment option for the 50,000 new patients diagnosed with RAS-mutated mCRC in the U.S. every year who have not had access to any new treatment options in several decades.”\n\n**Upcoming expected milestones**\n\n  * First-line RAS-mutated metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) randomized initial data readout from the CRDF-004 trial expected by end of 2024\n\n\n\n**Company highlights for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 and subsequent weeks include:**\n\n  * **Published clinical data of the combination of onvansertib with FOLFIRI and bev in second-line KRAS mutant mCRC in the peer-reviewed**[** _Journal of Clinical Oncology_**](https://ascopubs.org/doi/10.1200/JCO-24-01266)**, the flagship publication of the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO)**\n    * Phase 2 clinical trial treating patients with KRAS-mutant mCRC (NCT03829410) demonstrated that onvansertib combined with FOLFIRI and bev was well-tolerated, and exhibited clinical activity in the second-line setting.\n    * A post hoc analysis revealed a greater clinical benefit in bev naïve patients, who demonstrated an ORR of 77% and mPFS of 14.9 months compared to an ORR of 10% and mPFS of 6.6 months in those previously exposed to bev.\n  * **Published promising preclinical data demonstrating the combination of onvansertib and alpelisib in PIK3CA-mutated HR-positive breast cancer resistant to palbociclib and endocrine therapy in the peer-reviewed journal,**[**__Cancers__**](https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6694/16/19/3259)\n    * The combination of onvansertib and alpelisib synergistically inhibited cell viability, suppressed PI3K signaling, and induced G2/M arrest and apoptosis in PI3K-activated cell lines. \n    * The combination demonstrated superior anti-tumor activity compared to the single agents in three PDX models.\n    * Pharmacodynamic studies confirmed inhibition of both PLK1 and PI3K activity and pronounced apoptosis in the combination-treated tumors.\n    * The findings support that targeting PLK1 and PI3Kα with onvansertib and alpelisib, respectively, may be a promising strategy for patients with PIK3CA-mutant HR+ breast cancer failing ET + CDK4/6i therapies and warrant clinical evaluation.\n\n\n\n**Third Quarter 2024 Financial Results**\n\n_Liquidity, cash burn, and cash runway_\n\nAs of September 30, 2024, Cardiff Oncology had approximately $57.7 million in cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments.\n\nNet cash used in operating activities for the third quarter of 2024 was approximately $10.5 million, an increase of approximately $2.5 million from $8.0 million for the same period in 2023.\n\nBased on its current expectations and projections, the Company believes its current cash resources are sufficient to fund its operations into Q1 2026.\n\n_Operating results_\n\nTotal operating expenses were approximately $12.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, an increase of $1.8 million from $11.0 million for the same period in 2023. The increase in operating expenses was primarily due to clinical programs and outside service costs related to the development of our lead drug candidate, onvansertib.\n\n**About Cardiff Oncology, Inc.**\n\nCardiff Oncology is a clinical-stage biotechnology company leveraging PLK1 inhibition, a well-validated oncology drug target, to develop novel therapies across a range of cancers.

(Nasdaq: CRDF), a clinical-stage biotechnology company leveraging PLK1 inhibition to develop novel therapies across a range of cancers, today announced the publication of data from our Phase 2 trial evaluating onvansertib in combination with FOLFIRI and bevacizumab (bev) for the second-line treatment of KRAS mutant metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) in the peer-reviewed [_Journal of Clinical Oncology_](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=F9jNnOk8-AmifbbC0KU-uXT1aoaVeKfEm7FGFMYnlvlQonhz638hD-aaeSlwO2prOwZJdEK88xHF0KYwgGBZ4GpJCu1GwTHA3MclttA5g-vSW6R4djLaIxOI7YZDY5n16o5b17yMPjQuaKlVwVY7kQ==), the flagship publication of the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO).\n\n“It is exciting to see novel therapies in development that are well tolerated and demonstrate clinical activity in KRAS mutant mCRC, a cancer indication that has lacked new treatment options for decades,” said Heinz-Josef Lenz, MD, Professor of Medicine, J. Terrence Lanni Chair in Cancer Research, Deputy Cancer Center Director USC Norris Comprehensive Cancer Center, USC Keck School of Medicine and the national principal investigator on this trial. “The 77% objective response rate observed with onvansertib in combination with standard of care in bev-naïve patients is remarkable, and we look forward to determining the impact that onvansertib can make in the first-line setting.”\n\n“We are proud to be recognized by this prestigious oncology journal for our groundbreaking clinical and preclinical findings observed when adding onvansertib to the standard of care for KRAS mutant mCRC,” added Fairooz Kabbinavar, MD, FACP, Chief Medical Officer of Cardiff Oncology. We are highly encouraged by the clinical results demonstrating a 7.7x higher objective response rate (ORR) in patients who were not previously exposed to bev, and our subsequent discovery of a novel mechanism for onvansertib through our translational work. Collectively, these findings and the support of the FDA led us to shift our clinical development program for onvansertib to the first-line setting where all patients are bev-naïve.”\n\nThe results of the published Phase 2 clinical trial treating patients with KRAS-mutant mCRC (NCT03829410) demonstrated that onvansertib combined with FOLFIRI and bev was well-tolerated and revealed a greater clinical benefit in bev-naïve patients (ORR of 77%, mPFS of 14.9 months) compared to bev-exposed patients (ORR of 10%, mPFS of 6.6 months). In addition, the company showed the underpinnings of this clinical finding using preclinical models which demonstrated onvansertib inhibited the hypoxia pathway and exhibited robust antitumor activity in combination with bev through the inhibition of angiogenesis. Based on these findings, Cardiff Oncology initiated CRDF-004, a Phase 2 randomized clinical trial of onvansertib in combination with SoC (FOLFIRI and bev or FOLFOX and bev) for the first-line treatment of patients with RAS mutant mCRC. The company anticipates releasing initial data from the CRDF-004 trial in the second half of 2024.\n\n**About Cardiff Oncology, Inc.**\n\nCardiff Oncology is a clinical-stage biotechnology company leveraging PLK1 inhibition, a well-validated oncology drug target, to develop novel therapies across a range of cancers. The Company's lead asset is onvansertib, a PLK1 inhibitor being evaluated in combination with standard of care (SoC) therapeutics in clinical programs targeting indications such as RAS-mutated metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC), as well as in ongoing and planned investigator-initiated trials in metastatic pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (mPDAC), small cell lung cancer (SCLC) and triple negative breast cancer (TNBC). These programs and the Company's broader development strategy are designed to target tumor vulnerabilities in order to overcome treatment resistance and deliver superior clinical benefit compared to SoC alone.
