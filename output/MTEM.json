(Nasdaq: MTEM, “Molecular Templates,” or “MTEM” or the “Company”), a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on the discovery and development of proprietary targeted biologic therapeutics, known as engineered toxin bodies, to create novel therapies with potent and differentiated mechanisms of action for cancer, announced that it has received an expected deficiency notification letter from the Listing Qualifications Staff of The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC (“Nasdaq”) on November 25, 2024. The notice indicated that MTEM is not in compliance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5250(c)(1) (the “Listing Rule”) as a result of its failure to timely file its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the period ended September 30, 2024 (the “Form 10-Q”), as described more fully in MTEM’s Form 12b-25 Notification of Late Filing (the “Form 12b-25”) filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) on November 15, 2024. The Listing Rule requires Nasdaq-listed companies to timely file all required periodic reports with the SEC. MTEM has until January 24, 2025 to submit a plan of compliance with respect to the notice.\n\nOn November 25, 2024, MTEM also receive a notice with respect to its failure to maintain a $1.00 bid price in accordance with the Nasdaq Rule 5550(a)(2) (the “Minimum Bid Price Requirement”) as the closing price of the Company’s common stock as reported by Nasdaq was less than $1.00 for the preceding 30 business days. In accordance with Nasdaq rules, MTEM has been provided a 180-calendar day compliance period, or until May 26, 2025, to regain compliance with the Minimum Bid Price Requirement. To regain compliance with the Minimum Bid Price Requirement, the closing bid price of the common stock must meet or exceed $1.00 per share for a minimum of 10 consecutive business days during the 180-calendar day compliance period. Pursuant to Nasdaq Listing Rule 5810(c)(3)(A)(iii), if the price of the common stock is less than $0.10 during a compliance period, Nasdaq will issue a delisting determination for the common stock.\n\nAt this time, the Company has not yet determined whether to appeal these notices, submit plans of compliance or to take other action to address these deficiencies. The notices have no immediate effect on the listing or trading of the Company's common stock on the Nasdaq Capital Market.\n\n**About Molecular Templates**\n\nMolecular Templates is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on the discovery and development of next-generation ADCs.

(Nasdaq: MTEM, “Molecular Templates,” or “MTEM”), a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on the discovery and development of proprietary targeted biologic therapeutics, engineered toxin bodies (“ETBs”), to create novel therapies with potent differentiated mechanisms of action, today reported financial results and business updates for the second quarter of 2024.\n\n“ETBs can eliminate immune cells that monoclonal antibodies cannot. Eliminating MDSCs with MT-6402 and Tregs with MT-8421 is a novel approach to immuno-oncology that is demonstrating durable responses in patients who have progressed or were refractory to checkpoint therapy. The elimination of immunosuppressive cells in patients with tumor microenvironments that promote immune evasion may drive long-lasting responses in patients who have exhausted other treatment options,” said Eric Poma, PhD., Chief Executive and Chief Scientific Officer of MTEM. “Similarly, we believe MT-0169 can eliminate CD38+ immune cells that antibodies cannot, allowing for potentially greater potency in both hematologic malignancies and autoimmune diseases.”\n\n**Recent Company Highlights**\n\n  * **_MT-6402: Continued monotherapy activity in patients who progressed or were refractory to checkpoint therapy_** Nine patients (seven evaluable) with low PD-L1+ HNSCC were dosed in the MT-6402 phase I dose escalation study. Two patients remain in partial responses at cycle 23 and cycle 14 (one cycle is 4 weeks). Both patients had progressed after multiple lines of checkpoint therapy. In the high PD-L1+ dose expansion cohort, four NSCLC patients (three evaluable) have been enrolled. and one patient is in a partial response at cycle 11; the patient had progressed on chemotherapy, targeted therapy, and checkpoint therapy. All responding patients were heavily pretreated (3 or more lines of previous therapy including checkpoint) and have been on MT-6402 longer than any other previous therapy. MTEM continues to enroll HNSCC patients with low PD-L1 expression (1-49%) and patients with solid tumors with high PD-L1 expression (≥50%).\n\n\n  * **_MT-8421: Enrollment in Phase 1 dose escalation ongoing with continued observation of unique pharmacodynamic profile (peripheral and TME Treg depletion) and signs of monotherapy activity_** Five melanoma patients were evaluable in the first two dose cohorts (32 and 48 mcg/kg); no drug related adverse events > grade 2 were observed. One patient remains on study in cycle 11 with a 27% decrease in tumor volume and reduction in circulating tumor DNA from 3.13 to 0 MTM/mL. This patient had a >90% reduction in peripheral Tregs and a ~66% reduction of Tregs in the TME. The patient had progressed on pembrolizumab in the adjuvant setting and then progressed on ipilimumab (4 doses at 3mg/kg) and nivolumab in the metastatic setting.\n\n\n  * **_MT-0169: Potential in severe autoimmune diseases being explored based on clinical demonstration of complete elimination of CD38+ immune cells at dose levels with no drug-related adverse events > grade 2._** The potent and unique mechanism of action of MT-0169 is not subject to resistance mechanisms associated with monoclonal antibodies like trogocytosis and can eliminate high-expressing CD38 immune cells like plasma cells as well as low-expressing CD38+ cells like HLA-DR CD38+ T-cells. This mechanism of action does not require conditioning therapy. MTEM will continue to develop MT-0169 in hematologic malignancies and is evaluating the potential of MT-0169 in severe immune-mediated diseases. \n\n\n\n**Upcoming Milestones for 2H 2024**\n\n  * Additional updates from the MT-6402 low PD-L1+ HNSCC and high PD-L1+ solid tumor expansions studies in 3Q24.\n  * Additional updates from the MT-8421 dose escalation study in 3Q24.\n  * MT-0169 Phase 1 study initiation in CD38+ hematological malignancies and continued evaluation in autoimmune disease. \n\n\n\n**Upcoming Conferences**\n\nMTEM will participate at the H.C. Wainwright 26th Annual Global Investment Conference taking place at the New York Lotte Palace Hotel, September 9 – 11, 2024. An on-demand presentation will be accessible virtually starting 7:00am ET September 9, 2024 via MTEM corporate website. One-on-one meetings may be scheduled by directly contacting MTEM.\n\n**Second Quarter 2024 Financial Results**\n\nThe net loss attributable to common shareholders for the second quarter of 2024 was $8.1 million, or $1.23 per basic and diluted share. This compares with a net loss attributable to common shareholders of $10.9 million, or $2.89 per basic and diluted share, for the same period in 2023.\n\nRevenues for the second quarter of 2024 were $0.6 million, compared to $6.9 million for the same period in 2023.\n\nTotal research and development expenses for the second quarter of 2024 were $5.4 million, compared with $13.4 million for the same period in 2023. Total general and administrative expenses for the second quarter of 2024 were $3.5 million, compared with $5.2 million for the same period in 2023.\n\nAs of June 30, 2024, MTEM’s cash and cash equivalents totaled $9.7 million. The Company expects that its cash and cash equivalents for the quarter ended June 30, 2024 will support its ongoing operations into the fourth quarter of 2024.\n\n**Molecular Templates, Inc.****CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS****(in thousands, except share and per share data)****(unaudited)**  \n---  \n**Three Months Ended****June 30,** |  **Six Months Ended****June 30,**  \n**2024** |  **2023** |  **2024** |  **2023**  \nResearch and development revenue | $ | 189 | $ | 6,627 | $ | 11,113 | $ | 40,254  \nGrant revenue | 383 | 238 | 545 | 3,240  \nTotal revenue | 572 | 6,865 | 11,658 | 43,494  \nOperating expenses:  \nResearch and development | 5,402 | 13,413 | 12,807 | 32,455  \nGeneral and administrative | 3,466 | 5,195 | 7,197 | 10,997  \nTotal operating expenses | 8,868 | 18,608 | 20,004 | 43,452  \nIncome/(loss) from operations | (8,296 | ) | (11,743 | ) | (8,346 | ) | 42  \nInterest and other income, net | 130 | 365 | 239 | 820  \nInterest and other expense, net | (38 | ) | (1,189 | ) | (69 | ) | (2,584 | )  \nGain on extinguishment of debt | — | 1,795 | — | 1,795  \nChange in valuation of contingent value right | 107 | 303 | 651 | 303  \nLoss on disposal of property and equipment | — | (399 | ) | — | (399 | )  \nNet loss attributable to common stockholders | $ | (8,097 | ) | $ | (10,868 | ) | $ | (7,525 | ) | $ | (23 | )  \nNet loss per share attributable to common stockholders:  \nBasic and diluted | $ | (1.23 | ) | $ | (2.89 | ) | $ | (1.26 | ) | $ | (0.01 | )  \nWeighted average number of shares used in net loss per share calculations:  \nBasic and diluted | 6,557,295 | 3,756,711 | 5,965,781 | 3,756,711  \n**Molecular Templates, Inc.****CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS****(in thousands, except share and per share data)**  \n---  \n**June 30,****2024(unaudited)** |  **December 31,****2023**  \nASSETS  \nCurrent assets:  \nCash and cash equivalents | $ | 9,657 | $ | 11,523  \nPrepaid expenses | 787 | 2,195  \nGrants revenue receivable | 795 | 250  \nOther current assets | 777 | 2,804  \nTotal current assets | 12,016 | 16,772  \nOperating lease right-of-use assets | 8,124 | 9,161  \nProperty and equipment, net | 5,238 | 7,393  \nOther assets | 1,319 | 2,057  \nTotal assets | $ | 26,697 | $ | 35,383  \nLIABILITIES AND STOCKHOLDERS’ EQUITY  \nCurrent liabilities:  \nAccounts payable | $ | 2,773 | $ | 1,523  \nAccrued liabilities | 2,270 | 4,279  \nDeferred revenue, current | — | 9,031  \nOther current liabilities | 2,637 | 2,488  \nTotal current liabilities | 7,680 | 17,321  \nOperating lease liabilities, long term portion | 8,390 | 9,742  \nContingent value right liability | 2,051 | 2,702  \nOther liabilities | 1,465 | 1,406  \nTotal liabilities | 19,586 | 31,171  \nCommitments and contingencies  \nStockholders’ equity  \nPreferred stock, $0.001 par value per share:  \nAuthorized: 2,000,000 shares as of June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023; Issued and outstanding: 250 shares as of June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 | — | —  \nCommon stock, $0.001 par value per share:  \nAuthorized: 150,000,000 shares as of June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023; Issued and outstanding: 6,583,880 and 5,374,268 shares as of June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively | 7 | 5  \nAdditional paid-in capital | 467,521 | 457,099  \nAccumulated deficit | (460,417 | ) | (452,892 | )  \nTotal stockholders’ equity | 7,111 | 4,212  \nTotal liabilities and stockholders’ equity | $ | 26,697 | $ | 35,383  \n  \n**_Second tranche of July 2023 Private Placement_**\n\nWe closed the second tranche of the July 2023 Private Placement on April 2, 2024 with gross proceeds of approximately $9.5M.

(Nasdaq: MTEM, “Molecular Templates,” or “MTEM”), a clinical-stage company focused on the discovery and development of targeted biologic therapeutics with unique mechanisms of action (engineered toxin bodies or “ETBs”) for cancer and immune-mediated disease, today provided an update on its clinical-stage programs.\n\nEric Poma, PhD., Chief Executive and Chief Scientific Officer of MTEM, stated, “ETBs are a potentially powerful therapeutic approach to selectively depleting immunosuppressive cells in oncology or eliminating self-reacting immune cells in severe immune-mediated diseases. The monotherapy activity we see with MT-6402 in relapsed/refractory solid tumor patients, and the clinical and _ex vivo_ depletion of CD38+ immune cells seen with MT-0169 at well-tolerated doses underscore the potential of this platform across multiple diseases.”\n\n**Company Pipeline Highlights**\n\n**MT-6402 (PD-L1-targeting ETB)**\n\n  * **Promising Single-Agent Activity** : MT-6402 has shown monotherapy activity in heavily pre-treated patients who had previously progressed or were refractory to immuno-oncology therapy.\n  * **Head and Neck Cancer Responses** : MTEM had previously reported that nine patients (seven evaluable) with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (“HNSCC”) had been treated in the Phase 1 dose escalation. Two heavily pre-treated patients with low PD-L1 expressing squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (HNSCC) had achieved partial responses with MT-6402 monotherapy. These patients remain in response and in good clinical condition, continuing treatment in cycles 21 and 12 (one cycle = 4 weeks), respectively. In addition, four of the HNSCC patients treated with MT-6402 had stable disease with two showing tumor reduction. All patients with tumor responses or tumor reduction had low PD-L1 expression (≤20% CPS).\n  * **New Lung Cancer Response** : An unconfirmed partial response was observed in a non-small cell lung cancer (“NSCLC”) patient with high PD-L1 expression in the Phase 1b monotherapy dose expansion study in solid tumor patients with high PD-L1 tumor expression (TPS≥50%). The patient achieved a partial response at the end of cycle 8 following sustained tumor reduction in prior assessments. A PET scan in cycle 8 showed no indications of active metastatic disease. This patient had previously progressed on chemotherapy, targeted therapy, and checkpoint therapy, including progression within six months on pembrolizumab + ramucirumab, before enrolling in the study. Three other NSCLC patients with high PD-L1 expression have been dosed in the Phase 1b expansion study. Two of these patients had progressive disease and one passed away from COVID and was not evaluable.\n  * **Favorable Safety Profile** : To date, MT-6402 appears to be generally well-tolerated, with no drug-related adverse events exceeding grade 3.\n  * **Ongoing Enrollment** : MTEM continues to enroll HNSCC patients with low PD-L1 expression (1-49%) and patients with solid tumors with high PD-L1 expression (≥50%). \n\n\n\n**MT-0169 (CD38-targeting ETB)**\n\n  * **Clinical proof-of-concept supports the elimination of CD38+ cells in immune-mediated disease.** Recent clinical data with CD38 antibodies have demonstrated the therapeutic potential of CD38+ immune cell clearance in several immune-mediated diseases. Despite these promising early data, a more potent mechanism of CD38+ immune cell depletion may provide greater clinical benefit.\n  * **Potent and unique mechanism of action.** MT-0169 is designed to destroy CD38+ tumor or immune cells through internalization of CD38 and cell destruction via a novel mechanism of action (enzymatic ribosomal destruction and ER stress). In _ex vivo_ cell kill assays, MT-0169 shows potency against plasma cells with IC50 activity in the picomolar or femtomolar range. Plasma cells are exceptionally sensitive to ER stress, making them uniquely susceptible to the MT-0169 mechanism of action. MT-0169 also shows potent activity against T-cells that express low levels of CD38. HLA-DR CD38+ T-cells have been implicated in many immune-mediated diseases.\n  * **Overcoming antibody resistance.** The unique mechanism of action of MT-0169 and its lack of an Fc domain may avoid resistance mechanisms seen with CD38 antibodies like receptor downregulation or trogocytosis while allowing for combination approaches with FcRn-targeting therapies.\n  * **Clinical proof-of-concept with MT-0169.** MTEM’s Phase 1 study in patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma dosed at 5, 10, or 15 mcg/kg showed potent depletion of CD38+ immune cells with no drug-related adverse events of grade 3 or higher noted in these patients.\n  * **Planned clinical development with MT-0169.** MTEM will continue to develop MT-0169 in hematology and is evaluating the potential of MT-0169 in severe immune-mediated diseases. \n\n\n\n**MT-8421 (CTLA-4 ETB)**\n\n  * **Tumor microenvironment dismantling.** MT-8421 is designed to potently destroy CTLA4+ Tregs, alleviating immunosuppression in the tumor microenvironment.\n  * **Pharmacodynamic effects observed early Phase 1 dose escalation.** Three patients were dosed in the first cohort of the Phase 1 study at 32 mcg/kg. No drug-related adverse events of grade 3 or higher were observed. One patient had disease progression at the end of cycle 2. Two patients have stable disease and remain on study at cycle 8 and cycle 7, respectively (one cycle = four weeks). The two patients in stable disease showed peripheral depletion of Tregs and significant elevations in IL-2 while on therapy. One of the patients has a notable decrease in ctDNA.\n  * **Dose escalation continues.** Enrollment is on-going in the second cohort of 48 mcg/kg for the Phase 1 study of MT-8421. \n\n\n\n**About Molecular Templates**\n\nMolecular Templates is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on the discovery and development of targeted biologic therapeutics.

(Nasdaq: MTEM, “Molecular Templates,” or “MTEM”), a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on the discovery and development of proprietary targeted biologic therapeutics, engineered toxin bodies (“ETBs”), to create novel therapies with potent differentiated mechanisms of action, today reported financial results and business updates for the second quarter of 2024.\n\n“ETBs can eliminate immune cells that monoclonal antibodies cannot. Eliminating MDSCs with MT-6402 and Tregs with MT-8421 is a novel approach to immuno-oncology that is demonstrating durable responses in patients who have progressed or were refractory to checkpoint therapy.

Two patients remain in partial responses at cycle 23 and cycle 14 (one cycle is 4 weeks). Both patients had progressed after multiple lines of checkpoint therapy. In the high PD-L1+ dose expansion cohort, four NSCLC patients (three evaluable) have been enrolled. and one patient is in a partial response at cycle 11; the patient had progressed on chemotherapy, targeted therapy, and checkpoint therapy. All responding patients were heavily pretreated (3 or more lines of previous therapy including checkpoint) and have been on MT-6402 longer than any other previous therapy.

One patient remains on study in cycle 11 with a 27% decrease in tumor volume and reduction in circulating tumor DNA from 3.13 to 0 MTM/mL. This patient had a >90% reduction in peripheral Tregs and a ~66% reduction of Tregs in the TME.
