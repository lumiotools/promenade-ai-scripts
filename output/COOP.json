We are excited to welcome our new team members, with the acquisition of Flagstar’s mortgage operations on\ntarget to close, as announced, in the fourth quarter.”\nMike Weinbach, President added, “I’m extremely pleased with our strong performance in servicing and exceptional execution in\noriginations, where volumes increased 80% quarter-over-quarter, as our direct-to-consumer channel helped customers take\nadvantage of the rally in mortgage rates during September, while our correspondent channel implemented a number of new\ninitiatives which were well-received by clients.”\n1\nServicing\nThe Servicing segment provides a best-in-class home loan experience for our 5.4 million customers while simultaneously\nstrengthening asset performance for investors.

Eastern Time. Preregistration for the call is now\navailable in the Investor section of www.mrcoopergroup.com. Participants will receive a toll-free dial-in number and a unique\nregistrant ID to be used for immediate call access. A simultaneous audio webcast of the conference call will be available under\nthe investors section on www.mrcoopergroup.com.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nThe Company utilizes non-GAAP financial measures as the measures provide additional information to assist investors in\nunderstanding and assessing the Company’s and our business segments’ ongoing performance and financial results, as well as\nassessing our prospects for future performance. The adjusted operating financial measures facilitate a meaningful analysis and\nallow more accurate comparisons of our ongoing business operations because they exclude items that may not be indicative of or\nare unrelated to the Company’s and our business segments’ core operating performance, and are better measures for assessing\ntrends in our underlying businesses. These notable items are consistent with how management views our businesses. Management\nuses these non-GAAP financial measures in making financial, operational and planning decisions and evaluating the Company’s\nand our business segment’s ongoing performance. Pretax operating income (loss) in the servicing segment eliminates the effects\nof mark-to-market adjustments which primarily reflects unrealized gains or losses based on the changes in fair value\nmeasurements of MSRs and their related financing liabilities for which a fair value accounting election was made. These\nadjustments, which can be highly volatile and material due to changes in credit markets, are not necessarily reflective of the gains\nand losses that will ultimately be realized by the Company. Pretax operating income (loss) in each segment also eliminates, as\napplicable, transition and integration costs, gains (losses) on sales of fixed assets, certain settlement costs that are not considered\nnormal operational matters, intangible amortization, change in equity method investments, fair value change in equity investments\nand other adjustments based on the facts and circumstances that would provide investors a supplemental means for evaluating\nthe Company’s core operating performance. Return on tangible common equity (ROTCE) is computed by dividing net income\n3\nby average tangible common equity (also known as tangible book value). Tangible common equity equals total stockholders’\nequity less goodwill and intangible assets. Management believes that ROTCE is a useful financial measure because it measures\nthe performance of a business consistently and enables investors and others to assess the Company’s use of equity. Tangible book\nvalue is defined as stockholders’ equity less goodwill and intangible assets. Our management believes tangible book value is\nuseful to investors because it provides a more accurate measure of the realizable value of shareholder returns, excluding the\nimpact of goodwill and intangible assets.\nForward Looking Statements\nAny statements in this release that are not historical or current facts are forward looking statements.

Tangible common equity equals total stockholders’ equity less goodwill and intangible assets. The methodology of determining tangible common equity may differ among companies. Management\nbelieves that ROTCE and operational ROTCE are useful financial measures because they measure the performance of a business consistently and enables investors and others to assess the

The adjusted operating financial measures facilitate a meaningful analysis and allow more accurate comparisons of our ongoing business operations because they exclude items that may not be indicative of or are unrelated to the Company’s and our business segments’ core operating performance, and are better measures for assessing trends in our underlying businesses. These notable items are consistent with how management views our businesses. Management uses these non-GAAP financial measures in making financial, operational and planning decisions and evaluating the Company’s and our business segment’s ongoing performance. Pretax operating income (loss) in the servicing segment eliminates the effects of mark-to-market adjustments which primarily reflects unrealized gains or losses based on the changes in fair value measurements of MSRs and their related financing liabilities for which a fair value accounting election was made. These adjustments, which can be highly volatile and material due to changes in credit markets, are not necessarily reflective of the gains and losses that will ultimately be realized by the Company. Pretax operating income (loss) in each segment also eliminates, as applicable, transition and integration costs, gains (losses) on sales of fixed assets, certain settlement costs that are not considered normal operational matters, intangible amortization, change in equity method investments, fair value change in equity investments and other adjustments based on the facts and circumstances that would provide investors a supplemental means for evaluating the Company’s core operating performance. Return on tangible common equity (ROTCE) is computed by dividing net income by average tangible common equity (also known as tangible book value). Tangible common equity equals total stockholders’ equity less goodwill and intangible assets. Management believes that ROTCE is a useful financial measure because it measures the performance of a business consistently and enables investors and others to assess the Company’s use of equity. Tangible book value is defined as stockholders’ equity less goodwill and intangible assets. Our management believes tangible book value is useful to investors because it provides a more accurate measure of the realizable value of shareholder returns, excluding the impact of goodwill and intangible assets. \n\n** Forward Looking Statements **\n\nAny statements in this release that are not historical or current facts are forward looking statements.
