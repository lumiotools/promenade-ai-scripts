Pursuant to the SPA, ReShape agreed to issue the investor a senior secured convertible note in the aggregate original principal amount of $833,333.34, and also issue to the investor 7,983 shares of ReShape common stock.\n  * September: Effected a 1-for-58 reverse stock split of the company’s common stock, which was effective for trading purposes upon the commencement of trading on September 23, 2024.\n  * July 2024: Entered into a definitive merger agreement with Vyome Therapeutics, Inc., a private clinical-stage company targeting immuno-inflammatory and rare diseases, under which ReShape and Vyome will combine in an all-stock transaction. Under the terms of the merger agreement, which has been unanimously approved by the boards of directors of both companies, existing ReShape stockholders will own approximately 11.1% of the combined company immediately following the closing of the merger, subject to adjustment based on ReShape’s actual net cash at closing compared to a target, net cash amount of $5 million.Simultaneously with the execution of the merger agreement, ReShape entered into an asset purchase agreement with Biorad Medisys, Pvt. Ltd., which is party to a previously disclosed exclusive license agreement with ReShape for ReShape’s Obalon® Gastric Balloon System. Pursuant to the asset purchase agreement, ReShape will sell substantially all of its assets to Biorad (or an affiliate thereof), including ReShape’s Lap-Band® System, Obalon® Gastric Balloon System and the Diabetes Bloc-Stim Neuromodulation™ (DBSN™) System (but excluding cash), and Biorad will assume substantially all of ReShape’s liabilities, for a purchase price of $5.16 million in cash, subject to adjustment based on ReShape’s actual accounts receivable and accounts payable at the closing compared to such amounts as of March 31, 2024. The cash purchase price under the asset purchase agreement will count toward ReShape’s net cash for purposes of determining the post-merger ownership allocation between ReShape and Vyome stockholders under the merger agreement.\n\n\n\n“During the third quarter, our revenues continued to rebound, increasing 16.6% over the second quarter, representing the third sequential quarter of growth, and we continued to execute on our 2024 cost reduction plan, leading to approximately 41% lower operating expenses for the first nine months of the year, compared to last year. This, in turn, has increased our gross profit margin to over 60%,” stated Paul F. Hickey, President and Chief Executive Officer of ReShape Lifesciences®. “Notably, just this week, we received Health Canada approval for the next generation Lap-Band® 2.0 FLEX, as well as a $241,000 supplementary grant from the NIH for our DBSN™ device, representing two important milestones for our weight loss and metabolic health products.\n\n“As previously reported, in July, we coordinated a merger agreement with Vyome Therapeutics and a concurrent asset purchase agreement with Biorad, successfully maximizing value for our stockholders. This resulted from the exclusive engagement of Maxim Group LLC last December to initiate a high-priority search for synergistic merger and acquisition opportunities. After thoroughly evaluating various strategic options and discussing a variety of potential mergers and acquisitions, our board unanimously recommended merging with Vyome and concurrently selling assets to Biorad. We believe this merger will unlock significant value for our shareholders in the newly combined entity. Furthermore, we are grateful to our Series C preferred stockholders for lowering their liquidation preference, allowing our common stockholders to benefit from the merger's potential. It is worth noting that, in October, we regained compliance with Nasdaq after effecting a 1-for-58 reverse stock split in September, which was a critical component for the merger with Vyome. I remain very excited about the shareholder value and growth potential resulting from these transactions.”\n\n**Third Quarter and Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024, Financial and Operating Results**\n\n**Revenue** totaled $2.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, which represents an increase of 6.4%, compared to the same period in 2023, and an increase of 16.6% as compared to the second quarter of 2024. This stabilization in revenue resulted from highly focused DTC marketing efforts amidst the continued pressure due to GLP-1 pharmaceutical weight-loss alternatives.\n\nRevenue totaled $6.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, which represents a contraction of 7.4%, or $0.5 million compared to the same period in 2023. This primarily resulted from a decrease in sales volume, primarily due to GLP-1 pharmaceutical weight-loss alternatives.\n\n**Gross Profit** for the three months ended September 30, 2024, was $1.4 million, which was slightly above $1.3 million for the same period in 2023. Gross profit as a percentage of total revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2024, was 62.8% compared to 59.8% for the same period in 2023. Gross profit for both the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, was $3.7 million, respectively. Gross profit as a percentage of total revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, was 60.3% compared to 55.3% for the same period in 2023. The increase in gross profit percentage is due to the reduction in overhead related costs, primarily payroll, as the Company had a reduction of employees late in 2023.\n\n**Sales and Marketing Expenses** for the three months ended September 30, 2024, decreased by $1.1 million, or 59.9%, to $0.7 million, compared to $1.8 million for the same period in 2023. Sales and marketing expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, decreased by $3.7 million, or 60.8%, to $2.4 million, compared to $6.2 million for the same period in 2023. The decrease is primarily due to a decrease in advertising and marketing expenses, including consulting and professional marketing services, as the Company has reevaluated its marketing approach and has moved to a targeted digital marketing campaign, resulting in a reduction of costs. Additionally, there was a decrease in payroll-related expenditures, including commissions, stock compensation expense and travel, due to changes in sales personnel and a reduction in sales, and a reduction of in other expenses.\n\n**General and Administrative Expenses** for the three months ended September 30, 2024, increased by $24 thousand, or 1.2%, to approximately $2.1 million, compared to $2.1 million for the same period in 2023. The increase is primarily due to a $0.4 million increase professional services primarily related to the merger and asset purchase transaction that was entered into during July 2024, offset by a $0.2 million reduction in employee related expenses, a $0.1 million in bad debt expense and $0.1 million in other expenses.\n\nGeneral and administrative expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, decreased by $2.7 million, or 30.4%, to $6.1 million, compared to $8.7 million for the same period in 2023. The decrease is primarily due to a reduction in professional services, such as audit and legal fees of $1.1 million, primarily due to the Company incurring one-time adjustments for professional services related to the February 2023 public offering, and a reduction in payroll-related expenditures, including stock-based compensation expense, of $1.0 million due to decline in staffing levels, and a reduction in rent expense of $0.1 million, as the Company moved its headquarters at the end of the second quarter of 2023 to a smaller facility to reduce costs. Additionally, there was a reduction in bad debt expense of $0.4 million, and a reduction in other miscellaneous expenses of $0.1 million.\n\n**Research and Development Expenses** for the three months ended September 30, 2024, decreased by $0.1 million, or 26.4% to $0.4 million, compared to $0.5 million for the same period in the prior year. Research and development expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, decreased by $0.3 million, or 18.7% to $1.3 million, compared to approximately $1.6 million for the same period in the prior year. The primary reason for the decrease is a reduction in payroll and consulting services.\n\n**Cash and Cash Equivalents** As of September 30, 2024, the Company had net working capital of approximately $1.3 million, primarily due to cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash of $0.8 million.\n\nA full discussion of the Company’s financials is available in our Third Quarter 2024 Form 10-Q Report, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.\n\n**Conference Call Information**\n\nManagement will host a conference call to discuss ReShape’s financial and operational results on Thursday, November 14 at 4:30 pm ET.

Hickey, President and Chief Executive Officer of ReShape Lifesciences. “As a reminder, the enhanced Lap-Band® 2.0 FLEX was designed with physician feedback with the goal of improving the patient experience. Like the current Lap-Band, Lap-Band® 2.0 FLEX can be adjusted postoperatively to increase or decrease the band opening, thus optimizing eating habits and comfort. Additionally, Lap-Band® 2.0 FLEX has a new feature called Flex technology, which acts as a relief valve, enabling larger pieces of food to pass through the narrowed passage more easily. Specifically, the band momentarily relaxes before returning to its resting diameter, while minimizing discomfort caused by swallowing large food pieces. Recently, we have successfully completed the limited market release of the Lap-Band® 2.0 FLEX in the U.S., and initial surgeon feedback has been overwhelmingly positive, we are analyzing data and metrics that will be used to support our U.S. commercial launch. Additionally, we now look forward to launching the product in Canada in the near future.”\n\n**About ReShape Lifesciences® **ReShape Lifesciences® is America’s premier weight loss and metabolic health-solutions company, offering an integrated portfolio of proven products and services that manage and treat obesity and metabolic disease.

Pursuant to the SPA, ReShape agreed to issue the investor a senior secured convertible note in the aggregate original principal amount of $833,333.34, and also issue to the investor 7,983 shares of ReShape common stock.\n  * September: Effected a 1-for-58 reverse stock split of the company’s common stock, which was effective for trading purposes upon the commencement of trading on September 23, 2024.\n  * July 2024: Entered into a definitive merger agreement with Vyome Therapeutics, Inc., a private clinical-stage company targeting immuno-inflammatory and rare diseases, under which ReShape and Vyome will combine in an all-stock transaction. Under the terms of the merger agreement, which has been unanimously approved by the boards of directors of both companies, existing ReShape stockholders will own approximately 11.1% of the combined company immediately following the closing of the merger, subject to adjustment based on ReShape’s actual net cash at closing compared to a target, net cash amount of $5 million.Simultaneously with the execution of the merger agreement, ReShape entered into an asset purchase agreement with Biorad Medisys, Pvt. Ltd., which is party to a previously disclosed exclusive license agreement with ReShape for ReShape’s Obalon® Gastric Balloon System. Pursuant to the asset purchase agreement, ReShape will sell substantially all of its assets to Biorad (or an affiliate thereof), including ReShape’s Lap-Band® System, Obalon® Gastric Balloon System and the Diabetes Bloc-Stim Neuromodulation™ (DBSN™) System (but excluding cash), and Biorad will assume substantially all of ReShape’s liabilities, for a purchase price of $5.16 million in cash, subject to adjustment based on ReShape’s actual accounts receivable and accounts payable at the closing compared to such amounts as of March 31, 2024. The cash purchase price under the asset purchase agreement will count toward ReShape’s net cash for purposes of determining the post-merger ownership allocation between ReShape and Vyome stockholders under the merger agreement.\n\n\n\n“During the third quarter, our revenues continued to rebound, increasing 16.6% over the second quarter, representing the third sequential quarter of growth, and we continued to execute on our 2024 cost reduction plan, leading to approximately 41% lower operating expenses for the first nine months of the year, compared to last year. This, in turn, has increased our gross profit margin to over 60%,” stated Paul F. Hickey, President and Chief Executive Officer of ReShape Lifesciences®. “Notably, just this week, we received Health Canada approval for the next generation Lap-Band® 2.0 FLEX, as well as a $241,000 supplementary grant from the NIH for our DBSN™ device, representing two important milestones for our weight loss and metabolic health products.\n\n“As previously reported, in July, we coordinated a merger agreement with Vyome Therapeutics and a concurrent asset purchase agreement with Biorad, successfully maximizing value for our stockholders. This resulted from the exclusive engagement of Maxim Group LLC last December to initiate a high-priority search for synergistic merger and acquisition opportunities. After thoroughly evaluating various strategic options and discussing a variety of potential mergers and acquisitions, our board unanimously recommended merging with Vyome and concurrently selling assets to Biorad. We believe this merger will unlock significant value for our shareholders in the newly combined entity. Furthermore, we are grateful to our Series C preferred stockholders for lowering their liquidation preference, allowing our common stockholders to benefit from the merger's potential. It is worth noting that, in October, we regained compliance with Nasdaq after effecting a 1-for-58 reverse stock split in September, which was a critical component for the merger with Vyome. I remain very excited about the shareholder value and growth potential resulting from these transactions.”\n\n**Third Quarter and Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024, Financial and Operating Results**\n\n**Revenue** totaled $2.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, which represents an increase of 6.4%, compared to the same period in 2023, and an increase of 16.6% as compared to the second quarter of 2024. This stabilization in revenue resulted from highly focused DTC marketing efforts amidst the continued pressure due to GLP-1 pharmaceutical weight-loss alternatives.\n\nRevenue totaled $6.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, which represents a contraction of 7.4%, or $0.5 million compared to the same period in 2023. This primarily resulted from a decrease in sales volume, primarily due to GLP-1 pharmaceutical weight-loss alternatives.\n\n**Gross Profit** for the three months ended September 30, 2024, was $1.4 million, which was slightly above $1.3 million for the same period in 2023. Gross profit as a percentage of total revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2024, was 62.8% compared to 59.8% for the same period in 2023. Gross profit for both the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, was $3.7 million, respectively. Gross profit as a percentage of total revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, was 60.3% compared to 55.3% for the same period in 2023. The increase in gross profit percentage is due to the reduction in overhead related costs, primarily payroll, as the Company had a reduction of employees late in 2023.\n\n**Sales and Marketing Expenses** for the three months ended September 30, 2024, decreased by $1.1 million, or 59.9%, to $0.7 million, compared to $1.8 million for the same period in 2023. Sales and marketing expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, decreased by $3.7 million, or 60.8%, to $2.4 million, compared to $6.2 million for the same period in 2023. The decrease is primarily due to a decrease in advertising and marketing expenses, including consulting and professional marketing services, as the Company has reevaluated its marketing approach and has moved to a targeted digital marketing campaign, resulting in a reduction of costs. Additionally, there was a decrease in payroll-related expenditures, including commissions, stock compensation expense and travel, due to changes in sales personnel and a reduction in sales, and a reduction of in other expenses.\n\n**General and Administrative Expenses** for the three months ended September 30, 2024, increased by $24 thousand, or 1.2%, to approximately $2.1 million, compared to $2.1 million for the same period in 2023. The increase is primarily due to a $0.4 million increase professional services primarily related to the merger and asset purchase transaction that was entered into during July 2024, offset by a $0.2 million reduction in employee related expenses, a $0.1 million in bad debt expense and $0.1 million in other expenses.\n\nGeneral and administrative expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, decreased by $2.7 million, or 30.4%, to $6.1 million, compared to $8.7 million for the same period in 2023. The decrease is primarily due to a reduction in professional services, such as audit and legal fees of $1.1 million, primarily due to the Company incurring one-time adjustments for professional services related to the February 2023 public offering, and a reduction in payroll-related expenditures, including stock-based compensation expense, of $1.0 million due to decline in staffing levels, and a reduction in rent expense of $0.1 million, as the Company moved its headquarters at the end of the second quarter of 2023 to a smaller facility to reduce costs. Additionally, there was a reduction in bad debt expense of $0.4 million, and a reduction in other miscellaneous expenses of $0.1 million.\n\n**Research and Development Expenses** for the three months ended September 30, 2024, decreased by $0.1 million, or 26.4% to $0.4 million, compared to $0.5 million for the same period in the prior year. Research and development expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, decreased by $0.3 million, or 18.7% to $1.3 million, compared to approximately $1.6 million for the same period in the prior year. The primary reason for the decrease is a reduction in payroll and consulting services.\n\n**Cash and Cash Equivalents** As of September 30, 2024, the Company had net working capital of approximately $1.3 million, primarily due to cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash of $0.8 million.\n\nA full discussion of the Company’s financials is available in our Third Quarter 2024 Form 10-Q Report, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.\n\n**Conference Call Information**\n\nManagement will host a conference call to discuss ReShape’s financial and operational results on Thursday, November 14 at 4:30 pm ET.

Hickey, President and Chief Executive Officer of ReShape Lifesciences. “As a reminder, the enhanced Lap-Band® 2.0 FLEX was designed with physician feedback with the goal of improving the patient experience. Like the current Lap-Band, Lap-Band® 2.0 FLEX can be adjusted postoperatively to increase or decrease the band opening, thus optimizing eating habits and comfort. Additionally, Lap-Band® 2.0 FLEX has a new feature called Flex technology, which acts as a relief valve, enabling larger pieces of food to pass through the narrowed passage more easily. Specifically, the band momentarily relaxes before returning to its resting diameter, while minimizing discomfort caused by swallowing large food pieces. Recently, we have successfully completed the limited market release of the Lap-Band® 2.0 FLEX in the U.S., and initial surgeon feedback has been overwhelmingly positive, we are analyzing data and metrics that will be used to support our U.S. commercial launch. Additionally, we now look forward to launching the product in Canada in the near future.”\n\n**About ReShape Lifesciences® **ReShape Lifesciences® is America’s premier weight loss and metabolic health-solutions company, offering an integrated portfolio of proven products and services that manage and treat obesity and metabolic disease.
