Our Healthcare and Education segments have grown over each comparative quarter since the first quarter of 2021, and in the third quarter of 2024, our Commercial segment achieved strong sequential growth over the second quarter of 2024,” said [Mark Hussey](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.huronconsultinggroup.com%2Fcompany%2Fexperts%2Femployees%2Fmark-hussey%3FPractice%3Dabout-us&esheet=54143543&newsitemid=20241029303264&lan=en-US&anchor=Mark+Hussey&index=1&md5=14330e2853e86c766546fab958cc01bb), chief executive officer and president of [Huron](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.huronconsultinggroup.com%2F&esheet=54143543&newsitemid=20241029303264&lan=en-US&anchor=Huron&index=2&md5=a86bcfa5e996d58e7dcff57ccda5ec89). “We continue to execute against our margin enhancement initiatives, which produced strong third quarter and year-to-date margin percentage and earnings per share expansion.”\n\n“Strong sales conversion across all three operating segments in the third quarter positions us well to deliver on our annual revenue and earnings guidance while laying the foundation for continued solid growth in 2025,” added [Hussey](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.huronconsultinggroup.com%2Fcompany%2Fexperts%2Femployees%2Fmark-hussey%3FPractice%3Dabout-us&esheet=54143543&newsitemid=20241029303264&lan=en-US&anchor=Hussey&index=3&md5=c655eec488d0a7f2e9ebdd226997763d).\n\n**THIRD QUARTER 2024 RESULTS**\n\nRevenues before reimbursable expenses increased $11.9 million, or 3.3%, to $370.0 million for the third quarter of 2024, compared to $358.2 million for the third quarter of 2023. The increase in revenues before reimbursable expenses was driven by an increase in demand for Education's Consulting and Managed Services and Digital capabilities, as well as continued strength in demand for Healthcare's Digital capability, reflecting the company's focus on accelerating growth in the healthcare and education industries. These increases in demand were partially offset by a decrease in demand for Commercial's Consulting and Managed Services capability.\n\nNet income increased $5.6 million, or 26.2%, to $27.1 million, or 7.2% of total revenues, for the third quarter of 2024, compared to $21.5 million, or 5.9% of total revenues, for the same quarter last year. Diluted earnings per share increased $0.37, or 33.6%, to $1.47 for the third quarter of 2024, compared to $1.10 for the third quarter of 2023.\n\nThird quarter 2024 earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (“EBITDA”)(9) increased $8.3 million, or 19.4%, to $50.9 million, compared to $42.6 million in the same prior year period.\n\nIn addition to using EBITDA to evaluate the company’s financial performance, management uses other non-GAAP financial measures, which exclude the effect of the following items (in thousands).\n\n**Three Months Ended****September 30 ,**  \n---  \n**2024**| **2023**  \nAmortization of intangible assets| $| 1,600| $| 1,997  \nRestructuring charges| $| 3,137| $| 5,402  \nOther gains, net| $| (173| )| $| (14| )  \nTransaction-related expenses| $| 716| $| 302  \nTax effect of adjustments| $| (1,372| )| $| (2,037| )  \nForeign currency transaction losses (gains), net| $| 267| $| (332| )  \n  \nAdjusted EBITDA(9) increased $6.9 million, or 14.3%, to $54.9 million, or 14.8% of revenues before reimbursable expenses(9), in the third quarter of 2024, compared to $48.0 million, or 13.4% of revenues before reimbursable expenses(9), in the same quarter last year. Adjusted net income(9) increased $3.9 million, or 14.3%, to $31.1 million, or $1.68 per diluted share, for the third quarter of 2024, compared to $27.2 million, or $1.39 per diluted share, for the same quarter in 2023.\n\nThe number of revenue-generating professionals(2) increased 10.4% to 5,896 as of September 30, 2024 from 5,341 as of September 30, 2023. The utilization rate(8) of the company's Consulting capability was 73.6% during the third quarter of 2024, compared to 77.3% during the same period last year. The utilization rate(8) for the company's Digital capability increased to 77.2% during the third quarter of 2024, compared to 75.4% during the same period last year.\n\n**YEAR-TO-DATE 2024 RESULTS**\n\nRevenues before reimbursable expenses increased $74.8 million, or 7.3%, to $1.10 billion for the first nine months of 2024, compared to $1.02 billion for the first nine months of 2023. The increase in revenues before reimbursable expenses was driven by continued strength in demand for both our Consulting and Managed Services capability and Digital capability within Healthcare and Education, reflecting the company's focus on accelerating growth in the healthcare and education industries. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in demand for Commercial's Digital and Consulting and Managed Services capabilities.\n\nNet income increased $23.0 million, or 38.5%, to $82.6 million, or 7.4% of total revenues, for the first nine months of 2024, compared to $59.6 million, or 5.7% of total revenues, for the same prior year period. Results for the first nine months of 2024 include an $11.1 million litigation settlement gain, net of tax, related to a completed legal matter in which Huron was the plaintiff. Diluted earnings per share increased $1.38, or 45.2%, to $4.43 for the first nine months of 2024, compared to $3.05 for the same prior year period. The litigation settlement gain recognized in the second quarter of 2024 had a favorable $0.59 impact on diluted earnings per share for the nine months ended September 30, 2024.\n\nEBITDA(9) for the first nine months of 2024 increased $29.6 million, or 25.5%, to $146.1 million, compared to $116.5 million in the same prior year period. Results for the first nine months of 2024 include a pre-tax $15.0 million litigation settlement gain related to the completed legal matter in which Huron was the plaintiff.\n\nIn addition to using EBITDA to evaluate the company’s financial performance, management uses other non-GAAP financial measures, which exclude the effect of the following items (in thousands):\n\n**Nine Months Ended****September 30 ,**  \n---  \n**2024**| **2023**  \nAmortization of intangible assets| $| 4,917| $| 6,202  \nRestructuring charges| $| 7,530| $| 9,385  \n2024 litigation settlement gain (10)| $| (11,701| )| $| —  \nOther losses (gains), net| $| 478| $| (202| )  \nTransaction-related expenses| $| 2,316| $| 302  \nTax effect of adjustments| $| (920| )| $| (4,157| )  \nForeign currency transaction losses (gains), net| $| (348| )| $| 36  \n  \nAdjusted EBITDA(9), which excludes the 2024 litigation settlement gain, increased $18.4 million, or 14.6%, to $144.4 million, or 13.2% of revenues before reimbursable expenses(9), for the first nine months of 2024, compared to $126.0 million, or 12.3% of revenues before reimbursable expenses(9), in the same prior year period. Adjusted net income(9) increased $14.1 million, or 19.8%, to $85.3 million, or $4.57 per diluted share, for the first nine months of 2024, compared to $71.2 million, or $3.64 per diluted share, for the same prior year period.\n\nThe number of revenue-generating professionals(2) increased 10.4% to 5,896 as of September 30, 2024 from 5,341 as of September 30, 2023. The utilization rate(8) of the company's Consulting capability was 72.5% for the first nine months of 2024, compared to 76.5% during the same period last year. The utilization rate(8) for the company's Digital capability increased to 75.4% for the first nine months of 2024, compared to 73.7% during the same period last year.\n\nAdditionally, Huron returned $104.0 million to shareholders in the first nine months of 2024 by repurchasing 1,067,545 shares of the company's common stock, representing 5.8% of the company's common stock outstanding as of December 31, 2023.\n\n**OPERATING INDUSTRIES**\n\nThe company’s year-to-date 2024 revenues before reimbursable expenses by operating segment as a percentage of total company revenues before reimbursable expenses are as follows: Healthcare (50%); Education (32%); and Commercial (18%). Financial results by operating industry are included in the attached schedules and in Huron's forthcoming Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q filing for the quarter ended September 30, 2024.\n\n**OUTLOOK FOR 2024**\n\nBased on currently available information, the company is narrowing guidance for full year 2024 revenues before reimbursable expenses to a range of $1.47 billion to $1.49 billion while maintaining its previous midpoint of guidance. The company also anticipates adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of revenues before reimbursable expenses(9) in a range of 13.0% to 13.5%, and is increasing adjusted diluted earnings per share(9) guidance to a range of $6.00 to $6.20.\n\n**THIRD QUARTER 2024 WEBCAST**\n\nThe company will host a webcast to discuss its financial results today, October 29, 2024, at 5:00 p.m. Eastern Time, 4:00 p.m. Central Time. The conference call is being webcast by Notified and can be accessed from Huron's website at [http://ir.huronconsultinggroup.com](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=http%3A%2F%2Fir.huronconsultinggroup.com&esheet=54143543&newsitemid=20241029303264&lan=en-US&anchor=http%3A%2F%2Fir.huronconsultinggroup.com&index=4&md5=b6f1a412ee791511785e8b5913cce835). A replay will be available approximately two hours after the conclusion of the webcast and for 90 days thereafter.\n\n**USE OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES(9)**\n\nIn evaluating the company’s financial performance and outlook, management uses EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of revenues before reimbursable expenses, adjusted net income, and adjusted diluted earnings per share, which are non-GAAP measures. Management uses these non-GAAP financial measures to gain an understanding of the company's comparative operating performance (when comparing such results with previous periods or forecasts). These non-GAAP financial measures are used by management in their financial and operating decision making because management believes they reflect the company's ongoing business in a manner that allows for meaningful period-to-period comparisons. Management also uses these non-GAAP financial measures when publicly providing their business outlook, for internal management purposes, and as a basis for evaluating potential acquisitions and dispositions. Management believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating Huron’s current operating performance and future prospects in the same manner as management does, if they so choose, and in comparing in a consistent manner Huron’s current financial results with Huron’s past financial results. Investors should recognize that these non-GAAP measures might not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies. These measures should be considered in addition to, and not as a substitute for or superior to, any measure of performance, cash flows or liquidity prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.\n\nManagement has provided its outlook regarding adjusted EBITDA and adjusted diluted earnings per share, both of which are non-GAAP financial measures and exclude certain charges. Management has not reconciled these non-GAAP financial measures to the corresponding GAAP financial measures because guidance for the various reconciling items is not provided. Management is unable to provide guidance for these reconciling items because they cannot determine their probable significance, as certain items are outside of the company's control and cannot be reasonably predicted since these items could vary significantly from period to period. Accordingly, reconciliations to the corresponding GAAP financial measures are not available without unreasonable effort.\n\n**ABOUT HURON**\n\nHuron is a global professional services firm that collaborates with clients to put **possible into practice** by creating sound strategies, optimizing operations, accelerating digital transformation, and empowering businesses and their people to own their future.

Available working hours exclude local country holidays and vacation days. Utilization rates are presented for our revenue-generating professionals who primarily bill on an hourly basis. We have not presented utilization rates for our Managed Services professionals as most of the revenues generated by these employees are not billed on an hourly basis.  \n**HURON CONSULTING GROUP INC.****RECONCILIATION OF NET INCOME****TO ADJUSTED EARNINGS BEFORE INTEREST, TAXES, DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION(9)****(In thousands)****(Unaudited)**  \n---  \n**Three Months Ended****September 30 ,**| **Nine Months Ended****September 30 ,**  \n**2024**| **2023**| **2024**| **2023**  \n**Revenues before reimbursable expenses**|  $| 370,049| $| 358,178| $| 1,097,664| $| 1,022,832  \n**Reimbursable expenses**|  8,040| 9,288| 24,827| 25,918  \n**Total revenues**|  $| 378,089| $| 367,466| $| 1,122,491| $| 1,048,750  \n**Net income**|  $| 27,149| $| 21,516| $| 82,637| $| 59,647  \n**Net income as a percentage of total revenues**|  7.2| %| 5.9| %| 7.4| %| 5.7| %  \nAdd back:  \nIncome tax expense| 10,432| 9,779| 24,599| 22,480  \nInterest expense, net of interest income| 6,800| 5,047| 19,894| 15,146  \nDepreciation and amortization| 6,542| 6,300| 18,967| 19,183  \n**Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA)(9)**| 50,923| 42,642| 146,097| 116,456  \nAdd back:  \nRestructuring charges| 3,137| 5,402| 7,530| 9,385  \n2024 litigation settlement gain (10)| —| —| (11,701| )| —  \nOther losses (gains), net| (173| )| (14| )| 478| (202| )  \nTransaction-related expenses| 716| 302| 2,316| 302  \nForeign currency transaction losses (gains), net| 267| (332| )| (348| )| 36  \n**Adjusted EBITDA(9)**| $| 54,870| $| 48,000| $| 144,372| $| 125,977  \n**Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of revenues before reimbursable expenses(9)**| 14.8| %| 13.4| %| 13.2| %| 12.3| %  \n**HURON CONSULTING GROUP INC.****RECONCILIATION OF NET INCOME TO ADJUSTED NET INCOME(9)****(In thousands, except per share amounts)****(Unaudited)**  \n---  \n**Three Months Ended****September 30 ,**| **Nine Months Ended****September 30 ,**  \n**2024**| **2023**| **2024**| **2023**  \n**Net income**|  $| 27,149| $| 21,516| $| 82,637| $| 59,647  \n**Weighted average shares - diluted**|  18,471| 19,475| 18,672| 19,578  \n**Diluted earnings per share**|  $| 1.47| $| 1.10| $| 4.43| $| 3.05  \nAdd back:  \nAmortization of intangible assets| 1,600| 1,997| 4,917| 6,202  \nRestructuring charges| 3,137| 5,402| 7,530| 9,385  \n2024 litigation settlement gain (10)| —| —| (11,701| )| —  \nOther losses (gains), net| (173| )| (14| )| 478| (202| )  \nTransaction-related expenses| 716| 302| 2,316| 302  \nTax effect of adjustments| (1,372| )| (2,037| )| (920| )| (4,157| )  \nTotal adjustments, net of tax| 3,908| 5,650| 2,620| 11,530  \n**Adjusted net income(9)**| $| 31,057| $| 27,166| $| 85,257| $| 71,177  \n**Adjusted weighted average shares - diluted**|  18,471| 19,475| 18,672| 19,578  \n**Adjusted diluted earnings per share(9)**| $| 1.68| $| 1.39| $| 4.57| $| 3.64  \n(9)| In evaluating the company’s financial performance and outlook, management uses earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (“EBITDA”), adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of revenues before reimbursable expenses, adjusted net income, and adjusted diluted earnings per share, which are non-GAAP measures. Management uses these non-GAAP financial measures to gain an understanding of the company's comparative operating performance (when comparing such results with previous periods or forecasts). These non-GAAP financial measures are used by management in their financial and operating decision making because management believes they reflect the company's ongoing business in a manner that allows for meaningful period-to-period comparisons. Management also uses these non-GAAP financial measures when publicly providing the company's business outlook, for internal management purposes, and as a basis for evaluating potential acquisitions and dispositions. Management believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating Huron’s current operating performance and future prospects in the same manner as management does, if they so choose, and in comparing in a consistent manner Huron’s current financial results with Huron’s past financial results. Investors should recognize that these non-GAAP measures might not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies. These measures should be considered in addition to, and not as a substitute for or superior to, any measure of performance, cash flows or liquidity prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.  \n---|---  \n(10)| The non-GAAP financial measures for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 include an adjustment for the 2024 litigation settlement gain. In the second quarter of 2024, the company settled a litigation matter in which Huron was the plaintiff for $15.0 million, on a pre-tax basis. This $15.0 million settlement gain was recorded as a component of other gains, net on the consolidated statement of operations. The company has excluded from the non-GAAP measures $11.7 million, which is the value of the settlement gain that exceeds the third-party legal costs incurred during 2024 specific to this litigation matter, as this net gain is not indicative of the ongoing performance of Huron's business.

Our Healthcare and Education segments have grown over each comparative quarter since the first quarter of 2021, and in the third quarter of 2024, our Commercial segment achieved strong sequential growth over the second quarter of 2024,” said [Mark Hussey](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.huronconsultinggroup.com%2Fcompany%2Fexperts%2Femployees%2Fmark-hussey%3FPractice%3Dabout-us&esheet=54143543&newsitemid=20241029303264&lan=en-US&anchor=Mark+Hussey&index=1&md5=14330e2853e86c766546fab958cc01bb), chief executive officer and president of [Huron](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.huronconsultinggroup.com%2F&esheet=54143543&newsitemid=20241029303264&lan=en-US&anchor=Huron&index=2&md5=a86bcfa5e996d58e7dcff57ccda5ec89). “We continue to execute against our margin enhancement initiatives, which produced strong third quarter and year-to-date margin percentage and earnings per share expansion.”\n\n“Strong sales conversion across all three operating segments in the third quarter positions us well to deliver on our annual revenue and earnings guidance while laying the foundation for continued solid growth in 2025,” added [Hussey](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.huronconsultinggroup.com%2Fcompany%2Fexperts%2Femployees%2Fmark-hussey%3FPractice%3Dabout-us&esheet=54143543&newsitemid=20241029303264&lan=en-US&anchor=Hussey&index=3&md5=c655eec488d0a7f2e9ebdd226997763d).\n\n**THIRD QUARTER 2024 RESULTS**\n\nRevenues before reimbursable expenses increased $11.9 million, or 3.3%, to $370.0 million for the third quarter of 2024, compared to $358.2 million for the third quarter of 2023. The increase in revenues before reimbursable expenses was driven by an increase in demand for Education's Consulting and Managed Services and Digital capabilities, as well as continued strength in demand for Healthcare's Digital capability, reflecting the company's focus on accelerating growth in the healthcare and education industries. These increases in demand were partially offset by a decrease in demand for Commercial's Consulting and Managed Services capability.\n\nNet income increased $5.6 million, or 26.2%, to $27.1 million, or 7.2% of total revenues, for the third quarter of 2024, compared to $21.5 million, or 5.9% of total revenues, for the same quarter last year. Diluted earnings per share increased $0.37, or 33.6%, to $1.47 for the third quarter of 2024, compared to $1.10 for the third quarter of 2023.\n\nThird quarter 2024 earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (“EBITDA”)(9) increased $8.3 million, or 19.4%, to $50.9 million, compared to $42.6 million in the same prior year period.\n\nIn addition to using EBITDA to evaluate the company’s financial performance, management uses other non-GAAP financial measures, which exclude the effect of the following items (in thousands).\n\n**Three Months Ended****September 30 ,**  \n---  \n**2024**| **2023**  \nAmortization of intangible assets| $| 1,600| $| 1,997  \nRestructuring charges| $| 3,137| $| 5,402  \nOther gains, net| $| (173| )| $| (14| )  \nTransaction-related expenses| $| 716| $| 302  \nTax effect of adjustments| $| (1,372| )| $| (2,037| )  \nForeign currency transaction losses (gains), net| $| 267| $| (332| )  \n  \nAdjusted EBITDA(9) increased $6.9 million, or 14.3%, to $54.9 million, or 14.8% of revenues before reimbursable expenses(9), in the third quarter of 2024, compared to $48.0 million, or 13.4% of revenues before reimbursable expenses(9), in the same quarter last year. Adjusted net income(9) increased $3.9 million, or 14.3%, to $31.1 million, or $1.68 per diluted share, for the third quarter of 2024, compared to $27.2 million, or $1.39 per diluted share, for the same quarter in 2023.\n\nThe number of revenue-generating professionals(2) increased 10.4% to 5,896 as of September 30, 2024 from 5,341 as of September 30, 2023. The utilization rate(8) of the company's Consulting capability was 73.6% during the third quarter of 2024, compared to 77.3% during the same period last year. The utilization rate(8) for the company's Digital capability increased to 77.2% during the third quarter of 2024, compared to 75.4% during the same period last year.\n\n**YEAR-TO-DATE 2024 RESULTS**\n\nRevenues before reimbursable expenses increased $74.8 million, or 7.3%, to $1.10 billion for the first nine months of 2024, compared to $1.02 billion for the first nine months of 2023. The increase in revenues before reimbursable expenses was driven by continued strength in demand for both our Consulting and Managed Services capability and Digital capability within Healthcare and Education, reflecting the company's focus on accelerating growth in the healthcare and education industries. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in demand for Commercial's Digital and Consulting and Managed Services capabilities.\n\nNet income increased $23.0 million, or 38.5%, to $82.6 million, or 7.4% of total revenues, for the first nine months of 2024, compared to $59.6 million, or 5.7% of total revenues, for the same prior year period. Results for the first nine months of 2024 include an $11.1 million litigation settlement gain, net of tax, related to a completed legal matter in which Huron was the plaintiff. Diluted earnings per share increased $1.38, or 45.2%, to $4.43 for the first nine months of 2024, compared to $3.05 for the same prior year period. The litigation settlement gain recognized in the second quarter of 2024 had a favorable $0.59 impact on diluted earnings per share for the nine months ended September 30, 2024.\n\nEBITDA(9) for the first nine months of 2024 increased $29.6 million, or 25.5%, to $146.1 million, compared to $116.5 million in the same prior year period. Results for the first nine months of 2024 include a pre-tax $15.0 million litigation settlement gain related to the completed legal matter in which Huron was the plaintiff.\n\nIn addition to using EBITDA to evaluate the company’s financial performance, management uses other non-GAAP financial measures, which exclude the effect of the following items (in thousands):\n\n**Nine Months Ended****September 30 ,**  \n---  \n**2024**| **2023**  \nAmortization of intangible assets| $| 4,917| $| 6,202  \nRestructuring charges| $| 7,530| $| 9,385  \n2024 litigation settlement gain (10)| $| (11,701| )| $| —  \nOther losses (gains), net| $| 478| $| (202| )  \nTransaction-related expenses| $| 2,316| $| 302  \nTax effect of adjustments| $| (920| )| $| (4,157| )  \nForeign currency transaction losses (gains), net| $| (348| )| $| 36  \n  \nAdjusted EBITDA(9), which excludes the 2024 litigation settlement gain, increased $18.4 million, or 14.6%, to $144.4 million, or 13.2% of revenues before reimbursable expenses(9), for the first nine months of 2024, compared to $126.0 million, or 12.3% of revenues before reimbursable expenses(9), in the same prior year period. Adjusted net income(9) increased $14.1 million, or 19.8%, to $85.3 million, or $4.57 per diluted share, for the first nine months of 2024, compared to $71.2 million, or $3.64 per diluted share, for the same prior year period.\n\nThe number of revenue-generating professionals(2) increased 10.4% to 5,896 as of September 30, 2024 from 5,341 as of September 30, 2023. The utilization rate(8) of the company's Consulting capability was 72.5% for the first nine months of 2024, compared to 76.5% during the same period last year. The utilization rate(8) for the company's Digital capability increased to 75.4% for the first nine months of 2024, compared to 73.7% during the same period last year.\n\nAdditionally, Huron returned $104.0 million to shareholders in the first nine months of 2024 by repurchasing 1,067,545 shares of the company's common stock, representing 5.8% of the company's common stock outstanding as of December 31, 2023.\n\n**OPERATING INDUSTRIES**\n\nThe company’s year-to-date 2024 revenues before reimbursable expenses by operating segment as a percentage of total company revenues before reimbursable expenses are as follows: Healthcare (50%); Education (32%); and Commercial (18%). Financial results by operating industry are included in the attached schedules and in Huron's forthcoming Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q filing for the quarter ended September 30, 2024.\n\n**OUTLOOK FOR 2024**\n\nBased on currently available information, the company is narrowing guidance for full year 2024 revenues before reimbursable expenses to a range of $1.47 billion to $1.49 billion while maintaining its previous midpoint of guidance. The company also anticipates adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of revenues before reimbursable expenses(9) in a range of 13.0% to 13.5%, and is increasing adjusted diluted earnings per share(9) guidance to a range of $6.00 to $6.20.\n\n**THIRD QUARTER 2024 WEBCAST**\n\nThe company will host a webcast to discuss its financial results today, October 29, 2024, at 5:00 p.m. Eastern Time, 4:00 p.m. Central Time. The conference call is being webcast by Notified and can be accessed from Huron's website at [http://ir.huronconsultinggroup.com](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=http%3A%2F%2Fir.huronconsultinggroup.com&esheet=54143543&newsitemid=20241029303264&lan=en-US&anchor=http%3A%2F%2Fir.huronconsultinggroup.com&index=4&md5=b6f1a412ee791511785e8b5913cce835). A replay will be available approximately two hours after the conclusion of the webcast and for 90 days thereafter.\n\n**USE OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES(9)**\n\nIn evaluating the company’s financial performance and outlook, management uses EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of revenues before reimbursable expenses, adjusted net income, and adjusted diluted earnings per share, which are non-GAAP measures. Management uses these non-GAAP financial measures to gain an understanding of the company's comparative operating performance (when comparing such results with previous periods or forecasts). These non-GAAP financial measures are used by management in their financial and operating decision making because management believes they reflect the company's ongoing business in a manner that allows for meaningful period-to-period comparisons. Management also uses these non-GAAP financial measures when publicly providing their business outlook, for internal management purposes, and as a basis for evaluating potential acquisitions and dispositions. Management believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating Huron’s current operating performance and future prospects in the same manner as management does, if they so choose, and in comparing in a consistent manner Huron’s current financial results with Huron’s past financial results. Investors should recognize that these non-GAAP measures might not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies. These measures should be considered in addition to, and not as a substitute for or superior to, any measure of performance, cash flows or liquidity prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.\n\nManagement has provided its outlook regarding adjusted EBITDA and adjusted diluted earnings per share, both of which are non-GAAP financial measures and exclude certain charges. Management has not reconciled these non-GAAP financial measures to the corresponding GAAP financial measures because guidance for the various reconciling items is not provided. Management is unable to provide guidance for these reconciling items because they cannot determine their probable significance, as certain items are outside of the company's control and cannot be reasonably predicted since these items could vary significantly from period to period. Accordingly, reconciliations to the corresponding GAAP financial measures are not available without unreasonable effort.\n\n**ABOUT HURON**\n\nHuron is a global professional services firm that collaborates with clients to put **possible into practice** by creating sound strategies, optimizing operations, accelerating digital transformation, and empowering businesses and their people to own their future.

Revenues before reimbursable expenses generated by this offering during the quarters ended March 31, 2023, June 30, 2023, September 30, 2023, and December 31, 2023 were $2.8 million, $2.2 million, $2.4 million, and $2.7 million, respectively, and during the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2023 were $15.0 million and $10.1 million, respectively. The number of revenue-generating professionals within this offering as of December 31, 2022, March 31, 2023, June 30, 2023, September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2023 were 54, 24, 24, 24 and 23, respectively.  \nThis reclassification did not impact the aggregate revenues before reimbursable expenses or headcount reported for the Education Consulting and Managed Services capability for any period, and the prior period Education Managed Services capability revenues before reimbursable expenses and headcount in the following footnotes have been revised for consistent presentation.  \n(6)| Managed Services capability revenues before reimbursable expenses within our Healthcare segment was $19.3 million and $16.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively; and $53.5 million and $53.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.  \nManaged Services capability revenues before reimbursable expenses within our Education segment was $6.6 million and $7.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively; and $20.8 million and $22.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.  \n(7)| The number of Managed Services revenue-generating professionals within our Healthcare segment was 1,223 and 757 as of September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.  \nThe number of Managed Services revenue-generating professionals within our Education segment was 122 and 129 as of September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.  \n(8)| Utilization rate is calculated by dividing the number of hours our billable consultants worked on client assignments during a period by the total available working hours for these billable consultants during the same period. Available working hours are determined by the standard hours worked by each billable consultant, adjusted for part-time hours, and U.S. standard work weeks. Available working hours exclude local country holidays and vacation days. Utilization rates are presented for our revenue-generating professionals who primarily bill on an hourly basis. We have not presented utilization rates for our Managed Services professionals as most of the revenues generated by these employees are not billed on an hourly basis.  \n**HURON CONSULTING GROUP INC.****RECONCILIATION OF NET INCOME****TO ADJUSTED EARNINGS BEFORE INTEREST, TAXES, DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION(9)****(In thousands)****(Unaudited)**  \n---  \n**Three Months Ended****September 30 ,**| **Nine Months Ended****September 30 ,**  \n**2024**| **2023**| **2024**| **2023**  \n**Revenues before reimbursable expenses**|  $| 370,049| $| 358,178| $| 1,097,664| $| 1,022,832  \n**Reimbursable expenses**|  8,040| 9,288| 24,827| 25,918  \n**Total revenues**|  $| 378,089| $| 367,466| $| 1,122,491| $| 1,048,750  \n**Net income**|  $| 27,149| $| 21,516| $| 82,637| $| 59,647  \n**Net income as a percentage of total revenues**|  7.2| %| 5.9| %| 7.4| %| 5.7| %  \nAdd back:  \nIncome tax expense| 10,432| 9,779| 24,599| 22,480  \nInterest expense, net of interest income| 6,800| 5,047| 19,894| 15,146  \nDepreciation and amortization| 6,542| 6,300| 18,967| 19,183  \n**Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA)(9)**| 50,923| 42,642| 146,097| 116,456  \nAdd back:  \nRestructuring charges| 3,137| 5,402| 7,530| 9,385  \n2024 litigation settlement gain (10)| —| —| (11,701| )| —  \nOther losses (gains), net| (173| )| (14| )| 478| (202| )  \nTransaction-related expenses| 716| 302| 2,316| 302  \nForeign currency transaction losses (gains), net| 267| (332| )| (348| )| 36  \n**Adjusted EBITDA(9)**| $| 54,870| $| 48,000| $| 144,372| $| 125,977  \n**Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of revenues before reimbursable expenses(9)**| 14.8| %| 13.4| %| 13.2| %| 12.3| %  \n**HURON CONSULTING GROUP INC.****RECONCILIATION OF NET INCOME TO ADJUSTED NET INCOME(9)****(In thousands, except per share amounts)****(Unaudited)**  \n---  \n**Three Months Ended****September 30 ,**| **Nine Months Ended****September 30 ,**  \n**2024**| **2023**| **2024**| **2023**  \n**Net income**|  $| 27,149| $| 21,516| $| 82,637| $| 59,647  \n**Weighted average shares - diluted**|  18,471| 19,475| 18,672| 19,578  \n**Diluted earnings per share**|  $| 1.47| $| 1.10| $| 4.43| $| 3.05  \nAdd back:  \nAmortization of intangible assets| 1,600| 1,997| 4,917| 6,202  \nRestructuring charges| 3,137| 5,402| 7,530| 9,385  \n2024 litigation settlement gain (10)| —| —| (11,701| )| —  \nOther losses (gains), net| (173| )| (14| )| 478| (202| )  \nTransaction-related expenses| 716| 302| 2,316| 302  \nTax effect of adjustments| (1,372| )| (2,037| )| (920| )| (4,157| )  \nTotal adjustments, net of tax| 3,908| 5,650| 2,620| 11,530  \n**Adjusted net income(9)**| $| 31,057| $| 27,166| $| 85,257| $| 71,177  \n**Adjusted weighted average shares - diluted**|  18,471| 19,475| 18,672| 19,578  \n**Adjusted diluted earnings per share(9)**| $| 1.68| $| 1.39| $| 4.57| $| 3.64  \n(9)| In evaluating the company’s financial performance and outlook, management uses earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (“EBITDA”), adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of revenues before reimbursable expenses, adjusted net income, and adjusted diluted earnings per share, which are non-GAAP measures. Management uses these non-GAAP financial measures to gain an understanding of the company's comparative operating performance (when comparing such results with previous periods or forecasts). These non-GAAP financial measures are used by management in their financial and operating decision making because management believes they reflect the company's ongoing business in a manner that allows for meaningful period-to-period comparisons. Management also uses these non-GAAP financial measures when publicly providing the company's business outlook, for internal management purposes, and as a basis for evaluating potential acquisitions and dispositions. Management believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating Huron’s current operating performance and future prospects in the same manner as management does, if they so choose, and in comparing in a consistent manner Huron’s current financial results with Huron’s past financial results. Investors should recognize that these non-GAAP measures might not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies. These measures should be considered in addition to, and not as a substitute for or superior to, any measure of performance, cash flows or liquidity prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.  \n---|---  \n(10)| The non-GAAP financial measures for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 include an adjustment for the 2024 litigation settlement gain. In the second quarter of 2024, the company settled a litigation matter in which Huron was the plaintiff for $15.0 million, on a pre-tax basis. This $15.0 million settlement gain was recorded as a component of other gains, net on the consolidated statement of operations. The company has excluded from the non-GAAP measures $11.7 million, which is the value of the settlement gain that exceeds the third-party legal costs incurred during 2024 specific to this litigation matter, as this net gain is not indicative of the ongoing performance of Huron's business. Of the $3.3 million third-party legal costs incurred for this matter in 2024, $2.7 million was incurred in the first quarter and $0.6 million was incurred in the second quarter. Third-party legal expenses are recorded as a component of selling, general and administrative expenses on the statement of operations. Third-party legal costs incurred for this litigation matter during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 were $1.2 million and $2.2 million, respectively.  \n  \nView source version on [businesswire.com](http://businesswire.com): [https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20241029303264/en/](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20241029303264/en/)\n\n**MEDIA CONTACT** Allie Bovis abovis@hcg.com **INVESTOR CONTACT** John D.

The increase in revenues before reimbursable expenses was driven by an increase in demand for Education's Consulting and Managed Services and Digital capabilities, as well as continued strength in demand for Healthcare's Digital capability, reflecting the company's focus on accelerating growth in the healthcare and education industries. These increases in demand were partially offset by a decrease in demand for Commercial's Consulting and Managed Services capability.\n\nNet income increased $5.6 million, or 26.2%, to $27.1 million, or 7.2% of total revenues, for the third quarter of 2024, compared to $21.5 million, or 5.9% of total revenues, for the same quarter last year. Diluted earnings per share increased $0.37, or 33.6%, to $1.47 for the third quarter of 2024, compared to $1.10 for the third quarter of 2023.\n\nThird quarter 2024 earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (“EBITDA”)(9) increased $8.3 million, or 19.4%, to $50.9 million, compared to $42.6 million in the same prior year period.\n\nIn addition to using EBITDA to evaluate the company’s financial performance, management uses other non-GAAP financial measures, which exclude the effect of the following items (in thousands).\n\n**Three Months Ended****September 30 ,**  \n---  \n**2024**| **2023**  \nAmortization of intangible assets| $| 1,600| $| 1,997  \nRestructuring charges| $| 3,137| $| 5,402  \nOther gains, net| $| (173| )| $| (14| )  \nTransaction-related expenses| $| 716| $| 302  \nTax effect of adjustments| $| (1,372| )| $| (2,037| )  \nForeign currency transaction losses (gains), net| $| 267| $| (332| )  \n  \nAdjusted EBITDA(9) increased $6.9 million, or 14.3%, to $54.9 million, or 14.8% of revenues before reimbursable expenses(9), in the third quarter of 2024, compared to $48.0 million, or 13.4% of revenues before reimbursable expenses(9), in the same quarter last year. Adjusted net income(9) increased $3.9 million, or 14.3%, to $31.1 million, or $1.68 per diluted share, for the third quarter of 2024, compared to $27.2 million, or $1.39 per diluted share, for the same quarter in 2023.\n\nThe number of revenue-generating professionals(2) increased 10.4% to 5,896 as of September 30, 2024 from 5,341 as of September 30, 2023.

The increase in revenues before reimbursable expenses was driven by continued strength in demand for both our Consulting and Managed Services capability and Digital capability within Healthcare and Education, reflecting the company's focus on accelerating growth in the healthcare and education industries. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in demand for Commercial's Digital and Consulting and Managed Services capabilities.\n\nNet income increased $23.0 million, or 38.5%, to $82.6 million, or 7.4% of total revenues, for the first nine months of 2024, compared to $59.6 million, or 5.7% of total revenues, for the same prior year period. Results for the first nine months of 2024 include an $11.1 million litigation settlement gain, net of tax, related to a completed legal matter in which Huron was the plaintiff. Diluted earnings per share increased $1.38, or 45.2%, to $4.43 for the first nine months of 2024, compared to $3.05 for the same prior year period. The litigation settlement gain recognized in the second quarter of 2024 had a favorable $0.59 impact on diluted earnings per share for the nine months ended September 30, 2024.\n\nEBITDA(9) for the first nine months of 2024 increased $29.6 million, or 25.5%, to $146.1 million, compared to $116.5 million in the same prior year period. Results for the first nine months of 2024 include a pre-tax $15.0 million litigation settlement gain related to the completed legal matter in which Huron was the plaintiff.\n\nIn addition to using EBITDA to evaluate the company’s financial performance, management uses other non-GAAP financial measures, which exclude the effect of the following items (in thousands):\n\n**Nine Months Ended****September 30 ,**  \n---  \n**2024**| **2023**  \nAmortization of intangible assets| $| 4,917| $| 6,202  \nRestructuring charges| $| 7,530| $| 9,385  \n2024 litigation settlement gain (10)| $| (11,701| )| $| —  \nOther losses (gains), net| $| 478| $| (202| )  \nTransaction-related expenses| $| 2,316| $| 302  \nTax effect of adjustments| $| (920| )| $| (4,157| )  \nForeign currency transaction losses (gains), net| $| (348| )| $| 36  \n  \nAdjusted EBITDA(9), which excludes the 2024 litigation settlement gain, increased $18.4 million, or 14.6%, to $144.4 million, or 13.2% of revenues before reimbursable expenses(9), for the first nine months of 2024, compared to $126.0 million, or 12.3% of revenues before reimbursable expenses(9), in the same prior year period. Adjusted net income(9) increased $14.1 million, or 19.8%, to $85.3 million, or $4.57 per diluted share, for the first nine months of 2024, compared to $71.2 million, or $3.64 per diluted share, for the same prior year period.\n\nThe number of revenue-generating professionals(2) increased 10.4% to 5,896 as of September 30, 2024 from 5,341 as of September 30, 2023. The utilization rate(8) of the company's Consulting capability was 72.5% for the first nine months of 2024, compared to 76.5% during the same period last year. The utilization rate(8) for the company's Digital capability increased to 75.4% for the first nine months of 2024, compared to 73.7% during the same period last year.\n\nAdditionally, Huron returned $104.0 million to shareholders in the first nine months of 2024 by repurchasing 1,067,545 shares of the company's common stock, representing 5.8% of the company's common stock outstanding as of December 31, 2023.\n\n**OPERATING INDUSTRIES**\n\nThe company’s year-to-date 2024 revenues before reimbursable expenses by operating segment as a percentage of total company revenues before reimbursable expenses are as follows: Healthcare (50%); Education (32%); and Commercial (18%). Financial results by operating industry are included in the attached schedules and in Huron's forthcoming Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q filing for the quarter ended September 30, 2024.\n\n**OUTLOOK FOR 2024**\n\nBased on currently available information, the company is narrowing guidance for full year 2024 revenues before reimbursable expenses to a range of $1.47 billion to $1.49 billion while maintaining its previous midpoint of guidance. The company also anticipates adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of revenues before reimbursable expenses(9) in a range of 13.0% to 13.5%, and is increasing adjusted diluted earnings per share(9) guidance to a range of $6.00 to $6.20.\n\n**THIRD QUARTER 2024 WEBCAST**\n\nThe company will host a webcast to discuss its financial results today, October 29, 2024, at 5:00 p.m. Eastern Time, 4:00 p.m. Central Time. The conference call is being webcast by Notified and can be accessed from Huron's website at [http://ir.huronconsultinggroup.com](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=http%3A%2F%2Fir.huronconsultinggroup.com&esheet=54143543&newsitemid=20241029303264&lan=en-US&anchor=http%3A%2F%2Fir.huronconsultinggroup.com&index=4&md5=b6f1a412ee791511785e8b5913cce835). A replay will be available approximately two hours after the conclusion of the webcast and for 90 days thereafter.\n\n**USE OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES(9)**\n\nIn evaluating the company’s financial performance and outlook, management uses EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of revenues before reimbursable expenses, adjusted net income, and adjusted diluted earnings per share, which are non-GAAP measures. Management uses these non-GAAP financial measures to gain an understanding of the company's comparative operating performance (when comparing such results with previous periods or forecasts). These non-GAAP financial measures are used by management in their financial and operating decision making because management believes they reflect the company's ongoing business in a manner that allows for meaningful period-to-period comparisons. Management also uses these non-GAAP financial measures when publicly providing their business outlook, for internal management purposes, and as a basis for evaluating potential acquisitions and dispositions. Management believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating Huron’s current operating performance and future prospects in the same manner as management does, if they so choose, and in comparing in a consistent manner Huron’s current financial results with Huron’s past financial results. Investors should recognize that these non-GAAP measures might not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies. These measures should be considered in addition to, and not as a substitute for or superior to, any measure of performance, cash flows or liquidity prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.\n\nManagement has provided its outlook regarding adjusted EBITDA and adjusted diluted earnings per share, both of which are non-GAAP financial measures and exclude certain charges. Management has not reconciled these non-GAAP financial measures to the corresponding GAAP financial measures because guidance for the various reconciling items is not provided. Management is unable to provide guidance for these reconciling items because they cannot determine their probable significance, as certain items are outside of the company's control and cannot be reasonably predicted since these items could vary significantly from period to period. Accordingly, reconciliations to the corresponding GAAP financial measures are not available without unreasonable effort.\n\n**ABOUT HURON**\n\nHuron is a global professional services firm that collaborates with clients to put **possible into practice** by creating sound strategies, optimizing operations, accelerating digital transformation, and empowering businesses and their people to own their future.

Management uses these non-GAAP financial measures to gain an understanding of the company's comparative operating performance (when comparing such results with previous periods or forecasts). These non-GAAP financial measures are used by management in their financial and operating decision making because management believes they reflect the company's ongoing business in a manner that allows for meaningful period-to-period comparisons. Management also uses these non-GAAP financial measures when publicly providing the company's business outlook, for internal management purposes, and as a basis for evaluating potential acquisitions and dispositions. Management believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating Huron’s current operating performance and future prospects in the same manner as management does, if they so choose, and in comparing in a consistent manner Huron’s current financial results with Huron’s past financial results. Investors should recognize that these non-GAAP measures might not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies. These measures should be considered in addition to, and not as a substitute for or superior to, any measure of performance, cash flows or liquidity prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.  \n---|---  \n(10)| The non-GAAP financial measures for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 include an adjustment for the 2024 litigation settlement gain. In the second quarter of 2024, the company settled a litigation matter in which Huron was the plaintiff for $15.0 million, on a pre-tax basis. This $15.0 million settlement gain was recorded as a component of other gains, net on the consolidated statement of operations. The company has excluded from the non-GAAP measures $11.7 million, which is the value of the settlement gain that exceeds the third-party legal costs incurred during 2024 specific to this litigation matter, as this net gain is not indicative of the ongoing performance of Huron's business. Of the $3.3 million third-party legal costs incurred for this matter in 2024, $2.7 million was incurred in the first quarter and $0.6 million was incurred in the second quarter. Third-party legal expenses are recorded as a component of selling, general and administrative expenses on the statement of operations. Third-party legal costs incurred for this litigation matter during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 were $1.2 million and $2.2 million, respectively.  \n  \nView source version on [businesswire.com](http://businesswire.com): [https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20241029303264/en/](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20241029303264/en/)\n\n**MEDIA CONTACT** Allie Bovis abovis@hcg.com **INVESTOR CONTACT** John D.
