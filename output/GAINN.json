These fees were accrued/(reversed) in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles (\"U.S. GAAP\"), where such amounts were not contractually due under the terms of the investment advisory agreement for the respective periods.

The Company uses this non-GAAP financial measure internally in analyzing financial results and believes it is useful to investors as an additional tool to evaluate ongoing results and trends for the Company.  \n(C) |  Includes $0.70 per common share of distributions declared and unpaid as of September 30, 2024, as such distribution was a supplemental distribution declared on September 17, 2024 with a record date of October 4, 2024 and a pay date of October 15, 2024.  \n(D) |  Estimates of tax characterization made on a quarterly basis may not be representative of the actual tax characterization of distributions for the full year. Estimates made on a quarterly basis are updated as of each interim reporting date.  \n  \n**Highlights for the Quarter:** During the quarter ended September 30, 2024, the following significant events occurred:\n\n  * **Portfolio Activity:**\n\n    * In July 2024, we invested an additional $18.5 million through secured first lien debt in Nocturne Luxury Villas, Inc. to fund an add-on acquisition.\n\n    * In September 2024, we exited our investment in Nth Degree Investment Group, LLC., which resulted in success fee income of $0.1 million, a realized gain on our preferred equity of $42.3 million and the repayment of our debt investment of $25.0 million.\n\n\n\n\n  * **Distributions and Dividends:**\n\n    * Paid an $0.08 per common share distribution to common stockholders in each of July, August and September 2024.\n\n    * Declared a $0.70 per common share distribution to common stockholders in September 2024 paid in October 2024.\n\n\n\n\n**Second Quarter Results:** Net investment income for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 was $7.3 million, or $0.20 per weighted-average common share, compared to net investment income of $12.4 million, or $0.34 per weighted-average common share, for the quarter ended June 30, 2024. This decrease was a result of an increase in total expenses, net of credits, primarily due to an increase in accruals for capital gains-based incentive fees and income-based incentive fees, partially offset by an increase in total investment income in the current quarter.\n\nTotal investment income for the quarters ended September 30, 2024 and June 30, 2024 was $22.6 million and $22.2 million, respectively. The increase quarter over quarter was due to a $0.4 million increase in interest income, primarily due to certain loans to portfolio companies being placed on non-accrual status during the previous quarter.\n\nTotal expenses, net of credits, for the quarters ended September 30, 2024 and June 30, 2024 was $15.3 million and $9.8 million, respectively. The increase quarter over quarter was primarily due to a $5.4 million increase in capital gains-based incentive fees in the current quarter, as a result of the net impact of realized and unrealized gains and losses, and a $0.6 million increase in income-based incentive fees. These increases were partially offset by a $0.4 million decrease in other expenses, primarily due to a decrease in bad debt expense due to certain loans to portfolio companies being placed on non-accrual status during the previous quarter.\n\nNet asset value per common share as of September 30, 2024 was $12.49, compared to $13.01 as of June 30, 2024. The decrease quarter over quarter was primarily due to:\n\n  * $34.5 million, or $0.94 per common share, of distributions declared to common shareholders, of which $8.8 million, or $0.24 per common share, was paid to common shareholders as of September 30, 2024, and $25.7 million, or $0.70 per common share, was paid in October 2024; and\n\n  * $34.1 million, or $0.93 per common share, of net unrealized depreciation on investments, of which unrealized depreciation of $38.0 million, or $1.04 per common share, was due to the reversal of unrealized appreciation on the exit of Nth Degree, and unrealized appreciation of $3.9 million, or $0.11 per common share, was due to unrealized appreciation of investments; partially offset by\n\n  * $42.3 million, or $1.15 per common share, of realized gains on investments; and\n\n  * $7.3 million, or $0.20 per common share, of net investment income.\n\n\n\n\n**Subsequent Events:** After September 30, 2024, the following significant events occurred:\n\n  * **Distributions and Dividends:**\n\n    * In October 2024, our Board of Directors declared the following monthly distributions to common stockholders:\n\n\n**Record Date** |  **Payment Date** |  **Distribution per Common Share**  \n---|---|---  \nOctober 22, 2024 |  October 31, 2024 |  0.08  \nNovember 20, 2024 |  November 29, 2024 |  0.08  \nDecember 20, 2024 |  December 31, 2024 |  0.08  \n**Total for the Quarter:** |  **$** |  **0.24**  \n  \n**Non-GAAP Financial Measure - Adjusted Net Investment Income:** On a supplemental basis, the Company discloses Adjusted net investment income, including on a weighted-average per share basis, which is a financial measure that is calculated and presented on a basis of methodology other than in accordance with GAAP. Adjusted net investment income represents net investment income, excluding capital gains-based incentive fees. The Company uses this non-GAAP financial measure internally in analyzing financial results and believes that this non-GAAP financial measure is useful to investors as an additional tool to evaluate ongoing results and trends for the Company. The Company's investment advisory agreement provides that a capital gains-based incentive fee is determined and paid annually with respect to realized capital gains (but not unrealized appreciation) to the extent such realized capital gains exceed realized capital losses and unrealized depreciation on investments for such year. However, under GAAP, a capital gains-based incentive fee is accrued if realized capital gains and unrealized appreciation of investments exceed realized capital losses and unrealized depreciation of investments. Refer to Note 4 - _Related Party Transactions_ in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for further discussion. The Company believes that Adjusted net investment income is a useful indicator of operations exclusive of any capital gains-based incentive fees, as net investment income does not include realized or unrealized investment activity associated with the capital gains-based incentive fee.\n\nThe following table provides a reconciliation of net investment income (the most comparable GAAP measure) to Adjusted net investment income for the periods presented (_dollars in thousands, except per share amounts; unaudited)_ :\n\n**For the quarter ended**  \n---  \n**September 30, 2024** |  **June 30, 2024**  \n**Amount** |  **Per Share** **Amount** |  **Amount** |  **Per Share** **Amount**  \nNet investment income |  **$** |  **7,291** |  **$** |  **0.20** |  $ |  12,414 |  $ |  0.34  \nCapital gains-based incentive fee |  **1,638** |  **0.04** |  (3,788 |  ) |  (0.10 |  )  \nAdjusted net investment income |  **$** |  **8,929** |  **$** |  **0.24** |  $ |  8,626 |  $ |  0.24  \nWeighted-average shares of common stock outstanding - basic and diluted |  **36,688,667** |  36,688,667  \n  \nAdjusted net investment income may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other companies, as it is a non-GAAP financial measure that is not based on a comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles and therefore may be defined differently by other companies. In addition, Adjusted net investment income should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures determined in accordance with GAAP.\n\n**Conference Call:** The Company will hold its earnings release conference call on Friday, November 8, 2024, at 8:30 a.m. Eastern Time.

These fees were accrued/(reversed) in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles (\"U.S. GAAP\"), where such amounts were not contractually due under the terms of the investment advisory agreement for the respective periods. Also see discussion under _Non-GAAP Financial Measure - Adjusted Net Investment Income_ below.  \n---|---  \n(B) |  See Non-GAAP Financial Measure - Adjusted Net Investment Income, below, for a description of this non-GAAP measure and a reconciliation from Net investment income to Adjusted net investment income, including on a weighted-average per share basis. The Company uses this non-GAAP financial measure internally in analyzing financial results and believes it is useful to investors as an additional tool to evaluate ongoing results and trends for the Company.  \n(C) |  Includes $0.70 per common share of distributions declared and unpaid as of September 30, 2024, as such distribution was a supplemental distribution declared on September 17, 2024 with a record date of October 4, 2024 and a pay date of October 15, 2024.  \n(D) |  Estimates of tax characterization made on a quarterly basis may not be representative of the actual tax characterization of distributions for the full year. Estimates made on a quarterly basis are updated as of each interim reporting date.  \n  \n**Highlights for the Quarter:** During the quarter ended September 30, 2024, the following significant events occurred:\n\n  * **Portfolio Activity:**\n\n    * In July 2024, we invested an additional $18.5 million through secured first lien debt in Nocturne Luxury Villas, Inc. to fund an add-on acquisition.\n\n    * In September 2024, we exited our investment in Nth Degree Investment Group, LLC., which resulted in success fee income of $0.1 million, a realized gain on our preferred equity of $42.3 million and the repayment of our debt investment of $25.0 million.\n\n\n\n\n  * **Distributions and Dividends:**\n\n    * Paid an $0.08 per common share distribution to common stockholders in each of July, August and September 2024.\n\n    * Declared a $0.70 per common share distribution to common stockholders in September 2024 paid in October 2024.\n\n\n\n\n**Second Quarter Results:** Net investment income for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 was $7.3 million, or $0.20 per weighted-average common share, compared to net investment income of $12.4 million, or $0.34 per weighted-average common share, for the quarter ended June 30, 2024. This decrease was a result of an increase in total expenses, net of credits, primarily due to an increase in accruals for capital gains-based incentive fees and income-based incentive fees, partially offset by an increase in total investment income in the current quarter.\n\nTotal investment income for the quarters ended September 30, 2024 and June 30, 2024 was $22.6 million and $22.2 million, respectively. The increase quarter over quarter was due to a $0.4 million increase in interest income, primarily due to certain loans to portfolio companies being placed on non-accrual status during the previous quarter.\n\nTotal expenses, net of credits, for the quarters ended September 30, 2024 and June 30, 2024 was $15.3 million and $9.8 million, respectively. The increase quarter over quarter was primarily due to a $5.4 million increase in capital gains-based incentive fees in the current quarter, as a result of the net impact of realized and unrealized gains and losses, and a $0.6 million increase in income-based incentive fees. These increases were partially offset by a $0.4 million decrease in other expenses, primarily due to a decrease in bad debt expense due to certain loans to portfolio companies being placed on non-accrual status during the previous quarter.\n\nNet asset value per common share as of September 30, 2024 was $12.49, compared to $13.01 as of June 30, 2024. The decrease quarter over quarter was primarily due to:\n\n  * $34.5 million, or $0.94 per common share, of distributions declared to common shareholders, of which $8.8 million, or $0.24 per common share, was paid to common shareholders as of September 30, 2024, and $25.7 million, or $0.70 per common share, was paid in October 2024; and\n\n  * $34.1 million, or $0.93 per common share, of net unrealized depreciation on investments, of which unrealized depreciation of $38.0 million, or $1.04 per common share, was due to the reversal of unrealized appreciation on the exit of Nth Degree, and unrealized appreciation of $3.9 million, or $0.11 per common share, was due to unrealized appreciation of investments; partially offset by\n\n  * $42.3 million, or $1.15 per common share, of realized gains on investments; and\n\n  * $7.3 million, or $0.20 per common share, of net investment income.\n\n\n\n\n**Subsequent Events:** After September 30, 2024, the following significant events occurred:\n\n  * **Distributions and Dividends:**\n\n    * In October 2024, our Board of Directors declared the following monthly distributions to common stockholders:\n\n\n**Record Date** |  **Payment Date** |  **Distribution per Common Share**  \n---|---|---  \nOctober 22, 2024 |  October 31, 2024 |  0.08  \nNovember 20, 2024 |  November 29, 2024 |  0.08  \nDecember 20, 2024 |  December 31, 2024 |  0.08  \n**Total for the Quarter:** |  **$** |  **0.24**  \n  \n**Non-GAAP Financial Measure - Adjusted Net Investment Income:** On a supplemental basis, the Company discloses Adjusted net investment income, including on a weighted-average per share basis, which is a financial measure that is calculated and presented on a basis of methodology other than in accordance with GAAP. Adjusted net investment income represents net investment income, excluding capital gains-based incentive fees. The Company uses this non-GAAP financial measure internally in analyzing financial results and believes that this non-GAAP financial measure is useful to investors as an additional tool to evaluate ongoing results and trends for the Company. The Company's investment advisory agreement provides that a capital gains-based incentive fee is determined and paid annually with respect to realized capital gains (but not unrealized appreciation) to the extent such realized capital gains exceed realized capital losses and unrealized depreciation on investments for such year. However, under GAAP, a capital gains-based incentive fee is accrued if realized capital gains and unrealized appreciation of investments exceed realized capital losses and unrealized depreciation of investments. Refer to Note 4 - _Related Party Transactions_ in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for further discussion. The Company believes that Adjusted net investment income is a useful indicator of operations exclusive of any capital gains-based incentive fees, as net investment income does not include realized or unrealized investment activity associated with the capital gains-based incentive fee.\n\nThe following table provides a reconciliation of net investment income (the most comparable GAAP measure) to Adjusted net investment income for the periods presented (_dollars in thousands, except per share amounts; unaudited)_ :\n\n**For the quarter ended**  \n---  \n**September 30, 2024** |  **June 30, 2024**  \n**Amount** |  **Per Share** **Amount** |  **Amount** |  **Per Share** **Amount**  \nNet investment income |  **$** |  **7,291** |  **$** |  **0.20** |  $ |  12,414 |  $ |  0.34  \nCapital gains-based incentive fee |  **1,638** |  **0.04** |  (3,788 |  ) |  (0.10 |  )  \nAdjusted net investment income |  **$** |  **8,929** |  **$** |  **0.24** |  $ |  8,626 |  $ |  0.24  \nWeighted-average shares of common stock outstanding - basic and diluted |  **36,688,667** |  36,688,667  \n  \nAdjusted net investment income may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other companies, as it is a non-GAAP financial measure that is not based on a comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles and therefore may be defined differently by other companies. In addition, Adjusted net investment income should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures determined in accordance with GAAP.\n\n**Conference Call:** The Company will hold its earnings release conference call on Friday, November 8, 2024, at 8:30 a.m. Eastern Time.
