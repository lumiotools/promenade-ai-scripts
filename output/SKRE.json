Year to date, the fund has returned close to 100%, as the broader markets seem to be stuck in a prolonged sell off.\nRelated: Anti-ARK ETF Trades Above Cathie Wood’s Flagship for First Time&media=)\n\nMatthew Tuttle has fantastic timing.\n\nLast November, the CEO of Tuttle Capital Management launched the **Tuttle Capital Short Innovation ETF (SARK)**. Year to date, the fund has returned close to 100%, as the broader markets seem to be stuck in a prolonged sell off.\n\n**Related:** [Anti-ARK ETF Trades Above Cathie Wood’s Flagship for First Time](/etfs/anti-ark-etf-trades-above-cathie-wood-s-flagship-first-time)\n\nThe fund is better known as \"Short the ARKK.\" It is literally shorting the **ARK Innovation ETF** (ARKK) on a daily basis through swap exposure directly on ARKK. Swap contracts are derivatives similar to forward contracts.\n\nWhy choose to put ARKK in the crosshairs? Tuttle recognized a fund that got far out over its skies. It's run by Cathie Wood, the ETF Industry's appointed “it” portfolio manager. In 2020, at the height of the pandemic, ARKK invested in small technology stocks meant to be part of the disruptive wave of innovation that promised outsized returns for early investors. The fund rocketed 157%, according to Morningstar.\n\n**Related:** [ARKK Is Epicenter of Market Rout as ETF Nears Covid Low](/etfs/arkk-epicenter-market-rout-etf-nears-covid-low)\n\nIn an industry with few superstars, Cathie Wood stood out. Posting one of the best annual returns on Wall Street is enough to get people talking about you, but this was also a rare female portfolio manager, one who gives away her team’s research for free and speaks with a certainty about the coming waves of disruptive technology that give her a guru-like status among some investors.\n\nShe has many fans in the industry, but also many skeptics. Tuttle realized there was an audience for a portfolio betting against her fund. At the end of 2021, when SARK launched, the trend started to turn against ARKK.\n\n![SARK vs ARKK chart](/sites/wealthmanagement.com/files/SARK_ARKK_chart.png)\n\nYear-to-date, the tech-filled Nasdaq is down 28% and the S&P 500 Index has lost 18%. Meanwhile, ARKK has plunged nearly 60%, as of May 11. Over the past five years, an investor in the S&P 500 (62%) would have had a higher return than an investor in ARKK (41%) by some 20 percentage points.\n\nTuttle's firm now has $600 million in assets under management, with SARK alone holding $400 million. In comparison, ARKK holds $9.2 billion, according to Morningstar.\n\nI sat down with Tuttle at the recent Exchange conference in Miami Beach, Fla. We discussed SARK, his views on the economy, the stock market and his other funds.\n\n**WealthManagement.com: Why is SARK the ETF of the moment?**\n\n**Matthew Tuttle** : The Federal Reserve is raising interest rates and will be for a while. Interest rates are kryptonite to the types of companies that ARKK is investing in, speculative, unprofitable technology. We saw what was going on with the Fed. We knew they were going to raise rates and that the market was overdue for a correction. While it's bad for Apple, Amazon and Microsoft, it's really bad for Zoom and (virtual-health company) Teledock. (_Editor’s note: On April 28, Teledoc’s Teledoc's stock plunged 47% on a bad earnings report. It's one of ARKK's top holdings._)\n\nIf you're worried about the market, and quite frankly you should be, this is a good way to hedge your portfolio, because the overall trend is down, and that's a not good sign. I believe this market sucks and I would rather be short the market and own SARK.\n\nGrowth and speculative stocks keep getting killed. Then last week, they took everything out and just crushed it. Utilities and consumer defensive stocks had been hanging in. Now, they are not.\n\n**WM: Your website says the ETF's structure doesn't fully address the opportunities and risks in today's market. So what are those opportunities and risk?**\n\n**MT:** A few weeks ago, there were still pockets. You could buy utilities, consumer defense, energy, commodities and gold. But right now, there's nowhere to go, all of that stuff is getting hammered. And the traditional ETF hedges aren't great. You've got inverse S&P 500 and the inverse NASDAQ. I think we're in a bear market and that it's going to get worse. In a bear market they will do well, but at the end of the day, you're still in the best of the best stocks. Whereas with SARK, you're in the speculative stuff. And if this market continues to sink, the speculative stuff is going to get hurt more than Apple and Microsoft. How many innovative companies from 1999 are no longer with us? It's a lot.\n\n**WM: Do you think we're entering a recession or is this all interest-rate related?**\n\n**MT** : I look at what the market is telling me. And the market is telling me it thinks we're going in a recession. So, I'm not going to argue with that. The market is being extremely clear on the fact that it's worried about the consumer because consumer-discretionary stocks are getting savaged. They're worried about anything home related, which is interest-rate related certainly, but it's also consumer-related. So, I think we are entering a recession because the market is telling me that.\n\n**WM: Let's jump to another speculative market. Three of your ETFs track the market for SPACs (special purpose acquisition companies). SPACs are pools of capital that list on a stock exchange with the purpose of merging with a private company in order to bring it public without an initial public offering. The Short De-SPAC ETF (SOGU) shorts another Tuttle fund, the De-SPAC ETF (DSPC), which is a pure-play index fund of post-merger SPACs, such as electric-vehicle company Lucid Group. SOGU is up 41.4% year to date, according to Morningstar.**\n\n**MT:** There was a bubble in the SPAC market. Investors were looking at SPACs the same way they looked at meme stocks. Anytime a SPAC announced a merger, it popped. It was crazy. I think the SPAC market sentiment is awful and for a good reason. On the pre-merger side there are too many SPACS looking for deals and not enough deals. So, you're going to see some SPACs liquidate which means, they give shareholders back their money. It's not a bad thing, but from a PR standpoint, it's not a good look.\n\nAnother reason is you're going to see a lot of them desperate to make a deal and they will make crappy deals. They will buy companies that are just awful and from a PR standpoint that's not a good look, either. Deals came public at $10 and now they trade for $2, like Lordstown Motors. Eventually, you'll be left with a few guys who got the best deals and will dominate the market.\n\nTAGS: [People](/news/people)\n\n[0 comments](javascript:void\\(0\\))\n\nHide comments\n\n![](https://www.wealthmanagement.com/sites/all/themes/penton_core_theme/images/account-default-image.png)\n\n[](/)\n\nComment *\n\n[Switch to plain text editor](javascript:void\\(0\\);)\n\n[More information about text formats](/filter/tips)\n\nText format  CommentsPlain text\n\n### Comments\n\n  * Allowed HTML tags: <em> <strong> <blockquote> <br> <p>\n\n\n\n### Plain text\n\n  * No HTML tags allowed.\n  * Web page addresses and e-mail addresses turn into links automatically.\n  * Lines and paragraphs break automatically.\n\n\n\n[Publish](#)[Log in or register to comment](/penton_modal/nojs/login)\n\nSave\n\nLeave this field blank \n\nRelated\n\n[![Tom Lee chief investment officer at Fundstrat Capital](https://www.wealthmanagement.com/sites/wealthmanagement.com/files/styles/article_related_thumb_retina/public/Tom-Lee-fundstrat-etfs.jpg?itok=edJiCrtZ)Wall Street’s Uber Bull Tom Lee Makes Next Bold Bet in ETF EraNov 26, 2024](/etfs/wall-street-s-uber-bull-tom-lee-makes-next-bold-bet-etf-era)[![compass](https://www.wealthmanagement.com/sites/wealthmanagement.com/files/styles/article_related_thumb_retina/public/mustreads-2025-outlook.jpg?itok=MKSRM_kg)10 Investment Must Reads for This Week (Nov. 26, 2024)Nov 26, 2024](/etfs/10-investment-must-reads-week-nov-26-2024)[![Adjusted for Risk Zephyr podcast](https://www.wealthmanagement.com/sites/wealthmanagement.com/files/styles/article_related_thumb_retina/public/adjusted-for-risk-promo-2023-USE.png?itok=VMuF_Rn_)Adjusted for Risk: Leveraging Data to Enhance Investment Decision MakingNov 26, 2024](/etfs/adjusted-risk-leveraging-data-enhance-investment-decision-making)[![Apollo, Citadel Flag Hidden Costs of Passive Investing](https://www.wealthmanagement.com/sites/wealthmanagement.com/files/styles/article_related_thumb_retina/public/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/NYSE-trader-on-floor-Getty.jpg?itok=ZWzTsZ0x)Apollo, Citadel Flag Hidden Costs of Passive InvestingNov 22, 2024](/etfs/apollo-citadel-flag-hidden-costs-passive-investing)\n\n  * [Load More](/technology/boostedai-building-agentic-ai-wealth-managers-raises-15m?parent=144223&infscr=1)\n\n\n\nLoading... \n"

The world of finance is a multifaceted one, with countless perspectives on how to navigate it successfully. In the spirit of this REBELS edition of FOLIO, we firmly believe in the importance of considering contrasting viewpoints, even those that don't necessarily align with our own. That's precisely why we've chosen to feature Matthew Tuttle in this piece. In today's divided world, where investment strategies and social responsibility often converge, we thought it essential to listen to someone who dares to challenge consensus.\n\nMatthew is a forthright, data-driven ETF trader with a unique approach that not only generates returns but also challenges the status quo. We found Tuttle's perspective intriguing, and we believe his insights will provide you, our dear readers, with food for thought on what is undeniably a divisive topic in today's financial world. It is, after all, your prerogative to form your own conclusions, but we thank Matthew for giving us a fresh perspective and hope you enjoy this exploration of his unconventional approach.\n\n![AI Investments](https://folio.capecapital.com/hs-fs/hubfs/FOLIO%20Edition%203/Matthew%20Tuttle/AI%20Investments.jpg?width=2100&height=1200&name=AI%20Investments.jpg)\n\n‘Past performance is no guarantee of future results’ is a warning statement plastered on almost every piece of investment literature. Yet, argues Matthew Tuttle, founder of Connecticut-based Tuttle Capital Management, that’s precisely how the majority of the sector operates. ‘It’s the biggest single mistake investors make. Think about it: if you put money in any type of investment, does it matter what it did in the past, or is it only what it does in the future that’s important?’ Instead, what he does is use ‘forward looking due diligence’ (or as he calls it, common sense) to evaluate the reasons why aportfolio has performed in a certain way. ‘It’s about looking at what happened in the past but with a forward mindset and asking, is that sustainable in the future and what could go wrong.’\n\nThis methodical, data driven approach extends to his wider, overall investment strategy which eschews the current penchant for having ESG within an investment portfolio. ‘When I started in financial services you hired a broker to make you money, full stop. In the 90s that started to shift. It didn’t start to shift because broker firms realised there was a better way for clients; it started to shift because they realised there’s a better way for them. The goal became to have a globally diversified portfolio, managed according to risk tolerance and goals, compared to some benchmark which is not 0. If the market goes down 30 percent and you’re down 28 percent, they say they did a good job. To me, that’s unwise. When I saw that happening, I realised I had to do this stuff myself,’ explains Matthew, who set up his first advisory service company, Tuttle Wealth Management, in 2003. \n\n![Wall Street](https://folio.capecapital.com/hs-fs/hubfs/FOLIO%20Edition%203/Matthew%20Tuttle/Wall%20Street.jpg?width=2100&height=1200&name=Wall%20Street.jpg)\n\nAn outspoken advocate of keeping investments and social responsibility separate, Tuttle believes; ‘You don’t invest to change the world. If you want to change the world, make as much money as you can and use that to contribute to whatever cause is important to you. Don’t do it with your investments,’ says Matthew, who reasons that businesses spending their time and resources on environmental and political issues could potentially hurt their reputation, and therefore lower their stock price. ‘I think the data is compelling about the possibility of politically neutral stocks outperforming those that engage in politics. The other issue I have is that ESG has morphed so now there are some huge asset management firms with amazing power because they own so much of the outstanding shares of these companies. They have zero accountability and I think that’s an extremely slippery slope.’\n\nIn 2015, Matthew moved into managing publicly traded ETFs – quite literally putting his money where his mouth is. ‘My investment strategy is that you need to be solely focused on making money. My goal every day is to make money: I don’t care if the market’s up, the market’s down or the market’s sideways. The benchmark is not the market, the benchmark is zero,’ he emphasises. His advice to individual investors includes being agnostic between long and short, ignoring the traditional asset allocation of a 60/40 portfolio and that bonds do not protect stock. Above all though, his biggest tip is that the consensus is usually wrong about the markets. ‘If you take a bunch of people and ask them what the market’s going to do, they’ll probably be wrong.’ \n\n![Future](https://folio.capecapital.com/hs-fs/hubfs/FOLIO%20Edition%203/Matthew%20Tuttle/Future.jpg?width=2100&height=1200&name=Future.jpg)\n\nOne person who Matthew thinks is more wrong than right is Jim Cramer, who presents the ‘Mad Money’ show on CNBC where he offers viewers investment advice. ‘Jim Cramer is the consensus on steroids. He’s forced to swing at every pitch – whether it’s a question about oil stock, semiconductor stock or food stock, and throughout time he has made some historically horrific calls,’ Matthew says, citing Cramer’s recommendation to buy stock in Silicon Valley Bank a month before it went bankrupt as an example. ‘What really irritates me is that he’s treated with deference. Somebody’s got to take the other side.’ The way he does this is through launching ETFs – in this case the Inverse Cramer which takes the opposite investing position of the host’s major calls. If Cramer says buy, the fund shorts it; if Cramer says don’t buy, the fund goes long.\n\nIt’s not the first time that Matthew has successfully taken the other side. He has previous form with the famous Short Innovation Daily ETF (now owned by AXS Investments), which bets against fund manager Cathie Wood. ‘She came out with a thesis that was initially brilliant, based on investing in the next generation of innovation. Right after Covid, interest rates went down, the American market zoomed up and those companies took off,’ he recalls. ‘They are very speculative and sensitive to interest rates so I knew it wouldn’t continue yet I saw the media bringing her out and calling her the next Warren Buffett. That gets my back up because there can never be another Warren Buffett; the landscape that allowed that doesn’t exist anymore. I knew people who bought into her fund at its height with more than they should, and could see that they would get hurt. There was also zero risk management which no-one cares about when they’re making money.’\n\nHis latest soon-to-launch products include a short on regional banks, and a long and short AI ETF, both aimed at individual retail traders. ‘Because of the bad investment advice on Wall Street, there’s a massive amount of individual investors who trade on their own and have created a community through social media, which I’m part of. It’s my incubator for a lot of the ideas I come up with,’ he says. ‘AI will change all our lives in some way so from an investment standpoint, it’s going to be a dominant theme for quite some time.’ He is also creating another attention-grabbing ETF, named Go Woke Go Broke, which will invest in companies that are politically neutral. \n\nWhat motivates his opinionated stance? ‘Wall Street is extremely unkind to people who aren’t educated. When they try to learn more about their finances, they turn on CNBC and get ridiculous advice. There’s nowhere for these people to go so they get taken advantage of. In my career on Wall Street, I saw it happen again and again,’ says Matthew, who previously did stints at Bear Stearns as well as insurance companies including Prudential Securities and MetLife. ‘Nobody is looking out for the little guys and somebody has to. I’ve got the ambition for it and I don’t mind pissing people off. I want to create investment products that I would use myself. At the same time, if I can take the other side of some hypocrisy, so much the better.’\n\n[Matthew Tuttle](https://www.linkedin.com/in/matthew-tuttle-2139091/) is the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Investment Officer of [Tuttle Capital Management.](https://tuttlecap.com)\n"

The Fund will also invest, under normal circumstances, at least 80% of its net assets, plus borrowings for investment purposes, in exchange listed common stock or American Depository Receipts (“ADRs”) of companies headquartered in Europe who derive at least 50% of their revenue from the manufacture, service, supply and distribution of aeronautical equipment, components, hardware, software or electronic systems; and equipment, systems, components, infrastructure support services, and hardware, software and electronics that directly support civil and military defense efforts.\n\nAs Of:\n\nNovember 27, 2024\n\nMM/DD/YYYY\n\nPrimary Exchange\n\nCboe\n\nNumber of Holdings\n\n13\n\n18\n\nShares Outstanding\n\n30000\n\nXX,XXX\n\n30-Day Median Bid-Ask\n\n0.53\n\nXX%\n\nCUSIP\n\n84858T772\n\nInception Date\n\n10/22/2024\n\nAs of:\n\nNovember 27, 2024\n\nMM/DD/YYYY\n\n## Performance\n\nNov 27, 2024\n\nMarket Price:\n\n24.82\n\n$XX.XX\n\n(Change: \n\n1.10\n\nXX.XX%\n\n)\n\nNAV Price:\n\n24.79\n\n$XX.XX\n\n(Change: \n\n1.17\n\nXX.XX%\n\n)\n\n{\"labels\":[\"2024-10-21\",\"2024-10-22\",\"2024-10-23\",\"2024-10-24\",\"2024-10-25\",\"2024-10-28\",\"2024-10-29\",\"2024-10-30\",\"2024-10-31\",\"2024-11-01\",\"2024-11-04\",\"2024-11-05\",\"2024-11-06\",\"2024-11-07\",\"2024-11-08\",\"2024-11-11\",\"2024-11-12\",\"2024-11-13\",\"2024-11-14\",\"2024-11-15\",\"2024-11-18\",\"2024-11-19\",\"2024-11-20\",\"2024-11-21\",\"2024-11-22\",\"2024-11-25\",\"2024-11-26\",\"2024-11-27\"],\"mp_data\":[\"25\",\"25.1748\",\"24.8547\",\"24.9671\",\"24.8024\",\"24.9366\",\"24.8137\",\"24.9899\",\"24.6832\",\"24.8455\",\"24.7356\",\"25.3767\",\"25.4568\",\"26.1382\",\"25.74\",\"26.1128\",\"25.63\",\"25.23\",\"24.8402\",\"24.6006\",\"24.7989\",\"24.908\",\"24.7781\",\"24.9048\",\"24.7939\",\"24.7001\",\"24.5508\",\"24.8197\"],\"nav_data\":[\"25\",\"25.1102\",\"24.83968\",\"24.95297\",\"24.75806\",\"24.92656\",\"24.78343\",\"24.97524\",\"24.63319\",\"24.78538\",\"24.6546\",\"25.34581\",\"25.42828\",\"26.09028\",\"25.73461\",\"26.09704\",\"25.51204\",\"25.14884\",\"24.71057\",\"24.58668\",\"24.79601\",\"24.88728\",\"24.76392\",\"24.89243\",\"24.79198\",\"24.56193\",\"24.5067\",\"24.79421\"]}\n\n1M3M6M1YSince Inception\n\nThank you!

Past performance does not guarantee future results.****The investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate so that an investor’s shares, when sold or redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost and current performance may be lower or higher than the performance quoted. Performance current to the most recent month-end can be obtained above. Returns less than one year are not annualized.**\n\nMarket performance is the price at which shares in the ETF can be brought or sold on the exchanges during trading hours, while the net asset value (NAV) represents the value of each share’s portion of the fund’s underlying assets and cash at the end of the trading day.\n\n## Top Ten Holdings\n\nAs of:\n\nNovember 27, 2024\n\nMM/DD/YYYY\n\n[Download Full Holdings (CSV)](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/export?id=1ChYTzE1d2L8oXShcYXXgjiheYZhOsb5HfhyxoLKlu1U&exportFormat=csv)\n\nTicker\n\nSecurity Description\n\nCUSIP\n\n% of Funds\n\nShares\n\nMarket Value\n\nEADSY\n\nAIRBUS GROUP SE\n\nN0280G100\n\n22.12\n\n2541\n\n93661.26\n\nSAFRY\n\nSAFRAN SA-UNSPON ADR\n\n786584102\n\n21.08\n\n1554\n\n89261.76\n\nRYCEY\n\nROLLS-ROYCE HOLDINGS-SP ADR\n\n775781206\n\n10.54\n\n6505\n\n44624.3\n\nBAESY\n\nBAE SYSTEMS PLC -SPON ADR\n\n05523R107\n\n10.3\n\n669\n\n43612.11\n\nRNMBY\n\nRHEINMETALL AG-UNSP ADR\n\n76206K107\n\n8.14\n\n265\n\n34457.95\n\nTHLLY\n\nTHALES SA - UNSP ADR\n\n883219206\n\n7.94\n\n1140\n\n33641.4\n\nMTUAY\n\nMTU AERO ENGINES-UNSPON ADR\n\n62473G102\n\n6.17\n\n159\n\n26147.55\n\nFINMY\n\nFINMECCANICA SPA-UNSPN ADR\n\n52660W101\n\n5.59\n\n1800\n\n23670\n\nSAABY\n\nSaab AB\n\nW72838175\n\n4\n\n1557\n\n16940.16\n\nHAGHY\n\nHensoldt AG\n\n42701C107\n\n1.37\n\n303\n\n5808.51\n\nFund holdings and allocations are subject to change and should not be considered recommendations to buy or sell any security.\n\n## Fund Documents\n\n[Fact Sheet](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/66951824fcfe7ed75e19e861/6744a66a8ec8012936fa463b_TCM_EUAD_FactSheet_103124_Nov15edit.pdf)\n\n[Prospectus](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/66951824fcfe7ed75e19e861/671950c51379b9a011d281d5_Prospectus_1_Select%20STOXX_102124_web.pdf)\n\n[SAI](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/66951824fcfe7ed75e19e861/671910849befb981876b327e_SAI_1_Select%20STOXX_093024_web.pdf)\n\n[Summary Prospectus](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/66951824fcfe7ed75e19e861/671950af8582caa6e455e221_Summary%20Prospectus_1_Select%20STOXX_102124_web.pdf)\n\n## Premium/Discount\n\nAs of:\n\nNovember 27, 2024\n\nMM/DD/YYYY\n\nPremium/Discount\n\n0.1\n\nCurrent Quarter\n\nThank you!

The index is built on a rules-based methodology, selecting companies across various sectors that demonstrate a strong commitment to shareholder interests. By focusing on metrics such as dividends, buybacks, and capital returns, the index aims to capture the performance of companies that align their strategies with shareholder success. This provides investors with a targeted approach to investing in businesses that emphasize shareholder value above other considerations.\n\n![a headshot of matthew tuttle](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/66c49b91e088d9049f85bc03/66c60e8ac653aad5b4ccfde0_tuttle-headshot.webp)\n\nTuttle Capital Management\n\n## About the Advisor\n\nMatthew Tuttle is the Managing Member and Chief Investment Officer of Tuttle Capital Management, LLC.

The Advisor attempts to consistently apply leverage to increase the Fund’s exposure to -200% of the KRE ETF by entering into total return swaps that provide a -200% return on the KRE ETF, and expects to rebalance the Fund’s holdings daily to maintain such exposure.\n\n**Single Trading Day Risk.** The Fund seeks daily investment results, before fees and expenses, of 200% of the inverse (or opposite) of the daily performance of the KRE ETF. The Fund does not seek to achieve its stated investment objective for a period of time different than a trading day.\n\nSingle Trading Day Risk Disclosure\n\n![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/6543ddc6ee172d807e6f3986/6543f1d64a9e51c8cc830dea_market-precision.webp)\n\n![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/6543ddc6ee172d807e6f3986/6543f1d6779dc8d637706055_sector-specific.webp)\n\n### Sector-Specific Investment\n\nWith a focus on the regional banking sector, SKRE provides investors with a targeted approach to potentially profit from downturns in this specific market segment. By concentrating on this sector, investors can take advantage of the unique dynamics and trends within regional banking.\n\n**Concentration Risk.** The KRE ETF's assets may be concentrated in an industry or group of industries, but only to the extent that the KRE ETF's underlying Index concentrates in a particular industry or group of industries. When the KRE ETF focuses its investments in a particular industry or sector, financial, economic, business, and other developments affecting issuers in that industry, market, or economic sector will have a greater effect on the KRE ETF than if it had not focused its assets in that industry, market, or economic sector, which may increase the volatility of the KRE ETF. \n\nConcentration Risk Disclosure\n\n### Optimized for Daily Performance\n\nSKRE is designed with daily investment goals in mind, offering investors a tool to potentially capitalize on short-term market movements in the regional banking sector. The Fund may be more suitable for knowledgeable investors who understand the potential consequences of seeking daily inverse (-2X) investment results, understand the risks associated with the use of shorting and are willing to monitor their portfolios frequently.\n\n![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/6543ddc6ee172d807e6f3986/6543f1d614f3d5695b13982f_daily-performance.webp)\n\n**Knowledgeable Risk.** The Fund is not suitable for all investors. The Fund is designed to be utilized only by knowledgeable investors who understand the potential consequences of seeking daily inverse (-2X) investment results, understand the risks associated with the use of shorting and are willing to monitor their portfolios frequently. The Fund is not intended to be used by, and is not appropriate for, investors who do not intend to actively monitor and manage their portfolios. For periods longer than a single day, the Fund will lose money if the KRE ETF’s performance is flat, and it is possible that the Fund will lose money even if the KRE ETF’s performance decreases over a period longer than a single day. An investor could lose the full principal value of his/her investment within a single day if the price of the KRE ETF goes up by more than 50% in one trading day.\n\n![a headshot of matthew tuttle](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/6543ddc6ee172d807e6f3986/654504be3073444b754c4a56_tuttle-headshot.webp)\n\nTuttle Capital Management\n\n## About the Advisor\n\nMatthew Tuttle is the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Investment Officer of Tuttle Capital Management, LLC.

The principal risks affecting shareholders’ investments in the Fund are set forth below. An investment in the Fund is not a bank deposit and is not insured or guaranteed by the FDIC or any government agency. The principal risks described herein pertain to direct risks of making an investment in the Fund and/or risks of the issuers in which the Fund invests.\n\nMarket Risk: The market price of securities owned by the Fund may go up or down, sometimes rapidly or unpredictably. Securities may decline in value due to factors affecting securities markets generally or particular industries represented in the securities markets. The value of a security may decline due to general market conditions that are not specifically related to a particular company, such as real or perceived adverse economic conditions, changes in the general outlook for corporate earnings changes in interest rates, adverse changes to credit markets or adverse investor sentiment generally. The value of a security may also decline due to factors that affect a particular industry or industries, such as labor shortages or increased production costs and competitive conditions within an industry.\n\nEquity Securities Risk: Equity prices may fall over short or extended periods of time. Historically, the equity markets have moved in cycles, and the value of equity securities may fluctuate from day to day. Individual companies may report poor results or be negatively affected by industry and/or economic trends and developments. The prices of securities issued by such companies may suffer a decline in response. These factors contribute to price volatility, which is a principal risk of investing in the Fund.\n\nActive Management Risk: As an actively managed investment portfolio, the Fund is subject to decisions made by the Adviser’s portfolio managers. The Adviser’s investment decisions about individual securities impact the Fund’s ability to achieve its investment objective. The Adviser’s judgments about the attractiveness and potential returns for specific investments in which the Fund invests may prove to be incorrect and there is no guarantee that the Adviser’s investment strategy will produce the desired results.\n\nNon-Diversification Risk: The Fund is non-diversified, which means that it may invest a greater percentage of its assets in a particular issuer than a diversified fund. Non-diversification increases the risk that the value of the Fund could go down because of the poor performance of a single investment or limited number of investments.\n\nRisks of Investment Selection: The Fund’s investment success depends on the skill of the Adviser in evaluating, selecting, and monitoring the portfolio assets. If the Adviser’s conclusions about growth rates or securities values are incorrect, the Fund may not perform as anticipated.\n\nRisk or Large Capitalization Securities Risk: Larger, more established companies may be unable to attain the high growth rates of successful, smaller companies during periods of economic expansion. Large cap companies may be less able than mid and small capitalization companies to adapt to changing market conditions.\n\nGrowth Stock Investment Risk: Growth-oriented common stocks may involve larger price swings and greater potential for loss than other types of investments. Growth stocks tend to trade at a premium when analyzed using tradition valuation metrics such as price-to-earnings ratio and price-to-book ratio. Due to this premium valuation, growth stocks tend to be more susceptible to big price swings. In bull markets, they tend to rise at a much faster pace than the overall market, and they tend to decline at a more rapid rate in bear markets.\n\nForeign Securities Risk: Investments in the securities of non-U.S. issuers involve risks beyond those associated with investments in U.S. securities. These additional risks include greater market volatility, the availability of less reliable financial information, higher transactional and custody costs, taxation by foreign governments, decreased market liquidity and political instability. Some countries and regions have experienced security concerns, war or threats of war and aggression, terrorism, economic uncertainty, natural and environmental disasters and/or systemic market dislocations that have led, and in the future may lead, to increased short-term market volatility and may have adverse long-term effects on the U.S. and world economies and markets generally. Foreign issuers are often subject to less stringent requirements regarding accounting, auditing, financial reporting and record keeping than are U.S. issuers, and therefore not all material information will be available. Securities exchanges or foreign governments may adopt rules or regulations that may negatively impact the Fund’s ability to invest in foreign securities or may prevent the Fund from repatriating its investments. Less developed securities markets are more likely to experience problems with the clearing and settling of trades, as well as the holding of securities by local banks, agents and depositories. The less developed a country’s securities market is, the greater the likelihood of custody problems.\n\nDepositary Receipts Risk: The Fund may invest in depositary receipts. Depositary receipts may be subject to certain of the risks associated with direct investments in the securities of foreign companies, such as currency, political, economic and market risks, because their values depend on the performance of the non-dollar denominated underlying foreign securities. Certain countries may limit the ability to convert depositary into the underlying foreign securities and vice versa, which may cause the securities of the foreign company to trade at a discount or premium to the market price of the related depositary receipts. Depositary receipts may be purchased through “sponsored” or “unsponsored” facilities. A sponsored facility is established jointly by a depositary and the issuer of the underlying security. A depositary may establish an unsponsored facility without participation by the issuer of the deposited security. Unsponsored receipts may involve higher expenses and may be less liquid. Holders of unsponsored depositary receipts generally bear all the costs of such facilities, and the depositary of an unsponsored facility frequently is under no obligation to distribute shareholder communications received from the issuer of the deposited security or to pass through voting rights to the holders of such receipts in respect of the deposited securities.\n\nCash and Cash Equivalents Risk: Holding cash or cash equivalents rather than securities or other instruments in which the Fund primarily invests, even strategically, may cause the Fund to risk losing opportunities to participate in market appreciation, and may cause the Fund to experience potentially lower returns than the Fund’s benchmark or other funds that remain fully invested. In rising markets, holding cash or cash equivalents will negatively affect the Fund’s performance relative to its benchmark.\n\nETF Structure Risk: The Fund is structured as an ETF and is therefore subject to special risks. Such risks include:\n\nTrading Issues Risk: Trading in ETF shares on an exchange may be halted due to market conditions or for reasons that, in the view of the exchange, make trading in the ETF’s shares inadvisable, such as extraordinary market volatility. There can be no assurance that an ETF’s shares will continue to meet the listing requirements of its exchange or will trade with any volume. There is no guarantee that an active secondary market will develop for shares of an ETF. In stressed market conditions, the liquidity of shares of an ETF may begin to mirror the liquidity of the ETF’s underlying portfolio holdings, which can be significantly less liquid than shares of the ETF. This adverse effect on liquidity for the ETF’s shares in turn could lead to differences between the market price of the ETF’s shares and the underlying value of those shares.\n\nMarket Price Variance Risk: The market prices of shares of an ETF will fluctuate in response to changes in the ETF’s NAV, and supply and demand for ETF shares and will include a “bid-ask spread” charged by the exchange specialists, market makers or other participants that trade the particular security. There may be times when the market price and the NAV vary significantly. This means that ETF shares may trade at a discount to NAV. The market price of an ETF’s shares may deviate from the value of the ETF’s underlying portfolio holdings, particularly in times of market stress, with the result that investors may pay significantly more or receive significantly less than the underlying value of the shares of the ETF bought or sold.\n\nAuthorized Participants (“APs”), Market Makers, and Liquidity Providers Risk: ETFs have a limited number of financial institutions that may act as APs. In addition, there may be a limited number of market makers and/or liquidity providers in the marketplace. To the extent either of the following events occur, shares of an ETF may trade at a material discount to NAV and possibly face delisting: (i) APs exit the business or otherwise become unable to process creation and/or redemption orders and no other APs step forward to perform these services, or (ii) market makers and/or liquidity providers exit the business or significantly reduce their business activities and no other entities step forward to perform their functions.\n\nCosts of Buying or Selling Shares of an ETF: Due to the costs of buying or selling shares of an ETF, including brokerage commissions imposed by brokers and bid/ask spreads, frequent trading of shares of an ETF may significantly reduce investment results and an investment in shares of an ETF may not be advisable for investors who anticipate regularly making small investments.\n\nNew Fund Risk: As of the date of this prospectus, the Fund has no operating history and currently has fewer assets than larger funds. Like other new funds, large inflows and outflows may impact the Fund’s market exposure for limited periods of time. This impact may be positive or negative, depending on the direction of market movement during the period affected.\n\nNew Adviser Risk: The Sub-Adviser is newly-registered and has not previously acted as an investment adviser or sub-adviser to an ETF, but the Sub-Adviser has experience creating an index utilizing the same process as will be used to create the model portfolio that will be provided to the Fund.\n\nThe Brendan Wood TopGun ETF is distributed by Foreside Fund Services, LLC, Member [FINRA](https://www.finra.org/).\n\nForeside Fund Services, LLC is not affiliated with Brendan Wood TopGun ETF.\n\nWebsite built by [Kinex Media](http://kinexmedia.com)\n"

Past performance does not guarantee future results.****The investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate so that an investor’s shares, when sold or redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost and current performance may be lower or higher than the performance quoted. Performance current to the most recent month-end can be obtained above. Returns less than one year are not annualized.**\n\nShort term performance, in particular, is not a good indication of the fund’s future performance, and an investment should not be made based solely on returns. The Fund does not have a track record of reporting to investors or widely available research coverage which may result in price volatility.\n\nMarket performance is the price at which shares in the ETF can be brought or sold on the exchanges during trading hours, while the net asset value (NAV) represents the value of each share’s portion of the fund’s underlying assets and cash at the end of the trading day.\n\n## Top Ten Holdings\n\nAs of:\n\nNovember 27, 2024\n\nMM/DD/YYYY\n\n[Download Full Holdings (CSV)](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/export?id=1lsWFaAiy_-SCM1H1ONCtXOtCsThGWmMEyF71LNw1D8U&exportFormat=csv)\n\nTicker\n\nSecurity Description\n\nCUSIP\n\n% of Funds\n\nShares\n\nMarket Value\n\nIBAC\n\nIB Acquisition Corp\n\n44934N108\n\n4.98\n\n50000\n\n503000\n\nPOLEU U\n\nANDRETTI ACQUISITION CORP\n\nG26745110\n\n4.96\n\n50000\n\n500500\n\nVCICU U\n\nVINE HILL CAPITAL INVESTM\n\nG93Y09123\n\n4.48\n\n45000\n\n452700\n\nWLACU U\n\nWILLOW LANE ACQUISITION C\n\nG9675P128\n\n4.44\n\n45000\n\n448650\n\nNTWOU U\n\nNEWBURY STREET II ACQUISI\n\nG6439S125\n\n4.44\n\n45000\n\n448200\n\nMBAVU U\n\nM3-BRIGADE ACQUISITION V\n\nG63212123\n\n4.02\n\n40000\n\n405600\n\nFVNNU\n\nFuture Vision II Acquisition C\n\nG37068122\n\n4.01\n\n40000\n\n404800\n\nALFUU\n\nCenturion Acquisition Corp\n\nG20315126\n\n4.01\n\n40000\n\n404800\n\nHONDU\n\nHCM II Acquisition Corp\n\nG43658114\n\n4\n\n40000\n\n404000\n\nCUB U\n\nLIONHEART HOLDINGS\n\nG5501C109\n\n3.99\n\n40000\n\n402400\n\nFund holdings and allocations are subject to change and should not be considered recommendations to buy or sell any security.\n\n## Fund Documents\n\n[Annual Financial Statements and Other Information](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/6619253b44eff8b692124c59/6747400346e57955c01ea79a_CIST%20SPAC_AR_093024_Final.pdf)\n\n[Annual Report](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/6619253b44eff8b692124c59/67473ff23e419d7896477d94_The%20SPAC%20and%20New%20Issue%20ETF%20Final.pdf)\n\n[Fact Sheet](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/6619253b44eff8b692124c59/6704281219889a614b22705c_SPCX-FactSheet-09302024.pdf)\n\n[Prospectus](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/6619253b44eff8b692124c59/67366259c3f7573d58aa044b_The%20SPAC%20and%20New%20Issue%20ETF%20485\\(b\\)%20Prospectus%20PDF%2C%20v.2.pdf)\n\n[Quarterly SOI (06/30/24)](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/6619253b44eff8b692124c59/66cf89fd60a3fe4019c95755_spac-soi%20Final.pdf)\n\n[Quarterly SOI (12/31/23)](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/6619253b44eff8b692124c59/661d7fc0618ab757753dc67f_SPAC-Dec-31-2023-Final-SOI.pdf)\n\n[SAI](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/6619253b44eff8b692124c59/665dd97c537be1c296bb2fd0_NDOW%20Pro%20SAI%20Updates.pdf)\n\n[Semi-annual Report](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/6619253b44eff8b692124c59/665758514622cf1d01d6f3b6_SPAC%203.31%20SAR%20Final.pdf)\n\n[Summary Prospectus](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/6619253b44eff8b692124c59/673662504b9ad2410200cab5_The%20SPAC%20and%20New%20Issue%20ETF%20Summary%20Prospectus%20\\(Feb%202024\\)%2C%20v.2.pdf)\n\n[Supplement (12/29/21)](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/6619253b44eff8b692124c59/661d7fe187e5cc660a83609b_spcx_497_bannerless.pdf)\n\n## Premium/Discount\n\nAs of:\n\nNovember 27, 2024\n\nMM/DD/YYYY\n\nPremium/Discount\n\n-0.33\n\nCurrent QuarterQ3 2024Q2 2024Q1 2024Q4 2023Q3 2023Q2 2023Q1 2023\n\nThank you!
