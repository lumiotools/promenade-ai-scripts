Piedmont is an FAA-certified repair\nstation and provides its services to airlines, air cargo carriers, maintenance service centers and, to a lesser extent, the military.\nThrough its Turbochrome subsidiary, TAT provides MRO services in the area of jet engine overhaul, which includes the overhaul and coating of jet engine components such as\nturbine vanes and blades, fan blades, variable inlet guide vanes and afterburner flaps. Turbochrome is certified by the FAA and EASA.\nIn addition, TAT, through its Piedmont subsidiary, holds approximately 5% of the equity securities of First Aviation Services Inc.(FAvS).\nDuring the years 2020 and 2021 the COVID-19 pandemic had an adverse effect on our industry and the markets in which we operate. The COVID-19 outbreak has significantly\nimpacted the aviation market in which TATs customers operate and has resulted in a reduction of TATs business with some of these customers. Global supply shortages emerged for certain\nproducts, leading to delays in delivery schedule these effects still apply to a certain degree.\n1\nFurther to the actions taken by TATs management to reduce its expenses, including a reduction in its headcount as well as other cost savings measures due to the effect of\nCOVID-19 on the TAT's industry, TAT announced a restructuring plan in March 2021, which included the transfer of the Company's activity from its leased facility in Gedera to a facility in\nKiryat Gat, Israel which is leased by the Companys wholly-owned subsidiary Turbochrome from the Israel Land Authority (ILA) pursuant to a long-term lease agreement expiring in\n2045 (with no rental payments due to the ILA in respect of such lease), and to our partially owned facility in Tulsa, Oklahoma. These actions enable TAT to concentrate its heat exchanges\ncores activity in the United States allowing for better operational flow, getting closer to the Companys customer base, and cutting fixed costs. For more information about the Company's\nrestructuring plan please see note 9 to the company financial statements.\nMacroeconomic conditions, including inflation, rising interest rates and recessionary concerns, as well as ongoing labor cost pressures, transportation and shipping cost pressures\nhave had, and may continue to have, a negative impact on our business, financial condition, profitability, and cash flows. For instance, we were negatively impacted in fiscal 2022 and 2023\nby persistent cost pressures, including supply chain and labor costs. We expect inflationary cost pressures to continue in 2024 and we continue to closely monitor macroeconomic conditions,\nincluding customer behavior, and the impact of these factors on customer demand. Continuing or worsening inflation, recessionary concerns and/or supply chain and labor challenges may\nnegatively impact our business, financial condition, profitability, and/or cash flows.\nGeopolitical events, including the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine , the related economic sanctions by Western governments on Russia and the war and hostilities\nbetween Israel and Hamaas and Israel and Hezbollah, has caused greater uncertainty in the global economy and the inflation situation.\nTATs ordinary shares are publicly traded on the NASDAQ Global Market (NASDAQ) under the symbol TATT and on the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange (TASE) under the\nsymbol TAT Tech.

Risk Factors\nInvesting in our ordinary shares involves certain risks and uncertainties. You should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below before investing in our ordinary\nshares. Our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected due to any of the following risks. In that case, the value of our ordinary shares could\ndecline, and you could lose all or part of your investment.\n3\nRisks Related to Our Business and Our Industry\n The aerospace industry is subject to significant regulation and oversight, and TAT and its subsidiaries may incur significant fines, penalties and costs if TAT and its\nsubsidiaries do not comply with these regulations.\n TAT competes with a number of established companies in all aspects of TATs business, many of which have significantly greater resources or capabilities than TAT.\n TAT derives a material share of its revenues from few major customers. If TAT loses any of these customers or they reduce the amount of business they do with TAT, TATs\nrevenues may be seriously affected.\n A part of the revenues of TAT and its subsidiaries are from contracts with the U.S. and Israeli governments and are subject to special risks. A loss of all, or a major portion, of\nthese revenues from government contracts could have a material adverse effect on TATs operations.\n If TAT and its subsidiaries do not receive the governmental approvals necessary for the export of their products, TATs revenues may decrease. Similarly, if TATs suppliers and\npartners do not receive their government approvals necessary to export their products or designs to TAT, TATs revenues may decrease.\n TAT depends on a limited number of suppliers of components for certain of its products and if TAT or any of its subsidiaries are unable to obtain these components when\nneeded, they would experience delays in manufacturing their products and TATs financial results could be adversely affected.\n TAT may face increased labor and raw materials costs. TAT may not be able to recoup future increases in the cost of wages and raw materials required for its operations\nthrough price increases for its products.\n TATs future success depends on its ability to develop new offerings and technologies.\n TAT may face significant risks in the management of its inventory, while failure to effectively manage its inventory levels may result in supply imbalances that could harm its\nbusiness.\n TATs backlog of projects under contract is subject to unexpected adjustments, delays in payments and cancellations.\n TAT faces special risks from international sales operations which may have a material adverse effect on TATs business, operating results and financial condition.\n TAT may engage in future acquisitions that could dilute TATs shareholders equity and harm TATs business, results of operations and financial condition.\n Our strategic partnerships and relationships carry inherent business risks.\n Rapid technological changes may adversely affect the market acceptance of TAT's products.\n TAT has fixed-price contracts with some of its customers and TAT bears the risk of costs in excess of its estimates. In addition, TAT may not be able to pass on increased costs\nto its customers.\n TAT depends on its key executives; it may not be able to hire and retain additional key employees or successfully integrate new members of its team; the loss of key employees\ncould have a material adverse effect on TATs business.\n TAT depends on its manufacturing and MRO facilities and any material damage to these facilities may adversely impact TATs operations.\n TAT uses equipment that is not easily repaired or replaced, and therefore material equipment failures could cause TAT or its subsidiaries to be unable to meet quality or\ndelivery expectations of its customers.\n TAT may fail to maintain effective internal controls in accordance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002.\n TAT has potential exposure to liabilities arising under environmental laws and regulations.\n TAT is exposed to potential liabilities arising from product liability and warranty claims.\n Significant disruptions of TATs information technology systems or breaches of its data security could adversely affect TATs business.\n TATs activity in Israel may be adversely affected by a change in the exchange rate of the NIS against the dollar. Because exchange rates between the NIS and the dollar\nfluctuate continuously, exchange rate fluctuations, particularly larger periodic devaluations, may have an impact on TATs profitability and period to period comparisons of\nTATs results.\n4\nRisk Factors Related to Our Ordinary Shares\n TATs share price has been volatile in the past and may decline in the future.\n Substantial future sales of TATs ordinary shares by TATs principal shareholders may depress TATs share price.\nRisks Relating to Our Location in Israel\n Because TAT has significant operations in Israel, TAT may be subject to political, economic and other conditions affecting Israel that could increase TATs operating expenses\nand disrupt TATs business.\n TATs results of operations may be negatively affected by the obligation of its personnel to perform military service.\n Your rights and responsibilities as a shareholder are governed by Israeli law and may differ in some respects from the rights and responsibilities of shareholders under U.S.\nlaw.\n Israeli law may delay, prevent or make difficult an acquisition of TAT, which could prevent a change of control and, therefore, depresses the price of TATs shares.\n Investors and TATs shareholders generally may have difficulties enforcing a U.S. judgment against TAT, TATs executive officers and directors or asserting U.S. securities\nlaws claims in Israel.\n As a foreign private issuer whose shares are listed on NASDAQ, TAT may follow certain home country corporate governance practices instead of certain NASDAQ\nrequirements.\nThe aerospace industry is subject to significant regulation and oversight, and TAT and its subsidiaries may incur significant fines, penalties and costs if TAT and its subsidiaries do not\ncomply with these regulations.\nThe aerospace industry is highly regulated in the United States and elsewhere. To manufacture, sell and service parts used in aircrafts, TAT and its subsidiaries must be certified or\naccepted by the FAA, EASA, the United States Department of Defense and comparable agencies in other countries and by leading original equipment manufacturers (OEMs). If any of our\nmaterial certifications, authorizations or approvals are revoked or suspended, then the operations of TAT or its subsidiaries, as the case may be, will be significantly curtailed and TAT and its\nsubsidiaries could be subjected to significant fines and penalties. In the future, new and more demanding government regulations may be adopted or industry oversight may be increased.\nTAT and its subsidiaries may have to incur significant additional costs to achieve compliance with new regulations or to reacquire a revoked or suspended license or approval, which could\nmaterially reduce profitability.\nTAT competes with a number of established companies in all aspects of TATs business, many of which have significantly greater resources or capabilities than TAT.\nTATs major competitors in the area of OEM heat transfer solutions and aviation accessories, are other OEMs who manufacture heat transfer solutions. These include:\n(i) Manufacturers based in the United States, such as the Hughes-Treitler division of Ametek Inc., Boyd Corporation, Collins Aerospace, Honeywell International, and\nTriumph Thermal Systems;\n(ii) Manufacturers based in Europe such as HS Marston Aerospace Ltd., a subsidiary of Collins Aerospace, Secan and Liebherr-Aerospace Toulouse S.A.; and\n(iii) Manufacturers based in Asia such as Sumitomo Precision Products from Japan.\n5\nMany of TATs competitors are far larger, have substantially greater resources than TAT, including technical, financial, research and development, marketing and distribution\ncapabilities, and enjoy greater market recognition. These competitors may be able to achieve greater economies of scale and may be less vulnerable to price competition than TAT. In\naddition, some of those companies are considered to be tier one suppliers offering customers a wider range of systems and products, in addition to heat transfer solutions, as a bundle. TAT\nmay not be able to offer its products as part of integrated systems to the same extent as its competitors or successfully develop or introduce new products that are more cost effective or offer\nbetter performance than those of its competitors. Failure to do so could adversely affect TATs business, financial condition and results of operations.\nTATs major competitors in the area of MRO services for heat transfer components are the service divisions of OEMs, including Honeywell-Lori, Honeywell Secan, Honeywell\nSingapore, Collins Aerospace Malaysia, Collins Aerospace Maastricht, and Liebherr Aerospace Saline, in addition to the in-house maintenance services of various commercial airlines and\nother independent service providers, including Triumph Accessory Services, Drake Air  Ametek, American Cooler Service  Aviation Technical Services, Lufthansa Technik and Elite\nAerospace, a division of Meggitt.\nTATs major competitors in the area of MRO services for aviation components, landing gears and APUs, are the service divisions of OEMs, the in-house maintenance services of\nvarious commercial airlines and other independent service providers, including Standard Aero Group Inc., Aerotech International Inc., Honeywell International, AAR Corp., Safran,\nLiebherr, Turbine Aero, Hawker Pacific and APRO.\nTATs major competitors in the area of overhaul and coating of jet engine components are the service divisions of OEMs, the in-house maintenance services of various commercial\nairlines and other independent service providers, including Safran, General Electric, GKN, PAS MCT Japan and others. With respect to masking materials, TAT's major competitors are APV\nCoatings, Praxair, Saint-Gobain and others.\nCompetition in the MRO market is based on price, quality, engineering solutions, breadth of services, and the ability to perform repairs and overhauls rapidly. A number of our\ncompetitors have inherent competitive advantages. For example, we compete with the service divisions of large OEMs which are able to derive significant brand recognition from their\nOEM manufacturing activities. We also compete with the in-house service divisions of large commercial airlines where there is a strong incentive for an airline to fully-utilize the services of\nits maintenance employees and facilities.\nFurther, TATs competitors may have additional competitive advantages, such as:\n The ability to adapt faster to changes in customer requirements and industry conditions or trends;\n Greater access to capital;\n Stronger relationships with customers and suppliers;\n Greater name recognition;\n Access to superior technology and greater marketing resources;\n The ability to offer complete systems in addition to components; and\n The ability to bundle heat transfer components and solutions and other aircraft components.\nIf TAT is unable to overcome these competitive disadvantages, then TATs business, financial condition and results of operations would be adversely affected.\n6\nTAT derives a material share of its revenues from few major customers. If TAT loses any of these customers or they reduce the amount of business they do with TAT, TATs revenues\nmay be seriously affected.\nFive customers accounted for approximately 28.46%, 26.4% and 27.8% of TATs revenues for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. TATs major\ncustomers may not maintain the same volume of business with TAT in the future. If TAT loses any of these customers or they reduce the amount of business they do with TAT, TATs\nrevenues may be seriously affected.\nA part of the revenues of TAT and its subsidiaries are from contracts with the U.S. and Israeli governments and are subject to special risks. A loss of all, or a major portion, of these\nrevenues from government contracts could have a material adverse effect on TATs operations.\nA portion of the revenues of TAT and its subsidiaries are from contracts with the U.S. and Israeli governments. Sales to the U.S. and Israeli governments accounted for\napproximately 8.3%, 6.3% and 5.6% of TATs revenues on a consolidated basis for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\nBusiness with the U.S. and Israeli governments, as well as with the governments of other countries, is subject to unique risks which do not exist when doing business with other\nprivate parties. These risks include the ability of the governmental authorities to unilaterally:\n Suspend TAT or any of its subsidiaries from receiving new contracts pending resolution of alleged violations of procurement laws or regulations;\n Terminate existing contracts, with or without cause, at any time;\n Condition the receipt of new contracts on conditions which are beyond the control of TAT;\n Reduce the value of existing contracts;\n Audit the contract-related costs and fees of TAT and its subsidiaries, including allocated indirect costs; and\n Control or prohibit the export of products of TAT and its subsidiaries.\nAlso, military and defense budget cuts may result in reduced demand for the products and manufacturing services of TAT and its subsidiaries. Smaller budgets could result in\nreduction in the business revenues of TAT and its subsidiaries.\nIf TAT and its subsidiaries do not receive the governmental approvals necessary for the export of their products, TATs revenues may decrease. Similarly, if TATs suppliers and partners\ndo not receive their government approvals necessary to export their products or designs to TAT, TATs revenues may decrease.\nUnder Israeli law, the export of certain products and know-how of TAT and its subsidiaries is subject to approval by the Israeli Ministry of Defense. Prior to initiating sales\nproposals for the export of these products and know-how and to the actual shipment of such products or know-how, TAT and its subsidiaries must obtain permits from the Ministry of\nDefense. TAT and its subsidiaries may not be able to receive in a timely manner, or at all, all the required permits for which they may apply in the future.\nSimilarly, many countries have laws according to which the export of certain military products, technical designs and spare parts require the prior approval of, or export license\nfrom, their governments. This process also applies to our partners and suppliers. If TAT and its subsidiaries or its partners and suppliers are unable to receive all the required permits and/or\nlicenses in a timely manner, or at all, TATs revenues may decrease.\n7\nTAT depends on a limited number of suppliers of components for certain of its products and if TAT or any of its subsidiaries are unable to obtain these components when needed, they\nwould experience delays in manufacturing their products and TATs financial results could be adversely affected.\nTAT relies on a limited number of key suppliers for parts for certain of its OEM activities and MRO services. Some of these suppliers are currently the sole source of one or more\ncomponents upon which TAT is dependent. For example, Honeywell International Inc. is a key supplier to TAT of APU spare parts and of certain other components used by TAT and its\nsubsidiaries for OEM activities and in the provision of MRO services. TAT's subsidiary, Piedmont, is a Honeywell licensed Authorized Repair Center for APUs under two separate\nagreements, for military and commercial applications. In September 2020 Piedmont signed a 10 years agreement with Honeywell for the commercial application. Under this contract\nPiedmont is an authorized MRO station under Honeywell's license.\nDuring June 2021 Piedmont has also signed a similar contract for the APU 331-500 serving the Boeing 777 aircraft.\nIn July 2021 Piedmont signed another contract granting Piedmont a 10-year MRO license for MRO of APU131 serving the Boeing 737 platform and AirBus A319-320-321\nplatform.\nAlso, Piedmont is a provider of services for the Safran and Liebherr landing gear systems (used on ATRs and Ejet platforms), and to do so, Piedmont is dependent on these OEMs\nto provide parts and engineering support.\nSuppliers of some of these components require TAT to place orders with significant lead time to assure supply in accordance with TATs requirements. A delay in the supply of\nthese components can significantly delay the delivery of our products and services. If TAT were to engage in a commercial dispute with or be unable to obtain adequate supplies of parts\nfrom these suppliers at commercially reasonable prices or required lead time, TAT could experience delays in manufacturing and its financial results could be adversely affected. Increased\ncosts associated with supplied materials or components could increase TATs costs and reduce TATs profitability if TAT is unable to pass these cost increases on to its customers.\nTAT may face increased labor and raw materials costs. TAT may not be able to recoup future increases in the cost of wages and raw materials required for its operations through price\nincreases for its products.\nWe are impacted by inflationary increases in wages and cost of raw materials. In all countries in which we operate, wage and benefit inflation, whether driven by competition for\ntalent, or ordinary course pay increases and other inflationary pressure, may increase our cost of providing services and reduce our profitability Decreases in the availability of supplies,\nincreases in the cost of supplies, and delivery issues have caused shortages and delays, as well as increased costs for the procurement of raw materials, components and other supplies\nrequired for our performance. TAT may not be able to recoup future increases in the cost of labor and raw materials through price increases for its products and services. Our operating\nprofits and margins under our contracts could be adversely affected by these factors, particularly if the current inflationary pressures are prolonged. If TAT is unable to obtain the raw\nmaterials required for its operation, TAT could experience delays or disruptions in the provision of its services and its financial results could be adversely affected.\nTATs future success depends on its ability to develop new offerings and technologies.\nThe markets we serve are characterized by rapid changes in technologies and evolving industry standards. In addition, some of our products are installed on, and some of our\nservices are provided in connection with, platforms that may have a limited life or become obsolete. Unless we develop new offerings or enhance our existing offerings, we may be\nsusceptible to loss of market share resulting from the introduction of new or enhanced offerings by competitors.\n8\nTAT may face significant risks in the management of its inventory, while failure to effectively manage its inventory levels may result in supply imbalances that could harm its business\nWe maintain an inventory of exchangeable units of heat transfer solutions, aviation accessories, aviation components, APUs, landing gears, engine blades and coating materials and\nother spare parts related to our products and services in various locations, including with third party logistics providers. Due to the long lead time of our suppliers and manufacturing cycles,\nwe need to forecast demand and commit significant resources towards these inventories. As such, we are subject to significant risks in managing the inventory needs of our business,\nincluding estimates of the appropriate demand across our products. Should actual market conditions differ from our estimates, our future results of operations could be materially adversely\naffected. In the future, we may be required to record write-downs of finished products and materials on-hand as a result of future changes in our sales forecasts.\nTATs backlog of projects under contract is subject to unexpected adjustments, delays in payments and cancellations.\nOur backlog includes purchase orders received from our customers for our products or services and our estimation of the maximum potential revenues that are expected to be\nderived from frame agreements with our customers over the life of the contract or 10 years  the lowest of the two. There is no legal obligation from the customer to purchase our products\nor services under those frame agreements. In addition, we use estimations to evaluate the potential revenue from these agreements. From time to time, for reasons beyond our control,\nprojects are delayed, scaled back, suspended or cancelled, or the customer delays making payments, which may adversely affect the revenue, profit and cash flow that we ultimately receive\nfrom contracts reflected in our backlog.\nTAT faces special risks from international sales operations which may have a material adverse effect on TATs business, operating results and financial condition.\nIn the years ending December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, approximately 93%, 92% and 89% of TATs sales, respectively, resulted from TATs operations out of Israel. This revenue\nconcentration is subject to various risks, including:\n Governmental embargoes or foreign trade restrictions;\n Changes in U.S. and foreign governmental regulations;\n Changes in foreign exchange rates;\n Tariffs;\n Other trade barriers;\n Political, economic and social instability; and\n Difficulties collecting accounts receivable.\nAccordingly, TAT and its subsidiaries may encounter significant difficulties in connection with the sale of their products in international markets.\nAs a result of the current geopolitical tensions and conflict between Russia and Ukraine, and the invasion by Russia of Ukraine, the governments of the United States, EU, Japan\nand other jurisdictions have announced the imposition of sanctions on certain industry sectors and parties in Russia and certain impacted regions, as well as enhanced export controls on\ncertain products and industries. Due to such sanctions, our subsidiary Limco, has ceased selling its products to customers in Russia. While our business in Russia is of limited in scope, these\nrestrictions may cause a reduction of our sales and financial results.\n9\nDuring the years 2020 and 2021 the COVID-19 pandemic had an adverse effect on our industry and the markets in which we operate. The COVID-19 outbreak has significantly\nimpacted the aviation market in which TATs customers operate and has resulted in a reduction of TATs business with some of these customers. In order to mitigate the impact of the decline\nin business as a result of the pandemic, TAT implemented measures to reduce its expenses, including the Company's restructuring plan announced in March 2021, reduction in its headcount\nas well as other cost savings measures. Please see Note 9 to the company financial statements. The Company applied and received governmental assistance as part of the COVID-19 relief\nprograms provided by the Israeli government and certain states in the United States in which the Company and its subsidiaries operate. Please see Notes 10 and 11 to the company financial\nstatements for long term loans, credit lines and grants received in connection with governmental assistance.\nTAT may engage in future acquisitions that could dilute TATs shareholders equity and harm TATs business, results of operations and financial condition.\nTAT has pursued, and will continue to pursue, growth opportunities through organic growth as well as acquisition of businesses, products and technologies.\nTAT is unable to predict whether or when any prospective acquisition will be completed. TAT may not be able to successfully identify suitable acquisition candidates, complete\nacquisitions, integrate the acquired businesses into its operations, or expand into new markets. The process of integrating an acquired business may be prolonged due to unforeseen\ndifficulties and may require a disproportionate amount of TATs resources, including management attention. Furthermore, once integrated, acquisitions may not achieve comparable levels of\nrevenues, profitability or productivity as TATs existing business or otherwise perform as expected. The occurrence of any of these events could harm TATs business, financial condition or\nresults of operations. Future acquisitions may require substantial capital resources, which may require TAT to seek additional debt or equity financing.\nFuture acquisitions by TAT could result in the following, any of which could materially harm TATs results of operations or the price of TATs ordinary shares:\n Issuance of equity securities that would dilute TATs shareholders percentages of ownership;\n Large one-time write-offs;\n The incurrence of debt and contingent liabilities;\n Difficulties in the assimilation and integration of operations, personnel, technologies, products and information systems of the acquired companies;\n Diversion of managements attention from other business activities and concerns;\n Contractual disputes;\n Risks of entering geographic and business markets in which TAT has no or only limited prior experience; and\n Potential loss of key employees of acquired organizations.\nOur strategic partnerships and relationships carry inherent business risks.\nWe may participate in strategic partnerships and joint ventures in a number of countries. For example, in November 2015, we signed a joint venture agreement with Russian-based\nEngineering, to establish a new facility for the provision of MRO services for heat transfer components in Russia and the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS).\n10\nOur actions with respect to these affiliated companies may be restricted to some degree by shareholder agreements entered into with our strategic partners. Our business, financial\ncondition, results of operations and prospects may be materially harmed if disagreements develop with our partners. Our ability to withdraw funds and dividends from these entities may\ndepend on the consent of partners. If one of our strategic partners becomes subject to investigation, sanctions or liability, TAT might be adversely affected. Furthermore, strategic\npartnerships in emerging markets are accompanied by risks inherent to those markets, such as an increased probability of a partner defaulting on obligations or losing a partner with\nimportant insights in that region. Strategic partnerships in emerging markets are subject to greater risks than strategic partnerships in more developed markets, including significant political,\nlegal and economic risks and risks related to fluctuations in currencies. As a result of the current geopolitical tensions and conflict between Russia and Ukraine, and the invasion by Russia\nof Ukraine, the governments of the United States, EU, Japan and other jurisdictions have announced the imposition of sanctions on certain industry sectors and parties in Russia and certain\nimpacted regions, as well as enhanced export controls on certain products and industries. Due to such sanctions, during 2022 and 2023 our joint venture in Russia ceased to purchase heat-\nexchange cores from Limco, our US subsidiary, and therefore the joint venture had to materially limit the extent of the MRO services it provides to its customers.\nRapid technological changes may adversely affect the market acceptance of TAT's products.\nThe aerospace and defense markets in which TAT competes are subject to technological changes, introduction of new products, changes in customer demands and evolving industry\nstandards. For example, new materials, new structures and 3D printing  a technology based on the principle of joining thin layers of materials, in horizontal cross-section, to build up a real,\nthree-dimensional object from a digital model  may enable the manufacturing of high-quality and new characterization heat exchangers in serial production with a better return of value.\nThe future success of TAT will depend upon its ability to keep pace with technological developments and to timely address the increasingly sophisticated needs of its customers by\nsupporting existing and new technologies and by developing enhancements to its current products and by introducing new ones.\nTAT has fixed-price contracts with some of its customers and TAT bears the risk of costs in excess of its estimates. In addition, TAT may not be able to pass on increased costs to its\ncustomers.\nTAT has entered into multi-year, fixed-price contracts with some of its MRO and OEM customers. Pursuant to these contracts, TAT realizes all the benefits or costs resulting from\nany increases or decreases in the cost of providing services and products to these customers. Several of TATs contracts do not allow TAT to recover for increases in raw material prices,\ntaxes or labor costs, while other contracts may permit, to a limited extent, periodic price adjustments. Any increase in these costs could increase the cost of operating our business and reduce\nour profitability. Factors such as inaccurate pricing and increases in the cost of labor, materials or overhead may result in cost over-runs and losses on those agreements. TAT may not\nsucceed in obtaining customer approval to re-price a particular product and may not be able to recoup previous losses resulting from incomplete or inaccurate engineering data. In addition,\nas costs increase, TAT may not be able to pass on such increased costs to other customers. This could materially impact TATs profitability.\nTAT depends on its key executives; it may not be able to hire and retain additional key employees or successfully integrate new members of its team; the loss of key employees could\nhave a material adverse effect on TATs business.\nTATs success depends to a large extent on the experience and expertise of its senior management. Any member of TATs senior management may choose to end his or her\nemployment with TAT and seek employment with others for any reason. The loss of the expertise of TATs senior management through death, disability or an employees decision to end his\nor her employment could have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. TAT is not the beneficiary of life or disability insurance covering\nany of its senior management, key employees or other personnel.\nTAT depends on its manufacturing and MRO facilities and any material damage to these facilities may adversely impact TATs operations.\nTATs results of operations depend in large part on its ability to provide prompt and efficient service to its customers upon receipt of orders, either the manufacture and delivery of\nOEM products or the provision of MRO services. As a result, any material disruption of TATs day-to-day operations could have a material adverse effect on its business, customer relations\nand profitability. TAT relies on its Kiryat Gat, Israel, Kernersville and Greensboro, North Carolina and Tulsa, Oklahoma facilities for the manufacture of its OEM products and provision of\nits MRO services. A war or terrorist act, fire, flood, earthquake or other disaster or condition that significantly damaged or destroyed any of these facilities would have a material adverse\neffect on the operations of TAT.\n11\nTAT uses equipment that is not easily repaired or replaced, and therefore material equipment failures could cause TAT or its subsidiaries to be unable to meet quality or delivery\nexpectations of its customers.\nMany of TATs service and manufacturing processes are dependent on equipment that is not easily repaired or replaced. As a result, unexpected equipment failures could result in\nproduction delays or the manufacture of defective products. TATs ability to meet its customers expectations with respect to on-time delivery of repaired components or quality OEM\nproducts is critical. Failure by TAT to meet the quality or delivery expectations of its customers could lead to the loss of one or more of its significant customers.\nTAT may fail to maintain effective internal controls in accordance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002.\nThe Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 imposes certain duties on TAT and its executives and directors. TATs efforts to comply with the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-\nOxley Act of 2002 (SOX) governing internal controls and procedures for financial reporting have resulted in increased general and administrative expenses and a diversion of\nmanagement time and attention. TAT expects these efforts to require the continued commitment of significant resources. TAT may identify material weaknesses or significant deficiencies in\nits assessments of its internal controls over financial reporting. Failure to maintain effective internal controls over financial reporting could result in investigation or sanctions by regulatory\nauthorities and could have a material adverse effect on TATs operating results, investor confidence in TATs reported financial information and the market price of TATs ordinary shares.\nOur independent registered public accounting firm is not required to perform an audit of our internal controls over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023.\nTAT has potential exposure to liabilities arising under environmental laws and regulations.\nTATs business operations and facilities are subject to various federal, state, and local laws and regulations related to the environment, including, but not limited to, regulations that\ngovern the discharge of pollutants and hazardous substances into the air and water and the handling, storage and disposal of such materials. Compliance with such laws as they relate to the\nhandling, storage and disposal of hazardous substances is a significant obligation for TAT at each of its facilities. If it fails to comply with these and other environmental-related laws and\nregulations, TAT would be subject to serious consequences, including fines and other sanctions, and limitations on its operations due to changes to, or revocations of, the environmental\npermits applicable to its facilities. The adoption of new laws and regulations, stricter enforcement of existing laws and regulations, the discovery of previously unknown contamination or\nthe imposition of new cleanup requirements could require TAT to incur costs and become subject to new or increased liabilities that could increase TATs operating costs and adversely affect\nthe manner in which we conduct our business.\nUnder certain environmental laws, liability associated with an investigation or remediation of hazardous substances can arise from a broad range of properties, including properties\ncurrently or formerly operated by TAT or any of its predecessors, as well as properties to which TAT sent hazardous substances or wastes for treatment, storage, or disposal. Costs and other\nobligations can arise from claims for toxic torts, natural resource and other damages, as well as the investigation and clean-up of contamination at such properties. Under certain\nenvironmental laws, such liability may be imposed jointly and severally, so TAT may be responsible for more than its proportionate share and may even be responsible for the entire liability\nat issue. The extent of any such liability can be difficult to predict.\nTAT is exposed to potential liabilities arising from product liability and warranty claims.\nTAT is exposed to potential liabilities for personal injury or death as a result of the failure of an aircraft component that was designed, manufactured, serviced or supplied by TAT.\nTAT believes that, in an effort to improve operating margins, some customers have delayed the replacement of parts beyond their recommended lifetime, which may undermine aircraft\nsafety and increase the risk of liability of TAT and its subsidiaries.\nIf any of our products are defective, we could be required to redesign or recall those products or pay substantial damages or warranty claims. Such an event could result in\nsignificant expenses, disrupt sales and damage our reputation and that of our products and services. There can be no assurance that TAT will not experience material product liability losses\nin the future, that it will not incur significant costs to defend such claims, that, although TAT maintains product liability insurance, its insurance coverage will be adequate if claims were to\narise or that it would be able to maintain insurance coverage in the future at an acceptable cost. A successful claim brought against TAT or its subsidiaries in excess of its available insurance\ncoverage may have a material adverse effect on TATs business.\nIn addition, contractual disputes over warranties can arise in the ordinary course of business. TAT may be subject to requests from customers for cost sharing or pricing adjustments\nas a part of their commercial relationships, even though the customers had previously agreed to bear these risks.\n12\nSignificant disruptions of our information technology systems or breaches of our data security could adversely affect our business.\nOur operations depend on the continued and secure functioning of our computer and communications systems and the protection of information stored in computer databases\nmaintained by us, and in certain circumstances, by third parties. Such systems and databases are subject to breach, damage, disruption or failure from, among other things, cyber-attacks and\nother unauthorized intrusions. In particular, we may be targeted by experienced computer hackers who may attempt to penetrate our computer systems and misappropriate or compromise\nour confidential information or that of our customers. A significant invasion, interruption, destruction or breakdown of our information technology, or IT, systems and/or infrastructure by\npersons with authorized or unauthorized access could negatively impact our business and operations. We could also experience business interruption, information theft and/or reputational\ndamage from cyber-attacks, which may compromise our systems and lead to data leakage either internally or at our third-party providers. Both data that has been inputted into our main IT\nplatform, which covers records of transactions, financial data and other data reflected in our results of operations, as well as data related to our proprietary rights (such as research and\ndevelopment, and other intellectual property-related data), are subject to material cyber security risks. To date, we are not aware that we have experienced any loss of, or disruption to,\nmaterial information as a result of any such malware or cyber-attack.\nTATs activity in Israel may be adversely affected by a change in the exchange rate of the NIS against the dollar. Because exchange rates between the NIS and the dollar fluctuate\ncontinuously, exchange rate fluctuations, particularly larger periodic devaluations, may have an impact on TATs profitability and period to period comparisons of TATs results.\nTATs financial statements are stated in dollars, while a portion of TATs expenses in Israel, primarily labor expenses, are incurred in NIS and a portion of its revenues are quoted in\nNIS and in Euro. Additionally, certain assets, as well as a portion of TATs liabilities, are denominated in NIS. Because exchange rates between the NIS and the dollar fluctuate continuously,\nexchange rate fluctuations, particularly larger periodic devaluations, may have an impact on TATs profitability and period to period comparisons of TATs results. TATs results may be\nadversely affected by the devaluation of the NIS in relation to the dollar (or if such devaluation is on a lagging basis), if TATs revenues in NIS are higher than TATs expenses in NIS and/\nor the value of TATs assets in NIS are higher than TATs liabilities in NIS. Alternatively, TATs results may be adversely affected by an appreciation of the NIS in relation to the dollar (or if\nsuch appreciation is on a lagging basis), if TATs expenses in NIS are higher than TATs revenues in NIS and/or TATs liabilities in NIS are higher than TATs assets in NIS. From time to\ntime, we enter into hedging transactions to attempt to limit the impact of foreign currency fluctuations. However, the protection provided by such hedging transactions may be partial and\nleave certain exchange rate-related losses and risks uncovered. Therefore, our business and profitability may be harmed by such exchange rate fluctuations.\nRisk Factors Related to Our Ordinary Shares\nTATs share price has been volatile in the past and may decline in the future.\nTATs ordinary shares have experienced significant market price and volume fluctuations in the past and may experience significant market price and volume fluctuations in the\nfuture, in response to factors such as the following, some of which are beyond TATs control:\n Quarterly variations in TATs operating results;\n Operating results that vary from the expectations of securities analysts and investors;\n Changes in expectations as to TATs future financial performance, including financial estimates by securities analysts and investors;\n Announcements of technological innovations or new products by TAT or TATs competitors;\n Announcements by TAT or TATs competitors of significant contracts, acquisitions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures or capital commitments;\n Announcements by third parties of significant claims or proceedings against us;\n Additions or departures of key personnel;\n Future sales of TATs ordinary shares by the Company (such as the issuance and sale in December 2023) or by our controlling shareholders or others;\n The effects of the war and hostilities between Israel and Hamas and Israel and Hezbollah;\n De-listing of TATs shares from NASDAQ and/or from the TASE;\n Stock market price and volume fluctuation;\n Legal proceedings against TAT or its controlling shareholders; and\n Regulatory actions by securities authorities which impacts TATs interaction with securities analysts and institutional investors.\n13\nEquity stock markets can undergo extreme price and volume fluctuations. Market fluctuations, as well as political and economic conditions, such as a recession, interest rate or\ncurrency rate fluctuations and political events or hostilities in or surrounding Israel, could adversely affect the market price of TATs ordinary shares.\nIn the past, securities class action litigation has often been brought against companies following periods of volatility in the market price of their securities. TAT may be the target of\nsimilar litigation in the future. Securities litigation could result in substantial costs and divert managements attention and resources both of which could have a material adverse effect on\nTATs business and results of operations.\nSubstantial future sales of TATs ordinary shares by TATs principal shareholders may depress TATs share price.\nTATs principal shareholders, FIMI Israel Opportunity FIVE, Limited Partnership and FIMI Opportunity V, L.P. (FIMI or the FIMI Funds), beneficially own together 52% of\nTATs outstanding shares. If FIMI sells a substantial number of TATs ordinary shares or if there is a perception that FIMI may sell a substantial number of TATs ordinary shares, the market\nprice of TATs ordinary shares may decline. Any substantial sales of TATs shares in the public market may also impede our ability to sell equity or equity-related securities in the future at a\ntime, in a place and on terms TAT deems appropriate.\nRisks Relating to Our Location in Israel\nBecause TAT has significant operations in Israel, TAT may be subject to political, economic and other conditions affecting Israel (including the ongoing war and hostilities with Hamas\nand Hezbollah) that could increase TATs operating expenses and disrupt TATs business.\nTAT is incorporated under the laws of the State of Israel. TATs executive offices, its research and development facilities and manufacturing plant are also located in Israel. As a\nresult, political, economic and military conditions affecting Israel directly influence TAT. Any major hostilities involving Israel, a full or partial mobilization of reserve forces of the Israeli\narmy, the interruption or curtailment of trade between Israel and its present trading partners, or a significant downturn in the economic or financial condition of Israel could have a material\nadverse effect on TATs business, financial condition and results of operations.\nSince its establishment in 1948, Israel and its Arab neighbors have engaged in a number of armed conflicts. A state of hostility, varying from time to time in intensity and degree,\nhas led to security and economic challenges for Israel. Major hostilities between Israel and its neighbors may hinder Israels international trade and lead to economic downturn. This, in turn,\ncould have a material adverse effect on TATs operations and business.\nIn October 2023, Hamas terrorists infiltrated Israels southern border from the Gaza Strip and conducted a series of attacks on civilian and military targets. Hamas also launched\nextensive rocket attacks on Israeli population and industrial centers located along Israels border with the Gaza Strip and in other areas within the State of Israel. These attacks resulted in\nextensive deaths, injuries and kidnapping of civilians and soldiers. Following the attack, Israels security cabinet declared war against Hamas and a military campaign against these terrorist\norganizations commenced in parallel to their continued rocket and terror attacks.\nFollowing the attack by Hamas on Israels southern border, Hezbollah in Lebanon has also launched missile, rocket, and shooting attacks against Israeli military sites, troops, and\nIsraeli towns in northern Israel. In response to these attacks, the Israeli army has carried out a number of targeted strikes on sites belonging to Hezbollah in southern Lebanon.\nIn addition, Israel faces threats from more distant neighbors, in particular, Iran which has threatened to attack Israel, may be developing nuclear weapons and has targeted cyber-\nattacks against Israeli entities, and terrorist groups in Yemen, which are threatening to limit the movement of marine shipments to Israel through the Red Sea.\n14\nCurrently TATs continues its business and operations but the intensity and duration of Israels current war against Hamas is difficult to predict, as are such wars economic\nimplications on our business and operations and on Israel's economy in general.\nFurthermore, there are a number of countries, primarily Arab and Muslim countries, that restrict or frown upon business with Israel or Israeli companies, and TAT is precluded from\nmarketing its products to these countries. Restrictive laws or policies directed towards Israel or Israeli companies may have an adverse impact on TATs operations, TATs financial results or\nthe expansion of TATs business.\nTATs results of operations may be negatively affected by the obligation of its personnel to perform military service.\nMany of TATs employees and some of TATs directors and senior management based in Israel are obligated to perform annual reserve duty in the Israel Defense Forces (IDF)\nand may be called for active duty under emergency circumstances at any time. If a military conflict or war arises, these individuals could be required to serve in the military for extended\nperiods of time. TATs operations could be disrupted by the absence of one or more of its senior management, key employees or a significant number of other employees for a significant\nperiod due to military service. Any such disruption in TATs operations could adversely affect TATs business. Since October 7, 2023, the Israel Defense Force (IDF) has called up more than\n350,000 of its reserve forces to serve. A significant number of our management and non-management employees are currently subject to military service in the IDF and many of them have\nbeen called to serve. In addition, the family members of many of our Israeli team members are currently serving in the IDF. Such disruption could materially and adversely affect our\nbusiness, prospects, financial condition, and results of operations.\nYour rights and responsibilities as a shareholder are governed by Israeli law and may differ in some respects from the rights and responsibilities of shareholders under U.S. law.\nTAT is incorporated under Israeli law. The rights and responsibilities of holders of TATs ordinary shares are governed by TATs memorandum of association, articles of association\nand by Israeli law. These rights and responsibilities differ in some respects from the rights and responsibilities of shareholders in typical U.S. corporations. In particular, each shareholder of\nan Israeli company has a duty to act in good faith and in a customary manner in exercising his or her rights and fulfilling his or her obligations toward the company and other shareholders\nand to refrain from abusing his power in the company, including, among other things, in voting at the general meeting of shareholders on certain matters. Israeli law provides that these\nduties are applicable in shareholder votes on, among other things, amendments to a companys articles of association, increases in a companys authorized share capital, mergers and\ninterested party transactions requiring shareholder approval. In addition, a controlling shareholder of an Israeli company, or a shareholder who knows that he or she possesses the power to\ndetermine the outcome of a shareholder vote or who has the power to appoint or prevent the appointment of a director or officer in the company, has a duty of fairness toward the company.\nHowever, Israeli law currently does not define the substance of this duty of fairness. Because Israeli corporate law has undergone extensive revision in recent years, there is relatively little\ncase law available to assist in understanding the implications of these provisions that govern shareholder behavior.\nIsraeli law may delay, prevent or make difficult an acquisition of TAT, which could prevent a change of control and, therefore, depresses the price of TATs shares.\nIsraeli corporate law regulates mergers, requires tender offers for acquisitions of shares above specified thresholds, requires special approvals for transactions involving directors,\nofficers or significant shareholders and regulates other matters that may be relevant to these types of transactions. Furthermore, Israeli tax considerations may make potential transactions\nunappealing to TAT or to some of TATs shareholders. These provisions of Israeli law may delay, prevent or make difficult an acquisition of TAT, which could prevent a change of control\nand therefore depress the price of TATs shares.\nInvestors and TATs shareholders generally may have difficulties enforcing a U.S. judgment against TAT, TATs executive officers and directors or asserting U.S. securities laws claims\nin Israel.\nTAT is incorporated in Israel and the majority of TATs executive officers and directors reside outside the United States. Service of process upon them may be difficult to effect\nwithin the United States. Furthermore, many of TATs assets and most of the assets of TATs executive officers and directors are located outside the United States. Therefore, a judgment\nobtained against TAT or certain of its executive officers and directors in the United States, including one based on the civil liability provisions of the U.S. federal securities laws, may not be\ncollectible in the United States and may not be enforced by an Israeli court. It also may be difficult for you to assert U.S. securities law claims in original actions instituted in Israel.\nHowever, subject to certain time limitations and other conditions, Israeli courts may enforce final judgments of U.S. courts for liquidated amounts in civil matters, including judgments\nbased upon the civil liability provisions of those and similar acts.\n15\nAs a foreign private issuer whose shares are listed on NASDAQ, TAT may follow certain home country corporate governance practices instead of certain NASDAQ requirements.\nAs a foreign private issuer whose shares are listed on NASDAQ, TAT is permitted to follow certain home country corporate governance practices instead of certain requirements of\nthe NASDAQ Marketplace Rules. A foreign private issuer that elects to follow a home country practice instead of such requirements must submit to NASDAQ in advance a written\nstatement from an independent counsel in such issuers home country certifying that the issuers practices are not prohibited by the home countrys laws. In addition, a foreign private issuer\nmust disclose in its annual reports filed with the SEC or on its website each such requirement that it does not follow and describe the home country practice followed by the issuer instead of\nany such requirement. For example, Israels corporate governance or laws require that TAT obtain shareholder approval for certain dilutive events, such as for the establishment or\namendment of certain equity-based compensation plans, an issuance that will result in a change of control of TAT, certain transactions other than a public offering involving issuances of a\n20% or more interest in TAT and certain acquisitions of the stock or assets of another company, which are not required by NASDAQ.\nItem 4. Information on the Company\nHistory and Development of TAT\nTAT was incorporated under the laws of the State of Israel in April 1985 under the name Galaxy Graphics Ltd. TAT changed its name to Galagraph Ltd. in August 1986 and to TAT\nTechnologies Ltd. in May 1992. TAT is a public limited liability company under the Israeli Companies Law 1999-5759, (Israeli Companies Law), and operates under this law and\nassociated legislation. TATs registered offices and principal place of business are located at 5 Hamelacha St., Netanya 4250540 Israel, and its telephone number is +972-8-862-8500. TATs\nwebsite is\nwww.tat-technologies.com. The information on TATS website is not incorporated by reference into this annual report. The Companys agent for service of process in the United States is\nthe Companys subsidiary, Limco-Piedmont, Inc., 5304 S. Lawton Avenue, Tulsa, Oklahoma 74107.\nTAT was founded in 1985 to develop the computerized systems business of its then parent company, TAT Industries Ltd. (TAT Industries), a publicly-held Israeli corporation then\nengaged in the manufacture and sale of aeronautical equipment. In December 1991, TAT acquired the heat exchange operations of TAT Industries and in 2000, TAT purchased the remaining\noperations of TAT Industries relating to the manufacture and maintenance of aviation accessories and leased certain of its properties.\nIn March 1987, TAT completed the initial public offering of its securities in the United States. TAT was listed on the NASDAQ Global Market (then known as the NASDAQ\nNational Market) from its initial public offering until July 1998 when the listing of TATs ordinary shares was transferred to the NASDAQ Capital Market. On June 24, 2009, TATs ordinary\nshares resumed trading on the NASDAQ Global Market. Since August 2005 TATs shares have been traded also on the TASE.\nIn 1993, TAT acquired Limco Airepair, Inc. (Limco). Located in Tulsa, Oklahoma, Limcos FAA-certified repair station provides MRO services for airlines, air cargo carriers,\nmaintenance service centers and the military, especially for heat transfer components. In addition to its MRO services, Limco is an OEM of heat transfer solutions for aircraft and system\nmanufacturers and other selected related products.\nIn 2005, Limco acquired Piedmont, a company certified by the FAA to perform MRO services of APUs and landing gears. Located in Greensboro, North Carolina, Piedmonts\nFAA-certified repair station provides MRO services for airlines, air cargo carriers, maintenance service centers and the military, especially for landing gears and APUs.\nIn July 2007, Limco-Piedmont completed an initial public offering of its common stock and Limco-Piedmonts shares were listed on the NASDAQ Global Market (symbol: LIMC)\nuntil July 2, 2009, when TAT acquired all of the publicly held shares of Limco-Piedmont (approximately 32% of Limco-Piedmonts total shares) in a stock for stock merger. As a result of\nsuch merger, Limco-Piedmont again became a wholly-owned subsidiary of TAT.\nFollowing a series of transactions occurring between March 2008 and March 2009, TAT acquired 70% control of Bental Industries Ltd. In February 2014, TAT sold its entire\ninterest in Bental Industries Ltd to Bental Investments Agshah Ltd. for an aggregate consideration of $5 million.\nOn December 4, 2009, TAT, through its subsidiary Piedmont, signed an investment agreement with FAvS. According to the agreement, Piedmont was issued 288,334 shares of\nClass B common stock of FAvS, representing 37% of FAvS' then share capital (total number of shares acquired was subsequently adjusted as result of a 1 for 20 reverse stock split) and\n$750,000 of FAvS preferred shares (entitled to cash dividends at an annual rate of 12% payable quarterly or to additional preferred shares at an annual rate of 15%) in return for Piedmont's\npropeller and parts businesses.\n16\nOn March 11, 2015, Piedmont sold 237,932 shares of Class B common stock of FAvS representing 23.18% of FAvS' share capital and its entire holdings (16,253) of FAvS' Series A\npreferred stock for an insignificant amount. As of December 31, 2023, TAT owns approximately 5% of FAvS issued and outstanding share capital.\nIn October 2015, TAT acquired Turbochrome, a company certified by the FAA and EASA to perform overhaul and coating of jet engine components, including turbine vanes and\nblades and fan blades.\nIn November 2015, TAT entered into an agreement with Engineering to establish a new MRO facility in Russia. The company, TAT-Engineering LLC, is based in Novosibirsks\nTolmachevo airport and is provides services of minor repair, overhaul and recore for heat transfer components in Russia and the CIS. According to the joint venture agreement, TAT owns\n51% of TAT-Engineering's shares and the remaining 49% are held by Engineering.\nA.

The customers for TAT Israel MRO services include the IAF, IAI,\nvarious NATO countries, as well as the U.S. Air Force, U.S. Army and U.S. Navy.\nTAT Israel relies on highly qualified personnel and strong engineering, development and manufacturing capabilities that enable it to support its customers from the early program\ndevelopment phase to prototype delivery.\nTAT estimates the size of the markets in which TAT Israel operates to be significant based on the scope of development projects and purchasing processes of its customers. Many of\nthe projects TAT Israel is engaged in are lengthy and complex, which account for its long-term supplier relationships and the customer loyalty it enjoys. TAT plans to expand its TAT Israel\noperations in the OEM segment, among other things, by increasing the scope of work with its existing strategic customers, establishing relationships with new customers, increasing its\ncapabilities in complete systems/subsystems manufacturing, and by targeting strategic territories with high commercial potential.\nMRO Services for Heat Transfer Components and OEM of Heat Transfer Solutions (Limco)\nThrough its Limco subsidiary TAT provides MRO services and OEM services to the aerospace and ground defense industries in the field of heat transfer. Limcos FAA-certified\nrepair station provides aircraft component MRO services for airlines, OEMs, air cargo carriers, maintenance service centers and the military. Limco is also certified by the EASA, and the\nCivil Aviation Administration of China (CAAC). Limco has NADCAP certification for dye penetrant testing, welding and heat treating. Limco specializes in MRO services for\ncomponents of aircraft, such as heat transfer components and ozone converters. Generally, manufacturer specifications, government regulations and military maintenance regimens require\nthat aircraft components undergo MRO servicing at regular intervals or as necessary. Aircraft heat transfer components typically require MRO services, including repairs and installation of\nreplacement units, after two to five years of service or sooner if required. Aircraft manufacturers typically provide warranties on new aircraft and their components and subsystems, which\nmay range from one to five years depending on the bargaining power of the purchaser. Warranty claims are generally the responsibility of the OEM during the warranty period. Limcos\nbusiness opportunity usually begins upon the conclusion of the warranty period for these components and subsystems. Limcos customers include major U.S. domestic and international\nairlines, air cargo carriers, maintenance service centers, OEMs such as commercial and military aircraft manufacturers and defense contractors, and the U.S. Armed Forces (Army, Air\nForce, Navy and Coast Guard). MRO contracts with these types of customers are generally long-term engagements and may have terms of one to five years or more.\n18\nLimco enjoys a strong reputation among customers for its competitive pricing and fast turnaround time. It is recognized by leading OEMs of aerospace products to provide MRO\nservices for their heat transfer solutions. For example, Limco is a well-recognized Collins Aerospace Authorized repair center, providing MRO services for many of its heat transfer\nsolutions.\nIn addition to its MRO services, Limco also manufactures, on an OEM basis, heat transfer solutions used in commercial, regional, business and military aviation platforms.\nCustomers for Limcos heat transfer solutions include Boeing, the Defense Supply Center, Parker Hannifin, Raytheon Company (Raytheon), BAE Systems, Bell Helicopter, Triumph\nAerostructures, Northrop Grumman Corporation and Gulfstream Aerospace Corporation.\nTAT estimates the size of the markets in which Limco operates to be significant based on the number of aircraft requiring MRO services provided by Limco along with the\ncustomer loyalty Limco enjoys. TAT plans to expand its Limco operations, among other things, by developing OEM and MRO capabilities for additional types of heat transfer products with\nsignificant commercial potential.\nMRO Services for Aviation Components (Piedmont)\nThrough its subsidiary Piedmont, TAT provides MRO services for aviation components to the aerospace industry. Piedmonts FAA- and EASA-certified repair station provides\naircraft component MRO services for commercial airlines, business jets, air cargo carriers, maintenance service providers as well as governments and military forces worldwide. Piedmont\nspecializes in MRO services for aircraft components, including APUs, landing gears and Machining and Plating services (MPG). Generally, manufacturer specifications, government\nregulations and military maintenance regimens require that aircraft components undergo MRO servicing at regular intervals or as necessary. Aircraft components typically require MRO\nservices, including repairs and installation of replacement units, after three to ten years of service or sooner if required. Aircraft manufacturers typically provide warranties on new aircraft\nand their components and subsystems, which may range from one to five years. Warranty claims are generally the responsibility of the OEM during the warranty period. Piedmonts\nbusiness opportunity usually begins upon the conclusion of the warranty period for these components and subsystems. Piedmonts customers include U.S. domestic and international\nairlines, air cargo carriers and maintenance service providers. MRO contracts with these types of customers are generally long-term engagements that may have terms of one to ten years or\nmore.\nPiedmont is licensed by Honeywell as an authorized repair center to provide MRO services for several types of its APU models. Piedmont has licensing agreements in place with\nthe major landing gear manufacturers Safran Landing Gear Systems and Liebherr Aerospace as well.\nIn 2021 Piedmont began providing its customers with APU engine leasing services with respect to the APU 331-250 and 331-500 models.\nTAT estimates the size of the markets in which Piedmont operates to be significant based on the number of aircraft requiring MRO services provided by Piedmont. TAT plans to\nexpand its Piedmont operations in the MRO segment by using Piedmonts experience and reputation to develop MRO capabilities for additional types of APU and landing gears applications\nas well as other aircraft systems/components with significant commercial potential and by offering additional supplementary services such as machining, plating, and grinding (MPG).\nIn this instance, Piedmont signed several strategic agreements with Honeywell (aerospace division). Under these transactions, Honeywell granted a 10-year license to MRO with\nrespect to the following APU lines : 331-200\\250, 331-500 that serves the Boeing 777 platform and 131 that serves the Boeing 737 platform and Airbus 319-320-321 platform. During 2021,\nPiedmont entered into the APU leasing activity with a purchase of eighteen 331-500APU engines from Honeywell, under which Honeywell is the main customer for leasing these engines\n(pursuant to this agreement Piedmont is Honeywell's sole source for engines for lease purposes). In 2022 Piedmont increased the lease pool by adding six 131-9A/B APUs and five\n331-200/250 APUs.\nPiedmonts extensive experience in the repair and overhaul of APUs and landing systems includes a comprehensive involvement in the industry supply chain. In addition to its\nMRO services, Piedmont is active worldwide in the exchange, lease and individual component parts supply of its APU and landing gear products. Through a network of industry partners\nand well-known aerospace parts distributors, Piedmonts activity in the sale of parts is a robust element of its business. Piedmonts quality systems are AS9110 and NADCAP for non-\ndestructive testing.\n19\nOverhaul and Coating of Jet Engine Components (Turbochrome)\nThrough its subsidiary Turbochrome, TAT provides MRO services for jet engine components to the aerospace industry. Turbochromes FAA- and EASA-certified repair station\nprovides its services mainly to maintenance service centers, airlines and the military. Turbochrome specializes in MRO services for engine components such as turbine vanes and blades,\ncompressor vanes and blades, fan blades and after burner flaps. Generally, manufacturer specifications, government regulations and military maintenance regimens require that engine\ncomponents undergo MRO servicing at regular intervals or as necessary. Commercial engine components typically require MRO services after three to five years of service or sooner if\nrequired. Engine manufacturers typically provide warranties on new engines and their components and subsystems, which may range from one to five years depending on the bargaining\npower of the purchaser. Warranty claims are generally the responsibility of the OEM during the warranty period. Turbochromes business opportunity usually begins upon the conclusion of\nthe warranty period for these components. Turbochromes customers include domestic and international airlines, maintenance service centers and the military.\nTurbochrome also specializes in the manufacturing of coating powders (for pack cementation aluminide coatings) and masking materials (for the prevention of coating in defined\nareas) used in the aviation industry. Turbochrome provides these materials to OEMs and to maintenance service centers.\nTAT estimates the size of the markets in which Turbochrome operates to be significant based on the number of jet engines requiring MRO services. Turbochrome plans to expand\nits operations in the MRO segment by using Turbochromes experience and reputation to develop MRO capabilities for additional types of jet engine components with significant\ncommercial potential.\nTurbochromes quality system complies with ISO 9001 and AS9100, and with EASA part 145 and FAA FAR 145 for the civil parts.\nIn June 2020, the Company's management decided to discontinue the JT8D engine blades reconditioning activity as part of a strategic change in Turbochrome's business to focus\non new capabilities to provide services to newer types of engines. This discontinued operation constitutes a material portion of Turbochromes revenues. In 2021, the Company continued\nwith the fade out plan of the JT8D engine blade reconditioning activity and as of 2022and 2023 this activity is immaterial for TATs financial statements reporting.\nTAT-Engineering LLC\nIn November 2015, we signed an agreement with Russian-based Engineering Holdings Ltd, of Moscow (Engineering), to establish a new facility for the provision of MRO\nservices for heat transfer components. The company, TAT-Engineering LLC, is based in Novosibirsks Tolmachevo airport. The entity was established in January 2016 and is currently\noperating under FAA certifications and obtained FAA high-level repair approvals. Current efforts are focused on marketing initiatives targeting the major Russian and CIS airlines and\nmaintenance stations. However, due to sanctions imposed by the United States, EU, Japan and other jurisdictions on certain industry sectors and parties in Russia and certain impacted\nregions, as well as enhanced export controls on certain products and industries, during 2022 and 2023 our joint venture in Russia ceased to purchase heat-exchange cores from Limco, our\nUS subsidiary, and therefore the joint venture had to materially limit the extent of the MRO services it provides to its customers.\nBusiness Strategy\nTAT aims to be the trusted partner to its strategic customers, delivering differentiated products and services in selected, high barrier-to-entry, markets. This will enable TAT to\ndevelop the long-term high-value relationships it strives to have with its customers to effectively complete and continue grow business and improve profitability. Currently, TATs focus is on\ntwo main markets: thermal management solutions and services and Power and Actuation solutions and services.\n20\nExecution of TATs strategy is based on the following principles:\n Enhancing OEM capabilities  capitalizing on our technical expertise, experience and reputation in the market of heat transfer solutions to expand the scope of our OEM\nofferings to new aircrafts or to new platforms in the existing aircrafts.\n Expand the scope of MRO servicesleveraging our technical expertise, engineering resources and facilities to broaden MRO services to additional types of aircraft and additional\naircraft systems, subsystems and components while developing the required technical expertise to provide these additional MRO services.\n Increasing market share  continuing aggressive marketing efforts to win new customers as well as to expand activities with existing customers, partly by focusing on cross\nselling opportunities between our different businesses. As part of our efforts, we also intend to expand our marketing presence in existing territories, like the United States and\nWestern Europe as well as new territories, where TAT currently has a smaller presence and fewer customers, such as Eastern Europe, Latin America and Asia.\n Effective synergy among group members  enhancing the synergies between our various businesses. For example, by supplying TAT Israel with heat transfer components\nmanufactured in Limco for the sale of heat exchangers.\n Organic growth and M&A  in addition to growing our existing businesses organically as detailed above, we intend to evaluate complementary acquisition opportunities.\nProducts and Services\nOEM of Heat Transfer Solutions and Aviation Accessories\nTAT Israel manufactures a wide range of heat transfer solutions used on board aircraft, air conditioning systems, environmental control systems and cooling systems for electronics\nfor military use. These solutions are manufactured in compliance with all of the stringent quality assurance standards that apply to the manufacture of aircraft parts. TAT Israel's quality\nsystem complies with ISO 9001, AS9100, Boeing quality systems approval D6-82479 and FAR 21.303 (the FAA standard for Parts Manufacturer Approval) and NADCAP for non-\ndestructive testing and welding.\nHeat Transfer Solutions\nTAT Israel specializes in the design and manufacture of highly efficient, compact and reliable heat transfer solutions that are designed to meet stringent constraints such as size,\nweight and environmental conditions. Heat transfer solutions, such as heat exchangers and cold plates, are integral components of a wide variety of environmental control, mechanical and\nengine systems, as well as a wide range of electronic systems. These systems generate heat during operation that must be removed and dissipated. Heat transfer solutions facilitate the\nexchange of heat created through the operation of these systems by transmitting the heat from a hot medium (air, oil or other fluids) to a cold medium for disposal.\nIn the aerospace industry, there is a constant need for improvements in performance, weight, cost and reliability. In addition, as electronic systems become smaller and more densely\npacked, the need for sophisticated and efficient heat transfer components used to provide the cooling functions becomes more critical. Using TAT Israel's technological expertise, TAT\nbelieves it is well positioned to respond to these industry demands through continued new product development and product improvements.\nTAT Israel's principal heat transfer solutions include heat exchangers and cold plates. Typically, air-to-air heat exchangers cool a jet engines bleed air which, when cooled, is then\nused in the aircrafts air conditioning, pressurization and pneumatic systems. The liquid-to-air heat exchangers cool liquids such as engine oil, hydraulic oil and others used in other systems.\nTAT Israel provides a one-stop-shop for all types of heat transfer solutions. A significant portion of TAT Israel's heat transfer solutions is sold to customers in connection with the\noriginal manufacture or retrofitting of particular aircraft equipment. TAT Israel generally enters into long-term supply contracts with its customers, which require TAT Israel to supply heat\ntransfer products as part of a larger project.\n21\nTAT Israel also manufactures other heat transfer solutions, such as cooling chassis, heat sinks and cold plates (which may be air-to-air, liquid-to-air or liquid-to-liquid), to control\nand dispose heat emitted by the operation of various electronic systems. Such products are currently utilized mainly in radar systems, avionics, electronic warfare systems and various pods\nfor targeting, navigation and night vision.\nAs a result of the specialized nature of the systems in which TAT Israel's parts are included, spare and replacement parts for the original heat transfer solutions are also usually\nprovided by TAT Israel.\nDuring 2021, as part of a strategic plan by TATs management, TAT started transferring the heat exchangers activity from its Gedera facility to Limco in the US. The transfer was\naccomplished according to TATs management strategic plan in 2022. Such transfer created a unified independent MRO\\OEM center for heat exchangers, and as part of such transfer TAT\nbuilt its strategic R&D center for heat exchangers in the US.\nAviation Flow Control Accessories\nTAT Israel is also engaged in the design, development, manufacture and MRO services for aviation flow control accessories. These accessories include components such as valves\nand pumps.\nCooling and Air Conditioning Systems\nTAT Israel is also engaged in the design, development and manufacture of complete environmental control systems and cooling systems. This product line includes ground cooling\nsystems mainly for military applications such as mobile command and control units, command and control vehicles, armored vehicles, mobile broadcast units, mobile hospitals, etc. In\naddition, TAT Israel designs, develops and manufactures power electronics cooling systems based on customer specifications, while providing a complete engineering solution in compliance\nwith strict civil aviation standards. TAT Israel's systems are used globally and are tested under strict standards.\nMRO Services for Heat Transfer Components and OEM of Heat Transfer Solutions\nMRO Services for Heat Transfer Components\nThrough its Limco subsidiary in the U.S., TAT provides MRO services for heat transfer components. The demand for MRO services is driven by the size and age of the aircraft fleet\n(including new aircrafts entering into service), aircraft utilization and regulations set OR promulgated by the FAA and other governmental authorities.\nDue to the increased maintenance costs of their aging fleets many carriers are seeking ways to reduce costs, minimize down-time, increase aircraft reliability and extend time\nbetween overhauls. One way to accomplish this goal is through the outsourcing of more of their maintenance and support functions to reliable third parties. Furthermore, we believe that\ncommercial carriers making the decision to outsource their MRO requirements are searching for MRO service providers with a wide-range of service capabilities. Such MRO service\nproviders allow the carriers to concentrate their outsourcing of MRO services to a select group of third-party providers. The global military aircraft fleet also presents similar opportunities\nfor MRO service providers. We believe that an aging military fleet and the increased use of upgrade programs aimed at extending the useful life of military aircraft will provide continued\nMRO growth opportunities.\nLimco specializes in the repair and overhaul of heat transfer components. These components include heat exchangers, oil coolers, pre-coolers, reheaters, condensers, water\nseparators, fuel heaters, evaporators and ozone converters.\n22\nLimco is continually expanding its MRO capabilities based on market need and/or customer request. Limcos capabilities include heat transfer components used in aircraft and\nsystems manufactured by Airbus, Boeing, Bombardier, Cessna, Embraer, Lockheed Martin, Fokker, Liebherr-Aerospace, Collins Aerospace, Honeywell Aerospace and others.\nAs part of the TAT's strategic plan announced in March 2021, the Company will enhance Limco's Heat exchange cores manufacturing capabilities by, among other things,\nstrengthening Limcos employees engineering knowledge, recruitment and training of employees and investment in new machines and infrastructures.\nLimco performs MRO services at its repair station in Tulsa, Oklahoma which has ISO9001, AS9110 and AS9100 certification, NADCAP certification for dye penetrant testing,\nwelding and heat treating, and is licensed to provide MRO services by the FAA and EASA, as well as by the civil aviation Administration of China.\nLimco offers different or various MRO services for heat transfer components. If the damage is significant, Limco will remanufacture the unit, which generally entails replacing the\ncore matrix of the damaged or old heat transfer component in lieu of replacing the entire unit with a new one. Limco designs and develops these customized remanufactured units as a cost-\neffective alternative to new part replacement. In the event of less severe damage, Limco will either overhaul or repair the unit as necessary. Re-manufactured units carry warranties which are\noften equal or better than those provided to new units.\nOEM Authorizations and Licenses\nLimco believes that establishing and maintaining relationships with OEMs of aircraft systems and components is an important factor in achieving sustainable success as an\nindependent MRO service provider. OEMs grant independent MRO service providers authorization to perform repair and overhaul services on their behalf. OEMs generally grant very few\nauthorizations and maintain tight controls over their authorized MRO service providers in order to maintain high quality of service to their customers. Obtaining OEM authorization requires\nsophisticated technological capabilities, experience-based industry knowledge and substantial capital investment. Furthermore, Limco believes that service providers that have OEM\nauthorization gain a competitive advantage as they typically receive discounts on parts, technical information and OEM warranty support. Limco is an independent MRO service provider\nthat is a well-recognized repair center of Collins Aerospace (Hamilton Sundstrand), one of the largest heat transfer solutions manufacturers in North America or in the United States.\nOEM of Heat Transfer Solutions\nIn addition to its MRO services, Limco also acts as an OEM manufacturer of heat transfer solutions used mainly in military aircraft and other ground applications and to a lesser\nextent, in commercial, regional and business aircraft. Limco specializes in the design and manufacture of highly efficient heat transfer solutions, which are designed to meet stringent\nconstraints such as size, weight and applicable environmental conditions. These units include heat exchangers, oil coolers, precoolers, reheaters, condensers, fuel heaters and evaporators.\nLimco also manufactures demineralizer systems for U.S. Navy vessels, including ships and nuclear submarines. Limco currently offers tens of OEM parts to the aerospace and\nground defense industries. These parts are manufactured in compliance with the stringent quality assurance standards that apply to the manufacture of aircraft and military parts.\nLimcos quality systems are ISO9001, AS9110, AS9100 and NADCAP for non-destructive testing, welding and heat treating and FAR 21.303 (the FAA standard for Parts\nManufacturer Approval).\n23\nMRO Services for Aviation Components\nThrough its Piedmont subsidiary, TAT provides MRO services for aviation components, including APUs and landing gear. As previously mentioned, the demand for MRO services\nis driven by the size and age of the aircraft fleet, aircraft utilization and regulations by the FAA and other governmental authorities.\nDue to increased maintenance costs of their aging fleets many carriers are seeking ways to reduce costs, minimize down-time, increase aircraft reliability and extend time between\noverhauls. One way to accomplish this goal is through the outsourcing of more of their maintenance and support functions to reliable third parties. Furthermore, we also believe that\ncommercial carriers making the decision to outsource their MRO requirements are searching for MRO service providers that offer a wide-range of service capabilities. These MRO service\nproviders allow the carriers to concentrate their outsourcing of MRO services to a select group of third-party providers. The global military aircraft fleet also presents similar opportunities\nfor MRO service providers. We believe that an aging military fleet and the increased use of upgrade programs aimed at extending the useful life of aircrafts will provide continued MRO\ngrowth opportunities.\nPiedmont specializes in the repair and overhaul of APUs and landing gears. APUs are relatively small, self-contained generators used to start jet engines, usually with compressed\nair, and to provide electricity, hydraulic pressure and air conditioning while an aircraft is on the ground. In many aircraft, an APU can also provide electrical power during in-flight\nemergency situations. Landing gears are the structure that support an aircraft on the ground and allow it to taxi, takeoff and land.\nPiedmont performs MRO services at its repair station in Greensboro, North Carolina, which is licensed by the FAA and EASA. Piedmont specializes in providing comprehensive\nrepair and overhaul services for APU models manufactured by Honeywell ,the leading OEM in the United States. In addition, Piedmont provides full repair, overhaul, machining, plating\nand grinding services for landing gear systems for commercial and military aircraft. Piedmont has a long history in providing landing gear MRO services for regional airliners, including\naircraft manufactured by the French-Italian ATR (42/72), Gulfstream (G4), Lockheed Martin (P3/C130) and the Brazilian Embraer (E170/E190). At the end of 2020 Piedmont signed a new\nexclusive contract with Honeywell as Honeywell's exclusive rental bank provider for the APU 331-500 (used in the Boeing 777 platform). By signing this agreement with Honeywell and\npurchasing 18 APU331-500 engines Piedmont entered a new segment of APU leasing. Piedmont also signed a contract to be an authorized repair station for the 331-500 APU (serving the\nBoeing 777 platform) as well as the APU 131 serving the Boeing 737 platform and Airbus 319-320-321 platform.\nOEM Authorizations and Licenses\nPiedmont believes that establishing and maintaining relationships with OEMs of aircraft systems and components is an important factor in achieving sustainable success as an\nindependent MRO service provider. OEMs grant independent MRO service providers authorizations or licenses to perform repair and overhaul services on the equipment they manufacture.\nOEMs generally grant few authorizations or licenses and maintain tight controls over their authorized and licensed MRO service providers, in order to maintain high quality of service to\ntheir customers. Obtaining OEM authorizations requires sophisticated technological capabilities, experience-based industry knowledge and substantial capital investment. Piedmont believes\nthat service providers that have OEM authorizations and licenses gain a competitive advantage as they typically receive discounts on parts, technical information, OEM warranty support\nand use of the OEM name in marketing. Piedmont is an authorized repair station licensed by Honeywell, the largest manufacturer of APUs, for several of its APU models.\nMachining, Plating and Grinding, or MPG Services\nPiedmont has extended its services to include the provision of MPG services, either as supplementary to its traditional MRO services or as stand-alone services. We believe that\nestablishing and maintaining customer relationships with our MPG shop is an important factor in achieving sustainable success as an independent MRO service provider and creates a\ncompetitive advantage.\n24\nOverhaul and Coating of Jet Engine Components\nThrough its subsidiary, Turbochrome, TAT provides MRO services for jet engine components to the aerospace industry. Turbochromes FAA- and EASA-certified repair station\nprovides its services mainly to maintenance service centers, airlines and the military. Turbochrome specializes in MRO services for engine components such as turbine vanes and blades,\ncompressor vanes and blades, fan blades and after burner flaps. Generally, manufacturer specifications, government regulations and military maintenance regimens require that engine\ncomponents undergo MRO servicing at regular intervals or as necessary. Commercial engine components typically require MRO services after three to five years of service or sooner if\nrequired. Engine manufacturers typically provide warranties on new engines and their components and subsystems, which may range from one to five years depending on the bargaining\npower of the purchaser. Engine manufacturers may also offer extended warranty agreements for 10 to 15 years for the engines. Warranty claims are generally the responsibility of the OEM\nduring the warranty period. Turbochromes business opportunity usually begins upon the conclusion of the warranty period for these components. Turbochrome offers its customers DER\n(Designated Engineering Representatives) and DOA (Design Organization Approval) repairs approved by the FAA and EASA. Turbochromes customers include U.S. domestic and\ninternational airlines, maintenance service centers and the military.\nTAT estimates the size of the markets in which Turbochrome operates to be significant based on the number of jet engines requiring MRO services provided by Turbochrome.\nTurbochrome plans to expand its operations in the MRO segment by using Turbochromes experience and reputation to develop MRO capabilities for additional types of jet engine\ncomponents with significant commercial potential.\nTurbochromes quality system complies with ISO 9001 and AS9100, and with EASA part 145, FAA FAR 145 for the civil parts, the Israel Laboratory Accreditation Authority\nunder ISO/IEC 17025:20 and NADCAP for 3 manufacturing procedures.\nManufacturing of masking and coating materials\nThrough its Turbochrome facility, TAT manufactures a wide range of masking and coating materials for the aviation industry. These products are manufactured in compliance with\nall of the stringent quality assurance standards that apply to the maintenance of aircraft engine components.\nCustomers\nGeneral\nTAT targets a broad range of customers within the commercial and military aerospace and ground defense industries. Our customers include commercial manufacturers of military\nequipment, commercial airlines, aircraft manufacturers, military forces, the defense industry, and other manufacturers of electronic systems, aviation units and machinery in the United\nStates, Europe, CIS, Asia, Latin America and Israel. During 2023, TAT had revenues generated by more than 500 customers worldwide.\nMajor Customers\nOEM Customers\nTAT, primarily through TAT Israel, sells its OEM solutions and systems to commercial and military aircraft manufacturers and defense contractors and to the U.S. and Israeli\ngovernments.\n25\nPartial lists of OEM customers are set in the following table:\nAircraft manufacturers Boeing, Textron, Pilatus, Embraer, Lockheed Martin, Honda Aircraft, Cirrus, Gulfstream,\nRaytheon-Collins\nSystem manufacturers/integrators and defense contractors Liebherr, , Rafael, Elbit, IAI, Parker, , Eaton Aerospace, Safran.\nThe development projects and purchasing processes of many of TATs OEM customers are lengthy and complex and accordingly, with some customers, TAT enters into frame\nagreements that determine certain legal conditions, but under which the customer is not obligated to purchase any quantity of products. Typically, customers issue purchase orders with the\nrequired supply quantity, price, lead times and other related terms.\nMRO Customers\nTAT services MRO customers primarily through Limco, Piedmont and Turbochrome, including major U.S. domestic and international airlines, air cargo carriers, maintenance\nservice centers, the U.S. Armed Forces and other air forces from around the world.\nTATs partial list of MRO customers is set forth in the following table:\nU.S. Domestic and international airlines and air cargo carriers Air France-KLM, Lufthansa, FedEx, UPS, American Airlines, Delta Airlines, United\nAirlines, Air Canada Jazz, Republic Airways, DHL, Austrian Airlines, TAM, Thai, Korean\nAir, Air India, Swiftair, Allegiant Air, Empire Airlines, Mountain Air Cargo, Alliance\nAirlines,\nMaintenance service centers Fokker, Honeywell International, Kellstrom Commercial, Aero Kool, Lufthansa Technik,\nRTX through Collins, SR Technics, Embraer, , Turkish Technic, Delta Tech Ops, ST\nAerospace Engineering, , Gulfstream, IAI, Haeco Americas , Air New-Zeeland, AAR.\nGovernments and military air forces U.S. Army, U.S. Air Force and U.S. Navy; Israeli Ministry of Defense, Israeli Air Force;\nBelgium Air Force, Polish Air Force, Portuguese Air Force, Japan Air Force.\nMilitary Contracts\nDirect sales to the U.S. government, our largest government customer, accounted for approximately 6.6% of TATs revenues for the year ended December 31, 2023, approximately\n5.2% of our revenues for the year ended December 31, 2022 and approximately 5.6% of our revenues for the year ended December 31, 2021.\nMany of TATs military contracts are awarded on a competitive basis based on technical merit, personnel qualifications, experience and price. TAT also receives some contract\nawards involving special technical capabilities on a negotiated, noncompetitive basis due to TATs technical capabilities.\n26\nTAT provides products under government contracts that usually require performance over a period of several months to several years. Long-term contracts for the U.S. military may\nbe conditioned upon continued availability of congressional appropriations. Variances between anticipated budget and congressional appropriations may result in a delay, modification of\nscope or termination of these contracts.\nThe vast majority of the governmental contracts to which TAT is party to are fixed-price contracts, some of which contain fixed-price escalation mechanism. Under these contracts,\nTAT agrees to perform specific work for a fixed price and, accordingly, realizes the benefit or detriment to the extent that the actual cost of performing the work differs from the contract\nprice. The allowable government contract costs and fees of TAT are subject to audit and may result in non-reimbursement of some contract costs and fees. While governments reserve the\nright to conduct further audits, audits conducted for periods through fiscal year 2022 and 2023 have resulted in no material cost recovery disallowances for TAT.\nTATs eligibility to perform under its government contracts requires us to maintain adequate security measures. TAT has implemented security procedures that it believes adequately\nsatisfies the requirements of its current government contracts.\nBacklog and Long-Term Agreements\nOur backlog includes the following: (i) actual purchase orders, and (ii) the estimated sales we expect to generate from long-term agreements during the life of the contract or 10\nyears the lower of the two, for which we do not have actual purchase orders. It should be noted that under these long-term agreements there is no legal obligation from the customer to\npurchase our products or services, yet typically our customers would not sign such an agreement unless there is a specific business opportunity. As such, backlog information may not\nnecessarily be indicative of future sales.\nAs of December 31, 2023, our backlog included: (i) outstanding purchase orders representing an aggregate amount of $85 million, and (ii) sales that we expect to generate from\nlong-term agreements (the longest of which is until 2033) for which we have not yet received actual purchase orders in an aggregate amount of $349 million.\nProduct and Service Warranties\nTAT provides warranties for its products and services ranging from one to three years, depending on the nature of the specific product. To date, TATs warranty costs have not been\nsubstantial. As of December 31, 2023, the combined warranty reserve for TAT was $0.3 million.\nCompetitive Environment\nOEM of Heat Transfer Solutions and Aviation Accessories\nThe aerospace and defense OEM industries in general and specifically, the commercial and military aviation markets, are characterized by intense competition and the need to\nconstantly be in the forefront of technological innovations in order to be able to offer technologically-advanced and attractive products. Competition in these OEM markets is also based on\nprice, quality and on time delivery. TAT estimates the market size of heat transfer solutions to be significant based on the scope of development projects and purchasing processes of the\npotential customers. TAT estimates that there is a small number of competing suppliers in the aerospace and defense OEM markets due to the high barriers to entry to these markets, which\ninclude the need for highly qualified and trained personnel, technologically advanced facilities and the need to obtain appropriate governmental approvals. The nature of the projects in the\ncommercial and military aviation OEM industry, which are often time consuming and complex, also require long-term supplier relationships and customer loyalty in order to succeed.\n27\nTATs competitors in the global OEM aerospace and defense industries can be divided into two main groups:\n Complete system manufacturers that either independently or through subcontractors, design, develop and manufacture complete systems (such as a manufacturer of aircraft\nhydraulic systems) directly for the platform manufacturer (i.e., for business jets). These companies will typically compete on bids for complete systems and/or projects where\nthe components/products TAT develops are part of the complete system. In such cases, it is very likely that these companies will subcontract to companies such as TAT the\ndesign and manufacturing of one or a few components in the system. Although some of these companies have the capabilities to design and manufacture each standalone\ncomponent in a complete system (i.e., a heat exchanger integrated in hydraulic systems) they usually do not compete with TAT in projects where there is a specific requirement\nfor a stand-alone component.\n Component manufacturers, such as TAT, for which the design and manufacture of components (such as heat exchangers or other types of heat transfer solutions) is the main\nbusiness (and which are normally situated in the value chain one tier below the system manufacturers, such as a manufacturer of an aircrafts hydraulic system and two tiers\nbelow the platform manufacturer, such as a manufacturer of a new aircraft). These companies typically compete in projects where there is a specific requirement for a\nstandalone aviation component (such as a heat exchanger or other types of heat transfer solutions) and in tenders by manufacturers of complete systems or products for sub-\ncontractors. Although some of the component manufacturers have the capabilities to design, develop and manufacture a complete system (i.e., environmental control system for\na business jet) for a certain platform, these companies usually do not compete on projects for complete systems in which their manufactured component constitutes a small part\nof the complete system, mainly due to the high barriers to entry and to the difficulty to move up the value chain from a component supplier to a whole system manufacturer.\nThe major competitors of TAT in the area of OEM of heat transfer solutions and aviation accessories include manufacturers in the United States such as the Hughes-Treitler division\nof Ametek, Lytron, Niagara Thermal, Collins Aerospace, Honeywell International and Triumph Thermal Systems; manufacturers based in Europe such as I.M.I. Marston, a subsidiary of\nCollins Aerospace, Safran and Liebherr; and manufacturers based in Asia such as Sumitomo Precision Products from Japan. These competitors may enjoy competitive advantages over TAT\nIsrael, such as:\n The ability to adapt faster to changes in customer requirements and industry conditions or trends;\n Greater access to capital;\n Stronger relationships with customers and suppliers;\n Greater name recognition;\n Access to superior technology and greater marketing resources;\n Ability to offer complete systems in addition to components; and\n The ability to bundle heat transfer solutions and other aircraft components.\nMRO Services for Heat Transfer Components\nThe market for MRO services in the field of heat transfer components is highly competitive. Competition in this market is based on price, turnaround time, quality and breadth of\nservices. TATs global competitors in the field of servicing heat transfer components can be divided into two main groups:\n Service divisions of OEMs  generally, each OEM of products in the heat transfer solutions segment has the necessary capabilities to provide MRO services for products it\ndesigns and manufactures throughout its lifetime, commencing with the initial warranty period and through the after-market period. Service divisions of OEMs may also acquire\ncapabilities to service products of other OEMs to further expand their MRO services.\n Service centers  which often provide MRO services for a broad range of components and systems. These service centers can be either the in-house maintenance services of\ncommercial airlines or other independent service providers, such as TAT or Limco.\nFor heat transfer MRO services, TATs major competitors are Triumph Thermal Systems, Lori Heat Transfer Center of Honeywell, Drake Air  Ametek, Liebherr-Aerospace,\nAmerican Cooler Service, Collins Aerospace Malaysia, Lufthansa Technik, Meggitt (Elite) and others.\n28\nAs an independent MRO service provider, Limcos competitors have inherent competitive advantages. For example, Limco competes with the service divisions of large OEMs\nwhich in some cases have design authority with respect to their OEM solutions and are able to derive significant pricing advantages from their OEM manufacturing activities. Limco also\ncompetes with the in-house service divisions of large commercial airlines where there is a strong incentive for an airline to fully utilize the services of its maintenance employees and\nfacilities. Further, Limcos competitors may have additional competitive advantages, such as:\n Ability to bundle heat transfer and other aircraft components;\n Access to greater marketing resources;\n Access to superior technology; and\n Greater resources which allow for better turnaround time.\nMRO Services for Aviation Components\nThe market for MRO services in which Piedmont operates is highly competitive. Competition in this market is based on quality, price, turnaround time and breadth of services.\nPiedmonts primary MRO services competitors are the service divisions of OEMs, the in-house maintenance services of various commercial airlines and other independent service providers,\nsuch as TAT or Piedmont. For APU and landing gear MRO services Piedmonts major competitors are Standard Aero Group., Aerotech International, Honeywell International, Chase\nAerospace, Professional Aviation, Messier-Dowty Aerospace (MD), AAR, Hawker Pacific, APRO, TAG Aero and Turbine Aero and others.\nA number of Piedmonts competitors have inherent competitive advantages. For example, Piedmont competes with the service divisions of large OEMs which in some cases have\ndesign authority with respect to their OEM products and are able to derive significant brand recognition from their OEM manufacturing activities. Piedmont also competes with the in-house\nservice divisions of large commercial airlines where there is a strong incentive for an airline to fully utilize the services of its maintenance employees and facilities. Further, Piedmonts\ncompetitors may have additional competitive advantages, such as:\n Better name recognition;\n Ability to bundle aviation and other aircraft components;\n Stronger relationships with customers and suppliers;\n Lower cost structure;\n Regional support near customers location;\n Access to greater marketing resources;\n Access to superior technology\n Greater access to capital; and\n Greater resources which allow for better turnaround time.\n29\nOverhaul and Coating of Jet Engine Components\nThe market for MRO services in which Turbochrome operates is highly competitive. Competition in this market is based on quality, price, level of service and turnaround time.\nTurbochromes primary MRO services competitors are the service divisions of OEMs, the in-house maintenance services of various commercial airlines and other independent service\nproviders, including Safran (Snecma), General Electric, GKN, PAS, Chromalloy Southwest, MCT Japan and others. With respect to coating and masking materials, Turbochrome's\ncompetitor is APV Coatings.\nA number of Turbochromes competitors have inherent competitive advantages. For example, Turbochrome competes with the service divisions of large OEMs which may have\ndesign authority with respect to their OEM products and are able to derive significant brand recognition from their OEM manufacturing activities. Turbochrome also competes with the in-\nhouse service divisions of large commercial airlines and there is a strong incentive for an airline to fully utilize the services of its maintenance employees and facilities. Further,\nTurbochromes competitors may have additional competitive advantages, such as:\n The ability to adapt faster to changes in customer requirements and industry conditions or trends;\n Better name recognition;\n Ability to bundle jet engine and other aircraft components;\n Stronger relationships with customers, OEMs and suppliers;\n Lower cost structure;\n Regional support near customers location;\n Access to greater marketing resources;\n Access to superior technology;\n Greater access to capital; and\n Greater resources which allow for better turnaround time\nCompetitive Strengths\nWe believe that TATs success can be attributed to several critical factors, including the following:\n Engaging in Pro-active Account Management efforts to preserve its customer base in existing projects, while working to broaden and increase its involvement with such clients.\n Conducting marketing activities aimed at penetrating new geographical markets and winning new customers, while taking advantage of the unique knowledge and expertise that\nTAT and its subsidiaries have gained in various areas.\n Entering into additional related operating segments that will enable TAT and its subsidiaries to fulfill their growth potential.\n Providing customers with the best value, including competitive prices, by tailoring comprehensive service packages that combine the design and planning of an OEM\ncomponent, the manufacture of such component, and the provision of maintenance services.\n Extending MRO capabilities in order to establish a one-stop-shop center for comprehensive MRO services for the types of aircraft Limco and/or Piedmont and/or\nTurbochrome target.\n Enhancing our engineering capabilities in order to support customer needs related to new projects and in order to certify MRO services that differ from processes previously\napproved by the FAA, EASA or other regulatory authorities.

This proactive\nexploration is specifically designed to not only improve the physical characteristics of its products, such as size and weight, but also to elevate their performance metrics, focusing on factors\nlike optimal heat transfer, heightened reliability, and extended lifespan.\n31\nAcknowledging the dynamic nature of customer demands and the ever-changing competitive environment, TAT is resolutely committed to the continuous development of\ngroundbreaking products. This commitment extends to the enhancement of functionalities in its existing offerings. By adopting this strategic approach, TAT ensures its adaptability and\nresponsiveness to emerging market potential. The company actively allocates significant resources to foster collaboration with its customers, forming partnerships that serve as catalysts for\nthe pursuit of technological advancements and the enhancement of product features.\nThrough these collaborative efforts, TAT aspires to achieve and deliver cutting-edge solutions, positioning itself at the forefront of innovation for the thermal management systems.\nBy staying at the vanguard of technological advancements, TAT aims to not only meet but exceed the evolving needs of its customers while maintaining a competitive edge in the dynamic\nmarket landscape.\nSource and Availability of Raw Materials and Spare Parts\nTAT and its subsidiaries acquire most of the components for the manufacture of their products and provision of their services from a limited number of suppliers and subcontractors,\nthe majority located in Israel and the United States. Some of these suppliers are currently the sole source of one or more components upon which TAT and its subsidiaries are dependent.\nSince many of TAT's and its subsidiaries purchases require long lead times, a delay in the supply of an item can significantly delay the delivery of a product. Generally, TAT and its\nsubsidiaries have not experienced significant difficulty in obtaining timely deliveries of necessary components; however, if they are unable to obtain these components when needed, they\nwould experience delays in manufacturing their products and their financial results could be adversely affected.\nThe raw materials used in manufacturing programs are generally readily available metals and alloys. TAT and its subsidiaries have not had any significant difficulty in obtaining\nsuch materials in the past.\nTAT and its subsidiaries select their suppliers primarily based on their ability to ensure that their parts are serviceable and traceable to OEM-approved sources, their delivery\nperformance and their ability to help reduce the total cost of procuring those parts. For quality control, cost and efficiency reasons, TAT and its subsidiaries generally purchase supplies only\nfrom vendors with who they have ongoing relationships or who their customers have previously approved.\nAuthorizations from OEMs often require that TAT purchase component parts that are needed for its MRO services from the OEM or its designated distributors.\nWherever possible, TAT and its subsidiaries have made and continue to make an effort to qualify second sources or have identified alternate sources for many of their parts needs.\n32\nIsraeli Export Policy\nExports of military related products are subject to the military export policy of the State of Israel. Currently the Israeli government encourages exports to approved customers,\nprovided that such exports do not run counter to Israeli policy or national security considerations. TAT Israel must obtain a permit prior to initiating a sales proposal and ultimately an export\nlicense for the transaction is required. Israeli law also regulates the export of dual use items (items that are typically sold for civilian uses or purposes but that may also have military\npurposes).\nWhile we have been successful in obtaining export permits in the past, we may not be able to obtain the necessary export permits or licenses in the future. In addition, governmental\npolicy with respect to military exports (or dual use items) may be altered.\nU.S. Export Regulations\nExport of defense products, military technical data and technical services by our U.S. subsidiaries to Israel and other countries is subject to applicable approvals by the U.S.\ngovernment under the U.S. International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR). Such approvals are typically in the form of an export license or a technical assistance agreement (TAA).\nOther U.S. companies wishing to export defense products or military-related services and technology to our Israeli and other non-U.S. entities are also required to obtain such export licenses\nand TAAs. An application for an export license or a TAA requires disclosure of the intended end user and the use of the technology. Pursuant to recent export control reform initiatives in the\nUnited States, a greater part of our U.S. subsidiaries and our U.S. suppliers' activities are becoming subject to control under the Export Administration Act \"dual use\" regulations. The U.S.\ngovernment may deny an export authorization if it determines that a transaction is counter to U.S. policy or national security.\nProprietary Rights\nAt the present time, TAT and its subsidiaries do not own any patents. TAT and its subsidiaries rely on laws protecting trade secrets, and consider such items proprietary; however,\nwe believe that our success depends less on the ownership of such proprietary rights than on our innovative skills, technical competences, marketing and engineering abilities. TAT and its\nsubsidiaries have no material registered trademarks.\nB. Government Regulations\nAerospace and Safety Regulations\nThe commercial aerospace industry is highly regulated by the FAA in the United States, EASA in Europe, and other governmental authorities elsewhere in the world, while the\nmilitary aerospace industry is governed by military quality specifications established by the U.S. Department of Defense for the manufacturing and repair industries and ISO-9000. TAT is\nrequired to be certified by one or more of these entities and, in some cases, by individual OEMs. TAT must also satisfy the requirements of its customers, including OEMs and airlines that\nare subject to FAA regulations and to evolving industry standards, and provide these customers with products that comply with the government regulations applicable to commercial flight\noperations. TAT believes it currently satisfies or exceeds these FAA maintenance standards in its repair and overhaul activities. Our active or operating repair stations in Israel and the United\nStates are approved by the FAA (while TAT-Engineering, our joint venture in Russia, is currently pursuing such certification or is currently in process of pursuing such certification). TAT\nalso believes it currently satisfies all industry standards in its facilities.\n33\nTATs operations are also subject to a variety of worker and community safety laws including the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970, known as OSHA, which mandates\ngeneral requirements for safe workplaces for all U.S. employees. In addition, OSHA provides special procedures and measures for the handling of certain hazardous and toxic substances.\nTAT believes that its operations are in compliance with OSHAs requirements.\nTAT believes that it is in material compliance with U.S., European and other governmental regulations affecting the aerospace and defense industries.\nIsraeli Regulations\nTATs operations in Israel are subject to supervision by the Israeli Ministry of Defense and Civil Aviation Administration of Israel. TAT Israel is certified by the IAF and the Israeli\nMinistry of Defense for both manufacturing and maintenance. TAT Israel is also licensed as a repair station for certain components by the Civil Aviation Administration of Israel. In\naddition, TAT Israel export of certain products and/or know-how is subject to approval by the Defense Export Controls Agency (DECA) of the Israeli Ministry of Defense. DECA permits\nare required prior to submitting sales proposals with regard to such exports, as well as for the actual export of such products.\nEnvironmental Matters\nTATs operations are subject to a number of stringent federal, state and local environmental laws in the United States and Israel, as well as to regulation set or promulgated by\ngovernment agencies, including the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. Among other matters, these regulatory authorities impose requirements that regulate the emission, discharge,\ngeneration, management, transportation and disposal of pollutants and hazardous substances. These authorities may require TAT to initiate actions to remediate the effects of hazardous\nsubstances which may be or have been released into the environment and require TAT to obtain and maintain permits in connection with TATs operations. This extensive regulatory\nframework imposes significant compliance burdens and risks. During the years 2020-2021, the Israeli Water Authority requested that TAT perform sampling of certain groundwater wells in\nTATs facility in Gedera. During March 2022 TAT has terminated its lease agreement in Gedera facility and has no further requests from the water authority.\nAlthough TAT seeks to maintain its operations and facilities in compliance with applicable environmental laws, there can be no assurance that TAT has no violations, or that change\nin such laws, regulations or interpretations of such laws, will not require TAT to make significant additional expenditures to ensure compliance in the future.\nC. Property, Plants and Equipment\nDuring 2022 TAT completed the strategic plan announced in March 2021, which includes transferring TATs activity from the leased facility in Gedera to a facility in Tulsa,\nOklahoma (see information regarding such facility below) and to a facility in Kiryat Gat, Israel which is leased by our wholly owned subsidiary Turbochrome. The facility in Kiryat Gat is\napproximately 138,000 square feet, and the land on which the facility is located is leased from the ILA. The leasehold rights are for a period ending in 2045 and are recorded in\nTurbochrome's name. Turbochrome paid the entire lease payments due until 2045 in a one-time payment (discounted to present value).\n34\nDuring 2023 TAT signed a lease agreement for an approximately 6,505 rentable square feet facility in Harris Corners Parkway , Charlotte, USA, which will expire in April, 2029.\nDue to the new agreement, the Company recognized an operating ROU assets and related operating lease liability of approximately $1 million. In 2023, the rental expense for this property\nwas $200 thousand.\nLimco owns and operates a 55,000 square feet manufacturing plant in Tulsa, Oklahoma which has historically supported all its business, including its aftermarket heat transfer\ncomponent repair station. This facility also has housed Limcos administration, engineering, quality control and support services.\nLimco also leases building #2, building #3, building #4, building #5, and building #6. Building #2 lease is effective from June 1, 2017 to November 30, 2026. The lessee or lessor\nmay terminate the lease by giving lessee or lessor six months advance written notice. The rent for building #2 is $4,000 per month plus the annual percentage increase in the CPI-W.\nBuilding #3 lease expired on January 31, 2014, however, the lease has renewed automatically from year to year since that date. Either party has the right to cancel the lease with 30 days\nadvance notice prior to the annual expiration of the term. The rent for building #3 is $1,505 per month plus the annual percentage increase in the CPI-W. Building #4 lease is effective from\nApril 1, 2017 to March 31, 2029. The lessee or lessor may terminate the lease by giving the lessee or lessor 6 months advance written notice. The rent for building #4 is $3,200 per month\nplus the annual percentage increase in the CPI-W. The lease on building #5 expires on March 31, 2025. The lessee or lessor may terminate the lease by giving the lessee or lessor 6 months\nadvance written notice. The rent for building #5 is $4,100 per month plus the annual percentage increase in the CPI-W. The lease on building #6 expires on March 31, 2032. The lessee or\nlessor may terminate the lease by giving the lessee or lessor 6 months advance written notice. The rent for building #6 is $9,364 per month plus the annual percentage increase in the CPI-W.\nIn 2023, 2022 and 2021, the rental expense for this property was $253 thousand, $271 thousand and $158 thousand, respectively.\nIn the second half of 2015, Piedmont leased approximately 82,000 square feet in Greensboro, North Carolina, for its new landing gear component and overhaul repair station as\nwell as the MPG operation. The lease expires on June 30, 2025. In 2023, 2022 and 2021 the rental expense was $357 thousand, respectively, for each one of these years. In addition,\nPiedmont leases approximately 56,000 square feet space for its facility in Kernersville, North Carolina to support its APU component and overhaul repair station. During 2018, Piedmont\nvacated the first floor of the facility while continuing to lease the second-floor space, approximately 28,000 square feet. In 2023, 2022 and 2021, the rental expense for this property was\n$48 thousand for each year respectively. The lease is in effect until May 2025.\nIn December 2023, Piedmont signed an additional lease agreement for a facility in Kernersville, North Carolina, USA, The term of this lease is 3 years and will expire on\nDecember 31, 2026. Piedmont has two options to extend the lease for the terms of 1 year each. The rentable facility is approximately 49,203 square feet and the rent expense will be $180\nthousand for each year..\n35\nItem 4A.Unresolved Staff Comments\nNot applicable.\nItem 5. Operating and Financial Review and Prospects Operating Results\nThe following discussion of our results of operations should be read together with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes, which appear elsewhere in this annual\nreport. The following discussion contains forward-looking statements that reflect our current plans, estimates and beliefs and involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results may differ\nmaterially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include those discussed below and elsewhere in this annual\nreport.\nOverview\nTAT is reliant on the robustness of the commercial and military aerospace and ground defense industries. Any downturn in these industries could weaken demand for its solutions\nand services and negatively impact its financial results. The commercial airline industry is cyclical and has historically been subject to fluctuations due to general economic and political\nconditions, such as fuel and labor costs, price competition, downturns in the global economy and national and international events.\nTATs cost of revenues for OEM operations and MRO services consists of component and material costs, direct labor costs, quality assurance costs, shipping expenses, royalties,\noverhead related to manufacturing and depreciation of manufacturing equipment. TATs gross margin is affected by the proportion of its revenues generated from each of its operational\nsegments.\nThe principal factors that affect the operating income of TATs four segments, in addition to their gross profit, is the expenditure on selling and marketing expenses and general and\nadministrative expenses. While TAT closely monitors its operating expenses to prevent unnecessary spending, we believe that these operating expenses may increase in the future in\naccordance with our plans to grow the business.\nTATs research and development expenses are related to new products and technologies or significant improvement of existing products and technologies.\nTATs selling and marketing expenses are related to commission payments, compensation and related expenses of TATs sales teams, participation in trade shows, travel expenses,\nadvertising expenses and related costs for facilities and equipment.\nTATs general and administrative expenses are related to compensation and related expenses for executive, finance and administrative personnel, professional fees such as legal,\naudit, SOX, internal audit, insurance premiums and general corporate expenses and related costs for facilities and equipment.\n36\nSources of Revenues\nTAT, directly and through its subsidiaries, provides a variety of solutions and services to the commercial and military aerospace and ground defense industries, including:\n(i) OEM of heat transfer solutions and aviation components, such as heat exchangers, pre-coolers and oil/fuel hydraulic coolers (through TAT Israel);\n(ii) MRO services for heat transfer components and OEM of heat transfer solutions (through our Limco subsidiary);\n(iii) MRO services for aviation components (through our Piedmont subsidiary); and\n(iv) Overhaul and coating of jet engine components (through our Turbochrome subsidiary).\nTATs revenues from its four operational segments for the three years ended December 31, 2023 were as follows:\nYear Ended December 31,\n2023 2022 2021\nRevenues % of Revenues % of Revenues % of\nin Total in Total in Total\nThousands Revenues Thousands Revenues Thousands Revenues\nRevenues\nOEM of heat transfer solutions and aviation\naccessories 27,555 24.2% 21,844 25.8% 25,997 33.3%\nMRO services for heat transfer components and\nOEM of heat transfer solutions 32,995 29% 24,796 29.3% 18,846 24.2%\nMRO services for aviation components 50,760 44.5% 35,879 42.4% 33,232 42.6%\nOverhaul and coating of jet engine components 6,854 6% 5,770 6.8% 3,834 4.9%\nEliminations (4,370) (3.7)% (3,733) (4.3)% (3,916) (5)%\nTotal Revenues $ 113,794 100% $ 84,556 100% $ 77,973 100%\n37\nThe following table reflects the geographic breakdown of TATs revenues for each of the three years ended December 31, 2023:\nYears Ended December 31,\n2023 2022 2021\nRevenues % of Revenues % of Revenues % of\nin Total in Total in Total\nThousands Revenues Thousands Revenues Thousands Revenues\nUnited States $ 7,698 7% $ 56,570 66.9% $ 47,947 61.5%\nIsrael 81,999 72% 7,162 8.5% 7,745 9.9%\nOther 24,097 21% 20,824 24.6% 22,281 28.6%\nTotal $ 113,794 100% $ 84,556 100.0% $ 77,973 100.0%\nCosts and Expenses\nCost of revenues. TATs cost of revenues for OEM operations and MRO services consists of component and material costs, direct labor costs, quality assurance costs, royalties,\nshipping expenses, overhead related to manufacturing and depreciation of manufacturing equipment.\nTATs gross margin was affected by the proportion of TATs revenues generated from OEM operations and MRO services in each of the reported years.\nResearch and development expenses, net. Research and development expenses, net are related to new products and technologies or to a significant improvement of products and\ntechnologies, net of grants and participations received.\nSelling and marketing expenses. Selling and marketing expenses consist primarily of commission payments, compensation and related expenses of TATs sales teams, participation\nin trade shows, travel expenses, advertising expenses and related costs for facilities and equipment.\nGeneral and administrative expenses. General and administrative expenses consist of compensation and related expenses for executive, finance and administrative personnel,\nprofessional fees such as legal, audit, SOX, internal audit, other general corporate expenses and related costs for facilities and equipment.\n38\nOther income (expense). Other income (expense) results from capital gain on sale of property and equipment and onetime expenses.\nFinancial income (expense), net. Financial income (expense), net consists of exchange rate and interest income or expense. Interest income or expense relates to the interest\nreceived from or paid to banks and changes in the rate of the NIS or other currencies against the U.S. dollar.\nTax expense (income). Tax expense consists of Israeli and U.S. federal and state taxes on the income of TATs business and changes in deferred tax assets or liabilities.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nTATs consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. These accounting principles require management to make certain estimates, judgments and\nassumptions based upon information available at the time that they are made, historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances.\nThese estimates, judgments and assumptions can affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements, as well as the reported amounts of revenues\nand expenses during the periods presented. While all the accounting policies impact the financial statements, certain policies may be viewed to be critical. These policies are those that are\nboth most important to the portrayal of TATs financial condition and results of operations and require managements most difficult, subjective and complex judgments and estimates. Actual\nresults could differ from those estimates.\nIn many cases, the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by U.S. GAAP and does not require managements judgment in its application. There are\nalso areas in which managements judgment in selecting among available alternatives would not produce a materially different result. Management has reviewed these critical accounting\npolicies and related disclosures with TATs audit committee.\nTATs management believes the significant accounting policies which affect managements more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of TATs consolidated\nfinancial statements and which are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating the reported financial results include the following:\n Inventory valuation\n Income taxes\n Allowance for current expected credit losses (CECL)\nInventory valuation\nInventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realizable value. Cost of raw material and parts is determined using the moving average basis. Cost of work in progress and\nfinished products is calculated based on actual costs and the capitalized production costs, mainly labor and overhead and is determined based on the average basis. TATs policy for valuation\nof inventory and commitments to purchase inventory, including the determination of obsolete or excess inventory, requires it to perform a detailed assessment of inventory at each balance\nsheet date which includes a review of, among other factors, an estimate of future demand for products within specific time frames, valuation of existing inventory, as well as product\nlifecycle and product development plans. The business environment in which TAT operates, the wide range of products that TAT offers and the relatively short sales cycles TAT experiences,\nall contribute to the exercise of judgment relating to maintaining and writing-off of inventory levels. The estimates of future demand that TAT uses in the valuation of inventory are the basis\nfor its revenue forecast, which is also consistent with its short-term manufacturing plan. Inventory reserves are also provided to cover risks arising from slow-moving items. Inventory\nmanagement remains an area of management focus as TAT balances the need to maintain strategic inventory levels to ensure competitive lead times against the risk of inventory\nobsolescence due to changing technology and customer requirements. TAT writes down obsolete or slow-moving inventory in an amount equal to the difference between the cost of\ninventory and the net realizable value based upon assumptions about future demand, market conditions and sale forecasts.\nIf actual market conditions are less favorable than TAT anticipates, additional inventory write-downs may be required.\n39\nIncome Taxes\nTAT operates within multiple tax jurisdictions and is subject to audits in these jurisdictions. These audits can involve complex issues, which may require an extended period of time\nto resolve. In managements opinion, adequate provisions for income taxes have been made for all years. Although management believes that its estimates are reasonable, no assurance can\nbe given that the final tax outcome of these issues will not be different than those reflected in its historical income tax provisions.\nTAT uses the liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on temporary differences between the\nfinancial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities and net operating loss and credit carry forwards using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to\nreverse. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. Valuation allowances are established\nwhen it is more likely than not that some portion of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. To the extent that TATs decisions and assumptions and historical reporting are determined\nnot to be compliant with applicable tax laws, TAT may be subject to adjustments in its reported income for tax purposes as well as interest and penalties.\nAccording to an acceptable interpretation that prescribes a minimum recognition threshold a tax position is required to meet before being recognized in the financial statements. The\ninterpretation also provides guidance on de-recognition of tax positions, classification on the balance sheet, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure and transition. In\naddition, the interpretation requires significant judgment with respect to determining what constitutes an individual tax position as well as assessing the outcome of each tax position.\nChanges in judgment as to recognition or measurement of tax positions can materially affect the estimate of the effective tax rate and consequently, affect our operating results.\nLosses generated prior to January 1, 2018 will still be subject to the 20-year carryforward limitation. Other potential impacts due to the Act include the repeal of the domestic\nmanufacturing deduction, modification of taxation of controlled foreign corporations, a base erosion anti-abuse tax, modification of interest expense limitation rules, modification of\nlimitation on deductibility of excessive executive compensation, and taxation of global intangible low-taxed income.\nAllowances for Current Expected Credit Losses\nTAT performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers financial condition and requires collateral as deemed necessary. Accounts receivable have been reduced by an allowance\nfor current expected losses. The Company maintains the allowance for estimated losses resulting from the inability of the Companys customers to make required payments. In judging the\nadequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts, TAT considers multiple factors including the aging of receivables, historical bad debt experience and the general economic environment.\nManagement applies considerable judgment in assessing the realization of receivables, including assessing the probability of collection and the current credit worthiness of each customer. If\nthe financial condition of TATs customers were to deteriorate, resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments, additional allowances may be required.\nKey Indicators\nTATs management evaluates its performance by focusing on key performance indicators, which are revenues, sources of revenues, gross profit and operating income. These key\nperformance indicators are primarily affected by the competitive landscape in which TAT operates and its ability to meet the challenges posed.\n40\nThe following table presents, for the periods indicated, information concerning TATs results of operations:\nYear Ended December 31\n2023 2022 2021\n(in thousands)\nRevenues\nOEM of heat transfer solutions and aviation accessories $ 27,555 $ 21,844 $ 25,977\nMRO services for heat transfer components and OEM of heat transfer solutions 32,995 24,796 18,846\nMRO services for aviation components 50,760 35,879 33,232\nOverhaul and coating of jet engine components 6,854 5,770 3,834\nEliminations (4,370) (3,733) (3,916)\nTotal revenues 113,794 84,556 77,973\nCost of revenues\nOEM of heat transfer solutions and aviation accessories 20,193 18,778 24,044\nMRO services for heat transfer components and OEM of heat transfer solutions 30,176 20,750 16,922\nMRO services for aviation components 41,788 28,890 26,444\nOverhaul and coating of jet engine components 4,110 3,495 2,978\nEliminations (4,941) (3,285) (3,685)\nTotal cost of revenues 91,326 68,628 66,703\nGross profit 22,468 15,928 11,270\nResearch and development costs, net 715 479 517\nSelling and marketing 5,523 5,629 5,147\nGeneral and administrative 10,558 9,970 8,354\nOther expenses (income) (433) (90) (468)\nRestructuring expenses, net - 1,715 1,755\nOperating income (loss) 6,075 (1,775) (4,035)\nFinancial income (expense), net (1,330) 127 (540)\nIncome (loss) before taxes on income (tax benefit) 4,745 (1,648) (4,575)\nTaxes on income (tax benefit) 576 98 (662)\nincome (loss) before equity investment 4,169 (1,746) (3,913)\nShare in results of affiliated company and impairment of share in affiliated companies 503 184 (76)\nNet income (loss) from continued operation $ 4,672 $ (1,562) $ (3,989)\nNet income (loss) from discontinued operation - - 427\nNet income (loss) $ 4,672 $ (1,562) $ (3,562)\n41\nThe following table presents, for the periods indicated, information concerning TATs results of operations as a percentage of revenues:\nYear Ended December 31,\n2023 2022 2021\nRevenues\nOEM of heat transfer solutions and aviation components 24.2% 25.8% 33.3%\nMRO services for heat transfer components and OEM of heat transfer solutions 29 29.3 24.2\nMRO services for aviation components 44.5 42.4 42.6\nOverhaul and coating of jet engine components 6 6.8 4.9\nEliminations (3.7) (4.4) (5)\nTotal revenues 100 100 100\nCost of revenues\nOEM of heat transfer solutions and aviation components 17.4 22.2 30.8\nMRO services for heat transfer components and OEM of heat transfer solutions 26.5 24.5 21.7\nMRO services for aviation components 36.7 34.2 33.9\nOverhaul and coating of jet engine components 3.6 4.1 3.8\nEliminations (4) (3.9) (4.7)\nCost of revenues 80.2 81.2 85.5\nGross profit 19.7 18.8 14.5\nResearch and development costs, net 0.6 0.6 0.7\nSelling and marketing 4.8 6.7 6.6\nGeneral and administrative 9.3 11.8 10.7\nOther expenses (income) (0.4) (0.1) (0.6)\nRestructuring expenses, net 0 2 2.2\n14.3 21 19.6\nOperating income (loss) 5.3 (2.1) (5.1)\nFinancial income (expense), net (1.2) 0.2 (0.7)\nIncome (loss) before taxes on income (tax benefit) 4.2 (1.9) (5.8)\nTaxes on income (tax benefit) 0.5 0.1 (0.8)\nincome (loss) before equity investment 3.7 (2.1) (5)\nShare in results of affiliated company and impairment of share in affiliated companies 0.4 0.2 (0.1)\nNet income (loss) from continued operation 4.1 (1.8) (5.1)\nNet income (loss) from discontinued operation - - 0.5\nNet income (loss) 4.1% (1.8)% (4.6)%\n________________________\n* Less than 0.1 percent\n42\nYear ended December 31, 2023 compared with Year ended December 31, 2022\nRevenues.

See\nRISK FACTORS for a description of governmental, economic, fiscal, monetary or political policies or factors (including the ongoing war and hostilities with Hamas and Hezbollah) that\nhave materially affected or could materially affect TATs operations.\n45\nTrade Relations\nIsrael is a member of the United Nations, the International Monetary Fund, the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development and the International Finance Corporation.\nIsrael is a member of the World Trade Organization and is a signatory to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. In addition, Israel has been granted preferences under the Generalized\nSystem of Preferences from the United States, Australia, Canada and Japan. These preferences allow Israel to export the products covered by such programs either duty-free or at reduced\ntariffs.\nIsrael and the European Union Community, known now as the European Union, concluded a Free Trade Agreement in July 1975 that confers some advantages with respect to\nIsraeli exports to most European countries and obligates Israel to lower its tariffs with respect to imports from these countries over a number of years. In 1985, Israel and the United States\nentered into an agreement to establish a Free Trade Area. The Free Trade Area has eliminated all tariff and some non-tariff barriers on most trade between the two countries. On January 1,\n1993, an agreement between Israel and the European Free Trade Association, known as the EFTA, established a free-trade zone between Israel and the EFTA nations. In November 1995,\nIsrael entered into a new agreement with the European Union, which includes a redefinition of rules of origin and other improvements, such as allowing Israel to become a member of the\nResearch and Technology programs of the European Union. In recent years, Israel has established commercial and trade relations with a number of other nations, including Russia, China,\nIndia, Turkey and other nations in Eastern Europe and the Asia-Pacific region.\nImpact of Currency Fluctuation and of Inflation\nTAT reports its financial results in dollars and receives payment primarily in dollars or dollar-linked NIS for all of its sales while it incurs a portion of its expenses, principally\nsalaries and related personnel expenses in Israel, in NIS. Additionally, certain assets, as well as a portion of its liabilities, are denominated in NIS. Therefore, the dollar cost of its operations\nis influenced by the extent to which any inflation in Israel is offset on a lagging basis or is not offset by the devaluation of the NIS in relation to the U.S. dollar. When the rate of inflation in\nIsrael exceeds the rate of devaluation of the NIS against the U.S. dollar, the dollar cost of operations in Israel increases. If the dollar cost of operations in Israel increases, its dollar-measured\nresults of operations will be adversely affected. It is uncertain whether TAT will be materially and adversely affected in the future if inflation in Israel exceeds the devaluation of the NIS\nagainst the dollar or if the timing of the devaluation lags behind inflation in Israel.\nBecause exchange rates between the NIS and the dollar fluctuate continuously, exchange rate fluctuations and especially larger periodic devaluations will have an impact on TATs\nprofitability and period-to-period comparisons of its results. The effects of foreign currency re-measurements are reported in TATs consolidated financial statements in current operations.\nAlthough TAT hedges a portion of its exchange rate risk through the use of forward contracts and other derivative instruments, there is no certainty that future results of operations may not\nbe materially adversely affected by currency fluctuations.\nCorporate Tax Rate\nIsraeli companies are generally subject to corporate tax on their taxable income (including capital gains). The regular corporate tax rate for Israel was 23% for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2021, December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2023.\nHowever, the rate is effectively reduced for income derived from Approved and Beneficiary Enterprises, as defined by the Law for the Encouragement of Capital Investments,\n1959, as amended.\nFor additional information, please see Item 10.E below Taxation - Israeli Tax Considerations - Tax Benefits under the Law for the Encouragement of Capital Investments, 1959.\nCertain investment income derived by TAT from investments may not be regarded by the Israeli tax authorities as income from TATs Preferred Enterprise and consequently may be\ntaxed at the regular statutory rate in Israel.\nCertain of TATs subsidiaries operate in and are subject to the tax laws of various other jurisdictions, primarily the United States. TATs U.S. subsidiaries are taxed based on federal\nand state tax laws. The U.S. federal statutory flat tax rate for tax years 2022 and 2023 is 21%.\n46\nRecently Issued Accounting Standards\nRecently adopted accounting pronouncements:\n1 In December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures. The amended guidance enhances income tax\ndisclosures primarily related to the effective tax rate reconciliation and income taxes paid information. This guidance requires disclosure of specific categories in the effective tax\nrate reconciliation and further information on reconciling items meeting a quantitative threshold. In addition, the amended guidance requires disaggregating income taxes paid (net\nof refunds received) by federal, state, and foreign taxes. It also requires disaggregating individual jurisdictions in which income taxes paid (net of refunds received) is equal to or\ngreater than 5 percent of total income taxes paid (net of refunds received). The amended guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024. The guidance can\nbe applied either prospectively or retrospectively. We are evaluating the impact this amended guidance may have on the footnotes to our consolidated financial statements.\n2. In November 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements\nto Reportable Segment Disclosures. The amended guidance requires incremental reportable segment disclosures, primarily about significant segment expenses. The amendments\nalso require entities with a single reportable segment to provide all disclosures required by these amendments, and all existing segment disclosures. The amendments will be applied\nretrospectively to all prior periods presented in the financial statements and is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, and interim periods in fiscal years\nbeginning after December 15, 2024, with early adoption permitted. We are evaluating the impact this amended guidance may have on the footnotes to our consolidated financial\nstatements.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOn December 21, 2023, TAT completed the issuance and sale of 1,158,600 Ordinary Shares of the Company in a private placement to Israeli institutional and accredited investors\n(as defined under Israels Securities Law, 5728-1968), for a purchase price of NIS 31.70 per share (which equaled $8.77 per share based on the exchange rate published by the Bank of Israel\nat such time), resulting in net proceeds to the Company, after deducting offering expenses, of approximately NIS 36.2 million (or approximately $10.0 million). The newly issued shares\nrepresent approximately 11.5% of the Companys issued and outstanding Ordinary Shares after the consummation of such sale.\nAs of December 31, 2023, TAT had cash and cash equivalents of $16.9 million compared to $ 8 million as of December 31, 2022, an increase of $8.9 million primarily due to the\nprivate placement.\nDuring 2023, TAT increased its loans and lines of credit from commercial banks by $1.7 million, and repaid loans in the amount of $1.7 million.\nDuring 2022, TAT received a loan from a commercial bank in the amount of $3.7 million. The loan bears annual interest rate of 6.65% (Prime Rate +0.9%) and is repaid in equal\nmonthly installment as of [April 2022] through March 2029. This new loan is in addition to four previous loans received during 2020 and 2021 in an aggregate amount of $6.3 million.\n47\nDuring 2022, TAT received loans from a commercial bank in the US in an aggregate amount of $7.9 million. These loans are secured with a first degree lien on TATs US\nsubsidiaries equipment. The loans bear annual interest of 3.75% and 4.2% and are repaid in equal monthly installments until 2029 and 2031. In addition, TAT received loans from Machinery\nFinance Resources in 2023 in the total amount of $0.7 million. The loans bear annual interest of 6.65% which are paid in equal monthly installments until 2028\nDuring 2022 TAT subsidiary received a credit line from a US commercial bank in the amount of $7 million with maturity date of February 2024 and carry an interest of\nWSJP+0.1% . During 2023, the Company utilized an additional $1 million from the credit line.\nDuring 2022 TAT received a long-term loan of $5 million from a commercial bank in the US, loan bears an annual fixed interest rate of 2.9% and maturity date of March 2024\nDuring 2023 the company secured another short term line of credit for the amount of $4.5 million from an Israeli bank. The companys building and land in Kiryat Gat serves as\ncollateral for this loan.\nFor more information about the company's loans please refer to Note 10 in the financial statements.\nCapital expenditures for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021 were approximately $2.9 million, $16.1 million and $15.6 million, respectively. TAT funded these\nexpenditures mainly from its own cash resources, cash flows from operations. TAT expects that its available cash and cash equivalents and cash flow generated from operations will be\nsufficient to fund its capital expenditures.\nManagement believes that anticipated cash flow from operations and its current cash balances will be sufficient to meet its cash requirements for at least 12 months from the\nfinancial statement issuance date. TATs future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including its rate of revenue growth, the expansion of its selling and marketing activities,\ncosts associated with expansion into new markets and the timing of the introduction of new products and services.\nCash Flows\nThe following table summarizes TATs cash flows for the periods presented:\nYear Ended December 31,\n(in thousands)\n2023 2022 2021\nNet cash provided by (used in) operating activities $ 2,255 $ (4,867) $ (2,269)\nNet cash used in investing activities (3,579) (16,120) (5,407)\nNet cash provided by financing activities 10,240 15,798 7,652\nNet cash provided by (used in) discontinued activities - - 153\nNet increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents 8,916 (5,189) 8,345\nCash and cash equivalents at beginning of the year 8,026 13,215 15,959\nCash and cash equivalents at end of the year $ 16,942 $ 8,026 $ 24,304\n48\nNet cash provided in operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2023, amounted to approximately $2.2 million, compared to net cash used in operating activities of ($4.9)\nmillion for the year ended December 31, 2022 and net cash used in by operating activities of ($2.3) million for the year ended December 31, 2021.\nNet cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2023 was impacted by the companys working capital needs.\nNet cash used in operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2023 was principally derived from the following adjustments of non-cash line items: an upward adjustment of\n$4.7 million for depreciation and amortization; an upward adjustment of $4.2 million for an increase in trade accrued expenses other; an offset adjustment of $5.4 million for inventory .; a\ndownward adjustment of $4.2 million for increase in trade accounts receivable.\nNet cash used in operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2022 was impacted by the company's restructuring plan costs with an amount of $1.7 million.\nNet cash used in operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2022 was principally derived from the following adjustments of non-cash line items: an upward adjustment of\n$3.7 million for depreciation and amortization; a upward adjustment of $1.1 million for an increase in trade accounts payable; an upward adjustment of $2.7 million for accrued expenses.\nThis was offset by a loss of $1.5 million; a downward adjustment of $5 million for increase in inventory; a downward adjustment of $2.6 million for increase in trade accounts receivable;\nand a downward adjustment of $1.8 million for increase in other current assets and prepaid expenses.\nNet cash used in operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2021 was impacted by the company's restructuring plan cost with a total amount of $0.58 million.\nNet cash used in operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2021 was principally derived from the following adjustments of non-cash line items: an upward adjustment of\n$4.8 million for depreciation and amortization; a upward adjustment of $2.6 million for increase in trade accounts payable; an upward adjustment of $1.8 million for impairment of fixed\nassets.

Research and Development, Patents and Licenses\nNot applicable.\nB. Trend Information\nIn recent years, the aerospace industry in which we operate has been impacted by the increase in number of commercial and defense aircraft, increase in commercial passenger\ntraffic and a corresponding increase in airlines revenue. The Covid-19 pandemic did, however, result in a slow-down in commercial aviation markets during the years 2019-2022.\nCommercial carriers remain committed to their efforts to reduce cost of MRO activities and increase efficiencies.\nC. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe are not a party to any material off-balance sheet arrangements.

Board Practices\nIntroduction\nAccording to the Israeli Companies Law and our articles of association, the management of our business is vested in our board of directors. The board of directors may exercise all\npowers and may take all actions that are not specifically granted to another organ in the Company (including our shareholders). Our executive officers are responsible for our day-to-day\nmanagement. Our executive officers have individual responsibilities established by our chief executive officer and board of directors.\nElection of Directors\nOur articles of association provide for a board of directors consisting of such number of directors as may be determined from time to time at a general meeting of shareholders,\nprovided that it shall be no less than two or more than eleven. Our board of directors is currently composed of five directors, including three independent directors, two of whom also qualify\nas external directors within the meaning of the Israeli Companies Law.\nPursuant to our articles of association and in accordance with the Israeli Companies Law, our directors (except for the external directors) are elected at our annual general meeting\nof shareholders by a vote of the holders of a majority of the voting power represented and voting at such meeting; in addition, directors (except for external directors) may be appointed by a\nvote of a majority of directors then in office. All our directors (except for external directors) hold office until the annual general meeting of shareholders succeeding their election (provided\nthat if no directors are elected at the annual general meeting, the directors in office at the time such meeting was convened shall continue to hold their office) or until their earlier death,\nresignation, removal or other circumstances as set forth in the Israeli law. All the members of our board of directors (except for external directors) may be re-elected upon completion of\ntheir term of office.\nThe Israeli Companies Law requires the board of directors of a public company to determine a minimum number of directors with accounting and financial expertise. Our board\nof directors determined, accordingly, that at least two directors must have accounting and financial expertise as such term is defined by regulations promulgated under the Israeli\nCompanies Law.\nWe are exempt from the requirements of the NASDAQ Marketplace Rules with regard to the nomination process of directors since we are a controlled company within the meaning\nof NASDAQ Marketplace Rule 5615(c)(2). See below in this Item 6. Directors, Senior Management and Employees - Board Practices - NASDAQ Exemptions for a Controlled Company.\nExternal and Independent Directors\nExternal Directors. Under the Israeli Companies Law, Israeli companies whose shares have been offered to the public or whose shares are listed in an authorized stock exchange\n(accordingly, such shares are considered as held by \"the public\") are required to appoint at least two external directors who meet the independence criteria set by the Israeli Companies Law.\n55\nA person is qualified to serve as an external director only if he or she has accounting and financial expertise or professional qualifications, as such terms are defined by the\nIsraeli Companies Regulations (Conditions and Criteria for a Director Who Possesses Accounting Expertise and a Director Who Possesses Professional Competence), 2005. At least one of\nthe external directors must have accounting and financial expertise. Each of our external directors has accounting and financial expertise.\nExternal directors are elected by a majority vote at a shareholders meeting. In addition to the majority vote, the shareholder approval of the election of an external director must\nsatisfy either of two additional tests:\n The majority includes at least a majority of the shares voted by shareholders other than controlling shareholders or shareholders who have a personal interest in the election of\nthe external directors (excluding a personal interest that is not related to a relationship with the controlling shareholders); or\n The total number of shares held by non-controlling shareholders and disinterested shareholders that voted against the election of the external director does not exceed 2% of the\naggregate voting rights of the company.\nIn general, external directors serve for a three-year term and may be re-elected to two additional three-year terms by one of the following mechanisms: (1) the board of directors\nproposes the re-election of the nominee and the re-election is approved by the majority required for appointment of external directors for their initial term; or (2) a shareholder holding 1% or\nmore of the company's voting rights proposes the re-election of the nominee, and the re-election is approved by a majority of the votes cast by the shareholders of the company, excluding\nthe votes of controlling shareholders or those who have a personal interest in the nomination, provided that the aggregate votes cast in favor of the re-election by shareholders who are not\ncontrolling shareholders and do not have a personal interest in the nomination constitute more than 2% of the company's voting rights. Israeli companies listed on certain stock exchanges\noutside Israel, including The NASDAQ Global Market, such as our company, may appoint an external director for additional terms of not more than three years subject to certain\nconditions. Such conditions include the determination by the audit committee and board of directors, that in view of the director's professional expertise and special contribution to the\ncompany's board of directors and its committees, the appointment of the external director for an additional term is in the best interest of the company.\nAn external director may be removed from office at the initiative of the board of directors at a special general meeting of shareholders, if the board resolves that the statutory\nrequirements for that persons appointment as external director no longer exist, or that the external director has violated his or her duty of loyalty to the company. The resolution of the\nspecial general meeting of shareholders regarding the termination of office of an external director requires the same majority that is required for the election of an external director. The court\nmay order the termination of the office of an external director on the same grounds, following a motion filed by a director or a shareholder. If an external directorship becomes vacant and as\na result there are fewer than two directors who serve as external directors in the company, the board of directors is required under the Israeli Companies law to convene a shareholder\nmeeting immediately to appoint a new external director.\nEach committee of the board of directors that is authorized to exercise powers vested in the board of directors must include at least one external director and the audit committee\nmust include all of the external directors. An external director is entitled to compensation as provided in regulations adopted under the Israeli Companies Law and is otherwise prohibited\nfrom receiving any other compensation, directly or indirectly, in connection with such service.\nUntil the lapse of two years from termination of office, we may not engage an external director or his spouse or child, to serve as an office holder and cannot employ or receive\nservices from these persons, either directly or indirectly, including through a corporation controlled by that person; and with regards to a related person (to a such external director) as\ndefined in the Israeli Companies law which is not a spouse or child  until the lapse of one year from termination of office.\nIndependent Directors. As a controlled company, within the meaning of NASDAQ Marketplace Rule 5615(c)(2), we are exempt from the NASDAQ Marketplace Rule which\nrequires that a majority of our board of directors qualify as independent directors, within the meaning of the NASDAQ Marketplace Rules. See Item 6. Directors, Senior Management and\nEmployees - Board Practices - NASDAQ Exemptions for a Controlled Company.\n56\nAudit Committee\nUnder the Israeli Companies Law, the board of directors of any public company must establish an audit committee. In general, the audit committee must consist of at least three\ndirectors and must include all of the external directors; furthermore, a majority of the audit committee members must comply with the director independence requirements prescribed by the\nIsraeli Companies Law. The audit committee may not include (i) the chairman of the board of directors, (ii) any director employed by the Company or by a controlling shareholder of the\ncompany (including a company which is controlled by the controlling shareholder), (iii) any director providing services to the company or to a controlling shareholder of the company\n(including to a company which is controlled by the controlling shareholder) on an ongoing basis, or (iv) a controlling shareholder or any of the controlling shareholders relatives.\nIn addition, the NASDAQ Marketplace Rules require us to establish an audit committee comprised of at least three members, all of whom must be independent directors, each of\nwhom is financially literate and satisfies the respective independence requirements of the SEC and NASDAQ and one of whom has accounting or related financial management expertise\nat senior levels within a company.\nOur audit committee acts also as a committee for the review and the approval of our financial statements, and as such, assists our board of directors in overseeing the accounting\nand financial reporting processes of our company and audits of our financial statements, including the integrity of our financial statements, compliance with legal and regulatory\nrequirements, our independent registered public accountants qualifications and independence, the performance of our internal audit function and independent registered public accountants,\nfinding any defects in the business management of our company and proposing to our board of directors ways to correct such defects, approving related-party (officers, directors, controlling\nshareholder, etc.) transactions with the company as required by Israeli law, examining the scope of work and the payment to our independent auditors and such other duties as may be\ndirected by our board of directors. The audit committee may consult from time to time with our independent auditors and internal auditor with respect to matters involving financial\nreporting and internal accounting controls.\nOur audit committee consists of three members of our board of directors (including two external directors and one independent director) who satisfy the respective independence\nrequirements of the SEC, NASDAQ and Israeli law for audit committee members. Our board of directors has determined that each member of our audit committee qualifies as an audit\ncommittee financial expert, as defined by rules of the SEC. The audit committee meets at least once each quarter.\nCompensation Committee\nUnder the Israeli Companies Law, the board of directors of any public company must establish a compensation committee. The compensation committee must consist of at least\nthree directors, include all of the external directors (including one external director serving as the chair of the compensation committee), and a majority of the committee members must\ncomply with the director independence requirements prescribed by the Israeli Companies Law. Similar to the rules that apply to the audit committee, the compensation committee may not\ninclude the chairman of the board, or any director employed by us, by a controlling shareholder or by any entity controlled by a controlling shareholder, or any director providing services to\nus, to a controlling shareholder or to any entity controlled by a controlling shareholder on a regular basis, or any director whose primary income is dependent on a controlling shareholder,\nand may not include a controlling shareholder or any of its relatives. Individuals who are not permitted to be compensation committee members may not participate in the committees\nmeetings other than to present a particular issue; provided, however, that an employee that is not a controlling shareholder or relative may participate in the committees discussions but not\nin any vote; other than the companys legal counsel and corporate secretary who may participate in the committees discussions and votes if requested by the committee.\nThe compensation committees duties include recommending to the board of directors a compensation policy for executives and monitor its implementation, approve compensation\nterms of executive officers, directors and employees affiliated with controlling shareholders, make recommendations to the board of directors regarding the issuance of equity incentive\nawards under our equity incentive plan and exempt certain compensation arrangements from the requirement to obtain shareholder approval under the Israeli Companies Law. The\ncompensation committee meets at least twice a year, with further meetings to occur, or actions to be taken by unanimous written consent, when deemed necessary or desirable by the\ncommittee or its chairperson.\nOur compensation committee consists of our two external directors and an independent director under the respective requirements of the SEC and NASDAQ and complies with the\nIsraeli Companies Law criteria for compensation committee members.\n57\nInternal Audit\nThe Israeli Companies Law requires the board of directors of a public company to appoint an internal auditor following a recommendation by the audit committee. The role of the\ninternal auditor is to examine, among other things, the companys compliance with applicable law and orderly business practice. The internal auditor must meet certain statutory\nrequirements of independence. Mr. Doron Cohen has served as our internal auditor since December 24, 2008.\nDirectors Service Contracts\nThere are no arrangements or understandings between us and any of our subsidiaries, on the one hand, and any of our directors, on the other hand, providing for benefits upon\ntermination of their employment or service as directors of our company or any of our subsidiaries.\nChairman of the Board\nUnder the Israeli Companies Law, the general manager of a company (or a relative of the general manager) may not serve as the chairman of the board of directors, and the\nchairman of the board of directors (or a relative of the chairman of the board of directors) may not serve as the general manager, unless approved by the shareholders by a special majority\nvote prescribed by the Israeli Companies Law. The shareholder vote cannot authorize the appointment for a period of longer than three years, which period may be extended from time to\ntime by the shareholders with a similar special majority vote. The chairman of the board of directors shall not hold any other position with the company (except as general manager if\napproved in accordance with the above procedure) or in any entity controlled by the company, other than as chairman of the board of directors of a controlled entity, and the company shall\nnot delegate to the chairman duties that, directly or indirectly, make him or her subordinate to the general manager.\nApproval of Related Party Transactions under Israeli Law\nFiduciary Duties of Office Holders\nThe Israeli Companies Law codifies the fiduciary duties that office holders, including directors and executive officers, owe to a company. An office holders fiduciary duties\nconsist of a duty of care and a duty of loyalty. The duty of care requires an office holder to act at a level of care that a reasonable office holder in the same position would employ under the\nsame circumstances. This includes the duty to utilize reasonable means to obtain (i) information regarding the business feasibility of a given action brought for his approval or performed by\nhim by virtue of his position and (ii) all other information of importance pertaining to the foregoing actions. The duty of loyalty requires that an office holder acts in good faith and for the\nbenefit of the company, including (i) avoiding any conflict of interest between the office holders position in the company and any other position he holds or his personal affairs, (ii) avoiding\nany competition with the companys business, (iii) avoiding exploiting any business opportunity of the company in order to receive personal gain for the office holder or others, and (iv)\ndisclosing to the company any information or documents relating to the companys affairs that the office holder has received by virtue of his position as an office holder.\n58\nDisclosure of Personal Interests of an Office Holder; Approval of Transactions with Office Holders\nThe Israeli Companies Law requires that an office holder promptly, and no later than the first board meeting at which such transaction is considered, disclose any personal interest\nthat he or she may have and all related material information known to him or her and any documents in their position, in connection with any existing or proposed transaction by us. An\noffice holder who did not disclose his or her personal interests will be deemed as breaching his or her fiduciary duties. In addition, if the transaction is an extraordinary transaction, that is, a\ntransaction other than in the ordinary course of business or other than in accordance with market terms, or likely to have a material impact on the companys profitability, assets or liabilities,\nthe office holder must also disclose any personal interest held by the office holders spouse, sibling, parent, grandparent, child as well as sibling or parent of such person's spouse or the\nspouse of any of the above, or by any corporation in which the office holder or his relative (as defined in the Israeli Companies Law) is a 5% or greater shareholder, director or general\nmanager or in which he or she has the right to appoint at least one director or the general manager.\nUnder the Israeli Companies Law, in general, all arrangements as to compensation of office holders who are not directors (other than the Chief Executive Officer) require the\napproval of the compensation committee and the board of directors, including exculpation, insurance and indemnification of, or an undertaking to, indemnify an office holder who is not a\ndirector. The compensation of office holders who are directors and compensation of the Chief Executive Officer must be approved by the compensation committee, board of directors and\nthe general meeting of shareholders.\nSome transactions, actions and arrangements involving an office holder (or a third party in which an office holder has an interest) must be approved by the board of directors or as\notherwise provided for in a companys articles of association. If the transaction is an extraordinary transaction (which is defined as a transaction not in the ordinary course of business and\nfor a material value) such a transaction must be approved by the audit committee and by the board of directors itself, and under certain circumstances shareholder approval may be required.\nA director who has a personal interest in a transaction that is considered at a meeting of the board of directors or the audit committee may not be present during the board of directors or\naudit committee discussions and may not vote on the transaction, unless the transaction is not an extraordinary transaction or the majority of the members of the board or the audit committee\nhave a personal interest, as the case may be. In the event the majority of the members of the board of directors or the audit committee have a personal interest, then the approval of the\ngeneral meeting of shareholders is also required.\nDisclosure of Personal Interests of a Controlling Shareholder; Approval of Transactions with Controlling Shareholders\nThe disclosure requirements that apply to an office holder also apply to a transaction in which a controlling shareholder of the company has a personal interest. The Israeli\nCompanies Law provides that an extraordinary transaction with a controlling shareholder or an extraordinary transaction with another person in whom the controlling shareholder has a\npersonal interest or a transaction with a controlling shareholder or his relative regarding terms of service and employment, must be approved by the audit committee (or the compensation\ncommittee, as the case may be), the board of directors and the shareholders by a special majority, as follows. The shareholders approval must include the majority of shares voted at the\nmeeting. In addition to the majority vote, the shareholder approval must satisfy either of two additional tests:\n The majority includes at least a majority of the shares voted by shareholders who have no personal interest in the transaction; or\n The total number of shares held by disinterested shareholders that voted against the approval of the transaction does not exceed 2% of the aggregate voting rights of our\ncompany.\n59\nAccording to regulations promulgated under the Israeli Companies Law, certain extraordinary transactions between a public company and its controlling shareholder(s) do not\nrequire shareholder approval. In addition, under such regulations, directors compensation and employment arrangements in a public company do not require the approval of the\nshareholders if both the audit committee and the board of directors agree that such arrangements are solely for the benefit of the company or if the directors compensation does not exceed\nthe maximum amount of compensation for external directors determined by applicable regulations. Also, employment and compensation arrangements for an office holder that is a\ncontrolling shareholder of a public company do not require shareholder approval if certain criteria are met. The foregoing exemptions from shareholder approval will not apply if one or\nmore shareholders holding at least 1% of the issued and outstanding share capital of the company or of the companys voting rights, objects to the use of these exemptions provided that such\nobjection is submitted to the company in writing not later than fourteen days from the date of the filing of a report regarding the adoption of such resolution by the company. If such\nobjection is duly and timely submitted, then the transaction or compensation arrangement of the directors will require shareholders approval as detailed above.\nIn addition, a private placement of securities that will (i) cause a person to become a controlling shareholder or (ii) increase the relative holdings of a shareholder that holds 5% or\nmore of the companys outstanding share capital, or (iii) will cause any person to become, as a result of the issuance, a holder of more than 5% of the companys outstanding share capital in\na private placement in which 20% or more of the companys outstanding share capital prior to the placement are offered, the payment for which (in whole or in part) is not in cash or not\nunder market terms, requires approval by the board of directors and the shareholders of the company.\nCompensation of Executive Officers and Directors\nIn accordance with the Israeli Companies Law, we have adopted a compensation policy for our executive officers and directors. The purpose of the policy is to describe our overall\ncompensation strategy for our executive officers and directors and to provide guidelines for setting their compensation, as prescribed by the Israeli Companies Law. In accordance with the\nIsraeli Companies Law, the policy must be reviewed and readopted at least once every three years.\nApproval of the compensation committee, the board of directors and our shareholders, in that order, is required for the adoption of the compensation policy. The shareholders\napproval must include the majority of shares voted at the meeting. In addition to the majority vote, the shareholder approval must satisfy either of two additional tests:\n The majority includes at least a majority of the shares voted by shareholders other than our controlling shareholders or shareholders who have a personal interest in the adoption\nof the compensation policies; or\n The total number of shares held by non-controlling shareholders and disinterested shareholders that voted against the adoption of the compensation policies does not exceed 2%\nof the aggregate voting rights of our company.\nUnder the Israeli Companies Law, the compensation arrangements for officers (other than the Chief Executive Officer) who are not directors require the approval of the\ncompensation committee and the board of directors; provided, however, that if the compensation arrangement is not in compliance with our executive compensation policy, the arrangement\nmay only be approved by the compensation committee and the board of directors for special reasons to be noted, and the compensation arrangement shall also require a special shareholder\napproval. If the compensation arrangement is an immaterial amendment to an existing compensation arrangement of an officer who is not a director and is in compliance with our executive\ncompensation policy, the approval of the compensation committee is sufficient.\nArrangements regarding the compensation of the Chief Executive Officer and directors require the approval of the compensation committee, the board of directors and our\nshareholders, in that order. In certain limited cases, the compensation of a new Chief Executive Officer who is not a director may be the approved without approval of the shareholders.\n60\nVariable Cash Incentive\nThe compensation committee and board of directors may adopt, from time to time, a cash incentive plan, which will set forth for each executive certain targets which form such\nexecutives on target cash payment (the On Target Cash Plan) and the rules or formula for calculation of the On Target Cash Plan payment once actual achievements are known.\nThe compensation committee and board of directors may include in the On Target Cash Plan predetermined thresholds and caps to correlate an executives On Target Cash Plan\npayments with actual achievements.\nThe actual payment of the annual On Target Cash Plan for the active chairman of the board of directors (the Active Chairman), the CEO and other executives in a given year shall\nbe capped as determined by our board of directors, but in no event shall exceed the ratio set forth in the table below.\nThe On Target Cash Plans may be composed based on a mix of (i) the company target; (ii) personal targets (KPIs); and (iii) personal evaluation. The weight to be assigned to each\nof the components per each of the executives shall be as set forth in the table below.\nActive Chairman CEO Other Executives\nCompany Target 100% 75% - 100% 50%-100%\nPersonal KPIs NONE NONE 0%-30%\nPersonal Evaluation NONE 0%-25% 0%-30%\nThe company target shall be determined in accordance with all or part of pre-determined targets of the sales budget, gross profit, o perating profit, EBITDA, net income and net\ncash from operating activities, all in accordance with TATs annual budget. If a company target shall apply to a Chief Executive Officer or a President of a subsidiary, such target may be\napplied up to 100% with respect to the financial results of the relevant subsidiary, and the remaining cash incentive with respect to the financial results of TAT and its subsidiaries on a\nconsolidated basis.\nThe board of directors may determine to exclude certain profits or loss items from the company target including, but not limited to, certain expenses related to acquisition of a new\ncompany, certain expenses related to distribution of dividend, certain items of revenue or any other items per the board of directors sole discretion.\nWith regard to each one of the measurable targets, reference points shall be determined in terms of numerical values, so that compliance with the precise numerical target as\ndetermined in the On Target Cash Plan shall constitute compliance with 100% of the target, and also, numerical values shall be determined which will constitute the lower threshold for\ncompliance with the target. The actual rate of compliance with the targets shall be calculated in accordance with the said reference points. Failure to comply with the minimum threshold of\nat least 75% of a specific target shall not entitle the executive to an On Target Cash Plan payment in respect of the said target. In the event of compliance at a rate of 75% or more with a\nspecific target, the annual On Target Cash Plan shall be calculated in accordance with a key (i.e. linear, steps, etc.) which shall determine  in relation to the point of compliance with the\ntarget  the amount of the payment in terms of a percentage of the executive annual base salary, all as shall be set forth in the On Target Cash Plan. In this respect, the compensation\ncommittee and the board of directors shall have the right to determine a higher (but not lower) entitlement threshold.\n61\nIndemnification and Insurance of Directors and Officers\nInsurance of Office Holders\nThe Israeli Companies Law provides that a company may, if permitted by its articles of association, enter into a contract to insure an office holder for acts or omissions performed\nby the office holder in such capacity for:\n Breach of his or her duty of care to the company or to another person;\n Breach of his or her duty of loyalty to the company, provided that the office holder acted in good faith and had reasonable cause to assume that his act would not prejudice the\ncompanys interests;\n Monetary liability imposed upon the office holder in favor of another person;\n A monetary obligation imposed on the office holder in favor of another person who was injured by a violation, as this term is defined in section 52(54)(a)(1)(a) of the Israeli\nSecurities Law, 1968 (Israeli Securities Law); and\n Expenses expended by the office holder, including reasonable litigation expenses, and including attorney's fees, in respect of any proceeding under chapters 8-C, 8-D or 9-A of\nthe Israeli Securities Law or in respect to any monetary sanction.\nIndemnification of Office Holders\nThe Israeli Companies Law provides that a company may, if permitted by its articles of association, indemnify an office holder for acts or omissions performed by the office holder\nin such capacity for:\n Monetary liability imposed on the office holder in favor of another person by any judgment, including a settlement or an arbitrators award approved by a court;\n Reasonable litigation expenses, including attorneys fees, actually incurred by the office holder as a result of an investigation or proceeding instituted against him or her by a\ncompetent authority, provided that such investigation or proceeding concluded without the filing of an indictment against the office holder or the imposition of any monetary\nliability in lieu of criminal proceedings, or concluded without the filing of an indictment against the office holder and a monetary liability was imposed on the officer holder in\nlieu of criminal proceedings with respect to a criminal offense that does not require proof of criminal intent;\n A monetary obligation imposed on the office holder in favor of another person who was injured by a violation, as this term is defined in section 52(54)(a)(1)(a) of the Israeli\nSecurities Law;\n Expenses expended by the office holder, including reasonable litigation expenses, and including attorney's fees, in respect of any proceeding under chapters 8-C, 8-D or 9-A of\nthe Israeli Securities Law or in respect to any monetary sanction;\n Reasonable litigation expenses, including attorneys fees, incurred by such office holder or which were imposed on him by a court, in proceedings the company instituted\nagainst the office holder or that were instituted on the companys behalf or by another person, or in a criminal charge from which the office holder was acquitted, or in a\ncriminal proceeding in which the office holder was convicted of a crime which does not require proof of criminal intent; or\n Any other liability, payment or expense which the company may indemnify its office holders under the Israeli Company Law, the Israeli Securities Law or other Israeli law.\n62\nIn accordance with the Israeli Companies Law, a companys articles of association may permit the company to:\n Undertake in advance to indemnify an office holder, except that with respect to a financial liability imposed on the office holder by any judgment, settlement or court-approved\narbitration award, the undertaking must be limited to types of occurrences, which, in the opinion of the companys board of directors, are, at the time of the undertaking,\nforeseeable due to the companys activities and to an amount or standard that the board of directors has determined is reasonable under the circumstances; and\n Undertake in advance to indemnify an office holder for reasonable litigation expenses, including attorneys fees, actually incurred by the office holder as a result of an\ninvestigation or proceeding instituted against him or her by a competent authority, provided that such investigation or proceeding concluded without the filing of an indictment\nagainst the office holder or the imposition of any monetary liability in lieu of criminal proceedings, or concluded without the filing of an indictment against the office holder\nand a monetary liability was imposed on the officer holder in lieu of criminal proceedings with respect to a criminal offense that does not require proof of criminal intent.\n Undertake in advance to indemnify an office holder for reasonable litigation expenses, including attorneys fees, incurred by such office holder or which were imposed on him\nby a court, in proceedings the company instituted against the office holder or that were instituted on the companys behalf or by another person, or in a criminal charge from\nwhich the office holder was acquitted, or in a criminal proceeding in which the office holder was convicted of a crime which does not require proof of criminal intent.\n Retroactively indemnify an office holder of the company.\nLimitations on Exculpation, Insurance and Indemnification\nThe Israeli Companies Law provides that neither a provision of the articles of association permitting the company to enter into a contract to insure the liability of an office holder,\nnor a provision in the articles of association or a resolution of the board of directors permitting the indemnification of an office holder, nor a provision in the articles of association\nexempting an office holder from duty to the company shall be valid, where such insurance, indemnification or exemption relates to any of the following:\n Breach by the office holder of his duty of loyalty, except with respect to insurance coverage or indemnification if the office holder acted in good faith and had reasonable\ngrounds to assume that the act would not prejudice the company;\n Breach by the office holder of his duty of care if such breach was committed intentionally or recklessly, unless the breach was committed only negligently;\n Any act or omission committed with intent to derive an unlawful personal gain; and\n Any fine or forfeiture imposed on the office holder.\n63\nPursuant to our articles of association, the total amount of indemnification that we will pay (in addition to amounts received from an insurance company, if any) to all officers of the\ncompany, in aggregate, shall not exceed, in all circumstances, more than 25% of the company's shareholders equity as set forth in the company's recent consolidated financial statements\nprior to the date that the indemnity is paid. Our articles of association include provisions which allow us to insure, indemnify and exempt our office holders, subject to the provisions of the\nIsraeli Companies Law.\nWe maintain a directors and officers liability insurance policy with a per claim and aggregate coverage limit of $10 million, including legal costs incurred in Israel. In addition,\nour audit committee, board of directors and shareholders resolved to indemnify our office holders, pursuant to a standard indemnification agreement that provides for indemnification of an\noffice holder in an aggregate amount not to exceed 25% of our equity capital (net worth). To date, we have provided letters of indemnification to all of our officers and directors.\nIn 2023, we adopted a Clawback Policy in compliance with the SEC rules and Nasdaq listing standards to recover any excess incentive-based compensation from current and\nformer executive officers after an accounting restatement. A copy of the policy is filed as an exhibit to this Annual Report.\nNASDAQ Exemptions for a Controlled Company\nWe are a controlled company within the meaning of NASDAQ Marketplace Rule 5615(c)(2), or Rule 5615(c)(2), because the FIMI Opportunity V, L.P. and FIMI Israel Opportunity\nFIVE, Limited Partnership (the FIMI Funds) beneficially own more than 50% of our voting shares.\nUnder Rule 5615(c)(2), a controlled company is exempt from the following requirements of NASDAQ Marketplace Rules 5605(b)(1), 5605(d) and 5605(e) that would otherwise\nrequire that:\n The majority of the companys board of directors qualifies as independent directors, as defined under NASDAQ Marketplace Rules.\n The compensation of the chief financial officer and all other executive officers be determined, or recommended to the board of directors for determination, either by (i) a\nmajority of the independent directors or (ii) a compensation committee comprised solely of independent directors.\n Director nominees must be selected or recommended for the board of directors, either by (a) a majority of independent directors or (b) a nominations committee comprised\nsolely of independent directors.\nWe intend to continue to rely on these exemptions provided under Rule 5615(c)(2).\nD. Employees\nAs of December 31, 2023, TAT and its subsidiaries employed 540 employees, of whom 449 were employed in manufacturing and quality control, 24 were employed in engineering\nand research and development and 67 were employed in general & administration, sales and marketing. Of such employees, 168 were located in Israel and 372 were employed by Limco and\nPiedmont located in the United States.\n64\nEmployees in Israel are employed under collective or individual employment agreements. Senior employees in special positions and members of management are employed under\nindividual agreements. Collective bargaining agreements are signed for specified terms and are renewed from time to time. During 2022, TAT's management and the union of TAT Israel\nagreed to enter into a new collective bargaining agreement with respect to employees of TAT Israel. The new agreement was signed on September 7, 2022 and will be in effect until April\n30, 2025.\nIn Turbochrom, a new collective bargaining agreement was signed with Turbochromes union on September 18, 2022, and will be in effect until April 30, 2025.\nCertain provisions of the collective bargaining agreements between the Histadrut (General Federation of Labor in Israel) and the Coordinating Bureau of Economic Organizations\n(including the Manufacturers Association of Israel) are applicable to our Israeli employees by order of the Israeli Ministry of Economy and Industry. These provisions concern mainly the\nlength of the workday, minimum daily wages for professional workers, pension contributions, insurance for work-related accidents, procedures for terminating employees, determination of\nseverance pay and other employment terms. We generally provide our employees with benefits and working conditions exceeding the required minimums. Furthermore, under the collective\nbargaining agreements, the wages of most of our employees are linked to the CPI in Israel, although the extent of the linkage is limited.\nIn addition, Israeli law generally requires severance pay upon the retirement or death of an employee or termination of employment without due cause. Furthermore, Israeli\nemployees and employers are required to pay predetermined sums to the National Insurance Institute which is similar to the United States Social Security Administration. These payments\namount to approximately 12% of wages, with the employee contributing approximately 43% and the employer approximately 56%.\nWe currently also generally grant senior employees based in Israel participation in a particular insurance product called management insurance. Management insurance provides a\ncombination of savings plan, insurance and severance pay benefits to the employee, giving the employee a lump sum payment upon retirement (rather than receiving annuity payments) and\nsecuring his or her right to receive severance pay, if legally entitled, upon termination of employment. In general, the employee contributes an amount equal to approximately 5% to 6% of\nhis or her wage and the employer contributes an additional amount of approximately 13-1/3% to 16% of such wage. Management insurance is not a legally mandated by Israeli law.\nLimco-Piedmont sponsors a 401(K) QACA safe harbor profit sharing plan covering substantially all of its employees in the United States. The plan requires the employer to\ncontribute a match which is currently done on a payroll period basis, matching 100% of the first 2% and 50% of the next 3%. In addition, the plan allows for a discretionary qualified non-\nelective contribution for the plan year.\nE. Share Ownership\nBeneficial Ownership of Executive Officers and Directors\nExcept as set forth under Stock Option Plans and in Item 7A below, none of our directors and executive officers beneficially owns more than 1% of our outstanding shares.\n65\nStock Option Plans\nIn November 2011, our audit committee and board of directors approved a stock option plan (the 2012 Plan), which was subsequently approved by TATs shareholders, on June\n28, 2012. According to the 2012 Plan an aggregate of 980,000 options exercisable into up to 980,000 ordinary shares, 0.9 NIS par value, of TAT may be granted to certain members of our\nboard of directors and certain senior executives at an exercise price not less than the fair market value of the shares covered by the option on the date of grant.\nOn August 30, 2018 the Company's compensation committee, followed by the Board of Directors, approved the amended and restated company's 2012 Plan. On October 4, 2018\nthe company's amended and restated 2012 Plan was approved at the annual general meeting of shareholders. As part of the company's 2012 Plans amendments it was determined that if the\nCompany declares a cash dividend to its shareholders, and the distribution date of such dividend will precede the exercise date of an Option, including for the avoidance of doubt, Options\nthat have yet to become vested and Options which have been granted prior to the adoption of such amendment to the Plan, the exercise price of the option shall be reduced in the amount\nequal to the cash dividend per share distributed by the Company.\nFollowing the approval of TAT's audit committee and board of directors, on November 8, 2022 the Companys shareholders approved the 2022 stock option plan (the 2022 Plan,\nand together with the 2012 Plan, the Plans). According to the 2022 Plan an aggregate of 550,000 options exercisable into up to 550,000 ordinary shares, 0.9 NIS par value, of TAT may be\ngranted to certain members of our board of directors and certain senior executives at an exercise price not less than the fair market value of the shares covered by the option on the date of\ngrant\nTotal aggregate option pool under the Plans is 1,530,000 ordinary share of the company.\nIn general, the options under the Plans vest over a period of 4 years as follows: 25% of the options vest upon the lapse of 12 months following the date of grant and the remaining\n75% vest on a quarterly basis over the remaining 3-year period. Pursuant to the Plans, any options that are cancelled or not exercised within the option period determined in the relevant\noption agreement will become available for future grants.\nThe grant of options to Israeli employees under the Plans is subject to the terms stipulated by Sections 102 and 102A of the Israeli Income Tax Ordinance. Each option grant is\nsubject to the track chosen by the Company, either Section 102 or Section 102A of the Israeli Income Tax Ordinance, and pursuant to the terms thereof, the Company is not allowed to claim\nas an expense for tax purposes the amounts credited to employees as benefits, including amounts recorded as salary benefits in the Companys accounts, in respect of options granted to\nemployees under the Plans, with the exception of the work income benefit component, if any, determined on grant date. For nonemployees and for non-Israeli employees, the share option\nplan is subject to Section 3(i) of the Israeli Income Tax Ordinance.\nAs of December 31, 2023, options to purchase 625,000 ordinary shares were outstanding under the Plan, exercisable at an average exercise price of $7.31 per share.\nF.

The newly\nissued shares represented approximately 11.5% of the Companys issued and outstanding Ordinary Shares after the consummation of such sale.\nMajor Shareholders Voting Rights\nOur major shareholders do not have different voting rights.\nRecord Holders\nBased on a review of the information provided to us by our transfer agent, as of December 31, 2023, there were 32 holders of record of our ordinary shares, of which 29 record\nholders holding less than 1.0% of our ordinary shares had registered addresses in the United States. These numbers are not representative of the number of beneficial holders of our shares\nnor is it representative of where such beneficial holders reside since many of these ordinary shares were held by brokers or other nominees including CEDE & Co., the nominee for the\nDepositary Trust Company (the central depositary for the U.S. brokerage community), which held approximately 69% of our outstanding ordinary shares as of such date.\nB.

For a discussion of these matters, see Note 15 to our consolidated financial\nstatements included elsewhere in this annual report.\nDividend Distribution Policy\nWe may declare a dividend to be paid to the holders of our ordinary shares in proportion to their respective shareholdings. Under the Israeli Companies Law, dividend distributions\nare determined by the board of directors and do not require the approval of the shareholders of a company unless the companys articles of association provide otherwise. Our Articles do not\nrequire shareholder approval of a dividend distribution and provide that dividend distributions may be determined by our board of directors.\nPursuant to the Israeli Companies Law, the distribution amount is limited to the greater of retained earnings or earnings generated over the previous two years, according to our then\nlast reviewed or audited financial statements (less the amount of previously distributed dividends, if not reduced from the earnings), provided that the end of the period to which the financial\nstatements relate is not more than six months prior to the date of the distribution. If we do not meet such criteria, then we may distribute dividends only with court approval. In each case, we\nare only permitted to distribute a dividend if our board of directors and, if applicable, the court determines that there is no reasonable concern that payment of the dividend will prevent us\nfrom satisfying our existing and foreseeable obligations as they become due. In the event of our liquidation, after satisfaction of liabilities to creditors, our assets will be distributed to the\nholders of our ordinary shares in proportion to their shareholdings.\nB.

This\ndescription is only a summary and does not purport to be complete and is qualified by reference to the full text of the memorandum of association and articles of association, which are\nincorporated by reference as exhibits to this annual report, and to Israeli law.\n70\nPurposes and Objects of the Company\nWe are a public company registered with the Israeli Companies Registry and have been assigned company number 52-0035791. Section 2 of our memorandum of association\nprovides that we were established for the purpose of engaging in the business of providing services of planning, development, consultation and instruction in the electronics field. In\naddition, the purpose of our company is to perform various corporate activities permissible under Israeli law.\nPowers of the Directors\nUnder the provisions of the Israeli Companies Law which prevails over our articles of association in certain issues, a director cannot participate in a meeting nor vote on a proposal,\narrangement or contract in which he or she is materially interested except in cases where a majority of the directors are materially interested in the same transaction. In addition, our directors\ncannot vote on compensation to themselves without the approval of our compensation committee and our shareholders at a general meeting, except for certain cases in which there is no\nneed for the approval of the general meeting in accordance with the regulations promulgated under the Israeli Companies Law. See Item 6. Directors, Senior Management and Employees \nBoard Practices  Approval of Related Party Transactions Under Israeli Law.\nThe authority of our directors to enter into borrowing arrangements on our behalf is not limited, except in the same manner as any other transaction by us.\nOur articles of association do not impose any mandatory retirement or age-limit requirements on our directors and our directors are not required to own shares in our company in\norder to qualify to serve as directors.\nRights Attached to Shares\nOur authorized share capital consists of 13,000,000 ordinary shares of a nominal value of NIS 0.90 each. All outstanding ordinary shares are validly issued, fully paid and non-\nassessable.\nPlease refer to Exhibit 2.1 for Items 10.B.3, B.4, B.5, B.6, B.7, B.8, B.9 and B.10.\nC.

Exchange Controls\nIsraeli law and regulations do not impose any material foreign exchange restrictions on non-Israeli holders of our ordinary shares. In May 1998, a new general permit was issued\nunder the Israeli Currency Control Law, 1978, which removed most of the restrictions that previously existed under such law, and enabled Israeli citizens to freely invest outside of Israel\nand freely convert Israeli currency into non-Israeli currencies.\nNon-residents of Israel who purchase our ordinary shares will be able to convert dividends, if any, thereon, and any amounts payable upon our dissolution, liquidation or winding\nup, as well as the proceeds of any sale in Israel of our ordinary shares to an Israeli resident, into freely-repatriable dollars, at the exchange rate prevailing at the time of conversion, provided\nthat the Israeli income tax has been withheld (or paid) with respect to such amounts or an exemption has been obtained.\nE. Taxation\nThe following is a discussion of Israeli and United States tax consequences material to our shareholders. To the extent that the discussion is based on new tax legislation which has\nnot been subject to judicial or administrative interpretation, the views expressed in the discussion might not be accepted by the tax authorities in question. The discussion is not intended, and\nshould not be construed, as legal or professional tax advice and does not exhaust all possible tax considerations.\nYou are urged to consult your own tax advisor as to the Israeli, United States and other tax consequences of the purchase, ownership and disposition of our ordinary shares,\nincluding, in particular, the effect of any non-Israeli, state or local taxes.\nIsraeli Tax Considerations\nThe following is a summary of the principal Israeli tax laws applicable to us, of the Israeli Government programs from which we benefit and of the Income Tax Law (Inflationary\nAdjustments), 1985. This section also contains a discussion of material Israeli tax consequences to our shareholders who are not residents or citizens of Israel. This summary does not\ndiscuss all aspects of Israeli tax law that may be relevant to a particular investor in light of his or her personal investment circumstances, or to some types of investors subject to special\ntreatment under Israeli law. Examples of investors subject to special treatment under Israeli law include residents of Israel, traders in securities, or persons who own, directly or indirectly,\n10% or more of our outstanding voting capital, all of whom are subject to special tax regimes not covered in this discussion. Some parts of this discussion are based on new tax legislation\nthat has not been subject to judicial or administrative interpretation. The discussion should not be construed as legal or professional tax advice and does not cover all possible tax\nconsequences.\nGeneral Corporate Tax Structure\nIsraeli companies are generally subject to corporate tax on their taxable income at the rate of 23% in 2018 and thereafter. However, the effective tax rate payable by a company that\nderives income from an Approved Enterprise, a Benefited Enterprise, a Preferred Enterprise or a Technology Enterprise may be considerably less. Capital Gain derived by an Israeli resident\ncompany and / or royalties for which no tax clearance has been obtained from the ITA are subject to tax at the regular corporate tax rate (23% in 2019 and thereafter).\nTax Benefits under the Law for the Encouragement of Capital Investments, 1959\nWe have one capital investment program that has been granted Approved Enterprise status under the Investment Law, and one program that qualify as a Benefited Enterprise\npursuant to an amendment to the Investment Law that came into effect on April 1, 2005 (the April 2005 amendment). These programs were waived as part of the \"Preferred Enterprise\"\nwhich is part of the \"2011 Amendment\".\n72\nPrior to the April 2005 amendment, the Investment Law provided that capital investments in a production facility (or other eligible assets), may be designated as an Approved\nEnterprise upon prior approval from the Investment Center of the Israel Ministry of Industry, Trade and Labor (the Investment Center).\nThe April 2005 amendment revised the criteria for investments qualified to receive tax benefits. An eligible investment program under that amendment provided for benefits as a\nBenefited Enterprise (rather than the previous terminology of Approved Enterprise). Among other things, the April 2005 amendment provided tax benefits to both local and foreign\ninvestors. Companies that meet the specified criteria received the tax benefits without need for prior approval and instead, a company was to claim the tax benefits offered by the Investment\nLaw directly in its tax returns.\nThe period of tax benefits for the then new beneficiary enterprise commences in the year that is the later of: (i) the year in which taxable income is first generated by a company, or\n(ii) a year selected by the company for commencement, on the condition that the company meets certain provisions provided by the Investment Law. The amendment does not apply to\ninvestment programs approved prior to December 31, 2004 and applies only to new investment programs. We began to generate income under the provision of the new amendment as of the\nbeginning of 2006.\nAfter expiration of the initial tax exemption period, the company is eligible for what was considered then a reduced corporate tax rate of 10% to 25%, depending on the extent of\nforeign investment in the company, for the following five to eight years, depending on the geographic location of the Benefited Enterprise within Israel. The benefits period was limited to\n12 years from completion of the investment under the approved plan or 14 years from the date of the approval, whichever is earlier. A company in which more than 25% of the shareholders\nare non-residents of Israel, defined under the Investment Law as a Foreign Investors Company, may be eligible for benefits for an extended period of up to ten years.\nIn addition, pursuant to a recent amendment of the Law, any distribution of dividend as of August 15, 2021 will be prorated between exempt income and taxable income. As such,\nupon dividend distribution, in case the company has accumulated exempt income, the company will be obligated to pay the corporate income tax it was exempted from with respect to the\nexempt profits portion. Distribution of dividends derived from Approved Enterprise and Benefited Enterprise income that was taxed at reduced rates, but not tax exempt, does not result in\nadditional tax consequences to the company. Shareholders who receive dividends derived from approved enterprise and Benefited Enterprise income were generally taxed at a rate of 15%\nwhich was withheld and paid by the company paying the dividend if the dividend was distributed during the benefits period or within the following 12 years.\nThe benefits available to an Approved Enterprise and Benefited Enterprise were conditioned upon terms stipulated in the Investment Law and the related regulations (which include\nmaking specified investments in property and equipment, and financing a percentage of these investments with share capital), and, for an Approved Enterprise, the conditions contained in\nthe certificate of approval from the Investment Center. If we do not fulfill these conditions, in whole or in part, the benefits can be cancelled and we may be required to refund the amount of\nthe benefits, linked to the CPI in Israel plus interest. We believe that our Approved Enterprise and Benefited Enterprise programs were operated in compliance with all applicable conditions\nand criteria.\nWe had derived a material portion of our operating income from our Approved Enterprise and Benefited Enterprise facilities. We were therefore eligible for a tax exemption for a\nlimited period on undistributed Approved Enterprise and Benefited Enterprise income. We intend to reinvest the entire amount of our tax-exempt income and not to distribute this income as\na dividend\nUntil December 31, 2010, TAT and Turbochrome have elected to participate in the alternative package of tax benefits for their Approved and Benefited Enterprise under the law.\nPursuant to such Law, the income derived from those enterprises was exempted from Israeli corporate tax for a specified benefit period (except to the extent that dividends are\ndistributed during the tax-exemption period other than upon liquidation) and subject to reduced corporate tax rates for an additional period.\n73\nTax Benefits under the 2011 Amendment\nUnder the transitional provisions of the 2011 Amendment, the company elected to irrevocably implement the 2011 Amendment with respect to its existing Approved and\nBeneficiary Enterprises while waiving benefits provided under the legislation prior to the 2011 Amendment.\nDividends paid out of income attributed to a Preferred Enterprise will be subject to a withholding tax at the source at the rate of 20%, or such lower rate as may be provided in an\napplicable tax treaty. However, if such dividends are paid to an Israeli company, no tax is required to be withheld (although, if the funds are subsequently distributed to individuals or to non-\nIsraeli residents (individuals and corporations), the withholding tax would apply).\nAs of January 1, 2014, a Preferred Company is entitled to a reduced corporate tax rate of 16% with respect to its income derived from its Preferred Enterprise, unless the Preferred\nEnterprise is located in development area A, in which case the tax rate as of January 1, 2017 was 7.5% (our operations are currently not located in development area A). Income which is not\nderived from Preferred Enterprise is subject to the regular corporate tax rate (23% in tax year 2018 and thereafter).\nTAT is located in an area in Israel that is designated as elsewhere and as such is entitled to reduce tax rates of 16% (as of 2014).\nTurbochrome is located in an area in Israel that is designated as Zone A and as such entitled to reduce tax rates of 7.5% (as of 2017).\nTax Benefits under the 2017 Amendment\nAn amendment to the Investment Law, which became effective as of January 1, 2017, provides new tax benefit to Preferred companies for two types of \"Technology Enterprise\", as\ndescribed below, and is in addition to the other existing tax beneficial programs under the Investment Law.\nThe new incentives regime will apply to \"Preferred Technological Enterprises\" that meet certain conditions, as detailed in the 2017 amendment. Preferred Technological Enterprises\nwill be subject to a corporate tax rate of 12% unless the Preferred Technological Enterprise is located in development zone A, in which case the rate will be 7.5% with respect to the portion\nof income derived from intellectual property developed in Israel. The withholding tax on dividends from income derived from intellectual property of the Preferred Technological\nEnterprises will be 4% for dividends paid to a foreign parent company holding at least 90% of the shares of the distributing company. For other dividend distributions, the withholding tax\nrate will be 20% (or a lower rate under a tax treaty, if applicable).\nWe cannot assure you that we will continue to qualify as an Industrial Company or that the benefits described above will be available to us in the future.\nTax Benefits and Grants for Research and Development\nIsraeli tax law allows, under specific conditions, a tax deduction in the year incurred for expenditures, including capital expenditures, relating to scientific research and development\nprojects, if the expenditures are approved by the relevant Israeli government ministry, determined by the field of research, and the research and development is for the promotion of the\ncompany and is carried out by or on behalf of the company seeking such deduction. Expenditures not so approved are deductible over a three-year period. However, expenditures from\nproceeds made available to us through government grants are not deductible according to Israeli law.\n74\nTax Benefits under the Law for the Encouragement of Industry (Taxes), 1969\nAccording to the Law for the Encouragement of Industry (Taxes), 1969 (the Industry Encouragement Law), an Industrial Company is an Israeli resident company, with at least\n90% of the income of which, in a given tax year, (exclusive of income from some government loans) is derived from an Industrial Enterprise owned by it and located in Israel or in the\n\"Area\", in accordance with the definition in the section 3a of the Ordinance. An Industrial Enterprise is defined as an enterprise whose major activity in a given tax year is industrial\nproduction activity.\nUnder the Industry Encouragement Law, Industrial Companies are entitled to the following tax benefits:\n Amortization of purchases of acquired technology and patents over an eight-year period for tax purposes;\n Amortization of specified expenses incurred in connection with a public issuance of securities over a three-year period for tax purposes;\n Right to elect, under specified conditions, to file a consolidated tax return with additional related Israeli Industrial Companies; and\n Accelerated depreciation rates on equipment and buildings.\nEligibility for benefits under the Industry Encouragement Law is not subject to receipt of prior approval from any governmental authority.\nSpecial Provisions Relating to Taxation under Inflationary Conditions\nThe Income Tax Law (Inflationary Adjustments), 1985, referred to as the Inflationary Adjustments Law, attempts to overcome the problems presented to a traditional tax system by\nan economy undergoing rapid inflation. The Inflationary Adjustments Law is highly complex.\nOn February 26, 2008, the Israeli Parliament (the Knesset) enacted the Income Tax Law (Inflationary Adjustments) (Amendment No. 20) (Restriction of Effective Period), 2008\n(the Inflationary Adjustments Amendment). In accordance with the Inflationary Adjustments Amendment, as of the 2008 tax year the provisions of the law are no longer apply, other than\nthe transitional provisions intended at preventing distortions in the tax calculations. In accordance with the Inflationary Adjustments Amendment, commencing the 2008 tax year, income\nfor tax purposes is no longer be adjusted to a real (net of inflation) measurement basis. Furthermore, the depreciation of inflation immune assets and carried forward tax losses are no longer\nlinked to the CPI in Israel.\nTaxation of Dividends Paid on our Ordinary Shares\nTaxation of Israeli Shareholders\nA distribution of dividends from income, which is not attributed to an Approved Enterprise/ Benefited Enterprise/ Preferred Enterprise to an Israeli resident individual, will\ngenerally be subject to Israeli income tax, at the rate of 25%, or 30% for a recipient that is a \"Controlling Shareholder\" (within the meaning of the Israeli Income Tax Ordinance) at the time\nof distribution or at any time during the 12-month period preceding such distribution.\nHowever, dividends distributed from taxable income accrued during the benefits period of a Benefited Enterprise, subject to certain time limitations, are generally subject to Israeli\nincome tax at the reduced rate of 15%. Dividends paid out of income attributed to a Preferred Enterprise are generally subject to Israeli income tax at the source at the rate of 20%.\n75\nGenerally, Israeli resident corporations are exempt from Israeli corporate tax on the receipt of dividends paid on shares of Israeli resident corporations and that the dividends were\nfully taxed at the corporate tax rate in Israel, unless the dividends are distributed from taxable income that has accrued during the benefits period of Approved Enterprise of Benefited\nEnterprise, in which case they are taxable at the rate of 15%.\nIn addition, a 3% surtax will apply with respect to individuals on top of the aforementioned tax rates when annual taxable income exceeds NIS 698,280 (with respect to 2023). The\namount is updated every year.\nIt should be noted that we cannot assure you that we will designate the profits that are being distributed in a way that will reduce shareholders tax liability to those tax rates.\nTaxation of Non-Israeli Shareholders\nThe Ordinance generally provides that a non-Israeli resident (either individual or corporation) is subject to, an Israeli income tax at the rate of 25%, or 30% if the recipient is a\n\"Controlling Shareholder\" at the time of distribution or at any time during the 12-month period preceding such distribution, unless a different rate is provided in a treaty between Israel and\nthe shareholders country of residence.\nAs aforesaid, dividends derived from any of our income generated by an Approved Enterprise or Benefited Enterprise, are subject to withholding tax at a rate of 15% (or less based\non applicable tax treaty), and dividends derived from any of our income generated by a Preferred Enterprise are subject to withholding tax at a rate of 20% (or less based on applicable tax\ntreaty).\nIt should be noted that 3% surtax will apply on individuals on top of the aforementioned tax rates when annual taxable income exceeds NIS 698.280 (with respect to 2023). The\namount is updated every year.\nUnder the United States-Israel Tax Treaty, the maximum rate of tax withheld at source in Israel on dividends paid to a holder of our ordinary shares who is a U.S. resident (for\npurposes of the United States-Israel Tax Treaty) is 25%. However, generally the maximum rate of withholding tax on dividends, not generated by Approved / Benefited / Preferred\nEnterprises, that are paid to a U.S. corporation holding at least 10% or more of our outstanding voting capital from the start of the tax year preceding the distribution of the dividend through\n(and including) the distribution of the dividends, is 12.5%, provided that no more than 25% of our gross income of such preceding year consists of certain types of dividends and interest if a\ncertificate for a reduced withholding tax rate is obtained in advance from the Israeli Tax Authority. Notwithstanding the foregoing, dividends distributed from income attributed to an\nApproved Enterprise, Benefited Enterprise or a Preferred Enterprise are subject to withholding tax rate of 15% for such a U.S. corporation shareholder, provided that the condition related to\nour gross income for the previous year (as set forth in the previous sentence) is met.\nThe aforementioned rates under the United States-Israel Tax Treaty will not apply if the dividend income was derived through a permanent establishment of the U.S. resident in\nIsrael.\nWhen the amount of tax due is not fully withheld at source, such non-Israeli resident is obligated to file a tax return, report his or her Israeli income and pay the balance of the\namount of tax due.\nCapital gains taxes applicable to non-Israeli shareholders\nCapital gains from the sale of our ordinary shares by non-Israeli shareholders are exempt from Israeli taxation, provided that the capital gain is not derived from a permanent\nestablishment in Israel according to section 97(b2) to the Israeli income tax ordinance. In addition, the U.S.-Israel Tax Treaty exempts U.S. residents who hold less than 10% of our voting\nrights, and who held less than 10% of our voting rights during the 12 months prior to a sale of their shares, from Israeli capital gains tax in connection with such sale.\n76\nUnited States Federal Income Tax Consequences\nThe following discussion summarizes the material U.S. federal income tax considerations generally applicable to the purchase, ownership and disposition of our ordinary shares.\nUnless otherwise stated, this summary deals only with shareholders that are U.S. Holders (as defined below) who hold their ordinary shares as capital assets.\nAs used in this section, the term U.S. Holder means a beneficial owner of an ordinary share who is:\n An individual citizen or resident of the United States or an individual treated as a U.S. citizen or resident for U.S. federal income tax purposes;\n A corporation or other entity taxable as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes created or organized in or under the laws of the United States, any State or the\nDistrict of Columbia;\n An estate, the income of which is subject to U.S. federal income taxation regardless of its source; or\n Any trust if (A)(i) a court within the United States is able to exercise primary supervision over the administration of the trust and (ii) one or more United States persons have\nthe authority to control all substantial decisions of the trust, or (B) such trust validly elects to be treated as a United States person.\nThe term Non-U.S. Holder means a beneficial owner of an ordinary share that is an individual, corporation, estate or trust and is not a U.S. Holder. The tax consequences to a\nNon-U.S. Holder may differ substantially from the tax consequences to a U.S. Holder. Certain aspects of U.S. federal income tax relevant to a Non-U.S. Holder are discussed below.\nThis description is based on provisions of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code), existing and proposed U.S. Treasury regulations promulgated\nthereunder, administrative and judicial interpretations thereof, and the U.S.-Israel Tax Treaty, each as in effect as of the date of this annual report. In addition, this description also relates to\nthe Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) signed into law on December 22, 2017. These sources may change, possibly with retroactive effect, and are open to differing interpretations. This\ndescription does not discuss all aspects of U.S. federal income taxation that may be applicable to investors in light of their particular circumstances or to investors who are subject to special\ntreatment under U.S. federal income tax law, including:\n Insurance companies;\n Dealers in stocks, securities or currencies;\n Financial institutions and financial services entities;\n Real estate investment trusts;\n Regulated investment companies;\n Persons that receive ordinary shares in connection with the performance of services;\n Tax-exempt organizations;\n Persons that hold ordinary shares as part of a straddle or appreciated financial position or as part of a hedging, conversion or other integrated instrument;\n Persons who hold the ordinary shares through partnerships or other pass-through entities;\n Individual retirement and other tax-deferred accounts;\n Expatriates of the United States and certain former long-term residents of the United States;\n Persons liable for the alternative minimum tax;\n Persons having a functional currency other than the U.S. dollar; and\n Direct, indirect or constructive owners of 10% or more, by voting power or value, of our company.\n77\nIf a partnership or an entity treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes owns ordinary shares, the U.S. federal income tax treatment of a partner in such a\npartnership will generally depend upon the status of the partner and the activities of the partnership. A partnership that owns ordinary shares and the partners in such partnership should\nconsult their own tax advisors about the U.S. federal income tax consequences of holding and disposing of ordinary shares.\nThis discussion does not consider the possible application of U.S. federal gift or estate tax or alternative minimum tax.\nAll investors are urged to consult their own tax advisors as to the particular tax consequences to them of an investment in our ordinary shares, including the effect and applicability\nof United States federal, state, local and foreign income and other tax laws (including estate and gift tax laws) and tax treaties.\nDistributions Paid on the Ordinary Shares\nSubject to the discussion below under Passive Foreign Investment Company Considerations, a U.S. Holder generally will be required to include in his or her gross income as\nordinary dividend income the amount of any distributions paid on the ordinary shares, including the amount of any Israeli taxes withheld, to the extent that those distributions are paid out of\nour current or accumulated earnings and profits, as determined for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Subject to the discussion below under Passive Foreign Investment Company\nConsiderations, distributions in excess of our earnings and profits will be applied against and will reduce the U.S. Holders tax basis in its ordinary shares and, to the extent they exceed that\ntax basis, will be treated as gain from a sale or exchange of those ordinary shares. In some cases, our dividends will not qualify for the dividends-received deduction applicable to U.S.\ncorporations.\nDividends that we pay in NIS, including the amount of any Israeli taxes withheld therefrom, will be included in your income in a U.S. dollar amount calculated by reference to the\nexchange rate in effect on the day such dividends are received, regardless of whether the payment is in fact converted into U.S. dollars. A U.S. Holder who receives payment in NIS and\nconverts NIS into U.S. dollars at an exchange rate other than the rate in effect on such day will have a foreign currency exchange gain or loss that would be treated as ordinary income or\nloss. U.S. Holders should consult their own tax advisors concerning the U.S. tax consequences of acquiring, holding and disposing of NIS.\nSubject to certain limitations, qualified dividend income received by a non-corporate U.S. Holder will generally be subject to taxation in the U.S at a lower rate than ordinary\nincome. Distributions taxable as dividends paid on the ordinary shares should qualify for lower tax rate provided that we are not a passive foreign investment company (as described below)\nfor U.S. tax purposes and that either: (i) we are entitled to benefits under the U.S.-Israel Tax Treaty or (ii) the ordinary shares are readily tradable on an established securities market in the\nUnited States and certain other requirements are met. We believe that we are entitled to benefits under the U.S.-Israel Tax Treaty and that the ordinary shares currently will be readily\ntradable on an established securities market in the United States. However, no assurance can be given that the ordinary shares will remain readily tradable. The rate reduction does not apply\nunless certain holding period requirements are satisfied. With respect to the ordinary shares, the U.S. Holder must have held such shares for at least 61 days during the 121-day period\nbeginning 60 days before the ex-dividend date. The rate reduction also does not apply to dividends received from passive foreign investment companies, see discussion below, or in respect\nof certain hedged positions or in certain other situations. The legislation enacting the reduced tax rate contains special rules for computing the foreign tax credit limitation of a taxpayer who\nreceives dividends subject to the reduced tax rate. U.S. Holders of ordinary shares should consult their own tax advisors regarding the effect of these rules in their particular circumstances.\nSubject to the discussion below under Information Reporting and Back-up Withholding, a Non-U.S. Holder generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income or withholding\ntax on dividends received on ordinary shares unless that income is effectively connected with the conduct by that Non-U.S. Holder of a trade or business in the United States, in which case a\ncorporate Non-U.S. Holder may also be subject to the U.S. branch profits tax.\n78\nForeign Tax Credit\nAny dividend income resulting from distributions we pay to a U.S. Holder with respect to the ordinary shares generally may be treated as foreign source income for U.S. foreign tax\ncredit limitation purposes. For all taxable years ended until December 31, 2017, and subject to certain conditions and limitations, Israeli tax withheld on dividends may be deducted from\ntaxable income or credited against a U.S. Holders U.S. federal income tax liability. The limitation on foreign taxes eligible for credit is calculated separately with respect to specific classes\nof income. For this purpose, in general, any dividend that we distribute should constitute passive category income, or, in the case of certain U.S. Holders, general category income.\nStarting January 1, 2018, and with respect to our corporate U.S. Holders, the TCJA provides a 100% deduction for the foreign-source portion of dividends received after January 1,\n2018 from specified 10-percent owned foreign corporations by U.S. corporate holders, subject to a one-year holding period. No foreign tax credit, including Israeli withholding tax (or\ndeduction for foreign taxes paid with respect to qualifying dividends) would be permitted for foreign taxes paid or accrued with respect to a qualifying dividend. Deduction would be\nunavailable for hybrid dividends. The dividend received deduction enacted under the TCJA may not apply to dividends from a passive foreign investment company.\nThe rules relating to the determination of foreign source income and the foreign tax credit are complex, and the availability of a foreign tax credit depends on numerous factors.\nEach investor who is a U.S. Holder should consult with its own tax advisor to determine whether its income with respect to the ordinary shares would be foreign source income and whether\nand to what extent that investor would be entitled to a foreign tax credit.\nDisposition of Ordinary Shares\nUpon the sale or other disposition of ordinary shares, subject to the discussion below under Passive Foreign Investment Company Considerations, a U.S. Holder generally should\nrecognize capital gain or loss equal to the difference between the amount realized on the disposition and the holders adjusted tax basis in the ordinary shares. U.S. Holders should consult\ntheir own tax advisors with respect to the tax consequences of the receipt of a currency other than U.S. dollars upon such sale or other disposition.\nGain or loss upon the disposition of the ordinary shares will be treated as long-term if, at the time of the sale or disposition, the ordinary shares were held for more than one year.\nThe deductibility of capital losses by a U.S. Holder is subject to limitations. In general, any gain or loss recognized by a U.S. Holder on the sale or other disposition of ordinary shares will\nbe U.S. source income or loss for U.S. foreign tax credit purposes. U.S. Holders should consult their own tax advisors concerning the source of income for U.S. foreign tax credit purposes\nand the effect of the U.S.-Israel Tax Treaty on the source of income.\nSubject to the discussion below under Information Reporting and Back-up Withholding, a Non-U.S. Holder generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income or withholding\ntax on any gain realized on the sale or exchange of ordinary shares unless:\n that gain is effectively connected with the conduct by the Non-U.S. Holder of a trade or business in the United States, and, if a tax treaty applies, is attributable to a permanent\nestablishment or fixed base of the Non-U.S. Holder in the United States; or\n in the case of any gain realized by an individual Non-U.S. Holder, that holder is present in the United States for 183 days or more in the taxable year of the sale or exchange,\nand other conditions are met.\n79\nPassive Foreign Investment Company Considerations\nSpecial U.S. federal income tax rules apply to U.S. Holders owning shares of a passive foreign investment company. A non-U.S. corporation will be considered a passive foreign\ninvestment company for any taxable year in which, after applying certain look-through rules, 75% or more of its gross income consists of specified types of passive income, or 50% or more\nof the average value of its assets consists of assets that produce, or are held for the production of, passive income. For this purpose, passive income may include dividends, interest, royalties,\nrents, annuities and the excess of gains over losses from the disposition of assets which produce passive income.\nIf we were classified as a passive foreign investment company, a U.S. Holder could be subject to increased tax liability upon the sale or other disposition of ordinary shares or upon\nthe receipt of amounts treated as excess distributions. Under these rules, the excess distribution and any gain would be allocated ratably over the U.S. Holders holding period for the\nordinary shares, and the amount allocated to the current taxable year and any taxable year prior to the first taxable year in which we were a passive foreign investment company would be\ntaxed as ordinary income. The amount allocated to each of the other taxable years would be subject to tax at the highest marginal tax rate in effect for the applicable class of taxpayer for that\nyear, and an interest charge for the deemed deferral benefit would be imposed on the resulting tax allocated to such other taxable years. The tax liability with respect to the amount allocated\nto years prior to the year of the disposition, or excess distribution, cannot be offset by any net operating losses. In addition, holders of shares in a passive foreign investment company may\nnot receive a step-up in basis on shares acquired from a decedent. If we are a passive foreign investment company in any year, a U.S. Holder would be required to file an annual return on\nIRS Form 8621 regarding distributions received with respect to ordinary shares and any gain realized on the disposition of ordinary shares.\nBased on our current and projected income, assets and activities, we do not believe that we will be a passive foreign investment company for our current taxable year. However,\nbecause the determination of whether we are a passive foreign investment company is based upon the composition of our income and assets from time to time, we cannot be certain that we\nwill not be considered a passive foreign investment company for the current taxable year or any future taxable year.\nThe passive foreign investment company tax consequences described above will not apply to a U.S. Holder if the U.S. Holder makes a timely election to treat us as a qualified\nelecting fund (QEF). If a U.S. Holder makes a timely QEF election, the U.S. Holder would be required to include in income for each taxable year its pro rata share of our ordinary\nearnings as ordinary income and its pro rata share of our net capital gain as long-term capital gain, whether or not such amounts are actually distributed to the U.S. Holder. However, a U.S.\nHolder would not be eligible to make a QEF election unless we comply with certain applicable information reporting requirements. We will provide U.S. Holders with the information\nneeded to report income and gain under a QEF election should we become a passive foreign investment company.\nAs an alternative to making a QEF election, a U.S. Holder of passive foreign investment company stock which is publicly traded may in certain circumstances avoid certain of the\ntax consequences generally applicable to holders of a passive foreign investment company by electing to mark the stock to market annually and recognizing as ordinary income or loss each\nyear an amount equal to the difference as of the close of the taxable year between the fair market value of the passive foreign investment company stock and the U.S. Holders adjusted tax\nbasis in the passive foreign investment company stock. Losses would be allowed only to the extent of net mark-to-market gain previously included by the U.S. Holder under the election for\nprior taxable years. Income recognized and deductions allowed under the mark-to-market provisions, as well as any gain or loss on the disposition of ordinary shares with respect to which\nthe mark-to-market election is made, are generally treated as ordinary income or loss (except that loss is treated as capital loss to the extent the loss exceeds the net mark-to-market gains, if\nany, that a U.S. Holder included in its income with respect to such ordinary shares in prior years). However, gain or loss from the disposition of ordinary shares (as to which a mark-to-\nmarket election was made) in a year in which we are no longer a passive foreign investment company, will be capital gain or loss. The mark-to-market election is available for so long as\nour ordinary shares constitute marketable stock, which includes stock of a passive foreign investment company that is regularly traded on a qualified exchange or other market.\nGenerally, a qualified exchange or other market includes a national securities exchange that is registered with the SEC or the national market system established pursuant to Section 11A\nof the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. A class of stock that is traded on one or more qualified exchanges or other markets is regularly traded on an exchange or market for any calendar\nyear during which that class of stock is traded, other than in the minimized quantities, on at least 15 days during each calendar quarter. We believe that NASDAQ will constitute a qualified\nexchange or other market for this purpose. However, we cannot be certain that our ordinary shares will continue to trade on NASDAQ or that the ordinary shares will be regularly traded for\nthis purpose.\nThe rules applicable to owning shares of a passive foreign investment company are complex, and each holder who is a U.S. Holder should consult with its own tax advisor\nregarding the consequences of investing in a passive foreign investment company.\n80\nMedicare Tax\nCertain U.S. Holders that are individuals, estates or trusts may be subject to a 3.8% Net Investment Income tax on all or a portion of their net investment income, which may\ninclude all or a portion of their dividend income and net gains from the disposition of ordinary shares and warrants. Each U.S. Holder that is an individual, estate or trust is urged to consult\nits tax advisors regarding the applicability of the Net Investment Income tax to its income and gains in respect of its investment in our ordinary shares and warrants, including with respect to\nthe eligibility to claim foreign tax credit against such tax.\nInformation Reporting and Backup Withholding\nPayments in respect of ordinary shares may be subject to information reporting to the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (the IRS) and to U.S. backup withholding tax at a rate equal\nto the fourth lowest income tax rate applicable to individuals (which, under current law, is 24%). Backup withholding will not apply, however, if you (i) are a corporation or come within\ncertain exempt categories, and demonstrate the fact when so required, or (ii) furnish a correct taxpayer identification number and make any other required certification. U.S. Holders who are\nrequired to establish their exempt status generally must provide such certification on IRS Form W-9.\nBackup withholding is not an additional tax. Amounts withheld under the backup withholding rules may be credited against a U.S. Holders U.S. tax liability, and a U.S. Holder\nmay obtain a refund of any excess amounts withheld under the backup withholding rules by filing the appropriate claim for refund with the IRS.\nAny U.S. holder who holds 10% or more in vote or value of our ordinary shares will be subject to certain additional United States information reporting requirements.\nU.S. Gift and Estate Tax\nAn individual U.S. Holder of ordinary shares will generally be subject to U.S. gift and estate taxes with respect to ordinary shares in the same manner and to the same extent as with\nrespect to other types of personal property.\nF.

In addition, we are not required under the Exchange Act to file periodic reports and financial statements as frequently or as\npromptly as United States companies whose securities are registered under the Exchange Act.

Annual Report to Security Holders\nNot applicable.\nItem 11.Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk\nWe do not own and have not issued any market risk sensitive instruments about which disclosure is required to be provided pursuant to this Item.\nEffects of Currency Exchange Fluctuations\nOur financial statements are stated in dollars, while a portion of our expenses, primarily labor expenses, is incurred in NIS and a part of our revenues are quoted in NIS.\nAdditionally, certain assets, as well as a portion of our liabilities, are denominated in NIS. As a result, our operations may be affected by fluctuations of the U.S. dollar/NIS exchange rate.\nWe are hedging a portion of our exchange rate risk through forward transactions and the use of other derivative instruments.\nItem 12.Description of Securities Other than Equity Securities\nNot Applicable.\n82\nPART II\nItem 13.Defaults, Dividend Arrearages and Delinquencies\nNone.\nItem 14.Material Modifications to the Rights of Security Holders\nNone.\nItem 15.Controls and Procedures\n(a) Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nWe maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our Exchange Act reports is recorded, processed,\nsummarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SECs rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our chief executive officer and chief\nfinancial officer to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Our management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, conducted an evaluation of our\ndisclosure controls and procedures, as defined under Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(e), as of the end of the period covered by this annual report on Form 20-F. Based upon that evaluation, our\nchief executive officer and chief financial officer have concluded that, as of such date, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective.\n(b) Management's Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over our financial reporting. Internal control over financial reporting is defined in Rule\n13a-15(f) or 15d-15(f) promulgated under the Exchange Act as a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the companys principal executive and principal financial officers and\neffected by the companys board of directors, management and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of\nfinancial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and includes those policies and procedures that:\n Pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company;\n Provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting\nprinciples, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and\n Provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use of disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect\non the financial statements.\n83\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods\nare subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nOur management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023. In making this assessment, our management used the criteria\nset forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013). Based on that assessment, our management\nconcluded that as of December 31, 2023, our internal control over financial reporting is effective.\n(c) Attestation report of independent registered public accounting firm\nThis annual report does not include an attestation report of our independent registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial report. Managements report\nwas not subject to attestation by our independent registered public accounting firm pursuant to rules of the SEC that permit us to provide only managements report in this annual report.\n(d) Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nThere was no change in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the period covered by this annual report that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely\nto materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.\nItem 16. [Reserved]\nItem 16A.Audit Committee Financial Expert\nOur board of directors has determined that each member of our audit committee qualifies as an audit committee financial expert, as defined by rules of the SEC. For a brief listing\nof the relevant experience of the member of our audit committee, see Item 6.A. Directors, Senior Management and Employees  Directors and Senior Management.\nItem 16B.Code of Ethics\nWe have adopted a code of ethics that applies to our chief executive officer and all senior financial officers of our company, including the chief financial officer, chief accounting\nofficer or controller, or persons performing similar functions. The code of ethics is publicly available on our website at www.tat-technologies.com. Written copies are available upon\nrequest. If we make any substantive amendment to the code of ethics or grant any waivers, including any implicit waiver, from a provision of the codes of ethics, we will disclose the nature\nof such amendment or waiver on our website.\n84\nItem 16C.Principal Accountant Fees and Services\nFees Paid to Independent Public Accountant\nThe following table sets forth, for each of the years indicated, the fees paid to our principal independent registered public accounting firm. All of such fees were pre-approved by\nour audit committee.\nYear Ended December 31,\nServices Rendered 2023 2022\nAudit (1) $ 396,873 $ 248,524\nTax (2) 19,571 23,262\nTotal $ 413,444 $ 271,786\n(1) Audit fees are for audit services for each of the years shown in the table, including fees associated with the annual audit and reviews of our quarterly financial results,\nconsultations on various accounting issues and audit services provided in connection with other statutory or regulatory filings.\n(2) Tax fees relate to professional services rendered for tax compliance and tax advice. These services include assistance regarding international and Israeli taxation.\nPre-Approval Policies and Procedures\nOur audit committee has adopted a policy and procedures for the pre-approval of audit and non-audit services rendered by our independent registered public accounting firm\nKesselman & Kesselman, a member of PricewaterhouseCoopers International Ltd. Pre-approval of an audit or non-audit service may be given as a general pre-approval, as part of the audit\ncommittees approval of the scope of the engagement of our independent auditor, or on an individual basis. Any proposed services exceeding general pre-approved levels also require\nspecific pre-approval by our audit committee. The policy prohibits retention of the independent public accountants to perform the prohibited non-audit functions defined in Section 201 of\nthe Sarbanes-Oxley Act or the rules of the SEC, and also requires the audit committee to consider whether proposed services are compatible with the independence of the public accountants.\nItem 16D.Exemptions from the Listing Standards for Audit Committee\nNot Applicable.\n85\nItem 16E. Purchase of Equity Securities By The Issuer and Affiliated Purchasers\nNot Applicable.\nItem 16F. Change in Registrants Certifying Accountant.\nNot Applicable.\nItem 16G.Corporate Governance\nThe following are the significant ways in which our corporate governance practices differ from those followed by United States companies under Nasdaq rules:\nShareholder Approval. Although Nasdaq rules generally require shareholder approval of equity compensation plans and material amendments thereto, we follow Israeli Companies\nLaw, which is to have such plans and amendments approved only by the board of directors, unless such arrangements are for the compensation of directors, Chief Executive Officer or a\ntransaction with the controlling shareholder, in which case they also require the approval of the compensation committee and the shareholders.\nIn addition, rather than follow Nasdaq rules requiring shareholder approval for the issuance of securities in certain circumstances, we follow Israeli law, under which a private\nplacement of securities requires approval by our board of directors and shareholders if it will cause a person to become a controlling shareholder (generally presumed at 25% ownership) or\nif:\no The securities issued amount to 20% or more of our outstanding voting rights before the issuance;\no Some or all of the consideration is other than cash or listed securities or the transaction is not in accordance with market terms; and\no The transaction will increase the relative holdings of a shareholder that holds 5% or more of our outstanding share capital or voting rights or that it will cause any person to\nbecome, as a result of the issuance, a holder of more than 5% of our outstanding share capital or voting rights.\nAnnual Reports. While NASDAQ rules generally require that companies send an annual report to shareholders prior to the annual general meeting, we follow the generally\naccepted business practice for companies in Israel. Specifically, we file annual reports on Form 20-F, which contain financial statements audited by an independent registered public\naccounting firm, electronically with the SEC and post a copy on our website.\n86\nItem 16H.Mine Safety Disclosure\nNot applicable.\nItem 16I.Disclosure Regarding Foreign Jurisdictions that Prevent Inspections\nNot applicable.\nItem 16K.Cybersecurity\nThe Board recognizes the critical importance of maintaining the availability and completion of our data and systems, the trust and confidence of our business partners and\nemployees. The Audit Committee is responsible for reviewing our policies with respect to cybersecurity risks and relevant contingent liabilities and risks that may be material to the\nCompany, including risks from third parties and business partners.\nWe generally seek to address cybersecurity risks by implementing security measures on our internal computer systems.These security measures include firewalls, intrusion\nprevention and detection systems, anti-malware functionality and access controls, which are evaluated by our IT managers and improved through vulnerability assessments and\ncybersecurity threat intelligence.\nOur Chief Operating Officer is responsible for implementing protection measures for our information systems from cybersecurity threats and promptly responding to any\ncybersecurity incidents.\nTo date, we have not identified risks from known cybersecurity threats, including as a result of any prior cybersecurity incidents, that have materially affected or are reasonably\nlikely to materially affect us, including our operations, business strategy, results of operations, or financial condition.\n87\nPART III\nItem 17.Financial Statements\nWe have elected

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nTothe shareholders and board of directors of TAT Technologies Ltd.\nOpinion on the Financial Statements\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of TAT Technologies Ltd. and its subsidiaries (the Company) as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, and the related\nconsolidated statements of operations, of comprehensive income (loss), of changes in shareholders' equity and of cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31,\n2023, including the related notes (collectively referred to as the consolidatedfinancial statements). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material\nrespects, the financial position of the Companyas of December 31, 2023 and 2022, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended\nDecember 31, 2023in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Companys management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Companys consolidated financial statements\nbased on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with\nrespect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits of these consolidated financial statements in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain\nreasonable assurance about whether the consolidatedfinancial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we\nengaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but\nnot for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.\nOur audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures\nthat respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also\nincluded evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We\nbelieve that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matters\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be\ncommunicated to the audit committee and that (i) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging,\nsubjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are\nnot, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\nKesselman & Kesselman, 146 Derech Menachem Begin St. Tel-Aviv 6492103, Israel,\nP.O Box 7187 Tel-Aviv 6107120, Telephone: +972 -3- 7954555, Fax:+972 -3- 7954556, www.pwc.com/il\nF - 3\nTAT TECHNOLOGIES LTD.\nInventory - Write down of obsolete and unmarketable inventory\nAs described in Notes 2 and 4 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company's consolidated inventory balance was $51,280 thousand as of December 31, 2023. The Company writes\ndown its inventory for estimated obsolescence and unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and net realizable value based upon assumptions for future\ndemand and market conditions. Changes in these assumptions could have a significant impact on the inventory's valuation.\nThe principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the write down of obsolete and unmarketable inventory is a critical audit matter were based on the\nsignificant judgement used by management when determining the assumptions relating to the future demand, market conditions, and sales forecasts. This in turn led to a high degree of\nauditor judgement, subjectivity and effort in performing procedures and evaluating management's significant assumptions related to future demand and market conditions.\nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These\nprocedures included, among others: (i) utilizing historical inventory usage data to analyze the relationship between the inventory impairment calculated, the inventory on hand, and the sales\nover time; (ii) evaluating managements ability to accurately estimate future demand by comparing actual inventory usage to estimates made in prior years; (iii) comparison of\nmanagements assumptions related to market conditions to available external market data for a sample of inventory items; (iv) evaluating the accuracy of the impairment by selecting a\nsample of inventory items and evaluating supporting documentation regarding current and historical sales patterns; (v) assessing whether management's assumptions related to future\ndemand and market conditions were consistent with evidence obtained in other areas of the audit.\nTel-Aviv, Israel Kesselman & Kesselman\nMarch 6, 2024 Certified Public Accountants (Isr.)\nA member firm of PricewaterhouseCoopers International Limited\nWe have served as the Company's auditor since 2009.\nF - 4\nTAT TECHNOLOGIES LTD.\nCONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS\nU.S dollars in thousands\nDecember 31,\n2023 2022\nASSETS\nCURRENT ASSETS:\nCash and cash equivalents $ 15,979 $ 7,722\nAccounts receivable, net of allowance for credit losses of $345\nand $527 thousand as of December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022 respectively 20,009 15,622\nRestricted deposit 661 -\nOther current assets and prepaid expenses 6,397 6,047\nInventory 51,280 45,759\nTotal current assets 94,326 75,150\nNON-CURRENT ASSETS:\nRestricted deposit 302 304\nInvestment in affiliates 2,168 1,665\nFunds in respect of employee rights upon retirement 664 780\nDeferred income taxes 994 1,229\nProperty, plant and equipment, net 42,554 43,423\nOperating lease right of use assets 2,746 2,477\nIntangible assets, net 1,823 1,623\nTotal non-current assets 51,251 51,501\nTotal assets 145,577 $ 126,651\nThe accompanying notes are an integral part of the consolidated financial statements.\nF- 5\nTAT TECHNOLOGIES LTD.\nCONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS\nU.S dollars in thousands, except share data\nDecember 31,\n2023 2022\nLIABILITIES AND EQUITY\nCURRENT LIABILITIES:\nCurrent maturities of long-term loans $ 2,200 $ 1,876\nCredit line from bank 12,138 6,101\nAccounts payable 9,988 10,233\nAccrued expenses and other 13,952 9,876\nOperating lease liabilities 1,033 904\nTotal current liabilities 39,311 28,990\nNON-CURRENT LIABILITIES:\nLong-term loans 12,886 19,408\nLiability in respect of employee rights upon retirement 1,000 1,148\nOperating lease liabilities 1,697 1,535\nTotal non-current liabilities 15,583 22,091\nCOMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES (NOTE 15)\nTotal liabilities 54,894 51,081\nEQUITY:\nOrdinary shares of NIS 0.9 par value:\nAuthorized: 13,000,000 shares at December 31, 2023 and at December 31, 2022; Issued: 10,377,085 and 9,186,019 shares at December\n31, 2023 and at December 31, 2022 respectively; Outstanding: 10,102,612 and 8,911,546 shares at December 31, 2023 and at December\n31, 2022 respectively 3,140 2,842\nAdditional paid-in capital 76,335 66,245\nTreasury shares, at cost, 274,473 shares at December 31, 2023 and 2022 (2,088) (2,088)\nAccumulated other comprehensive income (loss) 27 (26)\nRetained earnings 13,269 8,597\nTotal shareholders' equity 90,683 75,570\nTotal liabilities and shareholders' equity 145,577 $ 126,651\nThe accompanying notes are an integral part of the consolidated financial statements.\nF- 6\nTAT TECHNOLOGIES LTD.\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS\nU.S dollars in thousands\nYear ended December 31,\n2023 2022 2021\nRevenue:\nProducts $ 35,241 $ 25,460 $ 25,870\nServices 78,553 59,096 52,103\n113,794 84,556 77,973\nCost of revenue, net:\nProducts 30,517 21,631 23,761\nServices 60,809 46,997 42,942\n91,326 68,628 66,703\nGross profit 22,468 15,928 11,270\nOperating expenses:\nResearch and development, net 715 479 517\nSelling and marketing, net 5,523 5,629 5,147\nGeneral and administrative, net 10,588 9,970 8,354\nOther (income) expenses (433) (90) (468)\nRestructuring expenses, net - 1,715 1,755\n16,393 17,703 15,305\nOperating income (loss) 6,075 (1,775) (4,035)\nInterest expenses (1,683) (902) (250)\nOther financial income (expenses), net 353 1,029 (290)\nIncome profit (loss) before taxes on income (tax benefit) 4,745 (1,648) (4,575)\nTaxes on income (tax benefit) 576 98 (662)\nProfit (Loss) before share of equity investment 4,169 (1,746) (3,913)\nShare in profit (losses) of equity investment of affiliated companies 503 184 (76)\nNet income (loss) from continued operation $ 4,672 $ (1,562) $ (3,989)\nThe accompanying notes are an integral part of the consolidated financial statements.\nF- 7\nTAT TECHNOLOGIES LTD.

AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nU.S. dollars in thousands\nNOTE 1 - GENERAL\na. TAT Technologies Ltd., (TAT or the Company) an Israeli corporation, incorporated in 1985, is a leading provider of solutions and services to the aerospace and\ndefense industries, focused mainly on the following four segments: (i) original equipment manufacturing (OEM) of heat transfer solutions and aviation accessories\nmainly through our Kiryat Gat facility and our Limco subsidiary; (ii) MRO (Maintenance Repair and Overhaul) services for heat transfer components and OEM of heat\ntransfer solutions through Limco Airepair Inc our wholly-owned subsidiary; (iii) MRO services for aviation components (mainly Auxiliary Power Unit APU and\nLanding Gear LG) through Piedmont Aviation Component Services LLC our wholly-owned subsidiary; and (iv) overhaul and coating of jet engine components through\nTurbochrome our wholly-owned subsidiary. TAT targets the commercial aerospace (serving a wide range of types and sizes of commercial and business jets), military\naerospace and ground defense sectors. TATs shares are listed on both the NASDAQ (TATT) and Tel-Aviv Stock Exchange.\nIn June 2020, the Company's management decided to discontinue the JT8D engine blades reconditioning activity which belong to overhaul and coating of jet engine\ncomponents segment as part of a strategic change, see Note 18.\nIn March 2021, the Company announced a restructuring plan which includes the transfer of the Company's activity of OEM of heat transfer solutions and aviation\naccessories in Gedera to our activity of MRO services for heat transfer components and OEM of heat transfer solutions in Tulsa, Oklahoma and to our overhaul and\ncoating of jet engine components activity in Kiryat Gat, see Note 9.\nb. During the years 2020 to 2022 the COVID-19 pandemic had an adverse effect on our industry and the markets in which we operate. The COVID-19 outbreak has\nsignificantly impacted the aviation market in which TATs customers operate and has resulted in a reduction of TATs business with some of these customers. Global\nsupply shortages emerged for certain products, leading to delays in delivery schedule.\nc. During 2023, global conflicts continue to create volatility in global financial and energy markets and contribute to supply chain shortages adding to the inflationary\npressures in the global economy. This capabilities lead to higher material and labor costs . The company actively collaborate with its suppliers to minimize impacts of\nsupply shortages on manufacturing.\nd. In October 2023, Hamas terrorists infiltrated Israels southern border from the Gaza Strip and conducted a series of attacks on civilian and military targets. Hamas also\nlaunched extensive rocket attacks on the Israeli population and industrial centers located along Israels border with the Gaza Strip and in other areas within the State of\nIsrael. These attacks resulted in thousands of deaths and injuries, and Hamas additionally kidnapped many Israeli civilians and soldiers. Following the attack, Israels\nsecurity cabinet declared war against Hamas and commenced a military campaign against Hamas and other terrorist organizations in parallel to their continued rocket and\nterror attacks. Since the commencement of hostilities, Tat technologies has experienced a considerable increased demand for our merchandise from the Israel Ministry Of\nDefense (IMOD) compared to the routine levels of demands, and we have increased our support to the IMOD, mainly through deliveries of our systems and dedicated\nefforts of our employees. Subject to further developments, this demand may continue and possibly generate material orders to the Company. At the same time, the\nCompany continues to support its international customers. The extent of the effects of the war on the Company's performance will depend on future developments that are\ndifficult to predict at this time, including the duration and scope of the war. We continue to monitor the situation closely Following the attack by Hamas on Israels\nsouthern border, Hezbollah in Lebanon has also launched missile, rocket, and shooting attacks against Israeli military sites, troops, and Israeli towns in northern Israel. In\nresponse to these attacks, the Israeli army has carried out a number of targeted strikes on sites belonging to Hezbollah in southern Lebanon.\nThe intensity and duration of Israels current war against Hamas is difficult to predict, as are such wars economic implications on our business and operations and on\nIsrael's economy in general.\nF- 13\nTAT TECHNOLOGIES LTD. AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nU.S. dollars in thousands\nNOTE 1 - GENERAL (CONT)\ne. TAT has the following wholly owned subsidiaries: Limco-Piedmont Inc. (Limco-Piedmont), and Turbochrome Ltd. (Turbochrome). Additionally, the Company holds\n51% of TAT-Engineering LLC (TAT-Engineering) as a joint venture, hereinafter collectively referred to as the Group.\nOn November 25, 2015, the Company signed an agreement with Russian-based Engineering Holding of Moscow (Engineering), to establish a new facility for the\nprovision of services for heat transfer products. The Company, TAT-Engineering LLC, is based in Novosibirsks Tolmachevo airport. TAT-Engineering, LLC shall provide\nservices for heat transfer products. 51% of TAT-Engineering LLC's shares are held by TAT and the remaining 49% are held by Engineering. The accounting treatment of\nthe joint venture is based on the equity method due to variable participating rights granted to Engineering. The new entity was established in January 2016.\nNOTE 2 - SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\na. Basis of Presentation\nThe Group's financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (\"U.S. GAAP\").\nb. Use of estimates in the preparation of financial statement\nThe preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported\namounts of assets and liabilities and disclose the nature of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues\nand expenses during the reporting years. Actual results could differ from those estimates.\nAs applicable to these financial statements, the most significant estimates and assumptions relate to: recoverability of inventory, provision for current expected credit\nloss, and income taxes.\nF- 14\nTAT TECHNOLOGIES LTD. AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nU.S. dollars in thousands\nNOTE 2 - SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONT)\nc. Functional currency\nThe majority revenues of the company and subsidiaries are generated in U.S. dollars (\"dollars\") and a substantial portion of the costs of the company and each\nsubsidiary in the Group are incurred in dollars. Accordingly, the dollar is the currency of the primary economic environment in which the Group operates and\naccordingly its functional and reporting currency is the dollar.\nTransactions and balances originally denominated in dollars are presented at their original amounts. Balances in currencies other than the U.S. dollar are translated into\ndollars using historical and current exchange rates for non-monetary and monetary balances, respectively. For non-dollar transactions and other items in the statements\nof income (indicated below), the following exchange rates are used: (i) for transactions  exchange rates at transaction dates or average rates; and (ii) for other items\n(derived from non-monetary balance sheet items such as depreciation and amortization, etc.)  historical exchange rates. Currency transaction gains and losses are\ncarried to other financial income (expenses), net, as appropriate.\nd. Principles of consolidation\nThe consolidated financial statements include the accounts of TAT and its subsidiaries.\nIntercompany balances and transactions, including profits from intercompany sales not yet realized outside the Group, have been eliminated upon consolidation.\ne. Cash and Cash equivalents\nAll highly liquid investments, which include short-term bank deposits, that are not restricted as to withdrawal or use. The period to maturity of which do not exceed\nthree months at the time of investment, are considered to be cash equivalents.\nRestricted Deposit\nRestricted deposit consists primarily of bank deposits to secure obligations under our state loan and a letter of credit to a supplier. Restricted deposit is presented at cost,\nincluding accrued interest, and is classified based on the duration of the restriction.The following table provides a reconciliation of cash and cash equivalents and\nrestricted deposit reported on the balance sheets that sum to the total of the same amounts shown on the statement of cash flows:\n2023 2022\nCash and cash equivalents $ 15,979 $ 7,722\nRestricted deposit short term 661 -\nRestricted deposit long term 302 304\nTotal cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash equivalents $ 16,942 $ 8,026\nF- 15\nTAT TECHNOLOGIES LTD. AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nU.S. dollars in thousands\nNOTE 2 - SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONT)\nf. Accounts receivable, net\nThe Groups accounts receivable balances are due from customers primarily in the airline and defense industries. Credit is extended based on evaluation of a customers\nfinancial condition and generally, collateral is not required. Trade accounts receivable from sales of services and products are typically due from customers within 30 -\n90 days. Trade accounts receivable balances are stated at amounts due from customers net of a provision for current expected losses.\nAccounts receivable have been reduced by an allowance for current expected losses. The Company maintains the allowance for estimated losses resulting from the\ninability of the Companys customers to make required payments. The allowance represents the current estimate of lifetime expected credit losses over the remaining\nduration of existing accounts receivable considering current market conditions and supportable forecasts when appropriate. The estimate is a result of the Companys\nongoing evaluation of collectability, customer creditworthiness, historical levels of credit losses, and future expectations.\nWrite-off activity and recoveries for the periods presented were not material (see note 22).\ng. Inventory\nInventory is measured at the lower of cost and net realizable value.\nInventories include raw materials, parts, work in progress and finished products.\nCost of raw material and parts is determined using the moving average basis. Cost of work in progress and finished products is calculated based on actual costs.\nCapitalized production costs components, mainly labor and overhead, are determined on average basis over the production period.\nSince the Group sells products and services related to airplane accessories for airplanes that can be in service for 20 to 50 years, it must keep a supply of such products\nand parts on hand while the airplanes are in use. The Group writes down its inventory for estimated obsolescence and unmarketable inventory equal to the difference\nbetween the cost of inventory and net realizable value, which includes costs to sell based upon assumptions for future demand and market conditions.\nIf actual market prices are less favorable than those projected by management, inventory write-downs may be required. When inventory is written down, a new lower\ncost basis for that inventory is established.\nF- 16\nTAT TECHNOLOGIES LTD. AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nU.S. dollars in thousands\nNOTE 2 - SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONT)\nh. Property, plant and equipment\nProperty, plant and equipment are stated at cost, after deduction of the related investment grants, net of accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is calculated using the\nstraight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, as follows:\nYears\nBuildings 25  39\nLeasehold improvements 3 - 20\nMachinery and equipment 15 - 20\nMotor vehicles 7\nOffice furniture and equipment 3 - 5\nInternal use software 7\nLeasehold improvements are amortized using the straight-line method over the period of the lease contract, or the estimated useful life of the asset, whichever is shorter\nCapitalized Software Costs\nThe Company accounts for its costs to develop software for internal use accordance with Accounting Standards (ASC) 350-40, Internal use Software. These costs are\ndirectly attributable to the development and implementation of a new ERP and supply chain software. The Company capitalizes the costs incurred during the\ndevelopment stage. Capitalized costs include software design, configuration, interfaces, coding, installation and testing, payroll, payroll-related expenses and external\ndirect costs, which are directly associated with creating and enhancing internal use software Capitalization of such costs begins when the preliminary project stage is\ncomplete and ceases at the point in which the project is substantially complete and is ready for its intended purpose.\nCapitalized software costs are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful life.\nWe evaluate the useful lives of these assets on an annual basis and test for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances occur that could impact the\nrecoverability of these assets. Refer to Note 6 for further information.\nCapitalized software costs are included in property, plant and equipment, net in the consolidated balance sheet.\ni. Government grants:\nGrants received from the IIA for approved research and development projects are recognized at the time the Company is reasonably assured that it will be entitled to\nsuch grants, on the basis of the costs incurred and included as a deduction from research and development expenses. Due to the fact that the Company is defined as a\n\"Traditional Industry Company\", under the IIA regulations, the grants are non-royalty bearing.\nGovernment grants relating to the purchase of property, plant and equipment (refer to note 11) are presented in the statement of financial position as a deduction to the\ncarrying amount of the asset and they are credited to profit or loss on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the related assets.\nGrants received according to the ERC and PPP plan launched by the US Government are recognized at the time the Company is reasonably assured that it will be\nentitled to such grants, on the basis of the costs incurred and included as a deduction from cost of revenues and operational expenses, as applicable.\nj. Investment in affiliates and share in results of equity investment of affiliated companies\nInvestment in which the Group exercises significant influence and which is not considered a subsidiary (\"affiliate\") is accounted for using the equity method, whereby\nthe Group recognizes its proportionate share of the affiliated Company's net income or loss after the date of investment. See Note 5.\nThe Group reviews those investments for impairment whenever events indicate the carrying amount may not be recoverable.\nOn consolidation, transactions between the Group and the affiliate are eliminated in the amount which related to the Group's proportionate share of the affiliate.\nF- 17\nTAT TECHNOLOGIES LTD. AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nU.S. dollars in thousands\nNOTE 2 - SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONT)\nk. Leases\nThe Company determines if an arrangement is a lease at inception. Balances related to operating leases are included in operating lease right-of-use (ROU) assets and\noperating lease liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets.\nROU assets represent the Companys right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent the Companys obligation to make lease payments\narising from the lease. Operating lease ROU assets are recognized as the lease liability, adjusted for lease incentives received and prepayments made. Lease liabilities\nare recognized at the present value of the future lease payments at the lease commencement date. On the commencement date, lease payments that include variable\nlease payments dependent on an index or a rate (such as the Consumer Price Index or a market interest rate), are initially measured using the index or rate at the\ncommencement date. The Companys lease terms may include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that the Company will exercise that\noption. The discount rate for the lease is the rate implicit in the lease unless that rate cannot be readily determined. As the Companys leases do not provide an implicit\nrate, the Companys uses its estimated incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at the commencement date in determining the present value of\nlease payments. Lease expense for lease payments is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term (see also note 2aa).\nIncome from Leasing Transactions under ASC 842\nThe Company accounts for certain leasing revenues in accordance with ASC 842, which qualify for operating lease treatment. For operating leases in which the\nCompany is the lessor, lease payments are recognized as leasing revenue over the lease term on a straight-line basis. APUs engines subject to operating leases are\nclassified as property, plant, and equipment and depreciated over the useful life, see Note 7.\nl. Identified intangible assets\nIdentifiable intangible assets are comprised of definite lived intangible assets  commercial license which are amortized over 10 years respectively, using the straight-\nline method over their estimated period of useful life as determined by identifying the period in which substantially all of the cash flows are expected to be generated.\nThe amortization of the commercial license is recorded in the cost of sales.\nm. Impairment of long-lived assets\nLong-lived assets, including property, plant and equipment, operating lease right of use assets and definite life intangible assets are reviewed for impairment whenever\nevents or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets (or asset group) may not be recoverable. In the event that the sum of the expected\nfuture cash flows (undiscounted and without interest charges) of the long-lived assets (or asset group) is less than the carrying amount of such assets, an impairment\ncharge would be recognized and the assets (or asset group) would be written down to their estimated fair values (see also Notes 6,7 and 8).\nF- 18\nTAT TECHNOLOGIES LTD. AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nU.S. dollars in thousands\nNOTE 2 - SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONT)\nn. Treasury Shares\nCompany shares held by the Company are presented as a reduction of equity at their cost to the Company. The treasury shares have no rights.\no. Revenue Recognition\nThe Group generates its revenues from the sale of OEM products and systems, providing MRO services (remanufacture, maintenance, repair and overhaul services and\nlong - term service contracts) and parts sales.\nA contract with a customer exists only when: the parties to the contract have approved it and are committed to perform their respective obligations, the Company can\nidentify each partys rights regarding the distinct goods or services to be transferred (performance obligations), the Company can determine the transaction price for\nthe goods or services to be transferred, the contract has commercial substance and it is probable that the Company will collect the consideration to which it will be\nentitled in exchange for the goods or services that will be transferred to the customer.\nRevenues are recorded in the amount of consideration to which the Company expects to be entitled in exchange for performance obligations upon transfer of control to\nthe customer, excluding amounts collected on behalf of other third parties and sales taxes.\nTo determine revenue recognition for arrangements that an entity determines are within the scope of Topic 606, the entity performs the following five steps: (i) identify\nthe contract(s) with a customer; (ii) identify the performance obligations in the contract; (iii) determine the transaction price; (iv) allocate the transaction price to the\nperformance obligations in the contract; and (v) recognize revenue when (or as) the performance obligation is satisfied.\nF- 19\nTAT TECHNOLOGIES LTD. AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nU.S. dollars in thousands\nNOTE 2 - SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONT)\nRevenue recognition (cont.)\nThe Company has adopted the following exemptions and accounting policies:\na. The Company has chosen to account for shipping as a fulfillment costs, in cases in which the shipping occurs after the customer has obtained control of a good.\nb. The Company has chosen not to adjust the promised amount of consideration for the effects of a significant financing component, in cases in which the Company\nexpects, at contract inception, that the period between when the Company transfers a promised good or service to the customer and when the customer pays for that\ngood or service will be one year or less.\nc. Revenues from the sale of OEM products is recognized at a point in time when the customer obtains control of the product, typically upon shipment. Invoices are\nissued based on the customer's approved PO and payment terms are due net 30 to net 90 from invoice date.\nRevenues from the sale of MRO services is recognized upon meeting all revenue recognition criteria, which involve receiving customers' purchase orders, completing\nthe service, and fulfilling inspection quality assurance obligations at the company's production site. Payment are due upon net 30 to net 45 from invoice date.\nContract liabilities\nContract liabilities are mainly comprised of deferred revenues which are included under accrued expenses and other.\nF- 20\nTAT TECHNOLOGIES LTD. AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nU.S. dollars in thousands\nNOTE 2 - SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONT)\np. Warranty costs\nThe Group provides warranties for its products and services ranging from one to three years, which vary with respect to each contract and in accordance with the nature\nof each specific product. According to Company's experience, most of the warranty costs incur during the first year of the contract.\nThe Group estimates the costs that may be incurred under its warranty and records a liability in the amount of such costs at the time revenue is recognized under\naccrued expenses on the Companys balance sheet. The Group periodically assesses the adequacy of its recorded warranty liabilities and adjusts the amounts as\nnecessary.\nq. Research and development\nResearch and development costs, net of grants, are charged to expenses as incurred and consist primarily of personnel and related expenses for research and\ndevelopment activities.\nr. Fair value measurement\nThe Group measures fair value and discloses fair value measurements for financial assets and liabilities. Fair value is based on the price that would be received to sell\nan asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.\nThe accounting standard establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes observable and unobservable inputs used to measure fair value into three broad levels, which\nare described below:\nLevel 1: Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets that are accessible at the measurement date for identical assets or liabilities. The fair value hierarchy gives the\nhighest priority to Level 1 inputs.\nLevel 2: Observable prices that are based on inputs not quoted on active markets, but corroborated by market data or active market data for similar but not identical\nassets or liabilities.\nF- 21\nTAT TECHNOLOGIES LTD. AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nU.S. dollars in thousands\nNOTE 2 - SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONT)\nr. Fair value measurement (cont.)\nLevel 3: Unobservable inputs are used when little or no market data is available. The fair value hierarchy gives the lowest priority to Level 3 inputs.\nIn determining fair value, the Group utilizes valuation techniques that maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs to the extent\npossible and considers credit risk in its assessment of fair value.\ns. Concentrations of credit risk\nFinancial instruments that potentially subject the Group to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash and cash equivalents, derivatives and accounts\nreceivable.\nCash and cash equivalents are deposited with several major banks in Israel and the United States. Such deposits in the United States may be in excess of insured limits\nand are not insured in other jurisdictions. Management believes that the financial institutions that hold the Group's cash and cash equivalents are financially sound, and\nthat the Group has not been effected by the recent turmoil in certain banking institutions in the United States. Accordingly, minimal credit risk exists with respect to\nthese financial instruments.\nThe Group's accounts receivable are derived mainly from sales to customers in the United States, Israel and Europe. The Group generally does not require collateral;\nhowever, in certain circumstances the Group may require letters of credit. Management believes that credit risks relating to accounts receivable are minimal since the\nmajority of the Group's customers are world-leading manufacturers of aviation systems and aircrafts, international airlines, governments and air-forces, and world-\nleading manufacturers and integrators of defense and ground systems. In addition, the Group has relatively a large number of customers with wide geographic spread\nwhich mitigates the credit risk. The Group performs ongoing credit evaluation of its customers' financial condition. As part of the risk management, the Company\npurchased a credit insurance policy from a well-known insurance Company. As of December 31, 2023 the Company has a single customer which represents 17.5% of\nthe Company's accounts receivable. As of December 2022, no individual customer represented 10% or more of the Company's accounts receivable.\nt. Income taxes\nIncome taxes are accounted for in accordance with ASC 740 \"Income Taxes\". This statement prescribes the use of the asset and liability method, whereby deferred tax\nassets and liabilities account balances are determined based on temporary differences between financial reporting and tax basis of assets and liabilities and for tax loss\ncarry-forwards. Deferred taxes are measured using the enacted laws and tax rates that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse. The Group provides\na valuation allowance, if it is more likely than not that a portion of the deferred income tax assets will not be realized, see Note 19(h).\nTaxes which would apply in the event of disposal of investments in domestic and foreign subsidiaries have not been taken into account in computing the deferred taxes,\nwhen the Groups intention is to hold, and not to realize the investments.\nF- 22\nTAT TECHNOLOGIES LTD. AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nU.S. dollars in thousands\nNOTE 2 - SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONT)\nt. Income taxes (cont.)\nThe Group did not provide for deferred taxes attributable to dividend distribution out of retained tax-exempt earnings from \"Approved/Benefited Enterprise\" plans (see\nNote 19(a)), since it intends to permanently reinvest them and has no intention to declare dividends out of such tax-exempt income in the foreseeable future.\nManagement considers such retained earnings to be essentially permanent in duration.\nResults for tax purposes for TATs Israeli subsidiaries are measured and reflected in NIS.\nAs explained in (c) above, the consolidated financial statements are measured and presented in U.S. dollars. In accordance with ASC 740, TAT has not provided\ndeferred income taxes on the differences resulting from changes in exchange rate and indexation.\nThe Group follows a two-step approach to recognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions. The first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by\ndetermining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit. The second step is to measure the tax\nbenefit as the largest amount that is more than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate resolution. The Groups policy is to include interest and penalties related to\nunrecognized tax benefits within financial income (expense). Such liabilities are classified as long-term, unless the liability is expected to be resolved within twelve\nmonths from the balance sheet date.\nu. Earnings per share\nBasic earnings (loss) per share are computed by dividing net income (loss) by the weighted average number of shares of the Company's Ordinary Shares, par value NIS\n0.9 per share outstanding for each period, net of treasury shares.\nDiluted earnings (loss) per share are calculated by dividing the net income by the fully-diluted weighted-average number of ordinary shares outstanding during each\nperiod. Potentially dilutive shares include outstanding options granted to employees and directors, using the treasury stock method.\nv. Share-based compensation\nThe Group applies ASC 718 \"Stock Based Compensation\" with respect to employees and directors options, which requires awards classified as equity awards to be\naccounted for using the grant-date fair value method. The fair value of share-based awards is estimated using the Black-Scholes valuation model, the payment\ntransaction is recognized as expense over the requisite service period, net of estimated forfeitures. The Company estimates forfeitures based on historical experience\nand anticipated future conditions.\nThe Group recognizes compensation cost for an award with only service conditions that has a graded vesting schedule using the accelerated method over the requisite\nservice period.\nF- 23\nTAT TECHNOLOGIES LTD. AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nU.S. dollars in thousands\nNOTE 2 - SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONT)\nw. Comprehensive income (loss)\nComprehensive income in 2023, 2022 and 2021 includes, in addition to net income or loss, gains and losses of derivatives designated for cash flow hedge accounting\n(net of related taxes where applicable).\nReclassification adjustments for gain or loss of derivatives are included in the relevant line item in the statement of income. See also Note 2 (aa).\nx. Contingencies\nCertain conditions may exist as of the date the financial statements are issued, which may result in a loss to the Group but which will only be resolved when one or\nmore future events occur or fail to occur. The Groups management assesses such contingent liabilities and estimated legal fees. Such assessment inherently involves an\nexercise of judgment. In assessing loss contingencies related to legal proceedings that are pending against the Group or unasserted claims that may result in such\nproceedings, the Groups management evaluates the perceived merits of any legal proceedings or unasserted claims as well as the perceived merits of the amount of\nrelief sought or expected to be sought.\nManagement applies the guidance in ASC 450-20-25 when assessing losses resulting from contingencies. If the assessment of a contingency indicates that it is probable\nthat a material loss has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be estimated, then the estimated liability is recorded as accrued expenses in the Companys\nfinancial statements. If the assessment indicates that a potential material loss contingency is not probable but is reasonably possible, or is probable but cannot be\nestimated, then the nature of the contingent liability, together with an estimate of the range of possible loss if determinable and material are disclosed.\nLoss contingencies considered to be remote by management are generally not disclosed unless they involve guarantees, in which case the guarantee would be disclosed.\ny. Derivatives and hedging\nThe Company carries out transactions involving foreign currency exchange derivative financial instruments. The transactions are designed to hedge the Companys\nexposure in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Derivatives are recognized at fair value as either assets or liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets in accordance\nwith ASC Topic 815, Derivatives and Hedging.\nFor derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as a cash-flow hedge, the gain or loss on the derivative instrument is reported as a component of other\ncomprehensive income and reclassified into earnings in the same line item associated with the anticipated transaction in the same period or periods during which the\nhedged transaction affects earnings.\nFor derivative instruments that qualify for hedge accounting, the cash flows associated with these derivatives are reported in the consolidated statements of cash flows\nconsistently with the classification of the cash flows from the underlying hedged items that these derivatives are hedging.\nThe effective portion and the ineffective portion of the gain or loss on the hedging instrument is recognized as other comprehensive income (loss).\nThe effective portion is determined by looking into changes in spot exchange rate.\nThe change in fair value attributable to changes other than those due to fluctuations in the spot exchange rate are excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness\nand are recognized in the statement of income under financial expenses-net.\nF- 24\nTAT TECHNOLOGIES LTD.

Restructuring Costs\nRestructuring costs have been recorded in connection with TATs restructuring plan announced in March 2021. Following this decision and in anticipation of ongoing\nefficiency measures in our business, TATs management has made estimates and judgments regarding future plans, mainly related to employee termination benefit\ncosts. Management also assesses the recoverability of long-lived assets employed in the business. In certain instances, asset lives have been shortened based on changes\nin the estimated useful lives of the affected assets. Asset-related impairments and employee's severance and other related costs are reflected within asset impairments of\nfixed assets, provision for restructuring plan and restructuring expenses.\naa. Recently Issued Accounting Principles:\nNew accounting pronouncements effective in future periods:\nIn December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures. The amended guidance enhances income tax\ndisclosures primarily related to the effective tax rate reconciliation and income taxes paid information. This guidance requires disclosure of specific categories in the\neffective tax rate reconciliation and further information on reconciling items meeting a quantitative threshold. In addition, the amended guidance requires\ndisaggregating income taxes paid (net of refunds received) by federal, state, and foreign taxes. It also requires disaggregating individual jurisdictions in which income\ntaxes paid (net of refunds received) is equal to or greater than 5 percent of total income taxes paid (net of refunds received). The amended guidance is effective for\nfiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024. The guidance can be applied either prospectively or retrospectively. We are evaluating the impact this amended\nguidance may have on the footnotes to our consolidated financial statements.\nIn November 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic 280):\nImprovements to Reportable Segment Disclosures. The amended guidance requires incremental reportable segment disclosures, primarily about significant segment\nexpenses. The amendments also require entities with a single reportable segment to provide all disclosures required by these amendments, and all existing segment\ndisclosures. The amendments will be applied retrospectively to all prior periods presented in the financial statements and is effective for fiscal years beginning after\nDecember 15, 2023, and interim periods in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024, with early adoption permitted.

Fair value is based on the price that would be received to sell an asset\nor paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.\nThe Company's financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis, consisted of the following types of instruments:\nDecember 31, 2023\nLevel 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total\nLiability (Accrued expenses and other):\n- $ (22) - $ (22)\nDecember 31, 2022\nLevel 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total\nLiability (Accrued expenses and other):\n- $ (31) - $ (31)\na. Derivative financial instruments:\nThe Company hedges the foreign currency risk arising from probable forecasted Israeli Shekel (\"ILS\") expenses as part of its risk management policy. The risk management\nobjective is to hedge the foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations associated with ILS denominated forecasted probable expenses according to the Company's hedging\npolicy. The majority of the ILS exposure arises from expected related salary expenses. The Company enters into contracts for derivative financial instruments forward\ncontracts in order to execute its policy. Such derivatives are recognized at fair value. The fair value of forward contracts is calculated as the difference between the forward\nrate on valuation date and the forward rate on the original forward contract, multiplied by the transaction's notional amount. At the inception of a hedge relationship, the\nCompany formally designates and documents the hedge relationship to which the Company wishes to apply hedge accounting and the risk management objective and strategy\nfor undertaking the hedge. The hedge effectiveness is assessed at the end of each reporting period.\nThe estimated net amount of existing gain (loss) that is reported in \"Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss)\" as of December 31, 2023 that is expected to be\nreclassified into earnings within the next 12 months is immaterial.\nF- 26\nTAT TECHNOLOGIES LTD.

Each capitalized term used and not defined shall have\nthe meaning set forth in Section VIII below.\nII. R E A C\n(1) In the event of an Accounting Restatement, the Company will reasonably promptly recover the Erroneously Awarded Compensation Received in accordance with\nthe applicable rules of Nasdaq (Nasdaq Rules) and Rule 10D-1 as follows:\n(i) After an Accounting Restatement, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors (the Committee) shall determine the amount of any\nErroneously Awarded Compensation Received by each Executive Officer, if any, and shall promptly notify each Executive Officer with a written notice containing the\namount of any Erroneously Awarded Compensation and a demand for repayment or return of such compensation, as applicable.\n(a) For Incentive-based Compensation based on (or derived from) the Companys share price or total shareholder return, where the amount of\nErroneously Awarded Compensation is not subject to mathematical recalculation directly from the information in the applicable Accounting Restatement:\n(x) The amount to be repaid or returned shall be determined by the Committee based on a reasonable estimate of the effect of the Accounting\nRestatement on the Companys share price or total shareholder return upon which the Incentive-based Compensation was Received; and\n(y) The Company shall maintain documentation of the determination of such reasonable estimate and provide the relevant documentation as\nrequired to the Nasdaq.\n(ii) The Committee shall have discretion to determine the appropriate means of recovering Erroneously Awarded Compensation based on the particular facts\nand circumstances, which may include, without limitation, reduction or cancellation by the Company or an affiliate of the Company of Incentive-Based Compensation or\nErroneously Awarded Compensation, reimbursement or repayment by any person subject to this Policy of the Erroneously Awarded Compensation, and, to the extent\npermitted by law, an offset of the Erroneously Awarded Compensation against other compensation payable by the Company or an affiliate of the Company to such person.\nNotwithstanding the foregoing, except as set forth in Subsection (2) below, in no event may the Company accept an amount that is less than the amount of Erroneously\nAwarded Compensation in satisfaction of an Executive Officers obligations hereunder.\n(iii) To the extent that the Executive Officer has already reimbursed the Company for any Erroneously Awarded Compensation Received under any\nduplicative recovery obligations established by the Company or applicable law, including, without limitation, the Companys Executive Compensation Policy adopted in\naccordance with Israeli law, it shall be appropriate for any such reimbursed amount to be credited to the amount of Erroneously Awarded Compensation that is subject to\nrecovery under this Policy.\n(iv) To the extent that an Executive Officer fails to repay all Erroneously Awarded Compensation to the Company when due, the Company shall take all\nactions reasonable and appropriate to recover such Erroneously Awarded Compensation from the applicable Executive Officer. The applicable Executive Officer shall be\nrequired to reimburse the Company for any and all expenses reasonably incurred (including reasonable legal fees) by the Company in recovering such Erroneously\nAwarded Compensation in accordance with the immediately preceding sentence.\n(2) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Company shall not be required to take the actions contemplated by Subsection (1) above if the Committee\ndetermines that recovery would be impracticable and any of the following three conditions are met:\n(i) The Committee has determined that the direct expenses paid to a third party to assist in enforcing the Policy would exceed the amount to be recovered.\nBefore making this determination, the Company must make a reasonable attempt to recover the Erroneously Awarded Compensation, documented such attempt(s) and\nprovided such documentation to the Nasdaq;\n(ii) Recovery would violate the Israeli law, provided that, before determining that it would be impracticable to recover any amount of Erroneously Awarded\nCompensation based on violation of the Israeli law, the Company has obtained an opinion of Israeli counsel, acceptable to Nasdaq, that recovery would result in such a\nviolation and a copy of the opinion is provided to Nasdaq; or\n(iii) Recovery would likely cause an otherwise tax-qualified retirement plan, under which benefits are broadly available to employees of the Company, to fail\nto meet the requirements of Section 401(a)(13) or Section 411(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and regulations thereunder.\n(3) Recovery shall be required in accordance with this Section II regardless of whether the applicable Executive Officer engaged in misconduct or otherwise caused or\ncontributed to the requirement for the Accounting Restatement and regardless of whether or when restated financial statements are filed by the Company.\n(4) For clarity, the recovery of Erroneously Awarded Compensation under this Policy will not give rise to any persons right to voluntarily terminate employment for\ngood reason, or due to a constructive termination (or any similar term of like effect) under any plan, program or policy of or agreement with the Company or any of its\naffiliates.\nIII. D R\nThe Company shall file all disclosures with respect to this Policy required by applicable U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filings and rules.\nIV. P I L\nThe Company shall not be permitted to insure or indemnify any Executive Officer against (i) the loss of any Erroneously Awarded Compensation that is repaid, returned or\nrecovered pursuant to the terms of this Policy, or (ii) any claims relating to the Companys enforcement of its rights under this Policy. None of the Company, an affiliate of the Company or\nany member of the Committee or the Board shall have any liability to any person as a result of actions taken under this Policy.\nFurther, the Company shall not enter into any agreement that exempts any Incentive-based Compensation that is granted, paid or awarded to an Executive Officer from the\napplication of this Policy or that waives the Companys right to recovery of any Erroneously Awarded Compensation, and this Policy shall supersede any such agreement (whether entered\ninto before, on or after the Effective Date of this Policy).\nV. A I\nThis Policy shall be administered by the Committee, and, subject to any permitted review by the Nasdaq pursuant to the Nasdaq Rules, any determinations made by the Committee\nshall be final and binding on all affected individuals. The Board may re-vest in itself the authority to administer, interpret and construe this Policy in accordance with applicable law, and in\nsuch event references herein to the Committee shall be deemed to be references to the Board.\nThe Committee is authorized to interpret and construe this Policy and to make all determinations necessary, appropriate, or advisable for the administration of this Policy and for the\nCompanys compliance with Nasdaq Rules, Section 10D, Rule 10D-1 and any other applicable law, regulation, rule or interpretation of the SEC or Nasdaq promulgated or issued in\nconnection therewith (the Applicable Rules). The Committee may delegate administrative duties with respect to this Policy to one or more directors or employees of the Company, as\npermitted under applicable law, including any Applicable Rules.\nThis Policy will be interpreted and applied in a manner that is consistent with the requirements of the Applicable Rules, and to the extent this Policy is inconsistent with such\nApplicable Rules, it shall be deemed amended to the minimum extent necessary to ensure compliance therewith.\nVI. A ; T\nThe Committee may amend this Policy from time to time in its discretion and shall amend this Policy as it deems necessary. Notwithstanding anything in this Section VI to the\ncontrary, no amendment or termination of this Policy shall be effective if such amendment or termination would (after taking into account any actions taken by the Company\ncontemporaneously with such amendment or termination) cause the Company to violate any federal securities laws, SEC rule, Nasdaq rule or Israeli law. This Policy will terminate\nautomatically when the Company does not have a class of securities listed on a national securities exchange or association in the United States.\nVII. O R R\nThis Policy shall be binding and enforceable against all Executive Officers and, to the extent required by applicable law or guidance from the SEC or Nasdaq, their beneficiaries,\nheirs, executors, administrators or other legal representatives. The Committee intends that this Policy will be applied to the fullest extent required by applicable law. Any employment\nagreement, equity award agreement, compensatory plan or any other agreement or arrangement with an Executive Officer shall be deemed to include, as a condition to the grant of any\nbenefit thereunder, an agreement by the Executive Officer to abide by the terms of this Policy. Any right of recovery under this Policy is in addition to, and not in lieu of, any other remedies\nor rights of recovery that may be available to the Company under applicable law, regulation or rule or pursuant to the terms of any policy of the Company, including, without limitation, the\nCompanys Executive Compensation Policy adopted in accordance with Israeli law, or any provision in any employment agreement, equity award agreement, compensatory plan, agreement\nor other arrangement.\nVIII. S\nThe provisions in this Policy are intended to be applied to the fullest extent of the law; provided, however, to the extent that any provision of this Policy is found to be\nunenforceable or invalid under any applicable law, such provision will be applied to the maximum extent permitted, and shall automatically be deemed amended in a manner consistent with\nits objectives to the extent necessary to conform to any limitations required under applicable law.\nIX. A\nEach Executive Officer shall sign an acknowledgment pursuant to which such Executive Officer will agree to be bound by the terms of, and comply with, this Policy; however, any\nExecutive Officers failure to sign any such acknowledgment shall not negate the application of this Policy to the Executive Officer.\nX. D\nFor purposes of this Policy, the following capitalized terms shall have the meanings set forth below.\n(1) Accounting Restatement means an accounting restatement to correct the material noncompliance of the Company with any financial reporting requirement\nunder the securities laws, including any required accounting restatement to correct an error in previously issued financial statements that is material to the previously issued\nfinancial statements (a Big R restatement), or that would result in a material misstatement if the error were corrected in the current period or left uncorrected in the current period\n(a little r restatement).\n(2) Clawback Eligible Incentive Compensation means all Incentive-based Compensation Received by an Executive Officer (i) on or after the effective date of the\napplicable Nasdaq rules, (ii) after beginning service as an Executive Officer, (iii) who served as an Executive Officer at any time during the applicable performance period relating\nto any Incentive-based Compensation (whether or not such Executive Officer is serving at the time the Erroneously Awarded Compensation is required to be repaid to the\nCompany), (iv) while the Company has a class of securities listed on a national securities exchange or a national securities association, and (v) during the applicable Clawback\nPeriod (as defined below).\n(3) Clawback Period means, with respect to any Accounting Restatement, the three completed fiscal years of the Company immediately preceding the Restatement\nDate (as defined below), and if the Company changes its fiscal year, any transition period of less than nine months within or immediately following those three completed fiscal\nyears.\n(4) Erroneously Awarded Compensation means, with respect to each Executive Officer in connection with an Accounting Restatement, the amount of Clawback\nEligible Incentive Compensation that exceeds the amount of Incentive-based Compensation that otherwise would have been Received based on a restated Financial Reporting\nMeasure had it been determined based on the restated amounts, determined on a pre-tax basis in accordance with the Applicable Rules.\n(5) Executive Officer means each individual who is currently or was previously designated as the Companys principal executive officer, principal financial officer\nor principal accounting officer, or was otherwise identified by the Company in Item 6.A of the Companys Annual Report on Form 20-F filed with the SEC as a member of the\nCompanys senior management (as defined in Form 20-F).\n(6) Financial Reporting Measures means measures that are determined and presented in accordance with the accounting principles used in preparing the\nCompanys financial statements, and all other measures that are derived wholly or in part from such measures.

The Company operates four operational units: (i) original equipment manufacturing (OEM) of heat transfer solutions and aviation accessories\nthrough its Kiryat Gat facility (TAT Israel); (ii) maintenance repair and overhaul (MRO) services for heat transfer components and OEM of heat transfer solutions through its Limco\nsubsidiary; (iii) MRO services for aviation components through its Piedmont subsidiary (mainly APU and LG); and (iv) overhaul and coating of jet engine components through its\nTurbochrome subsidiary.\nTAT targets the commercial aerospace (serving a wide range of types and sizes of commercial and business jets), military aerospace and ground defense sectors. TAT has a global\npresence with over 500 customers worldwide, including tier one players in their respective markets such as Boeing, Embraer, Lockheed Martin, Collins, Liebherr, Pratt & Whitney (a\ndivision of Collins), the U.S. Armed Forces, and service centers of airlines such as American Airlines, Lufthansa and others. TAT enjoys a strong reputation among its customers for quality\nand service-oriented approach.\nAs a leading provider in its market, TATs business is supported by an extensive number of certifications, including from the American, European, British and Chinese civil aviation\nauthorities, as well as leading manufactures such as Boeing and Honeywell International.\nTAT employed as of December 31, 2023 491 employees and operates in three locations: its facility in Kiryat Gat, Israel (TAT Israel and Turbochrome); Limco Airepair Inc.\n(Limco) in Tulsa, Oklahoma; Piedmont Aviation Component Services LLC (Piedmont) in Greensboro, North Carolina; the Company's Headquarters in Netanya Israel and a strategic\nsales office in Charlotte, North Carolina. In addition, the Company operates from its headquarters in Netanya Israel and from a strategic sales office in Charlotte, North Carolina.\nThrough TAT Israel, TAT is an OEM of a broad range of heat transfer solutions, air conditioning systems and other cooling systems used in mechanical and electronic systems on\nboard military and commercial aircraft as well as in ground systems. TAT Israel is also an OEM for a wide range of aviation accessories and provides limited MRO services for military and\ncommercial customers, mainly for aviation accessories. TAT Israel is a repair station certified by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA).\nThrough its Limco subsidiary, TAT provides MRO services for airlines, air cargo carriers, maintenance service centers and the military, primarily for heat transfer components.\nLimco is a repair station certified by the FAA and European Aviation Safety Agency (\"EASA\"). Limco is also an OEM of heat transfer solutions.\nThrough its Piedmont subsidiary, TAT provides MRO services for aviation components in the area of landing gears, APUs and Machining and Plating services (MPG). Piedmont\nhas a growing Trading and Leasing group that leases APUs (757, 767, 777, 737 and A320) and purchases and sells parts for the repair of APUs globally. Piedmont is an FAA-certified repair\nstation and provides its services to airlines, air cargo carriers, maintenance service centers and, to a lesser extent, the military.\nThrough its Turbochrome subsidiary, TAT provides MRO services in the area of jet engine overhaul, which includes the overhaul and coating of jet engine components such as\nturbine vanes and blades, fan blades, variable inlet guide vanes and afterburner flaps. Turbochrome is certified by the FAA and EASA.\nIn addition, TAT, through its Piedmont subsidiary, holds approximately 5% of the equity securities of First Aviation Services Inc.(FAvS).\nDuring the years 2020 and 2021 the COVID-19 pandemic had an adverse effect on our industry and the markets in which we operate. The COVID-19 outbreak has significantly\nimpacted the aviation market in which TATs customers operate and has resulted in a reduction of TATs business with some of these customers. Global supply shortages emerged for certain\nproducts, leading to delays in delivery schedule these effects still apply to a certain degree.\n1\nFurther to the actions taken by TATs management to reduce its expenses, including a reduction in its headcount as well as other cost savings measures due to the effect of\nCOVID-19 on the TAT's industry, TAT announced a restructuring plan in March 2021, which included the transfer of the Company's activity from its leased facility in Gedera to a facility in\nKiryat Gat, Israel which is leased by the Companys wholly-owned subsidiary Turbochrome from the Israel Land Authority (ILA) pursuant to a long-term lease agreement expiring in\n2045 (with no rental payments due to the ILA in respect of such lease), and to our partially owned facility in Tulsa, Oklahoma. These actions enable TAT to concentrate its heat exchanges\ncores activity in the United States allowing for better operational flow, getting closer to the Companys customer base, and cutting fixed costs. For more information about the Company's\nrestructuring plan please see note 9 to the company financial statements.\nMacroeconomic conditions, including inflation, rising interest rates and recessionary concerns, as well as ongoing labor cost pressures, transportation and shipping cost pressures\nhave had, and may continue to have, a negative impact on our business, financial condition, profitability, and cash flows. For instance, we were negatively impacted in fiscal 2022 and 2023\nby persistent cost pressures, including supply chain and labor costs. We expect inflationary cost pressures to continue in 2024 and we continue to closely monitor macroeconomic conditions,\nincluding customer behavior, and the impact of these factors on customer demand. Continuing or worsening inflation, recessionary concerns and/or supply chain and labor challenges may\nnegatively impact our business, financial condition, profitability, and/or cash flows.\nGeopolitical events, including the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine , the related economic sanctions by Western governments on Russia and the war and hostilities\nbetween Israel and Hamaas and Israel and Hezbollah, has caused greater uncertainty in the global economy and the inflation situation.\nTATs ordinary shares are publicly traded on the NASDAQ Global Market (NASDAQ) under the symbol TATT and on the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange (TASE) under the\nsymbol TAT Tech.

aerospace industry is highly regulated in the United States and elsewhere. To manufacture, sell and service parts used in aircrafts, TAT and its subsidiaries must be certified or\naccepted by the FAA, EASA, the United States Department of Defense and comparable agencies in other countries and by leading original equipment manufacturers (OEMs). If any of our\nmaterial certifications, authorizations or approvals are revoked or suspended, then the operations of TAT or its subsidiaries, as the case may be, will be significantly curtailed and TAT and its\nsubsidiaries could be subjected to significant fines and penalties. In the future, new and more demanding government regulations may be adopted or industry oversight may be increased.\nTAT and its subsidiaries may have to incur significant additional costs to achieve compliance with new regulations or to reacquire a revoked or suspended license or approval, which could\nmaterially reduce profitability.\n(cid:0)O(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)D(cid:0)S(cid:0)H(cid:0)D(cid:0)V(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)O(cid:0)L(cid:0)Q(cid:0)Q(cid:0)V(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)L(cid:0)H(cid:0)D(cid:0)H(cid:0)R(cid:0)P(cid:0)S(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)F(cid:0)O(cid:0)L(cid:0)V(cid:0)K(cid:0)G(cid:0)E(cid:0)V(cid:0)W(cid:0)D(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)H(cid:0)U(cid:0)I(cid:0)P(cid:0)Q(cid:0)H(cid:0)X(cid:0)R(cid:0)D(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)E(cid:0)W(cid:0)K(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)H(cid:0)L(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)Z(cid:0)S(cid:0)V(cid:0)W(cid:0)P(cid:0)H(cid:0)R(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)F(cid:0)7(cid:0)$(cid:0)7 (cid:0)U(cid:0)H(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)D(cid:0)H(cid:0)\\(cid:0)W(cid:0)J(cid:0)U(cid:0)Q(cid:0)L(cid:0)W(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)I(cid:0)O(cid:0)J(cid:0)D(cid:0)L(cid:0)F(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)Q(cid:0)H(cid:0)Y(cid:0)V(cid:0)L(cid:0)D(cid:0)K(cid:0)L(cid:0)F(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)K(cid:0)R(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)Z(cid:0)D(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)I(cid:0)K(cid:0)\\(cid:0)P(cid:0)Q(cid:0)(cid:15)(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)V(cid:0)V(cid:0)H(cid:0)V(cid:0)L(cid:0)Q(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)E(cid:0)V(cid:0)X(cid:0)¶(cid:0)7(cid:0)$(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)R(cid:0)W(cid:0)7(cid:0)V(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)I(cid:0)F (cid:0)(cid:17)(cid:0)7(cid:0)$(cid:0)Q(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)7(cid:0)K(cid:0)H(cid:0)D(cid:0)W(cid:0)L(cid:0)W(cid:0)V(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)L(cid:0)L(cid:0)O(cid:0)D(cid:0)S(cid:0)D(cid:0)E(cid:0)H(cid:0)U(cid:0)F(cid:0)V(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)R(cid:0)U(cid:0)V(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)F(cid:0)R(cid:0)X(cid:0)U(cid:0)H\nTATs major competitors in the area of OEM heat transfer solutions and aviation accessories, are other OEMs who manufacture heat transfer solutions. These include:\n(i) Manufacturers based in the United States, such as the Hughes-Treitler division of Ametek Inc., Boyd Corporation, Collins Aerospace, Honeywell International, and\nTriumph Thermal Systems;\n(ii) Manufacturers based in Europe such as HS Marston Aerospace Ltd., a subsidiary of Collins Aerospace, Secan and Liebherr-Aerospace Toulouse S.A.; and\n(iii) Manufacturers based in Asia such as Sumitomo Precision Products from Japan.\n5\nMany of TATs competitors are far larger, have substantially greater resources than TAT, including technical, financial, research and development, marketing and distribution\ncapabilities, and enjoy greater market recognition. These competitors may be able to achieve greater economies of scale and may be less vulnerable to price competition than TAT. In\naddition, some of those companies are considered to be tier one suppliers offering customers a wider range of systems and products, in addition to heat transfer solutions, as a bundle. TAT\nmay not be able to offer its products as part of integrated systems to the same extent as its competitors or successfully develop or introduce new products that are more cost effective or offer\nbetter performance than those of its competitors. Failure to do so could adversely affect TATs business, financial condition and results of operations.\nTATs major competitors in the area of MRO services for heat transfer components are the service divisions of OEMs, including Honeywell-Lori, Honeywell Secan, Honeywell\nSingapore, Collins Aerospace Malaysia, Collins Aerospace Maastricht, and Liebherr Aerospace Saline, in addition to the in-house maintenance services of various commercial airlines and\nother independent service providers, including Triumph Accessory Services, Drake Air  Ametek, American Cooler Service  Aviation Technical Services, Lufthansa Technik and Elite\nAerospace, a division of Meggitt.\nTATs major competitors in the area of MRO services for aviation components, landing gears and APUs, are the service divisions of OEMs, the in-house maintenance services of\nvarious commercial airlines and other independent service providers, including Standard Aero Group Inc., Aerotech International Inc., Honeywell International, AAR Corp., Safran,\nLiebherr, Turbine Aero, Hawker Pacific and APRO.\nTATs major competitors in the area of overhaul and coating of jet engine components are the service divisions of OEMs, the in-house maintenance services of various commercial\nairlines and other independent service providers, including Safran, General Electric, GKN, PAS MCT Japan and others. With respect to masking materials, TAT's major competitors are APV\nCoatings, Praxair, Saint-Gobain and others.\nCompetition in the MRO market is based on price, quality, engineering solutions, breadth of services, and the ability to perform repairs and overhauls rapidly. A number of our\ncompetitors have inherent competitive advantages. For example, we compete with the service divisions of large OEMs which are able to derive significant brand recognition from their\nOEM manufacturing activities.

These risks include the ability of the governmental authorities to unilaterally:\n Suspend TAT or any of its subsidiaries from receiving new contracts pending resolution of alleged violations of procurement laws or regulations;\n Terminate existing contracts, with or without cause, at any time;\n Condition the receipt of new contracts on conditions which are beyond the control of TAT;\n Reduce the value of existing contracts;\n Audit the contract-related costs and fees of TAT and its subsidiaries, including allocated indirect costs; and\n Control or prohibit the export of products of TAT and its subsidiaries.\nAlso, military and defense budget cuts may result in reduced demand for the products and manufacturing services of TAT and its subsidiaries.

Some of these suppliers are currently the sole source of one or more\ncomponents upon which TAT is dependent. For example, Honeywell International Inc. is a key supplier to TAT of APU spare parts and of certain other components used by TAT and its\nsubsidiaries for OEM activities and in the provision of MRO services. TAT's subsidiary, Piedmont, is a Honeywell licensed Authorized Repair Center for APUs under two separate\nagreements, for military and commercial applications. In September 2020 Piedmont signed a 10 years agreement with Honeywell for the commercial application. Under this contract\nPiedmont is an authorized MRO station under Honeywell's license.\nDuring June 2021 Piedmont has also signed a similar contract for the APU 331-500 serving the Boeing 777 aircraft.\nIn July 2021 Piedmont signed another contract granting Piedmont a 10-year MRO license for MRO of APU131 serving the Boeing 737 platform and AirBus A319-320-321\nplatform.\nAlso, Piedmont is a provider of services for the Safran and Liebherr landing gear systems (used on ATRs and Ejet platforms), and to do so, Piedmont is dependent on these OEMs\nto provide parts and engineering support.\nSuppliers of some of these components require TAT to place orders with significant lead time to assure supply in accordance with TATs requirements. A delay in the supply of\nthese components can significantly delay the delivery of our products and services. If TAT were to engage in a commercial dispute with or be unable to obtain adequate supplies of parts\nfrom these suppliers at commercially reasonable prices or required lead time, TAT could experience delays in manufacturing and its financial results could be adversely affected.

Due to such sanctions, our subsidiary Limco, has ceased selling its products to customers in Russia. While our business in Russia is of limited in scope, these\nrestrictions may cause a reduction of our sales and financial results.\n9\nDuring the years 2020 and 2021 the COVID-19 pandemic had an adverse effect on our industry and the markets in which we operate. The COVID-19 outbreak has significantly\nimpacted the aviation market in which TATs customers operate and has resulted in a reduction of TATs business with some of these customers. In order to mitigate the impact of the decline\nin business as a result of the pandemic, TAT implemented measures to reduce its expenses, including the Company's restructuring plan announced in March 2021, reduction in its headcount\nas well as other cost savings measures.

TAT may not be able to successfully identify suitable acquisition candidates, complete\nacquisitions, integrate the acquired businesses into its operations, or expand into new markets. The process of integrating an acquired business may be prolonged due to unforeseen\ndifficulties and may require a disproportionate amount of TATs resources, including management attention. Furthermore, once integrated, acquisitions may not achieve comparable levels of\nrevenues, profitability or productivity as TATs existing business or otherwise perform as expected. The occurrence of any of these events could harm TATs business, financial condition or\nresults of operations. Future acquisitions may require substantial capital resources, which may require TAT to seek additional debt or equity financing.\nFuture acquisitions by TAT could result in the following, any of which could materially harm TATs results of operations or the price of TATs ordinary shares:\n Issuance of equity securities that would dilute TATs shareholders percentages of ownership;\n Large one-time write-offs;\n The incurrence of debt and contingent liabilities;\n Difficulties in the assimilation and integration of operations, personnel, technologies, products and information systems of the acquired companies;\n Diversion of managements attention from other business activities and concerns;\n Contractual disputes;\n Risks of entering geographic and business markets in which TAT has no or only limited prior experience; and\n Potential loss of key employees of acquired organizations.\n(cid:0)V(cid:0)(cid:17)(cid:0)N(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)U(cid:0)L(cid:0)V(cid:0)Q(cid:0)V(cid:0)V(cid:0)H(cid:0)X(cid:0)V(cid:0)L(cid:0)H(cid:0)W(cid:0)E(cid:0)U(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)L(cid:0)H(cid:0)Q(cid:0)Q(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)U(cid:0)\\(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)F(cid:0)K(cid:0)U(cid:0)V(cid:0)D(cid:0)L(cid:0)S(cid:0)K(cid:0)R(cid:0)Q(cid:0)V(cid:0)D(cid:0)H(cid:0)W(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)U(cid:0)L(cid:0)Q(cid:0)O(cid:0)G(cid:0)L(cid:0)S(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)D(cid:0)K(cid:0)U(cid:0)W(cid:0)V(cid:0)Q(cid:0)U(cid:0)V(cid:0)H(cid:0)D(cid:0)F(cid:0)S(cid:0)J(cid:0)H(cid:0)V(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)W(cid:0)L(cid:0)U(cid:0)D(cid:0)U(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)W(cid:0)X(cid:0)2\nWe may participate in strategic partnerships and joint ventures in a number of countries. For example, in November 2015, we signed a joint venture agreement with Russian-based\nEngineering, to establish a new facility for the provision of MRO services for heat transfer components in Russia and the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS).\n10\nOur actions with respect to these affiliated companies may be restricted to some degree by shareholder agreements entered into with our strategic partners. Our business, financial\ncondition, results of operations and prospects may be materially harmed if disagreements develop with our partners. Our ability to withdraw funds and dividends from these entities may\ndepend on the consent of partners. If one of our strategic partners becomes subject to investigation, sanctions or liability, TAT might be adversely affected. Furthermore, strategic\npartnerships in emerging markets are accompanied by risks inherent to those markets, such as an increased probability of a partner defaulting on obligations or losing a partner with\nimportant insights in that region. Strategic partnerships in emerging markets are subject to greater risks than strategic partnerships in more developed markets, including significant political,\nlegal and economic risks and risks related to fluctuations in currencies. As a result of the current geopolitical tensions and conflict between Russia and Ukraine, and the invasion by Russia\nof Ukraine, the governments of the United States, EU, Japan and other jurisdictions have announced the imposition of sanctions on certain industry sectors and parties in Russia and certain\nimpacted regions, as well as enhanced export controls on certain products and industries. Due to such sanctions, during 2022 and 2023 our joint venture in Russia ceased to purchase heat-\nexchange cores from Limco, our US subsidiary, and therefore the joint venture had to materially limit the extent of the MRO services it provides to its customers.\n(cid:0)V(cid:0)R(cid:0)G(cid:0)X(cid:0)W(cid:0)(cid:17)(cid:0)U(cid:0)F(cid:0)(cid:10)(cid:0)7(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)S(cid:0)V(cid:0)$(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)R(cid:0)7(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)I(cid:0)Q(cid:0)H(cid:0)F(cid:0)W(cid:0)F(cid:0)D(cid:0)S(cid:0)D(cid:0)H(cid:0)F(cid:0)W(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)D(cid:0)H(cid:0)K(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)P(cid:0)U(cid:0)N(cid:0)H(cid:0)H(cid:0)W(cid:0)W(cid:0)I(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)F(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)D(cid:0)O(cid:0)I(cid:0)U(cid:0)\\(cid:0)V(cid:0)H(cid:0)H(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)D(cid:0)Y(cid:0)\\(cid:0)G(cid:0)V(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)D(cid:0)H(cid:0)Q(cid:0)P(cid:0)J(cid:0)K(cid:0)O(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)F(cid:0)D(cid:0)D(cid:0)L(cid:0)F(cid:0)J(cid:0)O(cid:0)R(cid:0)F(cid:0)Q(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)W(cid:0)H(cid:0)R(cid:0)K(cid:0)L(cid:0)G(cid:0)S(cid:0)5(cid:0)D\nThe aerospace and defense markets in which TAT competes are subject to technological changes, introduction of new products, changes in customer demands and evolving industry\nstandards.

Pursuant to these contracts, TAT realizes all the benefits or costs resulting from\nany increases or decreases in the cost of providing services and products to these customers. Several of TATs contracts do not allow TAT to recover for increases in raw material prices,\ntaxes or labor costs, while other contracts may permit, to a limited extent, periodic price adjustments. Any increase in these costs could increase the cost of operating our business and reduce\nour profitability. Factors such as inaccurate pricing and increases in the cost of labor, materials or overhead may result in cost over-runs and losses on those agreements. TAT may not\nsucceed in obtaining customer approval to re-price a particular product and may not be able to recoup previous losses resulting from incomplete or inaccurate engineering data. In addition,\nas costs increase, TAT may not be able to pass on such increased costs to other customers. This could materially impact TATs profitability.\n(cid:0)X(cid:0)O(cid:0)G(cid:0)R(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)F(cid:0)V(cid:0)R(cid:0)H(cid:0)H(cid:0)S(cid:0)\\(cid:0)P(cid:0)O(cid:0)H(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)N(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)I(cid:0)\\(cid:0)O(cid:0)H(cid:0)R(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)R(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)V(cid:0)V(cid:0)H(cid:0)W(cid:0)K(cid:0)(cid:30)(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)P(cid:0)V(cid:0)D(cid:0)W(cid:0)H(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)L(cid:0)U(cid:0)V(cid:0)W(cid:0)I(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)R(cid:0)P(cid:0)E(cid:0)H(cid:0)P(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)H(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)Q(cid:0)Z(cid:0)W(cid:0)H(cid:0)D(cid:0)H(cid:0)H(cid:0)L(cid:0)U(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)O(cid:0)Q(cid:0)\\(cid:0)J(cid:0)W(cid:0)I(cid:0)X(cid:0)V(cid:0)V(cid:0)O(cid:0)H(cid:0)X(cid:0)F(cid:0)H(cid:0)F(cid:0)H(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)R(cid:0)\\(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)V(cid:0)V(cid:0)U(cid:0)R(cid:0)S(cid:0)P(cid:0)O(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)H(cid:0)\\(cid:0)O(cid:0)W(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)N(cid:0)Q(cid:0)G(cid:0)D(cid:0)H(cid:0)L(cid:0)R(cid:0)G(cid:0)L(cid:0)Q(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)D(cid:0)D(cid:0)H(cid:0)L(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)U(cid:0)Q(cid:0)L(cid:0)W(cid:0)U(cid:0)G(cid:0)R(cid:0)K(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)D(cid:0)H(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)W(cid:0)D(cid:0)O(cid:0)H(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)E(cid:0)H(cid:0)D(cid:0)W(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)E(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)Q(cid:0)P(cid:0)\\(cid:0)R(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)L(cid:0)V(cid:0)W(cid:0)(cid:30)(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)H(cid:0)L(cid:0)Y(cid:0)X(cid:0)H(cid:0)F(cid:0)W(cid:0)H(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)\\(cid:0)[(cid:0)H(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)N(cid:0)Q(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)L(cid:0)W(cid:0)V(cid:0)G(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)R(cid:0)Q(cid:0)S(cid:0)V(cid:0)H(cid:0)H(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)G(cid:0)7(cid:0)$(cid:0)7\n(cid:0)V(cid:0)(cid:17)(cid:0)L(cid:0)Q(cid:0)V(cid:0)H(cid:0)X(cid:0)V(cid:0)V(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)E(cid:0)¶(cid:0)7(cid:0)$(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)7(cid:0)Q(cid:0)H(cid:0)W(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)R(cid:0)F(cid:0)I(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)U(cid:0)V(cid:0)H(cid:0)H(cid:0)I(cid:0)H(cid:0)O(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)D(cid:0)G(cid:0)Y(cid:0)U(cid:0)L(cid:0)W(cid:0)D(cid:0)H(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)D(cid:0)D(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)D(cid:0)P(cid:0)H(cid:0)Y(cid:0)K\nTATs success depends to a large extent on the experience and expertise of its senior management.

The adoption of new laws and regulations, stricter enforcement of existing laws and regulations, the discovery of previously unknown contamination or\nthe imposition of new cleanup requirements could require TAT to incur costs and become subject to new or increased liabilities that could increase TATs operating costs and adversely affect\nthe manner in which we conduct our business.\nUnder certain environmental laws, liability associated with an investigation or remediation of hazardous substances can arise from a broad range of properties, including properties\ncurrently or formerly operated by TAT or any of its predecessors, as well as properties to which TAT sent hazardous substances or wastes for treatment, storage, or disposal. Costs and other\nobligations can arise from claims for toxic torts, natural resource and other damages, as well as the investigation and clean-up of contamination at such properties. Under certain\nenvironmental laws, such liability may be imposed jointly and severally, so TAT may be responsible for more than its proportionate share and may even be responsible for the entire liability\nat issue. The extent of any such liability can be difficult to predict.\n(cid:0)V(cid:0)(cid:17)(cid:0)L(cid:0)P(cid:0)\\(cid:0)U(cid:0)O(cid:0)Q(cid:0)D(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)F(cid:0)D(cid:0)D(cid:0)W(cid:0)\\(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)Z(cid:0)U(cid:0)Q(cid:0)G(cid:0)O(cid:0)L(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)D(cid:0)W(cid:0)E(cid:0)L(cid:0)D(cid:0)L(cid:0)O(cid:0)G(cid:0)X(cid:0)W(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)F(cid:0)I(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)S(cid:0)R(cid:0)U(cid:0)P(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)U(cid:0)R(cid:0)J(cid:0)L(cid:0)Q(cid:0)U(cid:0)L(cid:0)V(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)D(cid:0)W(cid:0)V(cid:0)L(cid:0)D(cid:0)L(cid:0)H(cid:0)O(cid:0)L(cid:0)E(cid:0)O(cid:0)Q(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)O(cid:0)W(cid:0)L(cid:0)H(cid:0)W(cid:0)L(cid:0)D(cid:0)W(cid:0)R(cid:0)R(cid:0)G(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)S(cid:0)R(cid:0)S(cid:0)V(cid:0)H(cid:0)V(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)[(cid:0)H(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)L(cid:0)7(cid:0)$(cid:0)7\nTAT is exposed to potential liabilities for personal injury or death as a result of the failure of an aircraft component that was designed, manufactured, serviced or supplied by TAT.\nTAT believes that, in an effort to improve operating margins, some customers have delayed the replacement of parts beyond their recommended lifetime, which may undermine aircraft\nsafety and increase the risk of liability of TAT and its subsidiaries.\nIf any of our products are defective, we could be required to redesign or recall those products or pay substantial damages or warranty claims. Such an event could result in\nsignificant expenses, disrupt sales and damage our reputation and that of our products and services. There can be no assurance that TAT will not experience material product liability losses\nin the future, that it will not incur significant costs to defend such claims, that, although TAT maintains product liability insurance, its insurance coverage will be adequate if claims were to\narise or that it would be able to maintain insurance coverage in the future at an acceptable cost. A successful claim brought against TAT or its subsidiaries in excess of its available insurance\ncoverage may have a material adverse effect on TATs business.\nIn addition, contractual disputes over warranties can arise in the ordinary course of business. TAT may be subject to requests from customers for cost sharing or pricing adjustments\nas a part of their commercial relationships, even though the customers had previously agreed to bear these risks.\n12\n(cid:0)(cid:17)(cid:0)V(cid:0)V(cid:0)H(cid:0)Q(cid:0)L(cid:0)X(cid:0)V(cid:0)X(cid:0)U(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)E(cid:0)H(cid:0)R(cid:0)W(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)F(cid:0)I(cid:0)I(cid:0)V(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)D(cid:0)O(cid:0)U(cid:0)\\(cid:0)H(cid:0)H(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)D(cid:0)Y(cid:0)X(cid:0)O(cid:0)G(cid:0)G(cid:0)R(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)F(cid:0)W(cid:0)\\(cid:0)X(cid:0)L(cid:0)F(cid:0)U(cid:0)D(cid:0)D(cid:0)V(cid:0)H(cid:0)G(cid:0)W(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)X(cid:0)U(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)R(cid:0)V(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)I(cid:0)H(cid:0)R(cid:0)D(cid:0)V(cid:0)U(cid:0)H(cid:0)K(cid:0)P(cid:0)F(cid:0)R(cid:0)H(cid:0)E(cid:0)U(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)V(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)\\(cid:0)V(cid:0)W(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)R(cid:0)\\(cid:0)R(cid:0)K(cid:0)J(cid:0)F(cid:0)Q(cid:0)W(cid:0)H(cid:0)O(cid:0)L(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)D(cid:0)R(cid:0)Q(cid:0)U(cid:0)P(cid:0)W(cid:0)Q(cid:0)R(cid:0)R(cid:0)I(cid:0)I(cid:0)U(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)X(cid:0)R(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)L(cid:0)Q(cid:0)V(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)L(cid:0)L(cid:0)V(cid:0)R(cid:0)U(cid:0)S(cid:0)G(cid:0)D(cid:0)X(cid:0)L(cid:0)F(cid:0)W(cid:0)W(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)Q(cid:0)J(cid:0)Q(cid:0)L(cid:0)I(cid:0)6(cid:0)L\nOur operations depend on the continued and secure functioning of our computer and communications systems and the protection of information stored in computer databases\nmaintained by us, and in certain circumstances, by third parties.

Additionally, certain assets, as well as a portion of TATs liabilities, are denominated in NIS. Because exchange rates between the NIS and the dollar fluctuate continuously,\nexchange rate fluctuations, particularly larger periodic devaluations, may have an impact on TATs profitability and period to period comparisons of TATs results. TATs results may be\nadversely affected by the devaluation of the NIS in relation to the dollar (or if such devaluation is on a lagging basis), if TATs revenues in NIS are higher than TATs expenses in NIS and/\nor the value of TATs assets in NIS are higher than TATs liabilities in NIS. Alternatively, TATs results may be adversely affected by an appreciation of the NIS in relation to the dollar (or if\nsuch appreciation is on a lagging basis), if TATs expenses in NIS are higher than TATs revenues in NIS and/or TATs liabilities in NIS are higher than TATs assets in NIS. From time to\ntime, we enter into hedging transactions to attempt to limit the impact of foreign currency fluctuations. However, the protection provided by such hedging transactions may be partial and\nleave certain exchange rate-related losses and risks uncovered. Therefore, our business and profitability may be harmed by such exchange rate fluctuations.\nRisk Factors Related to Our Ordinary Shares\n(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)H(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)W(cid:0)L(cid:0)Q(cid:0)O(cid:0)D(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)L(cid:0)O(cid:0)R(cid:0)Y(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)E(cid:0)Q(cid:0)H(cid:0)V(cid:0)H(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)K(cid:0)H(cid:0)D(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)L(cid:0)F(cid:0)H(cid:0)K(cid:0)U(cid:0)U(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)V(cid:0)S(cid:0)D(cid:0)V(cid:0)¶(cid:0)7(cid:0)$(cid:0)7 (cid:0)(cid:17)(cid:0)H(cid:0)X(cid:0)U(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)I(cid:0)W(cid:0)X(cid:0)H(cid:0)Q(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)W(cid:0)K(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)H(cid:0)O(cid:0)L(cid:0)F(cid:0)Q(cid:0)L(cid:0)H(cid:0)\\(cid:0)G(cid:0)G(cid:0)D(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)P(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)Q(cid:0)D(cid:0)W(cid:0)D(cid:0)W(cid:0)K(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)S(cid:0)V(cid:0)H\nTATs ordinary shares have experienced significant market price and volume fluctuations in the past and may experience significant market price and volume fluctuations in the\nfuture, in response to factors such as the following, some of which are beyond TATs control:\n Quarterly variations in TATs operating results;\n Operating results that vary from the expectations of securities analysts and investors;\n Changes in expectations as to TATs future financial performance, including financial estimates by securities analysts and investors;\n Announcements of technological innovations or new products by TAT or TATs competitors;\n Announcements by TAT or TATs competitors of significant contracts, acquisitions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures or capital commitments;\n Announcements by third parties of significant claims or proceedings against us;\n Additions or departures of key personnel;\n Future sales of TATs ordinary shares by the Company (such as the issuance and sale in December 2023) or by our controlling shareholders or others;\n The effects of the war and hostilities between Israel and Hamas and Israel and Hezbollah;\n De-listing of TATs shares from NASDAQ and/or from the TASE;\n Stock market price and volume fluctuation;\n Legal proceedings against TAT or its controlling shareholders; and\n Regulatory actions by securities authorities which impacts TATs interaction with securities analysts and institutional investors.\n13\nEquity stock markets can undergo extreme price and volume fluctuations.

Any substantial sales of TATs shares in the public market may also impede our ability to sell equity or equity-related securities in the future at a\ntime, in a place and on terms TAT deems appropriate.\nRisks Relating to Our Location in Israel\n(cid:0)V(cid:0)D(cid:0)W(cid:0)D(cid:0)K(cid:0)+(cid:0)P(cid:0)Z(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)L(cid:0)O(cid:0)L(cid:0)W(cid:0)V(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)L(cid:0)H(cid:0)G(cid:0)Z(cid:0)V(cid:0)D(cid:0)W(cid:0)L(cid:0)D(cid:0)L(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)K(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)R(cid:0)U(cid:0)R(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)Q(cid:0)Q(cid:0)Q(cid:0)J(cid:0)H(cid:0)J(cid:0)J(cid:0)W(cid:0)K(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)R(cid:0)L(cid:0)X(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)G(cid:0)Q(cid:0)(cid:11)(cid:0)D(cid:0)L(cid:0)O(cid:0),(cid:0)Q(cid:0)O(cid:0)V(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)W(cid:0)U(cid:0)H(cid:0)L(cid:0)F(cid:0)F(cid:0)Q(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)I(cid:0)H(cid:0)J(cid:0)I(cid:0)Q(cid:0)V(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)D(cid:0)W(cid:0)L(cid:0)R(cid:0)G(cid:0)R(cid:0)Q(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)W(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)F(cid:0)L(cid:0)G(cid:0)R(cid:0)K(cid:0)U(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)D(cid:0)H(cid:0)L(cid:0)F(cid:0)P(cid:0)Q(cid:0)W(cid:0)L(cid:0)F(cid:0)Q(cid:0)R(cid:0)O(cid:0)(cid:15)(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)R(cid:0)O(cid:0)L(cid:0)F(cid:0)D(cid:0)W(cid:0)H(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)W(cid:0)F(cid:0)R(cid:0)S(cid:0)R(cid:0)M(cid:0)X(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)E(cid:0)H(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)V(cid:0)H(cid:0)\\(cid:0)E(cid:0)D(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)P(cid:0)7(cid:0)$(cid:0)O(cid:0)(cid:15)(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)H(cid:0)7(cid:0)U(cid:0)D(cid:0)L(cid:0)Q(cid:0),(cid:0)V(cid:0)V(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)R(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)U(cid:0)D(cid:0)R(cid:0)H(cid:0)Q(cid:0)W(cid:0)W(cid:0)L(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)S(cid:0)Q(cid:0)L(cid:0)J(cid:0)D(cid:0)L(cid:0)L(cid:0)F(cid:0)I(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)Q(cid:0)K(cid:0)7(cid:0)V(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)D(cid:0)V(cid:0)$(cid:0)X(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)7(cid:0)H(cid:0)D(cid:0)F(cid:0)V(cid:0)%(cid:0)H\n(cid:0)Q(cid:0)V(cid:0)V(cid:0)(cid:17)(cid:0)X(cid:0)H(cid:0)V(cid:0)L(cid:0)E(cid:0)V(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)7(cid:0)¶(cid:0)$(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)S(cid:0)W(cid:0)L(cid:0)7(cid:0)V(cid:0)U(cid:0)X(cid:0)G(cid:0)G(cid:0)V(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)D(cid:0)Q(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)H(cid:0)V(cid:0)H(cid:0)L(cid:0)Q(cid:0)S(cid:0)J(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)U(cid:0)Q(cid:0)[(cid:0)H(cid:0)W(cid:0)V(cid:0)S(cid:0)H(cid:0)D(cid:0)R(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)7(cid:0)¶(cid:0)$(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)7(cid:0)H(cid:0)D(cid:0)V(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)Q(cid:0)U(cid:0)H(cid:0)F(cid:0)O(cid:0)G(cid:0)R(cid:0)W(cid:0)F(cid:0)L(cid:0)X(cid:0)D(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)K(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)W(cid:0)K(cid:0)(cid:12)(cid:0)R(cid:0)O(cid:0)D(cid:0)E(cid:0)O(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)+(cid:0)Q(cid:0)](cid:0)G(cid:0)H(cid:0)D\nTAT is incorporated under the laws of the State of Israel. TATs executive offices, its research and development facilities and manufacturing plant are also located in Israel. As a\nresult, political, economic and military conditions affecting Israel directly influence TAT. Any major hostilities involving Israel, a full or partial mobilization of reserve forces of the Israeli\narmy, the interruption or curtailment of trade between Israel and its present trading partners, or a significant downturn in the economic or financial condition of Israel could have a material\nadverse effect on TATs business, financial condition and results of operations.\nSince its establishment in 1948, Israel and its Arab neighbors have engaged in a number of armed conflicts. A state of hostility, varying from time to time in intensity and degree,\nhas led to security and economic challenges for Israel. Major hostilities between Israel and its neighbors may hinder Israels international trade and lead to economic downturn. This, in turn,\ncould have a material adverse effect on TATs operations and business.\nIn October 2023, Hamas terrorists infiltrated Israels southern border from the Gaza Strip and conducted a series of attacks on civilian and military targets. Hamas also launched\nextensive rocket attacks on Israeli population and industrial centers located along Israels border with the Gaza Strip and in other areas within the State of Israel. These attacks resulted in\nextensive deaths, injuries and kidnapping of civilians and soldiers. Following the attack, Israels security cabinet declared war against Hamas and a military campaign against these terrorist\norganizations commenced in parallel to their continued rocket and terror attacks.\nFollowing the attack by Hamas on Israels southern border, Hezbollah in Lebanon has also launched missile, rocket, and shooting attacks against Israeli military sites, troops, and\nIsraeli towns in northern Israel. In response to these attacks, the Israeli army has carried out a number of targeted strikes on sites belonging to Hezbollah in southern Lebanon.\nIn addition, Israel faces threats from more distant neighbors, in particular, Iran which has threatened to attack Israel, may be developing nuclear weapons and has targeted cyber-\nattacks against Israeli entities, and terrorist groups in Yemen, which are threatening to limit the movement of marine shipments to Israel through the Red Sea.\n14\nCurrently TATs continues its business and operations but the intensity and duration of Israels current war against Hamas is difficult to predict, as are such wars economic\nimplications on our business and operations and on Israel's economy in general.\nFurthermore, there are a number of countries, primarily Arab and Muslim countries, that restrict or frown upon business with Israel or Israeli companies, and TAT is precluded from\nmarketing its products to these countries. Restrictive laws or policies directed towards Israel or Israeli companies may have an adverse impact on TATs operations, TATs financial results or\nthe expansion of TATs business.\n(cid:0)(cid:17)(cid:0)H(cid:0)F(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)\\(cid:0)U(cid:0)Y(cid:0)V(cid:0)W(cid:0)H(cid:0)U(cid:0)L(cid:0)P(cid:0)D(cid:0)L(cid:0)O(cid:0)L(cid:0)U(cid:0)I(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)P(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)R(cid:0)U(cid:0)W(cid:0)R(cid:0)H(cid:0)R(cid:0)O(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)U(cid:0)H(cid:0)S(cid:0)W(cid:0)V(cid:0)Q(cid:0)V(cid:0)H(cid:0)Q(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)R(cid:0)S(cid:0)R(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)L(cid:0)I(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)Q(cid:0)J(cid:0)W(cid:0)L(cid:0)O(cid:0)D(cid:0)E(cid:0)L(cid:0)H(cid:0)R(cid:0)E(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)W(cid:0)K(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)\\(cid:0)G(cid:0)W(cid:0)H(cid:0)F(cid:0)H(cid:0)I(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)D(cid:0)O(cid:0)\\(cid:0)I(cid:0)D(cid:0)W(cid:0)H(cid:0)L(cid:0)Y(cid:0)Q(cid:0)J(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)H(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)H(cid:0)V(cid:0)D(cid:0)\\(cid:0)R(cid:0)E(cid:0)U(cid:0)P(cid:0)D(cid:0)H(cid:0)Q(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)W(cid:0)L(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)S(cid:0)R(cid:0)W(cid:0)R(cid:0)V(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)I(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)U(cid:0)V(cid:0)X(cid:0)V(cid:0)H(cid:0)O(cid:0)¶(cid:0)7(cid:0)$(cid:0)7\nMany of TATs employees and some of TATs directors and senior management based in Israel are obligated to perform annual reserve duty in the Israel Defense Forces (IDF)\nand may be called for active duty under emergency circumstances at any time. If a military conflict or war arises, these individuals could be required to serve in the military for extended\nperiods of time. TATs operations could be disrupted by the absence of one or more of its senior management, key employees or a significant number of other employees for a significant\nperiod due to military service. Any such disruption in TATs operations could adversely affect TATs business. Since October 7, 2023, the Israel Defense Force (IDF) has called up more than\n350,000 of its reserve forces to serve. A significant number of our management and non-management employees are currently subject to military service in the IDF and many of them have\nbeen called to serve. In addition, the family members of many of our Israeli team members are currently serving in the IDF. Such disruption could materially and adversely affect our\nbusiness, prospects, financial condition, and results of operations.\n(cid:0)(cid:17)(cid:0)(cid:17)(cid:0)Z(cid:0)6(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)O(cid:0)D(cid:0)(cid:17)(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)8(cid:0)G(cid:0)U(cid:0)H(cid:0)V(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)Q(cid:0)U(cid:0)X(cid:0)H(cid:0)K(cid:0)H(cid:0)R(cid:0)O(cid:0)G(cid:0)U(cid:0)D(cid:0)K(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)V(cid:0)I(cid:0)L(cid:0)O(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)R(cid:0)L(cid:0)E(cid:0)R(cid:0)L(cid:0)W(cid:0)V(cid:0)V(cid:0)L(cid:0)H(cid:0)S(cid:0)Q(cid:0)V(cid:0)G(cid:0)U(cid:0)H(cid:0)V(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)Q(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)D(cid:0)K(cid:0)W(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)J(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)L(cid:0)H(cid:0)W(cid:0)K(cid:0)U(cid:0)U(cid:0)R(cid:0)P(cid:0)V(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)H(cid:0)I(cid:0)H(cid:0)W(cid:0)F(cid:0)V(cid:0)S(cid:0)U(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)P(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)V(cid:0)R(cid:0)U(cid:0)H(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)L(cid:0)Q(cid:0)I(cid:0)H(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)\\(cid:0)G(cid:0)L(cid:0)I(cid:0)D(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)P(cid:0)G(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)D(cid:0)Z(cid:0)Q(cid:0)O(cid:0)L(cid:0)H(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)O(cid:0)D(cid:0)U(cid:0)D(cid:0)Q(cid:0)G(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)\\(cid:0),(cid:0)V(cid:0)U(cid:0)E(cid:0)H(cid:0)H(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)Y(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)R(cid:0)U(cid:0)H(cid:0)J(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)D(cid:0)U(cid:0)H(cid:0)R(cid:0)H(cid:0)K(cid:0)D(cid:0)O(cid:0)G(cid:0)U(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)V(cid:0)K(cid:0)D(cid:0)V(cid:0)D(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)O(cid:0)L(cid:0)W(cid:0)V(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)L(cid:0)H(cid:0)L(cid:0)Q(cid:0)V(cid:0)L(cid:0)E(cid:0)R(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)V(cid:0)S(cid:0)G(cid:0)H(cid:0)U(cid:0)W(cid:0)V(cid:0)Q(cid:0)K(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)D(cid:0)L(cid:0)J(cid:0)U(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)U(cid:0)X(cid:0)R(cid:0)<\nTAT is incorporated under Israeli law. The rights and responsibilities of holders of TATs ordinary shares are governed by TATs memorandum of association, articles of association\nand by Israeli law. These rights and responsibilities differ in some respects from the rights and responsibilities of shareholders in typical U.S. corporations. In particular, each shareholder of\nan Israeli company has a duty to act in good faith and in a customary manner in exercising his or her rights and fulfilling his or her obligations toward the company and other shareholders\nand to refrain from abusing his power in the company, including, among other things, in voting at the general meeting of shareholders on certain matters. Israeli law provides that these\nduties are applicable in shareholder votes on, among other things, amendments to a companys articles of association, increases in a companys authorized share capital, mergers and\ninterested party transactions requiring shareholder approval. In addition, a controlling shareholder of an Israeli company, or a shareholder who knows that he or she possesses the power to\ndetermine the outcome of a shareholder vote or who has the power to appoint or prevent the appointment of a director or officer in the company, has a duty of fairness toward the company.\nHowever, Israeli law currently does not define the substance of this duty of fairness. Because Israeli corporate law has undergone extensive revision in recent years, there is relatively little\ncase law available to assist in understanding the implications of these provisions that govern shareholder behavior.\n(cid:0)(cid:15)(cid:0)U(cid:0)H(cid:0)R(cid:0)U(cid:0)H(cid:0)H(cid:0)I(cid:0)G(cid:0)W(cid:0)K(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)(cid:15)(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)R(cid:0)Q(cid:0)U(cid:0)O(cid:0)D(cid:0)Q(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)W(cid:0)R(cid:0)F(cid:0)I(cid:0)H(cid:0)D(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)R(cid:0)J(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)Q(cid:0)K(cid:0)H(cid:0)W(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)D(cid:0)F(cid:0)Y(cid:0)H(cid:0)Q(cid:0)G(cid:0)U(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)S(cid:0)X(cid:0)O(cid:0)K(cid:0)K(cid:0)R(cid:0)L(cid:0)F(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)F(cid:0)(cid:15)(cid:0)Z(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)7(cid:0)$(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)7(cid:0)I(cid:0)Q(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)R(cid:0)W(cid:0)L(cid:0)R(cid:0)L(cid:0)Q(cid:0)T(cid:0)X(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)D(cid:0)L(cid:0)F(cid:0)O(cid:0)V(cid:0)W(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)D(cid:0)F(cid:0)I(cid:0)X(cid:0)L(cid:0)L(cid:0)I(cid:0)N(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)G(cid:0)D(cid:0)H(cid:0)P(cid:0)U(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)W(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)R(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)H(cid:0)Q(cid:0)(cid:15)(cid:0)U(cid:0)H(cid:0)Y(cid:0)S(cid:0)O(cid:0)D(cid:0)\\(cid:0)H(cid:0)G(cid:0)D(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)\\(cid:0)O(cid:0)Z(cid:0)O(cid:0)L(cid:0)H(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)D(cid:0)P(cid:0)U(cid:0)D(cid:0),(cid:0)V (cid:0)(cid:17)(cid:0)D(cid:0)V(cid:0)V(cid:0)U(cid:0)H(cid:0)V(cid:0)K(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)¶(cid:0)7(cid:0)$(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)R(cid:0)H(cid:0)7(cid:0)I(cid:0)U(cid:0)F(cid:0)K(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)S(cid:0)L(cid:0)H(cid:0)V(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)V(cid:0)H(cid:0)W(cid:0)V(cid:0)S(cid:0)U(cid:0)H(cid:0)H(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)G\nIsraeli corporate law regulates mergers, requires tender offers for acquisitions of shares above specified thresholds, requires special approvals for transactions involving directors,\nofficers or significant shareholders and regulates other matters that may be relevant to these types of transactions.

It also may be difficult for you to assert U.S. securities law claims in original actions instituted in Israel.\nHowever, subject to certain time limitations and other conditions, Israeli courts may enforce final judgments of U.S. courts for liquidated amounts in civil matters, including judgments\nbased upon the civil liability provisions of those and similar acts.\n15\n(cid:0)H(cid:0)W(cid:0)V(cid:0)(cid:17)(cid:0)P(cid:0)H(cid:0)Q(cid:0)L(cid:0)U(cid:0)X(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)U(cid:0)H(cid:0)4(cid:0)T(cid:0)$(cid:0)’(cid:0)6(cid:0)L(cid:0)Q(cid:0)$(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)1(cid:0)U(cid:0)W(cid:0)D(cid:0)H(cid:0)F(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)I(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)G(cid:0)R(cid:0)Q(cid:0)D(cid:0)V(cid:0)W(cid:0)V(cid:0)H(cid:0)H(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)L(cid:0)U(cid:0)W(cid:0)L(cid:0)S(cid:0)F(cid:0)F(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)D(cid:0)Q(cid:0)H(cid:0)R(cid:0)F(cid:0)U(cid:0)H(cid:0)D(cid:0)J(cid:0)Y(cid:0)Q(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)R(cid:0)W(cid:0)H(cid:0)S(cid:0)U(cid:0)D(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)\\(cid:0)R(cid:0)U(cid:0)W(cid:0)X(cid:0)U(cid:0)Q(cid:0)F(cid:0)R(cid:0)F(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)K(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)D(cid:0)R(cid:0)H(cid:0)F(cid:0)W(cid:0)L(cid:0)P(cid:0)Z(cid:0)Q(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)U(cid:0)O(cid:0)I(cid:0)H(cid:0)R(cid:0)R(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)\\(cid:0)O(cid:0)D(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)P(cid:0)7(cid:0)$(cid:0)$(cid:0)(cid:15)(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)4(cid:0)7(cid:0)$(cid:0)6(cid:0)’(cid:0)1(cid:0)L(cid:0)G(cid:0)R(cid:0)Q(cid:0)V(cid:0)W(cid:0)H(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)U(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)H(cid:0)O(cid:0)D(cid:0)V(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)H(cid:0)D(cid:0)H(cid:0)K(cid:0)U(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)V(cid:0)R(cid:0)K(cid:0)V(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)Z(cid:0)L(cid:0)V(cid:0)V(cid:0)X(cid:0)U(cid:0)H(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)W(cid:0)S(cid:0)H(cid:0)D(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)U(cid:0)L(cid:0)Y(cid:0)Q(cid:0)U(cid:0)H(cid:0)I(cid:0)L(cid:0)J(cid:0)R(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)D(cid:0)$(cid:0)V\nAs a foreign private issuer whose shares are listed on NASDAQ, TAT is permitted to follow certain home country corporate governance practices instead of certain requirements of\nthe NASDAQ Marketplace Rules. A foreign private issuer that elects to follow a home country practice instead of such requirements must submit to NASDAQ in advance a written\nstatement from an independent counsel in such issuers home country certifying that the issuers practices are not prohibited by the home countrys laws. In addition, a foreign private issuer\nmust disclose in its annual reports filed with the SEC or on its website each such requirement that it does not follow and describe the home country practice followed by the issuer instead of\nany such requirement. For example, Israels corporate governance or laws require that TAT obtain shareholder approval for certain dilutive events, such as for the establishment or\namendment of certain equity-based compensation plans, an issuance that will result in a change of control of TAT, certain transactions other than a public offering involving issuances of a\n20% or more interest in TAT and certain acquisitions of the stock or assets of another company, which are not required by NASDAQ.\nItem 4. Information on the Company\nHistory and Development of TAT\nTAT was incorporated under the laws of the State of Israel in April 1985 under the name Galaxy Graphics Ltd. TAT changed its name to Galagraph Ltd. in August 1986 and to TAT\nTechnologies Ltd. in May 1992.

Limcos FAA-certified\nrepair station provides aircraft component MRO services for airlines, OEMs, air cargo carriers, maintenance service centers and the military. Limco is also certified by the EASA, and the\nCivil Aviation Administration of China (CAAC). Limco has NADCAP certification for dye penetrant testing, welding and heat treating. Limco specializes in MRO services for\ncomponents of aircraft, such as heat transfer components and ozone converters. Generally, manufacturer specifications, government regulations and military maintenance regimens require\nthat aircraft components undergo MRO servicing at regular intervals or as necessary. Aircraft heat transfer components typically require MRO services, including repairs and installation of\nreplacement units, after two to five years of service or sooner if required. Aircraft manufacturers typically provide warranties on new aircraft and their components and subsystems, which\nmay range from one to five years depending on the bargaining power of the purchaser. Warranty claims are generally the responsibility of the OEM during the warranty period. Limcos\nbusiness opportunity usually begins upon the conclusion of the warranty period for these components and subsystems. Limcos customers include major U.S. domestic and international\nairlines, air cargo carriers, maintenance service centers, OEMs such as commercial and military aircraft manufacturers and defense contractors, and the U.S. Armed Forces (Army, Air\nForce, Navy and Coast Guard). MRO contracts with these types of customers are generally long-term engagements and may have terms of one to five years or more.\n18\nLimco enjoys a strong reputation among customers for its competitive pricing and fast turnaround time. It is recognized by leading OEMs of aerospace products to provide MRO\nservices for their heat transfer solutions. For example, Limco is a well-recognized Collins Aerospace Authorized repair center, providing MRO services for many of its heat transfer\nsolutions.\nIn addition to its MRO services, Limco also manufactures, on an OEM basis, heat transfer solutions used in commercial, regional, business and military aviation platforms.\nCustomers for Limcos heat transfer solutions include Boeing, the Defense Supply Center, Parker Hannifin, Raytheon Company (Raytheon), BAE Systems, Bell Helicopter, Triumph\nAerostructures, Northrop Grumman Corporation and Gulfstream Aerospace Corporation.\nTAT estimates the size of the markets in which Limco operates to be significant based on the number of aircraft requiring MRO services provided by Limco along with the\ncustomer loyalty Limco enjoys. TAT plans to expand its Limco operations, among other things, by developing OEM and MRO capabilities for additional types of heat transfer products with\nsignificant commercial potential.\n(cid:0)Q(cid:0)W(cid:0)(cid:12)(cid:0)R(cid:0)H(cid:0)P(cid:0)3(cid:0)(cid:11)(cid:0)G(cid:0)L(cid:0)W(cid:0)V(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)P(cid:0)S(cid:0)R(cid:0)Q(cid:0)Q(cid:0)H(cid:0)R(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)&(cid:0)D(cid:0)L(cid:0)R(cid:0)W(cid:0)Q(cid:0)L(cid:0)Y(cid:0)U(cid:0)I(cid:0)R(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)$(cid:0)V(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)H(cid:0)L(cid:0)F(cid:0)Y(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)6(cid:0)U(cid:0)2(cid:0)H(cid:0)5(cid:0)0\nThrough its subsidiary Piedmont, TAT provides MRO services for aviation components to the aerospace industry. Piedmonts FAA- and EASA-certified repair station provides\naircraft component MRO services for commercial airlines, business jets, air cargo carriers, maintenance service providers as well as governments and military forces worldwide. Piedmont\nspecializes in MRO services for aircraft components, including APUs, landing gears and Machining and Plating services (MPG). Generally, manufacturer specifications, government\nregulations and military maintenance regimens require that aircraft components undergo MRO servicing at regular intervals or as necessary. Aircraft components typically require MRO\nservices, including repairs and installation of replacement units, after three to ten years of service or sooner if required. Aircraft manufacturers typically provide warranties on new aircraft\nand their components and subsystems, which may range from one to five years. Warranty claims are generally the responsibility of the OEM during the warranty period. Piedmonts\nbusiness opportunity usually begins upon the conclusion of the warranty period for these components and subsystems. Piedmonts customers include U.S. domestic and international\nairlines, air cargo carriers and maintenance service providers. MRO contracts with these types of customers are generally long-term engagements that may have terms of one to ten years or\nmore.\nPiedmont is licensed by Honeywell as an authorized repair center to provide MRO services for several types of its APU models. Piedmont has licensing agreements in place with\nthe major landing gear manufacturers Safran Landing Gear Systems and Liebherr Aerospace as well.\nIn 2021 Piedmont began providing its customers with APU engine leasing services with respect to the APU 331-250 and 331-500 models.\nTAT estimates the size of the markets in which Piedmont operates to be significant based on the number of aircraft requiring MRO services provided by Piedmont. TAT plans to\nexpand its Piedmont operations in the MRO segment by using Piedmonts experience and reputation to develop MRO capabilities for additional types of APU and landing gears applications\nas well as other aircraft systems/components with significant commercial potential and by offering additional supplementary services such as machining, plating, and grinding (MPG).\nIn this instance, Piedmont signed several strategic agreements with Honeywell (aerospace division). Under these transactions, Honeywell granted a 10-year license to MRO with\nrespect to the following APU lines : 331-200\\250, 331-500 that serves the Boeing 777 platform and 131 that serves the Boeing 737 platform and Airbus 319-320-321 platform. During 2021,\nPiedmont entered into the APU leasing activity with a purchase of eighteen 331-500APU engines from Honeywell, under which Honeywell is the main customer for leasing these engines\n(pursuant to this agreement Piedmont is Honeywell's sole source for engines for lease purposes). In 2022 Piedmont increased the lease pool by adding six 131-9A/B APUs and five\n331-200/250 APUs.\nPiedmonts extensive experience in the repair and overhaul of APUs and landing systems includes a comprehensive involvement in the industry supply chain. In addition to its\nMRO services, Piedmont is active worldwide in the exchange, lease and individual component parts supply of its APU and landing gear products. Through a network of industry partners\nand well-known aerospace parts distributors, Piedmonts activity in the sale of parts is a robust element of its business. Piedmonts quality systems are AS9110 and NADCAP for non-\ndestructive testing.\n19\nOverhaul and Coating of Jet Engine Components (Turbochrome)\nThrough its subsidiary Turbochrome, TAT provides MRO services for jet engine components to the aerospace industry. Turbochromes FAA- and EASA-certified repair station\nprovides its services mainly to maintenance service centers, airlines and the military. Turbochrome specializes in MRO services for engine components such as turbine vanes and blades,\ncompressor vanes and blades, fan blades and after burner flaps. Generally, manufacturer specifications, government regulations and military maintenance regimens require that engine\ncomponents undergo MRO servicing at regular intervals or as necessary. Commercial engine components typically require MRO services after three to five years of service or sooner if\nrequired. Engine manufacturers typically provide warranties on new engines and their components and subsystems, which may range from one to five years depending on the bargaining\npower of the purchaser. Warranty claims are generally the responsibility of the OEM during the warranty period. Turbochromes business opportunity usually begins upon the conclusion of\nthe warranty period for these components. Turbochromes customers include domestic and international airlines, maintenance service centers and the military.\nTurbochrome also specializes in the manufacturing of coating powders (for pack cementation aluminide coatings) and masking materials (for the prevention of coating in defined\nareas) used in the aviation industry. Turbochrome provides these materials to OEMs and to maintenance service centers.\nTAT estimates the size of the markets in which Turbochrome operates to be significant based on the number of jet engines requiring MRO services. Turbochrome plans to expand\nits operations in the MRO segment by using Turbochromes experience and reputation to develop MRO capabilities for additional types of jet engine components with significant\ncommercial potential.\nTurbochromes quality system complies with ISO 9001 and AS9100, and with EASA part 145 and FAA FAR 145 for the civil parts.\nIn June 2020, the Company's management decided to discontinue the JT8D engine blades reconditioning activity as part of a strategic change in Turbochrome's business to focus\non new capabilities to provide services to newer types of engines. This discontinued operation constitutes a material portion of Turbochromes revenues. In 2021, the Company continued\nwith the fade out plan of the JT8D engine blade reconditioning activity and as of 2022and 2023 this activity is immaterial for TATs financial statements reporting.\nTAT-Engineering LLC\nIn November 2015, we signed an agreement with Russian-based Engineering Holdings Ltd, of Moscow (Engineering), to establish a new facility for the provision of MRO\nservices for heat transfer components. The company, TAT-Engineering LLC, is based in Novosibirsks Tolmachevo airport. The entity was established in January 2016 and is currently\noperating under FAA certifications and obtained FAA high-level repair approvals. Current efforts are focused on marketing initiatives targeting the major Russian and CIS airlines and\nmaintenance stations. However, due to sanctions imposed by the United States, EU, Japan and other jurisdictions on certain industry sectors and parties in Russia and certain impacted\nregions, as well as enhanced export controls on certain products and industries, during 2022 and 2023 our joint venture in Russia ceased to purchase heat-exchange cores from Limco, our\nUS subsidiary, and therefore the joint venture had to materially limit the extent of the MRO services it provides to its customers.\nBusiness Strategy\nTAT aims to be the trusted partner to its strategic customers, delivering differentiated products and services in selected, high barrier-to-entry, markets.

These solutions are manufactured in compliance with all of the stringent quality assurance standards that apply to the manufacture of aircraft parts. TAT Israel's quality\nsystem complies with ISO 9001, AS9100, Boeing quality systems approval D6-82479 and FAR 21.303 (the FAA standard for Parts Manufacturer Approval) and NADCAP for non-\ndestructive testing and welding.\n(cid:0)Q(cid:0)L(cid:0)R(cid:0)V(cid:0)O(cid:0)X(cid:0)U(cid:0)V(cid:0)R(cid:0)W(cid:0)H(cid:0)U(cid:0)Q(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)6(cid:0)D(cid:0)I(cid:0)W(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)7(cid:0)D(cid:0)H(cid:0)+\nTAT Israel specializes in the design and manufacture of highly efficient, compact and reliable heat transfer solutions that are designed to meet stringent constraints such as size,\nweight and environmental conditions. Heat transfer solutions, such as heat exchangers and cold plates, are integral components of a wide variety of environmental control, mechanical and\nengine systems, as well as a wide range of electronic systems. These systems generate heat during operation that must be removed and dissipated. Heat transfer solutions facilitate the\nexchange of heat created through the operation of these systems by transmitting the heat from a hot medium (air, oil or other fluids) to a cold medium for disposal.\nIn the aerospace industry, there is a constant need for improvements in performance, weight, cost and reliability. In addition, as electronic systems become smaller and more densely\npacked, the need for sophisticated and efficient heat transfer components used to provide the cooling functions becomes more critical. Using TAT Israel's technological expertise, TAT\nbelieves it is well positioned to respond to these industry demands through continued new product development and product improvements.\nTAT Israel's principal heat transfer solutions include heat exchangers and cold plates. Typically, air-to-air heat exchangers cool a jet engines bleed air which, when cooled, is then\nused in the aircrafts air conditioning, pressurization and pneumatic systems. The liquid-to-air heat exchangers cool liquids such as engine oil, hydraulic oil and others used in other systems.\nTAT Israel provides a one-stop-shop for all types of heat transfer solutions. A significant portion of TAT Israel's heat transfer solutions is sold to customers in connection with the\noriginal manufacture or retrofitting of particular aircraft equipment. TAT Israel generally enters into long-term supply contracts with its customers, which require TAT Israel to supply heat\ntransfer products as part of a larger project.\n21\nTAT Israel also manufactures other heat transfer solutions, such as cooling chassis, heat sinks and cold plates (which may be air-to-air, liquid-to-air or liquid-to-liquid), to control\nand dispose heat emitted by the operation of various electronic systems. Such products are currently utilized mainly in radar systems, avionics, electronic warfare systems and various pods\nfor targeting, navigation and night vision.\nAs a result of the specialized nature of the systems in which TAT Israel's parts are included, spare and replacement parts for the original heat transfer solutions are also usually\nprovided by TAT Israel.\nDuring 2021, as part of a strategic plan by TATs management, TAT started transferring the heat exchangers activity from its Gedera facility to Limco in the US. The transfer was\naccomplished according to TATs management strategic plan in 2022. Such transfer created a unified independent MRO\\OEM center for heat exchangers, and as part of such transfer TAT\nbuilt its strategic R&D center for heat exchangers in the US.\n(cid:0)V(cid:0)V(cid:0)L(cid:0)H(cid:0)V(cid:0)U(cid:0)H(cid:0)F(cid:0)O(cid:0)F(cid:0)R(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)$(cid:0)R(cid:0)W(cid:0)U(cid:0)Q(cid:0)O(cid:0)R(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)&(cid:0)R(cid:0))(cid:0)Z(cid:0)R(cid:0)Q(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)W(cid:0)L(cid:0)L(cid:0)D(cid:0)Y(cid:0)$\nTAT Israel is also engaged in the design, development, manufacture and MRO services for aviation flow control accessories.

The demand for MRO services is driven by the size and age of the aircraft fleet\n(including new aircrafts entering into service), aircraft utilization and regulations set OR promulgated by the FAA and other governmental authorities.\nDue to the increased maintenance costs of their aging fleets many carriers are seeking ways to reduce costs, minimize down-time, increase aircraft reliability and extend time\nbetween overhauls. One way to accomplish this goal is through the outsourcing of more of their maintenance and support functions to reliable third parties. Furthermore, we believe that\ncommercial carriers making the decision to outsource their MRO requirements are searching for MRO service providers with a wide-range of service capabilities. Such MRO service\nproviders allow the carriers to concentrate their outsourcing of MRO services to a select group of third-party providers. The global military aircraft fleet also presents similar opportunities\nfor MRO service providers. We believe that an aging military fleet and the increased use of upgrade programs aimed at extending the useful life of military aircraft will provide continued\nMRO growth opportunities.\nLimco specializes in the repair and overhaul of heat transfer components. These components include heat exchangers, oil coolers, pre-coolers, reheaters, condensers, water\nseparators, fuel heaters, evaporators and ozone converters.\n22\nLimco is continually expanding its MRO capabilities based on market need and/or customer request. Limcos capabilities include heat transfer components used in aircraft and\nsystems manufactured by Airbus, Boeing, Bombardier, Cessna, Embraer, Lockheed Martin, Fokker, Liebherr-Aerospace, Collins Aerospace, Honeywell Aerospace and others.\nAs part of the TAT's strategic plan announced in March 2021, the Company will enhance Limco's Heat exchange cores manufacturing capabilities by, among other things,\nstrengthening Limcos employees engineering knowledge, recruitment and training of employees and investment in new machines and infrastructures.\nLimco performs MRO services at its repair station in Tulsa, Oklahoma which has ISO9001, AS9110 and AS9100 certification, NADCAP certification for dye penetrant testing,\nwelding and heat treating, and is licensed to provide MRO services by the FAA and EASA, as well as by the civil aviation Administration of China.\nLimco offers different or various MRO services for heat transfer components. If the damage is significant, Limco will remanufacture the unit, which generally entails replacing the\ncore matrix of the damaged or old heat transfer component in lieu of replacing the entire unit with a new one. Limco designs and develops these customized remanufactured units as a cost-\neffective alternative to new part replacement. In the event of less severe damage, Limco will either overhaul or repair the unit as necessary. Re-manufactured units carry warranties which are\noften equal or better than those provided to new units.\n(cid:0)Q(cid:0)V(cid:0)V(cid:0)H(cid:0)Q(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)/(cid:0)H(cid:0)L(cid:0)F(cid:0)Q(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)D(cid:0)G(cid:0)D(cid:0)L(cid:0)R(cid:0)V(cid:0)](cid:0)W(cid:0)R(cid:0)W(cid:0)$(cid:0)K(cid:0)U(cid:0)L(cid:0)X(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)0(cid:0)((cid:0)2\nLimco believes that establishing and maintaining relationships with OEMs of aircraft systems and components is an important factor in achieving sustainable success as an\nindependent MRO service provider. OEMs grant independent MRO service providers authorization to perform repair and overhaul services on their behalf. OEMs generally grant very few\nauthorizations and maintain tight controls over their authorized MRO service providers in order to maintain high quality of service to their customers. Obtaining OEM authorization requires\nsophisticated technological capabilities, experience-based industry knowledge and substantial capital investment. Furthermore, Limco believes that service providers that have OEM\nauthorization gain a competitive advantage as they typically receive discounts on parts, technical information and OEM warranty support.

APUs are relatively small, self-contained generators used to start jet engines, usually with compressed\nair, and to provide electricity, hydraulic pressure and air conditioning while an aircraft is on the ground. In many aircraft, an APU can also provide electrical power during in-flight\nemergency situations. Landing gears are the structure that support an aircraft on the ground and allow it to taxi, takeoff and land.\nPiedmont performs MRO services at its repair station in Greensboro, North Carolina, which is licensed by the FAA and EASA.

Typically, customers issue purchase orders with the\nrequired supply quantity, price, lead times and other related terms.\nVU(cid:0)H(cid:0)(cid:0)P(cid:0)RW(cid:0)V(cid:0)(cid:0)X&(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)25(cid:0)(cid:0)0(cid:0)\nTAT services MRO customers primarily through Limco, Piedmont and Turbochrome, including major U.S. domestic and international airlines, air cargo carriers, maintenance\nservice centers, the U.S. Armed Forces and other air forces from around the world.\nTATs partial list of MRO customers is set forth in the following table:\nU.S. Domestic and international airlines and air cargo carriers Air France-KLM, Lufthansa, FedEx, UPS, American Airlines, Delta Airlines, United\nAirlines, Air Canada Jazz, Republic Airways, DHL, Austrian Airlines, TAM, Thai, Korean\nAir, Air India, Swiftair, Allegiant Air, Empire Airlines, Mountain Air Cargo, Alliance\nAirlines,\nMaintenance service centers Fokker, Honeywell International, Kellstrom Commercial, Aero Kool, Lufthansa Technik,\nRTX through Collins, SR Technics, Embraer, , Turkish Technic, Delta Tech Ops, ST\nAerospace Engineering, , Gulfstream, IAI, Haeco Americas , Air New-Zeeland, AAR.\nGovernments and military air forces U.S. Army, U.S. Air Force and U.S. Navy; Israeli Ministry of Defense, Israeli Air Force;\nBelgium Air Force, Polish Air Force, Portuguese Air Force, Japan Air Force.\n(cid:0)W(cid:0)V(cid:0)D(cid:0)F(cid:0)U(cid:0)Q(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)&(cid:0)D(cid:0)R(cid:0)W(cid:0)\\(cid:0)L(cid:0)O(cid:0)U(cid:0)0(cid:0)L(cid:0)W\nDirect sales to the U.S. government, our largest government customer, accounted for approximately 6.6% of TATs revenues for the year ended December 31, 2023, approximately\n5.2% of our revenues for the year ended December 31, 2022 and approximately 5.6% of our revenues for the year ended December 31, 2021.\nMany of TATs military contracts are awarded on a competitive basis based on technical merit, personnel qualifications, experience and price. TAT also receives some contract\nawards involving special technical capabilities on a negotiated, noncompetitive basis due to TATs technical capabilities.\n26\nTAT provides products under government contracts that usually require performance over a period of several months to several years. Long-term contracts for the U.S. military may\nbe conditioned upon continued availability of congressional appropriations. Variances between anticipated budget and congressional appropriations may result in a delay, modification of\nscope or termination of these contracts.\nThe vast majority of the governmental contracts to which TAT is party to are fixed-price contracts, some of which contain fixed-price escalation mechanism. Under these contracts,\nTAT agrees to perform specific work for a fixed price and, accordingly, realizes the benefit or detriment to the extent that the actual cost of performing the work differs from the contract\nprice. The allowable government contract costs and fees of TAT are subject to audit and may result in non-reimbursement of some contract costs and fees. While governments reserve the\nright to conduct further audits, audits conducted for periods through fiscal year 2022 and 2023 have resulted in no material cost recovery disallowances for TAT.\nTATs eligibility to perform under its government contracts requires us to maintain adequate security measures. TAT has implemented security procedures that it believes adequately\nsatisfies the requirements of its current government contracts.\nBacklog and Long-Term Agreements\nOur backlog includes the following: (i) actual purchase orders, and (ii) the estimated sales we expect to generate from long-term agreements during the life of the contract or 10\nyears the lower of the two, for which we do not have actual purchase orders. It should be noted that under these long-term agreements there is no legal obligation from the customer to\npurchase our products or services, yet typically our customers would not sign such an agreement unless there is a specific business opportunity. As such, backlog information may not\nnecessarily be indicative of future sales.\nAs of December 31, 2023, our backlog included: (i) outstanding purchase orders representing an aggregate amount of $85 million, and (ii) sales that we expect to generate from\nlong-term agreements (the longest of which is until 2033) for which we have not yet received actual purchase orders in an aggregate amount of $349 million.\nProduct and Service Warranties\nTAT provides warranties for its products and services ranging from one to three years, depending on the nature of the specific product. To date, TATs warranty costs have not been\nsubstantial. As of December 31, 2023, the combined warranty reserve for TAT was $0.3 million.\nCompetitive Environment\n(cid:0)V(cid:0)L(cid:0)H(cid:0)V(cid:0)R(cid:0)V(cid:0)U(cid:0)H(cid:0)F(cid:0)$(cid:0)F(cid:0)L(cid:0)R(cid:0)Q(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)D(cid:0)Y(cid:0)W(cid:0)L(cid:0)G(cid:0)$(cid:0)V(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)R(cid:0)D(cid:0)Q(cid:0)6(cid:0)O(cid:0)Q(cid:0)X(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)W(cid:0)L(cid:0)R(cid:0)U(cid:0)Q(cid:0)H(cid:0)V(cid:0)I(cid:0)U(cid:0)D(cid:0)7(cid:0)W(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)D(cid:0)H(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)+(cid:0)I(cid:0)((cid:0)2(cid:0)0(cid:0)R\nThe aerospace and defense OEM industries in general and specifically, the commercial and military aviation markets, are characterized by intense competition and the need to\nconstantly be in the forefront of technological innovations in order to be able to offer technologically-advanced and attractive products. Competition in these OEM markets is also based on\nprice, quality and on time delivery. TAT estimates the market size of heat transfer solutions to be significant based on the scope of development projects and purchasing processes of the\npotential customers. TAT estimates that there is a small number of competing suppliers in the aerospace and defense OEM markets due to the high barriers to entry to these markets, which\ninclude the need for highly qualified and trained personnel, technologically advanced facilities and the need to obtain appropriate governmental approvals. The nature of the projects in the\ncommercial and military aviation OEM industry, which are often time consuming and complex, also require long-term supplier relationships and customer loyalty in order to succeed.\n27\nTATs competitors in the global OEM aerospace and defense industries can be divided into two main groups:\n Complete system manufacturers that either independently or through subcontractors, design, develop and manufacture complete systems (such as a manufacturer of aircraft\nhydraulic systems) directly for the platform manufacturer (i.e., for business jets). These companies will typically compete on bids for complete systems and/or projects where\nthe components/products TAT develops are part of the complete system. In such cases, it is very likely that these companies will subcontract to companies such as TAT the\ndesign and manufacturing of one or a few components in the system. Although some of these companies have the capabilities to design and manufacture each standalone\ncomponent in a complete system (i.e., a heat exchanger integrated in hydraulic systems) they usually do not compete with TAT in projects where there is a specific requirement\nfor a stand-alone component.\n Component manufacturers, such as TAT, for which the design and manufacture of components (such as heat exchangers or other types of heat transfer solutions) is the main\nbusiness (and which are normally situated in the value chain one tier below the system manufacturers, such as a manufacturer of an aircrafts hydraulic system and two tiers\nbelow the platform manufacturer, such as a manufacturer of a new aircraft). These companies typically compete in projects where there is a specific requirement for a\nstandalone aviation component (such as a heat exchanger or other types of heat transfer solutions) and in tenders by manufacturers of complete systems or products for sub-\ncontractors. Although some of the component manufacturers have the capabilities to design, develop and manufacture a complete system (i.e., environmental control system for\na business jet) for a certain platform, these companies usually do not compete on projects for complete systems in which their manufactured component constitutes a small part\nof the complete system, mainly due to the high barriers to entry and to the difficulty to move up the value chain from a component supplier to a whole system manufacturer.\nThe major competitors of TAT in the area of OEM of heat transfer solutions and aviation accessories include manufacturers in the United States such as the Hughes-Treitler division\nof Ametek, Lytron, Niagara Thermal, Collins Aerospace, Honeywell International and Triumph Thermal Systems; manufacturers based in Europe such as I.M.I. Marston, a subsidiary of\nCollins Aerospace, Safran and Liebherr; and manufacturers based in Asia such as Sumitomo Precision Products from Japan. These competitors may enjoy competitive advantages over TAT\nIsrael, such as:\n The ability to adapt faster to changes in customer requirements and industry conditions or trends;\n Greater access to capital;\n Stronger relationships with customers and suppliers;\n Greater name recognition;\n Access to superior technology and greater marketing resources;\n Ability to offer complete systems in addition to components; and\n The ability to bundle heat transfer solutions and other aircraft components.\n(cid:0)V(cid:0)Q(cid:0)Q(cid:0)H(cid:0)W(cid:0)R(cid:0)R(cid:0)S(cid:0)U(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)H(cid:0)P(cid:0)V(cid:0)I(cid:0)&(cid:0)Q(cid:0)U(cid:0)D(cid:0)7(cid:0)W(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)D(cid:0)H(cid:0)R(cid:0)U(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)+(cid:0)V(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)H(cid:0)L(cid:0)F(cid:0)Y(cid:0)I(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)6(cid:0)U(cid:0)2(cid:0)H(cid:0)5(cid:0)0\nThe market for MRO services in the field of heat transfer components is highly competitive. Competition in this market is based on price, turnaround time, quality and breadth of\nservices. TATs global competitors in the field of servicing heat transfer components can be divided into two main groups:\n Service divisions of OEMs  generally, each OEM of products in the heat transfer solutions segment has the necessary capabilities to provide MRO services for products it\ndesigns and manufactures throughout its lifetime, commencing with the initial warranty period and through the after-market period. Service divisions of OEMs may also acquire\ncapabilities to service products of other OEMs to further expand their MRO services.\n Service centers  which often provide MRO services for a broad range of components and systems. These service centers can be either the in-house maintenance services of\ncommercial airlines or other independent service providers, such as TAT or Limco.\nFor heat transfer MRO services, TATs major competitors are Triumph Thermal Systems, Lori Heat Transfer Center of Honeywell, Drake Air  Ametek, Liebherr-Aerospace,\nAmerican Cooler Service, Collins Aerospace Malaysia, Lufthansa Technik, Meggitt (Elite) and others.\n28\nAs an independent MRO service provider, Limcos competitors have inherent competitive advantages. For example, Limco competes with the service divisions of large OEMs\nwhich in some cases have design authority with respect to their OEM solutions and are able to derive significant pricing advantages from their OEM manufacturing activities. Limco also\ncompetes with the in-house service divisions of large commercial airlines where there is a strong incentive for an airline to fully utilize the services of its maintenance employees and\nfacilities. Further, Limcos competitors may have additional competitive advantages, such as:\n Ability to bundle heat transfer and other aircraft components;\n Access to greater marketing resources;\n Access to superior technology; and\n Greater resources which allow for better turnaround time.\n(cid:0)W(cid:0)V(cid:0)P(cid:0)S(cid:0)R(cid:0)Q(cid:0)Q(cid:0)H(cid:0)R(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)&(cid:0)D(cid:0)L(cid:0)R(cid:0)W(cid:0)Q(cid:0)L(cid:0)Y(cid:0)R(cid:0)U(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)$(cid:0)V(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)H(cid:0)L(cid:0)F(cid:0)Y(cid:0)I(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)6(cid:0)U(cid:0)2(cid:0)H(cid:0)5(cid:0)0\nThe market for MRO services in which Piedmont operates is highly competitive. Competition in this market is based on quality, price, turnaround time and breadth of services.\nPiedmonts primary MRO services competitors are the service divisions of OEMs, the in-house maintenance services of various commercial airlines and other independent service providers,\nsuch as TAT or Piedmont. For APU and landing gear MRO services Piedmonts major competitors are Standard Aero Group., Aerotech International, Honeywell International, Chase\nAerospace, Professional Aviation, Messier-Dowty Aerospace (MD), AAR, Hawker Pacific, APRO, TAG Aero and Turbine Aero and others.\nA number of Piedmonts competitors have inherent competitive advantages. For example, Piedmont competes with the service divisions of large OEMs which in some cases have\ndesign authority with respect to their OEM products and are able to derive significant brand recognition from their OEM manufacturing activities. Piedmont also competes with the in-house\nservice divisions of large commercial airlines where there is a strong incentive for an airline to fully utilize the services of its maintenance employees and facilities. Further, Piedmonts\ncompetitors may have additional competitive advantages, such as:\n Better name recognition;\n Ability to bundle aviation and other aircraft components;\n Stronger relationships with customers and suppliers;\n Lower cost structure;\n Regional support near customers location;\n Access to greater marketing resources;\n Access to superior technology\n Greater access to capital; and\n Greater resources which allow for better turnaround time.\n29\n(cid:0)Q(cid:0)H(cid:0)W(cid:0)V(cid:0)S(cid:0)Q(cid:0)P(cid:0)R(cid:0)&(cid:0)R(cid:0)Q(cid:0)L(cid:0)Q(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)H(cid:0)J(cid:0)((cid:0)-(cid:0)I(cid:0)W(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)H(cid:0)R(cid:0)L(cid:0)Q(cid:0)J(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)D(cid:0)&(cid:0)R(cid:0)W(cid:0)Q(cid:0)X(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)K(cid:0)D(cid:0)D(cid:0)G(cid:0)O(cid:0)U(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)H(cid:0)Y(cid:0)2\nThe market for MRO services in which Turbochrome operates is highly competitive. Competition in this market is based on quality, price, level of service and turnaround time.\nTurbochromes primary MRO services competitors are the service divisions of OEMs, the in-house maintenance services of various commercial airlines and other independent service\nproviders, including Safran (Snecma), General Electric, GKN, PAS, Chromalloy Southwest, MCT Japan and others. With respect to coating and masking materials, Turbochrome's\ncompetitor is APV Coatings.\nA number of Turbochromes competitors have inherent competitive advantages. For example, Turbochrome competes with the service divisions of large OEMs which may have\ndesign authority with respect to their OEM products and are able to derive significant brand recognition from their OEM manufacturing activities. Turbochrome also competes with the in-\nhouse service divisions of large commercial airlines and there is a strong incentive for an airline to fully utilize the services of its maintenance employees and facilities. Further,\nTurbochromes competitors may have additional competitive advantages, such as:\n The ability to adapt faster to changes in customer requirements and industry conditions or trends;\n Better name recognition;\n Ability to bundle jet engine and other aircraft components;\n Stronger relationships with customers, OEMs and suppliers;\n Lower cost structure;\n Regional support near customers location;\n Access to greater marketing resources;\n Access to superior technology;\n Greater access to capital; and\n Greater resources which allow for better turnaround time\nCompetitive Strengths\nWe believe that TATs success can be attributed to several critical factors, including the following:\n Engaging in Pro-active Account Management efforts to preserve its customer base in existing projects, while working to broaden and increase its involvement with such clients.\n Conducting marketing activities aimed at penetrating new geographical markets and winning new customers, while taking advantage of the unique knowledge and expertise that\nTAT and its subsidiaries have gained in various areas.\n Entering into additional related operating segments that will enable TAT and its subsidiaries to fulfill their growth potential.\n Providing customers with the best value, including competitive prices, by tailoring comprehensive service packages that combine the design and planning of an OEM\ncomponent, the manufacture of such component, and the provision of maintenance services.\n Extending MRO capabilities in order to establish a one-stop-shop center for comprehensive MRO services for the types of aircraft Limco and/or Piedmont and/or\nTurbochrome target.\n Enhancing our engineering capabilities in order to support customer needs related to new projects and in order to certify MRO services that differ from processes previously\napproved by the FAA, EASA or other regulatory authorities. This allows shortening the long and complex approval process, streamlining the design and certification process\nand reducing costs.\n Leveraging operational efficiencies to achieve shorter delivery times and reduce costs.\n Investing in new technologies and manufacturing techniques in the heat transfer solutions product line.\n Investing in innovations and improvements aimed at enhancing the quality and performance of our existing solutions and services as well as the development of new products in\nan effort to strengthen our market position and enter into more advanced platforms.\n30\nEngineering\nWe believe that our engineering capabilities is a strategic core competency and key competitive advantage, which allows us to effectively compete in the market with companies\nwhich, in many cases, have better name recognition and greater resources than we do. Our strong engineering capabilities enable us to meet our customers increasingly complex demands to\ndeliver high-quality and cost-effective solutions while maintaining efficient development cycles. These capabilities are based on proprietary technological expertise and know-how\ndeveloped by highly-experienced multi-disciplinary teams over the years.

Our strong engineering capabilities are\na key factor in preserving customer loyalty as well as supporting our efforts to expand our services to new areas of growth.\nTAT Israel's engineering staff has extensive knowledge and experience in designing heat transfer solutions. In general, TAT Israel has manufacturing capabilities for most heat\ntransfer solutions. TAT Israel manufactures the necessary tools, fixtures, test equipment and special jigs which are required to manufacture, assemble and test these products. TAT Israel\ndeveloped proprietary design and analysis techniques which assist in the mechanical and thermal design of its products. All of TAT Israel's products are inspected and tested by trained\ninspectors using highly sophisticated test equipment in accordance with its customer requirements.\nLimcos engineering department enhances its ability to provide its customers with high-end top-quality MRO services, supports the development of MRO services for new products\nwith commercial potential and supports its OEM activity. Limcos engineering department employs certified mechanical and aerospace engineers. Limcos multi-disciplinary team of\nengineers specializes in, among others, heat transfer solutions and components and supports all processes of thermal and structural analysis, mechanical and metallurgical research and\ndevelopment for manufacturing design. Limcos engineers have direct experience with aerospace component repair and with obtaining supplemental type certificates from the FAA. Limcos\nengineering department supports the development of new repairs capabilities that extend beyond the limits of the component maintenance manual and utilizes DER to obtain the necessary\nFAA approvals.\nPiedmonts engineering department employs experienced mechanical and aerospace engineers with repair station and manufacturing experience in both engineering and quality.\nPiedmont also has an FAA-certified DER on staff with delegations in Auxiliary Power Units (APUs) & Mechanical Systems and with special delegation to manage and approve repair\nspecifications. In addition to developing quality major repairs, Piedmonts engineers have experience in obtaining supplemental type certificates and parts manufacturer approvals while\nworking directly with the FAA Aircraft Certification Office.\nTurbochromes engineering department enhances its ability to provide its customers with high-end top-quality MRO services. Turbochromes engineering department employs\nseveral certified mechanical and metallurgical engineers. Turbochromes multi-disciplinary team of engineers specializes in, among other things, turbine components and supports all\nprocesses of thermal and structural analysis and mechanical and metallurgical research and development. Turbochromes engineers have substantial experience with aerospace component\nrepair and with obtaining DER and DOA certificates from the FAA and EASA.\nResearch and Development\nIn light of the rapidly evolving technological landscape in thermal management systems and the advent of electric Vertical Takeoff and Landing (eVTOL) aircraft, along with the\nincreasing cooling demands posed by sophisticated electrical flying vehicles, TAT recognizes the imperative for ongoing exploration of innovative technologies and materials. This proactive\nexploration is specifically designed to not only improve the physical characteristics of its products, such as size and weight, but also to elevate their performance metrics, focusing on factors\nlike optimal heat transfer, heightened reliability, and extended lifespan.\n31\nAcknowledging the dynamic nature of customer demands and the ever-changing competitive environment, TAT is resolutely committed to the continuous development of\ngroundbreaking products. This commitment extends to the enhancement of functionalities in its existing offerings. By adopting this strategic approach, TAT ensures its adaptability and\nresponsiveness to emerging market potential. The company actively allocates significant resources to foster collaboration with its customers, forming partnerships that serve as catalysts for\nthe pursuit of technological advancements and the enhancement of product features.\nThrough these collaborative efforts, TAT aspires to achieve and deliver cutting-edge solutions, positioning itself at the forefront of innovation for the thermal management systems.\nBy staying at the vanguard of technological advancements, TAT aims to not only meet but exceed the evolving needs of its customers while maintaining a competitive edge in the dynamic\nmarket landscape.\nSource and Availability of Raw Materials and Spare Parts\nTAT and its subsidiaries acquire most of the components for the manufacture of their products and provision of their services from a limited number of suppliers and subcontractors,\nthe majority located in Israel and the United States. Some of these suppliers are currently the sole source of one or more components upon which TAT and its subsidiaries are dependent.\nSince many of TAT's and its subsidiaries purchases require long lead times, a delay in the supply of an item can significantly delay the delivery of a product. Generally, TAT and its\nsubsidiaries have not experienced significant difficulty in obtaining timely deliveries of necessary components; however, if they are unable to obtain these components when needed, they\nwould experience delays in manufacturing their products and their financial results could be adversely affected.\nThe raw materials used in manufacturing programs are generally readily available metals and alloys. TAT and its subsidiaries have not had any significant difficulty in obtaining\nsuch materials in the past.\nTAT and its subsidiaries select their suppliers primarily based on their ability to ensure that their parts are serviceable and traceable to OEM-approved sources, their delivery\nperformance and their ability to help reduce the total cost of procuring those parts. For quality control, cost and efficiency reasons, TAT and its subsidiaries generally purchase supplies only\nfrom vendors with who they have ongoing relationships or who their customers have previously approved.\nAuthorizations from OEMs often require that TAT purchase component parts that are needed for its MRO services from the OEM or its designated distributors.\nWherever possible, TAT and its subsidiaries have made and continue to make an effort to qualify second sources or have identified alternate sources for many of their parts needs.\n32\nIsraeli Export Policy\nExports of military related products are subject to the military export policy of the State of Israel. Currently the Israeli government encourages exports to approved customers,\nprovided that such exports do not run counter to Israeli policy or national security considerations. TAT Israel must obtain a permit prior to initiating a sales proposal and ultimately an export\nlicense for the transaction is required. Israeli law also regulates the export of dual use items (items that are typically sold for civilian uses or purposes but that may also have military\npurposes).\nWhile we have been successful in obtaining export permits in the past, we may not be able to obtain the necessary export permits or licenses in the future. In addition, governmental\npolicy with respect to military exports (or dual use items) may be altered.\nU.S. Export Regulations\nExport of defense products, military technical data and technical services by our U.S. subsidiaries to Israel and other countries is subject to applicable approvals by the U.S.\ngovernment under the U.S. International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR). Such approvals are typically in the form of an export license or a technical assistance agreement (TAA).\nOther U.S. companies wishing to export defense products or military-related services and technology to our Israeli and other non-U.S. entities are also required to obtain such export licenses\nand TAAs. An application for an export license or a TAA requires disclosure of the intended end user and the use of the technology. Pursuant to recent export control reform initiatives in the\nUnited States, a greater part of our U.S. subsidiaries and our U.S. suppliers' activities are becoming subject to control under the Export Administration Act \"dual use\" regulations. The U.S.\ngovernment may deny an export authorization if it determines that a transaction is counter to U.S. policy or national security.\nProprietary Rights\nAt the present time, TAT and its subsidiaries do not own any patents. TAT and its subsidiaries rely on laws protecting trade secrets, and consider such items proprietary; however,\nwe believe that our success depends less on the ownership of such proprietary rights than on our innovative skills, technical competences, marketing and engineering abilities. TAT and its\nsubsidiaries have no material registered trademarks.\nB. Government Regulations\nAerospace and Safety Regulations\nThe commercial aerospace industry is highly regulated by the FAA in the United States, EASA in Europe, and other governmental authorities elsewhere in the world, while the\nmilitary aerospace industry is governed by military quality specifications established by the U.S. Department of Defense for the manufacturing and repair industries and ISO-9000. TAT is\nrequired to be certified by one or more of these entities and, in some cases, by individual OEMs. TAT must also satisfy the requirements of its customers, including OEMs and airlines that\nare subject to FAA regulations and to evolving industry standards, and provide these customers with products that comply with the government regulations applicable to commercial flight\noperations. TAT believes it currently satisfies or exceeds these FAA maintenance standards in its repair and overhaul activities. Our active or operating repair stations in Israel and the United\nStates are approved by the FAA (while TAT-Engineering, our joint venture in Russia, is currently pursuing such certification or is currently in process of pursuing such certification). TAT\nalso believes it currently satisfies all industry standards in its facilities.\n33\nTATs operations are also subject to a variety of worker and community safety laws including the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970, known as OSHA, which mandates\ngeneral requirements for safe workplaces for all U.S. employees. In addition, OSHA provides special procedures and measures for the handling of certain hazardous and toxic substances.\nTAT believes that its operations are in compliance with OSHAs requirements.\nTAT believes that it is in material compliance with U.S., European and other governmental regulations affecting the aerospace and defense industries.\nIsraeli Regulations\nTATs operations in Israel are subject to supervision by the Israeli Ministry of Defense and Civil Aviation Administration of Israel. TAT Israel is certified by the IAF and the Israeli\nMinistry of Defense for both manufacturing and maintenance. TAT Israel is also licensed as a repair station for certain components by the Civil Aviation Administration of Israel. In\naddition, TAT Israel export of certain products and/or know-how is subject to approval by the Defense Export Controls Agency (DECA) of the Israeli Ministry of Defense. DECA permits\nare required prior to submitting sales proposals with regard to such exports, as well as for the actual export of such products.\nEnvironmental Matters\nTATs operations are subject to a number of stringent federal, state and local environmental laws in the United States and Israel, as well as to regulation set or promulgated by\ngovernment agencies, including the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. Among other matters, these regulatory authorities impose requirements that regulate the emission, discharge,\ngeneration, management, transportation and disposal of pollutants and hazardous substances. These authorities may require TAT to initiate actions to remediate the effects of hazardous\nsubstances which may be or have been released into the environment and require TAT to obtain and maintain permits in connection with TATs operations. This extensive regulatory\nframework imposes significant compliance burdens and risks. During the years 2020-2021, the Israeli Water Authority requested that TAT perform sampling of certain groundwater wells in\nTATs facility in Gedera. During March 2022 TAT has terminated its lease agreement in Gedera facility and has no further requests from the water authority.\nAlthough TAT seeks to maintain its operations and facilities in compliance with applicable environmental laws, there can be no assurance that TAT has no violations, or that change\nin such laws, regulations or interpretations of such laws, will not require TAT to make significant additional expenditures to ensure compliance in the future.\nC. Property, Plants and Equipment\nDuring 2022 TAT completed the strategic plan announced in March 2021, which includes transferring TATs activity from the leased facility in Gedera to a facility in Tulsa,\nOklahoma (see information regarding such facility below) and to a facility in Kiryat Gat, Israel which is leased by our wholly owned subsidiary Turbochrome. The facility in Kiryat Gat is\napproximately 138,000 square feet, and the land on which the facility is located is leased from the ILA. The leasehold rights are for a period ending in 2045 and are recorded in\nTurbochrome's name. Turbochrome paid the entire lease payments due until 2045 in a one-time payment (discounted to present value).\n34\nDuring 2023 TAT signed a lease agreement for an approximately 6,505 rentable square feet facility in Harris Corners Parkway , Charlotte, USA, which will expire in April, 2029.\nDue to the new agreement, the Company recognized an operating ROU assets and related operating lease liability of approximately $1 million. In 2023, the rental expense for this property\nwas $200 thousand.\nLimco owns and operates a 55,000 square feet manufacturing plant in Tulsa, Oklahoma which has historically supported all its business, including its aftermarket heat transfer\ncomponent repair station. This facility also has housed Limcos administration, engineering, quality control and support services.\nLimco also leases building #2, building #3, building #4, building #5, and building #6.

Operating and Financial Review and Prospects Operating Results\nThe following discussion of our results of operations should be read together with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes, which appear elsewhere in this annual\nreport. The following discussion contains forward-looking statements that reflect our current plans, estimates and beliefs and involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results may differ\nmaterially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include those discussed below and elsewhere in this annual\nreport.\nOverview\nTAT is reliant on the robustness of the commercial and military aerospace and ground defense industries. Any downturn in these industries could weaken demand for its solutions\nand services and negatively impact its financial results. The commercial airline industry is cyclical and has historically been subject to fluctuations due to general economic and political\nconditions, such as fuel and labor costs, price competition, downturns in the global economy and national and international events.\nTATs cost of revenues for OEM operations and MRO services consists of component and material costs, direct labor costs, quality assurance costs, shipping expenses, royalties,\noverhead related to manufacturing and depreciation of manufacturing equipment. TATs gross margin is affected by the proportion of its revenues generated from each of its operational\nsegments.\nThe principal factors that affect the operating income of TATs four segments, in addition to their gross profit, is the expenditure on selling and marketing expenses and general and\nadministrative expenses. While TAT closely monitors its operating expenses to prevent unnecessary spending, we believe that these operating expenses may increase in the future in\naccordance with our plans to grow the business.\nTATs research and development expenses are related to new products and technologies or significant improvement of existing products and technologies.\nTATs selling and marketing expenses are related to commission payments, compensation and related expenses of TATs sales teams, participation in trade shows, travel expenses,\nadvertising expenses and related costs for facilities and equipment.\nTATs general and administrative expenses are related to compensation and related expenses for executive, finance and administrative personnel, professional fees such as legal,\naudit, SOX, internal audit, insurance premiums and general corporate expenses and related costs for facilities and equipment.\n36\nSources of Revenues\nTAT, directly and through its subsidiaries, provides a variety of solutions and services to the commercial and military aerospace and ground defense industries, including:\n(i) OEM of heat transfer solutions and aviation components, such as heat exchangers, pre-coolers and oil/fuel hydraulic coolers (through TAT Israel);\n(ii) MRO services for heat transfer components and OEM of heat transfer solutions (through our Limco subsidiary);\n(iii) MRO services for aviation components (through our Piedmont subsidiary); and\n(iv) Overhaul and coating of jet engine components (through our Turbochrome subsidiary).\nTATs revenues from its four operational segments for the three years ended December 31, 2023 were as follows:\nYear Ended December 31,\n2023 2022 2021\nRevenues % of Revenues % of Revenues % of\nin Total in Total in Total\nThousands Revenues Thousands Revenues Thousands Revenues\nRevenues\nOEM of heat transfer solutions and aviation\naccessories 27,555 24.2% 21,844 25.8% 25,997 33.3%\nMRO services for heat transfer components and\nOEM of heat transfer solutions 32,995 29% 24,796 29.3% 18,846 24.2%\nMRO services for aviation components 50,760 44.5% 35,879 42.4% 33,232 42.6%\nOverhaul and coating of jet engine components 6,854 6% 5,770 6.8% 3,834 4.9%\nEliminations (4,370) (3.7)% (3,733) (4.3)% (3,916) (5)%\nTotal Revenues $ 113,794 100% $ 84,556 100% $ 77,973 100%\n37\nThe following table reflects the geographic breakdown of TATs revenues for each of the three years ended December 31, 2023:\nYears Ended December 31,\n2023 2022 2021\nRevenues % of Revenues % of Revenues % of\nin Total in Total in Total\nThousands Revenues Thousands Revenues Thousands Revenues\nUnited States $ 7,698 7% $ 56,570 66.9% $ 47,947 61.5%\nIsrael 81,999 72% 7,162 8.5% 7,745 9.9%\nOther 24,097 21% 20,824 24.6% 22,281 28.6%\nTotal $ 113,794 100% $ 84,556 100.0% $ 77,973 100.0%\nCosts and Expenses\n(cid:0)W(cid:0)(cid:0)V&(cid:0)R(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)R(cid:0)I(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)V(cid:0)(cid:17)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)YH(cid:0)H(cid:0)XU(cid:0)(cid:0)QH TATs cost of revenues for OEM operations and MRO services consists of component and material costs, direct labor costs, quality assurance costs, royalties,\nshipping expenses, overhead related to manufacturing and depreciation of manufacturing equipment.\nTATs gross margin was affected by the proportion of TATs revenues generated from OEM operations and MRO services in each of the reported years.\n(cid:0)K(cid:0)U(cid:0)F(cid:0)D(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)H(cid:0)V(cid:0)5(cid:0)H(cid:0)G(cid:0)D(cid:0)Q(cid:0)H(cid:0)W(cid:0)Q(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)S(cid:0)O(cid:0)R(cid:0)P(cid:0)H(cid:0)G(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)Y(cid:0)Q(cid:0)V(cid:0)(cid:15)(cid:0)H(cid:0)H(cid:0)V(cid:0)H(cid:0)S(cid:0)[(cid:0)(cid:17)(cid:0)H(cid:0)H(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)Q(cid:0)W(cid:0)(cid:3) Research and development expenses, net are related to new products and technologies or to a significant improvement of products and\ntechnologies, net of grants and participations received.\n(cid:0)V(cid:0)(cid:17)(cid:0)H(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)H(cid:0)V(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)Q(cid:0)Q(cid:0)[(cid:0)S(cid:0)J(cid:0)U(cid:0)N(cid:0)Q(cid:0)H(cid:0)W(cid:0)L(cid:0)D(cid:0)H(cid:0)D(cid:0)L(cid:0)G(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)P(cid:0)Q(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)6(cid:0)O(cid:0)J(cid:0)O(cid:0)H Selling and marketing expenses consist primarily of commission payments, compensation and related expenses of TATs sales teams, participation\nin trade shows, travel expenses, advertising expenses and related costs for facilities and equipment.\n(cid:0)D(cid:0)O(cid:0)Q(cid:0)U(cid:0)H(cid:0)H(cid:0)*(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)D(cid:0)Q(cid:0)G(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)H(cid:0)L(cid:0)Y(cid:0)V(cid:0)U(cid:0)D(cid:0)Q(cid:0)W(cid:0)L(cid:0)P(cid:0)W(cid:0)D(cid:0)G(cid:0)L(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)Q(cid:0)V(cid:0)H(cid:0)V(cid:0)H(cid:0)H(cid:0)(cid:17)(cid:0)S(cid:0)[(cid:0)(cid:3) General and administrative expenses consist of compensation and related expenses for executive, finance and administrative personnel,\nprofessional fees such as legal, audit, SOX, internal audit, other general corporate expenses and related costs for facilities and equipment.\n38\n(cid:0)(cid:17)(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)Q(cid:0)(cid:12)(cid:0)[(cid:0)H(cid:0)V(cid:0)H(cid:0)(cid:11)(cid:0)S(cid:0)H(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)H(cid:0)P(cid:0)Q(cid:0)R(cid:0)H(cid:0)F(cid:0)L(cid:0)W(cid:0)2(cid:0)K(cid:0)U(cid:0)(cid:3) Other income (expense) results from capital gain on sale of property and equipment and onetime expenses.\n(cid:0)O(cid:0)Q(cid:0)L(cid:0)D(cid:0)F(cid:0)D(cid:0))(cid:0)L(cid:0)Q(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)H(cid:0)F(cid:0)L(cid:0)Q(cid:0)R(cid:0)P(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)(cid:15)(cid:0)H(cid:0)V(cid:0)H(cid:0)Q(cid:0)(cid:12)(cid:0)S(cid:0)(cid:11)(cid:0)[(cid:0)H(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)(cid:17)(cid:0)H(cid:0)Q(cid:0)W Financial income (expense), net consists of exchange rate and interest income or expense.

These accounting principles require management to make certain estimates, judgments and\nassumptions based upon information available at the time that they are made, historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances.\nThese estimates, judgments and assumptions can affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements, as well as the reported amounts of revenues\nand expenses during the periods presented. While all the accounting policies impact the financial statements, certain policies may be viewed to be critical. These policies are those that are\nboth most important to the portrayal of TATs financial condition and results of operations and require managements most difficult, subjective and complex judgments and estimates. Actual\nresults could differ from those estimates.\nIn many cases, the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by U.S. GAAP and does not require managements judgment in its application. There are\nalso areas in which managements judgment in selecting among available alternatives would not produce a materially different result. Management has reviewed these critical accounting\npolicies and related disclosures with TATs audit committee.\nTATs management believes the significant accounting policies which affect managements more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of TATs consolidated\nfinancial statements and which are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating the reported financial results include the following:\n Inventory valuation\n Income taxes\n Allowance for current expected credit losses (CECL)\nInventory valuation\nInventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realizable value. Cost of raw material and parts is determined using the moving average basis. Cost of work in progress and\nfinished products is calculated based on actual costs and the capitalized production costs, mainly labor and overhead and is determined based on the average basis. TATs policy for valuation\nof inventory and commitments to purchase inventory, including the determination of obsolete or excess inventory, requires it to perform a detailed assessment of inventory at each balance\nsheet date which includes a review of, among other factors, an estimate of future demand for products within specific time frames, valuation of existing inventory, as well as product\nlifecycle and product development plans. The business environment in which TAT operates, the wide range of products that TAT offers and the relatively short sales cycles TAT experiences,\nall contribute to the exercise of judgment relating to maintaining and writing-off of inventory levels. The estimates of future demand that TAT uses in the valuation of inventory are the basis\nfor its revenue forecast, which is also consistent with its short-term manufacturing plan. Inventory reserves are also provided to cover risks arising from slow-moving items. Inventory\nmanagement remains an area of management focus as TAT balances the need to maintain strategic inventory levels to ensure competitive lead times against the risk of inventory\nobsolescence due to changing technology and customer requirements. TAT writes down obsolete or slow-moving inventory in an amount equal to the difference between the cost of\ninventory and the net realizable value based upon assumptions about future demand, market conditions and sale forecasts.\nIf actual market conditions are less favorable than TAT anticipates, additional inventory write-downs may be required.\n39\nIncome Taxes\nTAT operates within multiple tax jurisdictions and is subject to audits in these jurisdictions. These audits can involve complex issues, which may require an extended period of time\nto resolve. In managements opinion, adequate provisions for income taxes have been made for all years. Although management believes that its estimates are reasonable, no assurance can\nbe given that the final tax outcome of these issues will not be different than those reflected in its historical income tax provisions.\nTAT uses the liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on temporary differences between the\nfinancial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities and net operating loss and credit carry forwards using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to\nreverse. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. Valuation allowances are established\nwhen it is more likely than not that some portion of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. To the extent that TATs decisions and assumptions and historical reporting are determined\nnot to be compliant with applicable tax laws, TAT may be subject to adjustments in its reported income for tax purposes as well as interest and penalties.\nAccording to an acceptable interpretation that prescribes a minimum recognition threshold a tax position is required to meet before being recognized in the financial statements. The\ninterpretation also provides guidance on de-recognition of tax positions, classification on the balance sheet, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure and transition. In\naddition, the interpretation requires significant judgment with respect to determining what constitutes an individual tax position as well as assessing the outcome of each tax position.\nChanges in judgment as to recognition or measurement of tax positions can materially affect the estimate of the effective tax rate and consequently, affect our operating results.\nLosses generated prior to January 1, 2018 will still be subject to the 20-year carryforward limitation. Other potential impacts due to the Act include the repeal of the domestic\nmanufacturing deduction, modification of taxation of controlled foreign corporations, a base erosion anti-abuse tax, modification of interest expense limitation rules, modification of\nlimitation on deductibility of excessive executive compensation, and taxation of global intangible low-taxed income.\nAllowances for Current Expected Credit Losses\nTAT performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers financial condition and requires collateral as deemed necessary. Accounts receivable have been reduced by an allowance\nfor current expected losses. The Company maintains the allowance for estimated losses resulting from the inability of the Companys customers to make required payments. In judging the\nadequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts, TAT considers multiple factors including the aging of receivables, historical bad debt experience and the general economic environment.\nManagement applies considerable judgment in assessing the realization of receivables, including assessing the probability of collection and the current credit worthiness of each customer. If\nthe financial condition of TATs customers were to deteriorate, resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments, additional allowances may be required.\nKey Indicators\nTATs management evaluates its performance by focusing on key performance indicators, which are revenues, sources of revenues, gross profit and operating income.

See\nRISK FACTORS for a description of governmental, economic, fiscal, monetary or political policies or factors (including the ongoing war and hostilities with Hamas and Hezbollah) that\nhave materially affected or could materially affect TATs operations.\n45\nTrade Relations\nIsrael is a member of the United Nations, the International Monetary Fund, the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development and the International Finance Corporation.\nIsrael is a member of the World Trade Organization and is a signatory to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. In addition, Israel has been granted preferences under the Generalized\nSystem of Preferences from the United States, Australia, Canada and Japan. These preferences allow Israel to export the products covered by such programs either duty-free or at reduced\ntariffs.\nIsrael and the European Union Community, known now as the European Union, concluded a Free Trade Agreement in July 1975 that confers some advantages with respect to\nIsraeli exports to most European countries and obligates Israel to lower its tariffs with respect to imports from these countries over a number of years. In 1985, Israel and the United States\nentered into an agreement to establish a Free Trade Area. The Free Trade Area has eliminated all tariff and some non-tariff barriers on most trade between the two countries. On January 1,\n1993, an agreement between Israel and the European Free Trade Association, known as the EFTA, established a free-trade zone between Israel and the EFTA nations. In November 1995,\nIsrael entered into a new agreement with the European Union, which includes a redefinition of rules of origin and other improvements, such as allowing Israel to become a member of the\nResearch and Technology programs of the European Union. In recent years, Israel has established commercial and trade relations with a number of other nations, including Russia, China,\nIndia, Turkey and other nations in Eastern Europe and the Asia-Pacific region.\nImpact of Currency Fluctuation and of Inflation\nTAT reports its financial results in dollars and receives payment primarily in dollars or dollar-linked NIS for all of its sales while it incurs a portion of its expenses, principally\nsalaries and related personnel expenses in Israel, in NIS. Additionally, certain assets, as well as a portion of its liabilities, are denominated in NIS. Therefore, the dollar cost of its operations\nis influenced by the extent to which any inflation in Israel is offset on a lagging basis or is not offset by the devaluation of the NIS in relation to the U.S. dollar. When the rate of inflation in\nIsrael exceeds the rate of devaluation of the NIS against the U.S. dollar, the dollar cost of operations in Israel increases. If the dollar cost of operations in Israel increases, its dollar-measured\nresults of operations will be adversely affected. It is uncertain whether TAT will be materially and adversely affected in the future if inflation in Israel exceeds the devaluation of the NIS\nagainst the dollar or if the timing of the devaluation lags behind inflation in Israel.\nBecause exchange rates between the NIS and the dollar fluctuate continuously, exchange rate fluctuations and especially larger periodic devaluations will have an impact on TATs\nprofitability and period-to-period comparisons of its results. The effects of foreign currency re-measurements are reported in TATs consolidated financial statements in current operations.\nAlthough TAT hedges a portion of its exchange rate risk through the use of forward contracts and other derivative instruments, there is no certainty that future results of operations may not\nbe materially adversely affected by currency fluctuations.\nCorporate Tax Rate\nIsraeli companies are generally subject to corporate tax on their taxable income (including capital gains). The regular corporate tax rate for Israel was 23% for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2021, December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2023.\nHowever, the rate is effectively reduced for income derived from Approved and Beneficiary Enterprises, as defined by the Law for the Encouragement of Capital Investments,\n1959, as amended.\nFor additional information, please see Item 10.E below (cid:0)(cid:15)(cid:0)(cid:20)(cid:0)(cid:28)(cid:0)(cid:24)(cid:0)(cid:28)(cid:0)Q(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)W(cid:0)H(cid:0)P(cid:0)W(cid:0)V(cid:0)Q(cid:0)V(cid:0),(cid:0)H(cid:0)W(cid:0)Y(cid:0)D(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)S(cid:0)O(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)&(cid:0)D(cid:0)L(cid:0)Q(cid:0)I(cid:0)H(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)W(cid:0)R(cid:0)J(cid:0)P(cid:0)D(cid:0)H(cid:0)R(cid:0)X(cid:0)U(cid:0)F(cid:0)((cid:0)K(cid:0)I(cid:0)Q(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)H(cid:0)Z(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)R(cid:0)U(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)W(cid:0)D(cid:0)W(cid:0)K(cid:0)H(cid:0)X(cid:0)G(cid:0)/(cid:0)U(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)Q(cid:0)H(cid:0)H(cid:0)I(cid:0)L(cid:0)[(cid:0)H(cid:0)W(cid:0)V(cid:0)D(cid:0)Q(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)%(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)7(cid:0)Q(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)(cid:16)(cid:0)D(cid:0)L(cid:0)R(cid:0)V(cid:0)U(cid:0)W(cid:0)H(cid:0)&(cid:0)R(cid:0)V(cid:0)L(cid:0)G(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)Q(cid:0)[(cid:0)D(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)7(cid:0)U(cid:0)D(cid:0)(cid:16)(cid:0)O(cid:0)V(cid:0)L(cid:0)H(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)W(cid:0),(cid:0)Q(cid:0)D(cid:0)L(cid:0)D(cid:0)[(cid:0)R(cid:0)7 .\nCertain investment income derived by TAT from investments may not be regarded by the Israeli tax authorities as income from TATs Preferred Enterprise and consequently may be\ntaxed at the regular statutory rate in Israel.\nCertain of TATs subsidiaries operate in and are subject to the tax laws of various other jurisdictions, primarily the United States. TATs U.S. subsidiaries are taxed based on federal\nand state tax laws. The U.S. federal statutory flat tax rate for tax years 2022 and 2023 is 21%.\n46\nRecently Issued Accounting Standards\nRecently adopted accounting pronouncements:\n1 In December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures. The amended guidance enhances income tax\ndisclosures primarily related to the effective tax rate reconciliation and income taxes paid information. This guidance requires disclosure of specific categories in the effective tax\nrate reconciliation and further information on reconciling items meeting a quantitative threshold. In addition, the amended guidance requires disaggregating income taxes paid (net\nof refunds received) by federal, state, and foreign taxes. It also requires disaggregating individual jurisdictions in which income taxes paid (net of refunds received) is equal to or\ngreater than 5 percent of total income taxes paid (net of refunds received). The amended guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024. The guidance can\nbe applied either prospectively or retrospectively. We are evaluating the impact this amended guidance may have on the footnotes to our consolidated financial statements.\n2. In November 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements\nto Reportable Segment Disclosures. The amended guidance requires incremental reportable segment disclosures, primarily about significant segment expenses. The amendments\nalso require entities with a single reportable segment to provide all disclosures required by these amendments, and all existing segment disclosures. The amendments will be applied\nretrospectively to all prior periods presented in the financial statements and is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, and interim periods in fiscal years\nbeginning after December 15, 2024, with early adoption permitted. We are evaluating the impact this amended guidance may have on the footnotes to our consolidated financial\nstatements.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOn December 21, 2023, TAT completed the issuance and sale of 1,158,600 Ordinary Shares of the Company in a private placement to Israeli institutional and accredited investors\n(as defined under Israels Securities Law, 5728-1968), for a purchase price of NIS 31.70 per share (which equaled $8.77 per share based on the exchange rate published by the Bank of Israel\nat such time), resulting in net proceeds to the Company, after deducting offering expenses, of approximately NIS 36.2 million (or approximately $10.0 million). The newly issued shares\nrepresent approximately 11.5% of the Companys issued and outstanding Ordinary Shares after the consummation of such sale.\nAs of December 31, 2023, TAT had cash and cash equivalents of $16.9 million compared to $ 8 million as of December 31, 2022, an increase of $8.9 million primarily due to the\nprivate placement.\nDuring 2023, TAT increased its loans and lines of credit from commercial banks by $1.7 million, and repaid loans in the amount of $1.7 million.\nDuring 2022, TAT received a loan from a commercial bank in the amount of $3.7 million. The loan bears annual interest rate of 6.65% (Prime Rate +0.9%) and is repaid in equal\nmonthly installment as of [April 2022] through March 2029. This new loan is in addition to four previous loans received during 2020 and 2021 in an aggregate amount of $6.3 million.\n47\nDuring 2022, TAT received loans from a commercial bank in the US in an aggregate amount of $7.9 million. These loans are secured with a first degree lien on TATs US\nsubsidiaries equipment. The loans bear annual interest of 3.75% and 4.2% and are repaid in equal monthly installments until 2029 and 2031. In addition, TAT received loans from Machinery\nFinance Resources in 2023 in the total amount of $0.7 million. The loans bear annual interest of 6.65% which are paid in equal monthly installments until 2028\nDuring 2022 TAT subsidiary received a credit line from a US commercial bank in the amount of $7 million with maturity date of February 2024 and carry an interest of\nWSJP+0.1% . During 2023, the Company utilized an additional $1 million from the credit line.\nDuring 2022 TAT received a long-term loan of $5 million from a commercial bank in the US, loan bears an annual fixed interest rate of 2.9% and maturity date of March 2024\nDuring 2023 the company secured another short term line of credit for the amount of $4.5 million from an Israeli bank. The companys building and land in Kiryat Gat serves as\ncollateral for this loan.\nFor more information about the company's loans please refer to Note 10 in the financial statements.\nCapital expenditures for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021 were approximately $2.9 million, $16.1 million and $15.6 million, respectively. TAT funded these\nexpenditures mainly from its own cash resources, cash flows from operations. TAT expects that its available cash and cash equivalents and cash flow generated from operations will be\nsufficient to fund its capital expenditures.\nManagement believes that anticipated cash flow from operations and its current cash balances will be sufficient to meet its cash requirements for at least 12 months from the\nfinancial statement issuance date. TATs future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including its rate of revenue growth, the expansion of its selling and marketing activities,\ncosts associated with expansion into new markets and the timing of the introduction of new products and services.\nCash Flows\nThe following table summarizes TATs cash flows for the periods presented:\nYear Ended December 31,\n(in thousands)\n2023 2022 2021\nNet cash provided by (used in) operating activities $ 2,255 $ (4,867) $ (2,269)\nNet cash used in investing activities (3,579) (16,120) (5,407)\nNet cash provided by financing activities 10,240 15,798 7,652\nNet cash provided by (used in) discontinued activities - - 153\nNet increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents 8,916 (5,189) 8,345\nCash and cash equivalents at beginning of the year 8,026 13,215 15,959\nCash and cash equivalents at end of the year $ 16,942 $ 8,026 $ 24,304\n48\nNet cash provided in operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2023, amounted to approximately $2.2 million, compared to net cash used in operating activities of ($4.9)\nmillion for the year ended December 31, 2022 and net cash used in by operating activities of ($2.3) million for the year ended December 31, 2021.\nNet cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2023 was impacted by the companys working capital needs.\nNet cash used in operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2023 was principally derived from the following adjustments of non-cash line items: an upward adjustment of\n$4.7 million for depreciation and amortization; an upward adjustment of $4.2 million for an increase in trade accrued expenses other; an offset adjustment of $5.4 million for inventory .; a\ndownward adjustment of $4.2 million for increase in trade accounts receivable.\nNet cash used in operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2022 was impacted by the company's restructuring plan costs with an amount of $1.7 million.\nNet cash used in operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2022 was principally derived from the following adjustments of non-cash line items: an upward adjustment of\n$3.7 million for depreciation and amortization; a upward adjustment of $1.1 million for an increase in trade accounts payable; an upward adjustment of $2.7 million for accrued expenses.\nThis was offset by a loss of $1.5 million; a downward adjustment of $5 million for increase in inventory; a downward adjustment of $2.6 million for increase in trade accounts receivable;\nand a downward adjustment of $1.8 million for increase in other current assets and prepaid expenses.\nNet cash used in operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2021 was impacted by the company's restructuring plan cost with a total amount of $0.58 million.\nNet cash used in operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2021 was principally derived from the following adjustments of non-cash line items: an upward adjustment of\n$4.8 million for depreciation and amortization; a upward adjustment of $2.6 million for increase in trade accounts payable; an upward adjustment of $1.8 million for impairment of fixed\nassets.

Board Practices\nIntroduction\nAccording to the Israeli Companies Law and our articles of association, the management of our business is vested in our board of directors. The board of directors may exercise all\npowers and may take all actions that are not specifically granted to another organ in the Company (including our shareholders). Our executive officers are responsible for our day-to-day\nmanagement. Our executive officers have individual responsibilities established by our chief executive officer and board of directors.\nElection of Directors\nOur articles of association provide for a board of directors consisting of such number of directors as may be determined from time to time at a general meeting of shareholders,\nprovided that it shall be no less than two or more than eleven. Our board of directors is currently composed of five directors, including three independent directors, two of whom also qualify\nas external directors within the meaning of the Israeli Companies Law.\nPursuant to our articles of association and in accordance with the Israeli Companies Law, our directors (except for the external directors) are elected at our annual general meeting\nof shareholders by a vote of the holders of a majority of the voting power represented and voting at such meeting; in addition, directors (except for external directors) may be appointed by a\nvote of a majority of directors then in office. All our directors (except for external directors) hold office until the annual general meeting of shareholders succeeding their election (provided\nthat if no directors are elected at the annual general meeting, the directors in office at the time such meeting was convened shall continue to hold their office) or until their earlier death,\nresignation, removal or other circumstances as set forth in the Israeli law. All the members of our board of directors (except for external directors) may be re-elected upon completion of\ntheir term of office.\nThe Israeli Companies Law requires the board of directors of a public company to determine a minimum number of directors with accounting and financial expertise. Our board\nof directors determined, accordingly, that at least two directors must have accounting and financial expertise as such term is defined by regulations promulgated under the Israeli\nCompanies Law.\nWe are exempt from the requirements of the NASDAQ Marketplace Rules with regard to the nomination process of directors since we are a controlled company within the meaning\nof NASDAQ Marketplace Rule 5615(c)(2). See below in this Item 6. Directors, Senior Management and Employees - Board Practices - NASDAQ Exemptions for a Controlled Company.\nExternal and Independent Directors\nU(cid:0)VR(cid:0)(cid:0)U(cid:0)HW(cid:0)(cid:0)D(cid:0)H(cid:0)O(cid:0)Q(cid:0)F(cid:0)W(cid:0)[(cid:0)((cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)L(cid:0)U(cid:0)’(cid:0) . Under the Israeli Companies Law, Israeli companies whose shares have been offered to the public or whose shares are listed in an authorized stock exchange\n(accordingly, such shares are considered as held by \"the public\") are required to appoint at least two external directors who meet the independence criteria set by the Israeli Companies Law.\n55\nA person is qualified to serve as an external director only if he or she has accounting and financial expertise or professional qualifications, as such terms are defined by the\nIsraeli Companies Regulations (Conditions and Criteria for a Director Who Possesses Accounting Expertise and a Director Who Possesses Professional Competence), 2005. At least one of\nthe external directors must have accounting and financial expertise. Each of our external directors has accounting and financial expertise.\nExternal directors are elected by a majority vote at a shareholders meeting. In addition to the majority vote, the shareholder approval of the election of an external director must\nsatisfy either of two additional tests:\n The majority includes at least a majority of the shares voted by shareholders other than controlling shareholders or shareholders who have a personal interest in the election of\nthe external directors (excluding a personal interest that is not related to a relationship with the controlling shareholders); or\n The total number of shares held by non-controlling shareholders and disinterested shareholders that voted against the election of the external director does not exceed 2% of the\naggregate voting rights of the company.\nIn general, external directors serve for a three-year term and may be re-elected to two additional three-year terms by one of the following mechanisms: (1) the board of directors\nproposes the re-election of the nominee and the re-election is approved by the majority required for appointment of external directors for their initial term; or (2) a shareholder holding 1% or\nmore of the company's voting rights proposes the re-election of the nominee, and the re-election is approved by a majority of the votes cast by the shareholders of the company, excluding\nthe votes of controlling shareholders or those who have a personal interest in the nomination, provided that the aggregate votes cast in favor of the re-election by shareholders who are not\ncontrolling shareholders and do not have a personal interest in the nomination constitute more than 2% of the company's voting rights. Israeli companies listed on certain stock exchanges\noutside Israel, including The NASDAQ Global Market, such as our company, may appoint an external director for additional terms of not more than three years subject to certain\nconditions. Such conditions include the determination by the audit committee and board of directors, that in view of the director's professional expertise and special contribution to the\ncompany's board of directors and its committees, the appointment of the external director for an additional term is in the best interest of the company.\nAn external director may be removed from office at the initiative of the board of directors at a special general meeting of shareholders, if the board resolves that the statutory\nrequirements for that persons appointment as external director no longer exist, or that the external director has violated his or her duty of loyalty to the company. The resolution of the\nspecial general meeting of shareholders regarding the termination of office of an external director requires the same majority that is required for the election of an external director. The court\nmay order the termination of the office of an external director on the same grounds, following a motion filed by a director or a shareholder. If an external directorship becomes vacant and as\na result there are fewer than two directors who serve as external directors in the company, the board of directors is required under the Israeli Companies law to convene a shareholder\nmeeting immediately to appoint a new external director.\nEach committee of the board of directors that is authorized to exercise powers vested in the board of directors must include at least one external director and the audit committee\nmust include all of the external directors. An external director is entitled to compensation as provided in regulations adopted under the Israeli Companies Law and is otherwise prohibited\nfrom receiving any other compensation, directly or indirectly, in connection with such service.\nUntil the lapse of two years from termination of office, we may not engage an external director or his spouse or child, to serve as an office holder and cannot employ or receive\nservices from these persons, either directly or indirectly, including through a corporation controlled by that person; and with regards to a related person (to a such external director) as\ndefined in the Israeli Companies law which is not a spouse or child  until the lapse of one year from termination of office.\nQ(cid:0)VHWU(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)Q(cid:0)HGRW(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)F(cid:0)GSH(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)(cid:0)H(cid:0)Q(cid:0),(cid:0)UL(cid:0)(cid:0)’(cid:0) . As a controlled company, within the meaning of NASDAQ Marketplace Rule 5615(c)(2), we are exempt from the NASDAQ Marketplace Rule which\nrequires that a majority of our board of directors qualify as independent directors, within the meaning of the NASDAQ Marketplace Rules. See Item 6. Directors, Senior Management and\nEmployees - Board Practices - NASDAQ Exemptions for a Controlled Company.\n56\nAudit Committee\nUnder the Israeli Companies Law, the board of directors of any public company must establish an audit committee. In general, the audit committee must consist of at least three\ndirectors and must include all of the external directors; furthermore, a majority of the audit committee members must comply with the director independence requirements prescribed by the\nIsraeli Companies Law. The audit committee may not include (i) the chairman of the board of directors, (ii) any director employed by the Company or by a controlling shareholder of the\ncompany (including a company which is controlled by the controlling shareholder), (iii) any director providing services to the company or to a controlling shareholder of the company\n(including to a company which is controlled by the controlling shareholder) on an ongoing basis, or (iv) a controlling shareholder or any of the controlling shareholders relatives.\nIn addition, the NASDAQ Marketplace Rules require us to establish an audit committee comprised of at least three members, all of whom must be independent directors, each of\nwhom is financially literate and satisfies the respective independence requirements of the SEC and NASDAQ and one of whom has accounting or related financial management expertise\nat senior levels within a company.\nOur audit committee acts also as a committee for the review and the approval of our financial statements, and as such, assists our board of directors in overseeing the accounting\nand financial reporting processes of our company and audits of our financial statements, including the integrity of our financial statements, compliance with legal and regulatory\nrequirements, our independent registered public accountants qualifications and independence, the performance of our internal audit function and independent registered public accountants,\nfinding any defects in the business management of our company and proposing to our board of directors ways to correct such defects, approving related-party (officers, directors, controlling\nshareholder, etc.) transactions with the company as required by Israeli law, examining the scope of work and the payment to our independent auditors and such other duties as may be\ndirected by our board of directors. The audit committee may consult from time to time with our independent auditors and internal auditor with respect to matters involving financial\nreporting and internal accounting controls.\nOur audit committee consists of three members of our board of directors (including two external directors and one independent director) who satisfy the respective independence\nrequirements of the SEC, NASDAQ and Israeli law for audit committee members. Our board of directors has determined that each member of our audit committee qualifies as an audit\ncommittee financial expert, as defined by rules of the SEC. The audit committee meets at least once each quarter.\nCompensation Committee\nUnder the Israeli Companies Law, the board of directors of any public company must establish a compensation committee. The compensation committee must consist of at least\nthree directors, include all of the external directors (including one external director serving as the chair of the compensation committee), and a majority of the committee members must\ncomply with the director independence requirements prescribed by the Israeli Companies Law. Similar to the rules that apply to the audit committee, the compensation committee may not\ninclude the chairman of the board, or any director employed by us, by a controlling shareholder or by any entity controlled by a controlling shareholder, or any director providing services to\nus, to a controlling shareholder or to any entity controlled by a controlling shareholder on a regular basis, or any director whose primary income is dependent on a controlling shareholder,\nand may not include a controlling shareholder or any of its relatives. Individuals who are not permitted to be compensation committee members may not participate in the committees\nmeetings other than to present a particular issue; provided, however, that an employee that is not a controlling shareholder or relative may participate in the committees discussions but not\nin any vote; other than the companys legal counsel and corporate secretary who may participate in the committees discussions and votes if requested by the committee.\nThe compensation committees duties include recommending to the board of directors a compensation policy for executives and monitor its implementation, approve compensation\nterms of executive officers, directors and employees affiliated with controlling shareholders, make recommendations to the board of directors regarding the issuance of equity incentive\nawards under our equity incentive plan and exempt certain compensation arrangements from the requirement to obtain shareholder approval under the Israeli Companies Law. The\ncompensation committee meets at least twice a year, with further meetings to occur, or actions to be taken by unanimous written consent, when deemed necessary or desirable by the\ncommittee or its chairperson.\nOur compensation committee consists of our two external directors and an independent director under the respective requirements of the SEC and NASDAQ and complies with the\nIsraeli Companies Law criteria for compensation committee members.\n57\nInternal Audit\nThe Israeli Companies Law requires the board of directors of a public company to appoint an internal auditor following a recommendation by the audit committee. The role of the\ninternal auditor is to examine, among other things, the companys compliance with applicable law and orderly business practice. The internal auditor must meet certain statutory\nrequirements of independence. Mr. Doron Cohen has served as our internal auditor since December 24, 2008.\nDirectors Service Contracts\nThere are no arrangements or understandings between us and any of our subsidiaries, on the one hand, and any of our directors, on the other hand, providing for benefits upon\ntermination of their employment or service as directors of our company or any of our subsidiaries.\nChairman of the Board\nUnder the Israeli Companies Law, the general manager of a company (or a relative of the general manager) may not serve as the chairman of the board of directors, and the\nchairman of the board of directors (or a relative of the chairman of the board of directors) may not serve as the general manager, unless approved by the shareholders by a special majority\nvote prescribed by the Israeli Companies Law. The shareholder vote cannot authorize the appointment for a period of longer than three years, which period may be extended from time to\ntime by the shareholders with a similar special majority vote. The chairman of the board of directors shall not hold any other position with the company (except as general manager if\napproved in accordance with the above procedure) or in any entity controlled by the company, other than as chairman of the board of directors of a controlled entity, and the company shall\nnot delegate to the chairman duties that, directly or indirectly, make him or her subordinate to the general manager.\nApproval of Related Party Transactions under Israeli Law\n(cid:0)O(cid:0)G(cid:0)U(cid:0)V(cid:0)R(cid:0)+(cid:0)H(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)I(cid:0)H(cid:0)L(cid:0)F(cid:0)I(cid:0)2(cid:0)I(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)X(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)R(cid:0)W(cid:0)V(cid:0)L(cid:0)H(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)’(cid:0)L(cid:0)L(cid:0)D(cid:0)U(cid:0)\\(cid:0)G(cid:0)F(cid:0))(cid:0)X\nThe Israeli Companies Law codifies the fiduciary duties that office holders, including directors and executive officers, owe to a company. An office holders fiduciary duties\nconsist of a duty of care and a duty of loyalty. The duty of care requires an office holder to act at a level of care that a reasonable office holder in the same position would employ under the\nsame circumstances. This includes the duty to utilize reasonable means to obtain (i) information regarding the business feasibility of a given action brought for his approval or performed by\nhim by virtue of his position and (ii) all other information of importance pertaining to the foregoing actions. The duty of loyalty requires that an office holder acts in good faith and for the\nbenefit of the company, including (i) avoiding any conflict of interest between the office holders position in the company and any other position he holds or his personal affairs, (ii) avoiding\nany competition with the companys business, (iii) avoiding exploiting any business opportunity of the company in order to receive personal gain for the office holder or others, and (iv)\ndisclosing to the company any information or documents relating to the companys affairs that the office holder has received by virtue of his position as an office holder.\n58\n(cid:0)H(cid:0)U(cid:0)V(cid:0)R(cid:0)O(cid:0)G(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)+(cid:0)I(cid:0)2(cid:0)I(cid:0)H(cid:0)L(cid:0)F(cid:0)W(cid:0)K(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)Z(cid:0)L(cid:0)W(cid:0)F(cid:0)R(cid:0)V(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)D(cid:0)Q(cid:0)U(cid:0)L(cid:0)D(cid:0)Q(cid:0)V(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)I(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)7(cid:0)D(cid:0)O(cid:0)R(cid:0)Y(cid:0)R(cid:0)S(cid:0)U(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)S(cid:0)H(cid:0)$(cid:0)U(cid:0)(cid:30)(cid:0)R(cid:0)O(cid:0)+(cid:0)G(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)I(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)2(cid:0)I(cid:0)H(cid:0)L(cid:0)F(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)Q(cid:0)W(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)R(cid:0)D(cid:0)V(cid:0)V(cid:0)H(cid:0)I(cid:0)U(cid:0)W(cid:0)H(cid:0)Q(cid:0)O(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0),(cid:0)V(cid:0)R(cid:0)D(cid:0)3(cid:0)U(cid:0)Q(cid:0)I(cid:0)H(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)R(cid:0)H(cid:0)X(cid:0)O(cid:0)R(cid:0)V(cid:0)U(cid:0)L(cid:0)’(cid:0)V(cid:0)F\nThe Israeli Companies Law requires that an office holder promptly, and no later than the first board meeting at which such transaction is considered, disclose any personal interest\nthat he or she may have and all related material information known to him or her and any documents in their position, in connection with any existing or proposed transaction by us. An\noffice holder who did not disclose his or her personal interests will be deemed as breaching his or her fiduciary duties. In addition, if the transaction is an extraordinary transaction, that is, a\ntransaction other than in the ordinary course of business or other than in accordance with market terms, or likely to have a material impact on the companys profitability, assets or liabilities,\nthe office holder must also disclose any personal interest held by the office holders spouse, sibling, parent, grandparent, child as well as sibling or parent of such person's spouse or the\nspouse of any of the above, or by any corporation in which the office holder or his relative (as defined in the Israeli Companies Law) is a 5% or greater shareholder, director or general\nmanager or in which he or she has the right to appoint at least one director or the general manager.\nUnder the Israeli Companies Law, in general, all arrangements as to compensation of office holders who are not directors (other than the Chief Executive Officer) require the\napproval of the compensation committee and the board of directors, including exculpation, insurance and indemnification of, or an undertaking to, indemnify an office holder who is not a\ndirector. The compensation of office holders who are directors and compensation of the Chief Executive Officer must be approved by the compensation committee, board of directors and\nthe general meeting of shareholders.\nSome transactions, actions and arrangements involving an office holder (or a third party in which an office holder has an interest) must be approved by the board of directors or as\notherwise provided for in a companys articles of association. If the transaction is an extraordinary transaction (which is defined as a transaction not in the ordinary course of business and\nfor a material value) such a transaction must be approved by the audit committee and by the board of directors itself, and under certain circumstances shareholder approval may be required.\nA director who has a personal interest in a transaction that is considered at a meeting of the board of directors or the audit committee may not be present during the board of directors or\naudit committee discussions and may not vote on the transaction, unless the transaction is not an extraordinary transaction or the majority of the members of the board or the audit committee\nhave a personal interest, as the case may be. In the event the majority of the members of the board of directors or the audit committee have a personal interest, then the approval of the\ngeneral meeting of shareholders is also required.\n(cid:0)V(cid:0)U(cid:0)H(cid:0)K(cid:0)O(cid:0)G(cid:0)H(cid:0)R(cid:0)K(cid:0)U(cid:0)Q(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)6(cid:0)D(cid:0)J(cid:0)O(cid:0)O(cid:0)L(cid:0)R(cid:0)R(cid:0)W(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)Q(cid:0)U(cid:0)W(cid:0)K(cid:0)&(cid:0)Q(cid:0)Z(cid:0)L(cid:0)L(cid:0)F(cid:0)R(cid:0)V(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)V(cid:0)D(cid:0)W(cid:0)Q(cid:0)U(cid:0)D(cid:0)7(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)O(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)R(cid:0)R(cid:0)D(cid:0)I(cid:0)Y(cid:0)U(cid:0)S(cid:0)$(cid:0)O(cid:0)G(cid:0)S(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)U(cid:0)(cid:30)(cid:0)R(cid:0)H(cid:0)K(cid:0)H(cid:0)D(cid:0)J(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)K(cid:0)U(cid:0)O(cid:0)L(cid:0)Q(cid:0)6(cid:0)R(cid:0)O(cid:0)U(cid:0)Q(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)&(cid:0)R(cid:0)W(cid:0)W(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)R(cid:0)D(cid:0)V(cid:0)V(cid:0)H(cid:0)I(cid:0)U(cid:0)W(cid:0)H(cid:0)Q(cid:0)O(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0),(cid:0)V(cid:0)R(cid:0)D(cid:0)3(cid:0)U(cid:0)Q(cid:0)I(cid:0)H(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)R(cid:0)H(cid:0)X(cid:0)O(cid:0)R(cid:0)V(cid:0)U(cid:0)L(cid:0)’(cid:0)V(cid:0)F\nThe disclosure requirements that apply to an office holder also apply to a transaction in which a controlling shareholder of the company has a personal interest. The Israeli\nCompanies Law provides that an extraordinary transaction with a controlling shareholder or an extraordinary transaction with another person in whom the controlling shareholder has a\npersonal interest or a transaction with a controlling shareholder or his relative regarding terms of service and employment, must be approved by the audit committee (or the compensation\ncommittee, as the case may be), the board of directors and the shareholders by a special majority, as follows. The shareholders approval must include the majority of shares voted at the\nmeeting. In addition to the majority vote, the shareholder approval must satisfy either of two additional tests:\n The majority includes at least a majority of the shares voted by shareholders who have no personal interest in the transaction; or\n The total number of shares held by disinterested shareholders that voted against the approval of the transaction does not exceed 2% of the aggregate voting rights of our\ncompany.\n59\nAccording to regulations promulgated under the Israeli Companies Law, certain extraordinary transactions between a public company and its controlling shareholder(s) do not\nrequire shareholder approval. In addition, under such regulations, directors compensation and employment arrangements in a public company do not require the approval of the\nshareholders if both the audit committee and the board of directors agree that such arrangements are solely for the benefit of the company or if the directors compensation does not exceed\nthe maximum amount of compensation for external directors determined by applicable regulations. Also, employment and compensation arrangements for an office holder that is a\ncontrolling shareholder of a public company do not require shareholder approval if certain criteria are met. The foregoing exemptions from shareholder approval will not apply if one or\nmore shareholders holding at least 1% of the issued and outstanding share capital of the company or of the companys voting rights, objects to the use of these exemptions provided that such\nobjection is submitted to the company in writing not later than fourteen days from the date of the filing of a report regarding the adoption of such resolution by the company. If such\nobjection is duly and timely submitted, then the transaction or compensation arrangement of the directors will require shareholders approval as detailed above.\nIn addition, a private placement of securities that will (i) cause a person to become a controlling shareholder or (ii) increase the relative holdings of a shareholder that holds 5% or\nmore of the companys outstanding share capital, or (iii) will cause any person to become, as a result of the issuance, a holder of more than 5% of the companys outstanding share capital in\na private placement in which 20% or more of the companys outstanding share capital prior to the placement are offered, the payment for which (in whole or in part) is not in cash or not\nunder market terms, requires approval by the board of directors and the shareholders of the company.\nCompensation of Executive Officers and Directors\nIn accordance with the Israeli Companies Law, we have adopted a compensation policy for our executive officers and directors. The purpose of the policy is to describe our overall\ncompensation strategy for our executive officers and directors and to provide guidelines for setting their compensation, as prescribed by the Israeli Companies Law. In accordance with the\nIsraeli Companies Law, the policy must be reviewed and readopted at least once every three years.\nApproval of the compensation committee, the board of directors and our shareholders, in that order, is required for the adoption of the compensation policy. The shareholders\napproval must include the majority of shares voted at the meeting. In addition to the majority vote, the shareholder approval must satisfy either of two additional tests:\n The majority includes at least a majority of the shares voted by shareholders other than our controlling shareholders or shareholders who have a personal interest in the adoption\nof the compensation policies; or\n The total number of shares held by non-controlling shareholders and disinterested shareholders that voted against the adoption of the compensation policies does not exceed 2%\nof the aggregate voting rights of our company.\nUnder the Israeli Companies Law, the compensation arrangements for officers (other than the Chief Executive Officer) who are not directors require the approval of the\ncompensation committee and the board of directors; provided, however, that if the compensation arrangement is not in compliance with our executive compensation policy, the arrangement\nmay only be approved by the compensation committee and the board of directors for special reasons to be noted, and the compensation arrangement shall also require a special shareholder\napproval. If the compensation arrangement is an immaterial amendment to an existing compensation arrangement of an officer who is not a director and is in compliance with our executive\ncompensation policy, the approval of the compensation committee is sufficient.\nArrangements regarding the compensation of the Chief Executive Officer and directors require the approval of the compensation committee, the board of directors and our\nshareholders, in that order. In certain limited cases, the compensation of a new Chief Executive Officer who is not a director may be the approved without approval of the shareholders.\n60\nH(cid:0)YL(cid:0)W(cid:0)(cid:0)Q(cid:0)H(cid:0)FQ(cid:0)(cid:0),(cid:3)(cid:0)(cid:0)KV(cid:0)(cid:0)D&(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)HO(cid:0)(cid:0)ED(cid:0)L(cid:0)(cid:0)U(cid:0)D(cid:0)9(cid:0)\nThe compensation committee and board of directors may adopt, from time to time, a cash incentive plan, which will set forth for each executive certain targets which form such\nexecutives on target cash payment (the On Target Cash Plan) and the rules or formula for calculation of the On Target Cash Plan payment once actual achievements are known.\nThe compensation committee and board of directors may include in the On Target Cash Plan predetermined thresholds and caps to correlate an executives On Target Cash Plan\npayments with actual achievements.\nThe actual payment of the annual On Target Cash Plan for the active chairman of the board of directors (the Active Chairman), the CEO and other executives in a given year shall\nbe capped as determined by our board of directors, but in no event shall exceed the ratio set forth in the table below.\nThe On Target Cash Plans may be composed based on a mix of (i) the company target; (ii) personal targets (KPIs); and (iii) personal evaluation.

The actual rate of compliance with the targets shall be calculated in accordance with the said reference points. Failure to comply with the minimum threshold of\nat least 75% of a specific target shall not entitle the executive to an On Target Cash Plan payment in respect of the said target. In the event of compliance at a rate of 75% or more with a\nspecific target, the annual On Target Cash Plan shall be calculated in accordance with a key (i.e. linear, steps, etc.) which shall determine  in relation to the point of compliance with the\ntarget  the amount of the payment in terms of a percentage of the executive annual base salary, all as shall be set forth in the On Target Cash Plan.

and\n Any fine or forfeiture imposed on the office holder.\n63\nPursuant to our articles of association, the total amount of indemnification that we will pay (in addition to amounts received from an insurance company, if any) to all officers of the\ncompany, in aggregate, shall not exceed, in all circumstances, more than 25% of the company's shareholders equity as set forth in the company's recent consolidated financial statements\nprior to the date that the indemnity is paid. Our articles of association include provisions which allow us to insure, indemnify and exempt our office holders, subject to the provisions of the\nIsraeli Companies Law.\nWe maintain a directors and officers liability insurance policy with a per claim and aggregate coverage limit of $10 million, including legal costs incurred in Israel. In addition,\nour audit committee, board of directors and shareholders resolved to indemnify our office holders, pursuant to a standard indemnification agreement that provides for indemnification of an\noffice holder in an aggregate amount not to exceed 25% of our equity capital (net worth). To date, we have provided letters of indemnification to all of our officers and directors.\nIn 2023, we adopted a Clawback Policy in compliance with the SEC rules and Nasdaq listing standards to recover any excess incentive-based compensation from current and\nformer executive officers after an accounting restatement. A copy of the policy is filed as an exhibit to this Annual Report.\nNASDAQ Exemptions for a Controlled Company\nWe are a controlled company within the meaning of NASDAQ Marketplace Rule 5615(c)(2), or Rule 5615(c)(2), because the FIMI Opportunity V, L.P. and FIMI Israel Opportunity\nFIVE, Limited Partnership (the FIMI Funds) beneficially own more than 50% of our voting shares.\nUnder Rule 5615(c)(2), a controlled company is exempt from the following requirements of NASDAQ Marketplace Rules 5605(b)(1), 5605(d) and 5605(e) that would otherwise\nrequire that:\n The majority of the companys board of directors qualifies as independent directors, as defined under NASDAQ Marketplace Rules.\n The compensation of the chief financial officer and all other executive officers be determined, or recommended to the board of directors for determination, either by (i) a\nmajority of the independent directors or (ii) a compensation committee comprised solely of independent directors.\n Director nominees must be selected or recommended for the board of directors, either by (a) a majority of independent directors or (b) a nominations committee comprised\nsolely of independent directors.\nWe intend to continue to rely on these exemptions provided under Rule 5615(c)(2).\nD. Employees\nAs of December 31, 2023, TAT and its subsidiaries employed 540 employees, of whom 449 were employed in manufacturing and quality control, 24 were employed in engineering\nand research and development and 67 were employed in general & administration, sales and marketing. Of such employees, 168 were located in Israel and 372 were employed by Limco and\nPiedmont located in the United States.\n64\nEmployees in Israel are employed under collective or individual employment agreements. Senior employees in special positions and members of management are employed under\nindividual agreements. Collective bargaining agreements are signed for specified terms and are renewed from time to time. During 2022, TAT's management and the union of TAT Israel\nagreed to enter into a new collective bargaining agreement with respect to employees of TAT Israel. The new agreement was signed on September 7, 2022 and will be in effect until April\n30, 2025.\nIn Turbochrom, a new collective bargaining agreement was signed with Turbochromes union on September 18, 2022, and will be in effect until April 30, 2025.\nCertain provisions of the collective bargaining agreements between the Histadrut (General Federation of Labor in Israel) and the Coordinating Bureau of Economic Organizations\n(including the Manufacturers Association of Israel) are applicable to our Israeli employees by order of the Israeli Ministry of Economy and Industry. These provisions concern mainly the\nlength of the workday, minimum daily wages for professional workers, pension contributions, insurance for work-related accidents, procedures for terminating employees, determination of\nseverance pay and other employment terms. We generally provide our employees with benefits and working conditions exceeding the required minimums. Furthermore, under the collective\nbargaining agreements, the wages of most of our employees are linked to the CPI in Israel, although the extent of the linkage is limited.\nIn addition, Israeli law generally requires severance pay upon the retirement or death of an employee or termination of employment without due cause. Furthermore, Israeli\nemployees and employers are required to pay predetermined sums to the National Insurance Institute which is similar to the United States Social Security Administration. These payments\namount to approximately 12% of wages, with the employee contributing approximately 43% and the employer approximately 56%.\nWe currently also generally grant senior employees based in Israel participation in a particular insurance product called management insurance. Management insurance provides a\ncombination of savings plan, insurance and severance pay benefits to the employee, giving the employee a lump sum payment upon retirement (rather than receiving annuity payments) and\nsecuring his or her right to receive severance pay, if legally entitled, upon termination of employment. In general, the employee contributes an amount equal to approximately 5% to 6% of\nhis or her wage and the employer contributes an additional amount of approximately 13-1/3% to 16% of such wage. Management insurance is not a legally mandated by Israeli law.\nLimco-Piedmont sponsors a 401(K) QACA safe harbor profit sharing plan covering substantially all of its employees in the United States. The plan requires the employer to\ncontribute a match which is currently done on a payroll period basis, matching 100% of the first 2% and 50% of the next 3%. In addition, the plan allows for a discretionary qualified non-\nelective contribution for the plan year.\nE. Share Ownership\nBeneficial Ownership of Executive Officers and Directors\nExcept as set forth under Stock Option Plans and in Item 7A below, none of our directors and executive officers beneficially owns more than 1% of our outstanding shares.\n65\nStock Option Plans\nIn November 2011, our audit committee and board of directors approved a stock option plan (the 2012 Plan), which was subsequently approved by TATs shareholders, on June\n28, 2012. According to the 2012 Plan an aggregate of 980,000 options exercisable into up to 980,000 ordinary shares, 0.9 NIS par value, of TAT may be granted to certain members of our\nboard of directors and certain senior executives at an exercise price not less than the fair market value of the shares covered by the option on the date of grant.\nOn August 30, 2018 the Company's compensation committee, followed by the Board of Directors, approved the amended and restated company's 2012 Plan. On October 4, 2018\nthe company's amended and restated 2012 Plan was approved at the annual general meeting of shareholders. As part of the company's 2012 Plans amendments it was determined that if the\nCompany declares a cash dividend to its shareholders, and the distribution date of such dividend will precede the exercise date of an Option, including for the avoidance of doubt, Options\nthat have yet to become vested and Options which have been granted prior to the adoption of such amendment to the Plan, the exercise price of the option shall be reduced in the amount\nequal to the cash dividend per share distributed by the Company.\nFollowing the approval of TAT's audit committee and board of directors, on November 8, 2022 the Companys shareholders approved the 2022 stock option plan (the 2022 Plan,\nand together with the 2012 Plan, the Plans). According to the 2022 Plan an aggregate of 550,000 options exercisable into up to 550,000 ordinary shares, 0.9 NIS par value, of TAT may be\ngranted to certain members of our board of directors and certain senior executives at an exercise price not less than the fair market value of the shares covered by the option on the date of\ngrant\nTotal aggregate option pool under the Plans is 1,530,000 ordinary share of the company.\nIn general, the options under the Plans vest over a period of 4 years as follows: 25% of the options vest upon the lapse of 12 months following the date of grant and the remaining\n75% vest on a quarterly basis over the remaining 3-year period. Pursuant to the Plans, any options that are cancelled or not exercised within the option period determined in the relevant\noption agreement will become available for future grants.\nThe grant of options to Israeli employees under the Plans is subject to the terms stipulated by Sections 102 and 102A of the Israeli Income Tax Ordinance. Each option grant is\nsubject to the track chosen by the Company, either Section 102 or Section 102A of the Israeli Income Tax Ordinance, and pursuant to the terms thereof, the Company is not allowed to claim\nas an expense for tax purposes the amounts credited to employees as benefits, including amounts recorded as salary benefits in the Companys accounts, in respect of options granted to\nemployees under the Plans, with the exception of the work income benefit component, if any, determined on grant date. For nonemployees and for non-Israeli employees, the share option\nplan is subject to Section 3(i) of the Israeli Income Tax Ordinance.\nAs of December 31, 2023, options to purchase 625,000 ordinary shares were outstanding under the Plan, exercisable at an average exercise price of $7.31 per share.\nF.

The newly\nissued shares represented approximately 11.5% of the Companys issued and outstanding Ordinary Shares after the consummation of such sale.\nMajor Shareholders Voting Rights\nOur major shareholders do not have different voting rights.\nRecord Holders\nBased on a review of the information provided to us by our transfer agent, as of December 31, 2023, there were 32 holders of record of our ordinary shares, of which 29 record\nholders holding less than 1.0% of our ordinary shares had registered addresses in the United States. These numbers are not representative of the number of beneficial holders of our shares\nnor is it representative of where such beneficial holders reside since many of these ordinary shares were held by brokers or other nominees including CEDE & Co., the nominee for the\nDepositary Trust Company (the central depositary for the U.S. brokerage community), which held approximately 69% of our outstanding ordinary shares as of such date.\nB.

For a discussion of these matters, see Note 15 to our consolidated financial\nstatements included elsewhere in this annual report.\nDividend Distribution Policy\nWe may declare a dividend to be paid to the holders of our ordinary shares in proportion to their respective shareholdings. Under the Israeli Companies Law, dividend distributions\nare determined by the board of directors and do not require the approval of the shareholders of a company unless the companys articles of association provide otherwise. Our Articles do not\nrequire shareholder approval of a dividend distribution and provide that dividend distributions may be determined by our board of directors.\nPursuant to the Israeli Companies Law, the distribution amount is limited to the greater of retained earnings or earnings generated over the previous two years, according to our then\nlast reviewed or audited financial statements (less the amount of previously distributed dividends, if not reduced from the earnings), provided that the end of the period to which the financial\nstatements relate is not more than six months prior to the date of the distribution. If we do not meet such criteria, then we may distribute dividends only with court approval. In each case, we\nare only permitted to distribute a dividend if our board of directors and, if applicable, the court determines that there is no reasonable concern that payment of the dividend will prevent us\nfrom satisfying our existing and foreseeable obligations as they become due. In the event of our liquidation, after satisfaction of liabilities to creditors, our assets will be distributed to the\nholders of our ordinary shares in proportion to their shareholdings.\nB.

Exchange Controls\nIsraeli law and regulations do not impose any material foreign exchange restrictions on non-Israeli holders of our ordinary shares. In May 1998, a new general permit was issued\nunder the Israeli Currency Control Law, 1978, which removed most of the restrictions that previously existed under such law, and enabled Israeli citizens to freely invest outside of Israel\nand freely convert Israeli currency into non-Israeli currencies.\nNon-residents of Israel who purchase our ordinary shares will be able to convert dividends, if any, thereon, and any amounts payable upon our dissolution, liquidation or winding\nup, as well as the proceeds of any sale in Israel of our ordinary shares to an Israeli resident, into freely-repatriable dollars, at the exchange rate prevailing at the time of conversion, provided\nthat the Israeli income tax has been withheld (or paid) with respect to such amounts or an exemption has been obtained.\nE. Taxation\nThe following is a discussion of Israeli and United States tax consequences material to our shareholders. To the extent that the discussion is based on new tax legislation which has\nnot been subject to judicial or administrative interpretation, the views expressed in the discussion might not be accepted by the tax authorities in question. The discussion is not intended, and\nshould not be construed, as legal or professional tax advice and does not exhaust all possible tax considerations.\nYou are urged to consult your own tax advisor as to the Israeli, United States and other tax consequences of the purchase, ownership and disposition of our ordinary shares,\nincluding, in particular, the effect of any non-Israeli, state or local taxes.\nIsraeli Tax Considerations\nThe following is a summary of the principal Israeli tax laws applicable to us, of the Israeli Government programs from which we benefit and of the Income Tax Law (Inflationary\nAdjustments), 1985. This section also contains a discussion of material Israeli tax consequences to our shareholders who are not residents or citizens of Israel. This summary does not\ndiscuss all aspects of Israeli tax law that may be relevant to a particular investor in light of his or her personal investment circumstances, or to some types of investors subject to special\ntreatment under Israeli law. Examples of investors subject to special treatment under Israeli law include residents of Israel, traders in securities, or persons who own, directly or indirectly,\n10% or more of our outstanding voting capital, all of whom are subject to special tax regimes not covered in this discussion. Some parts of this discussion are based on new tax legislation\nthat has not been subject to judicial or administrative interpretation. The discussion should not be construed as legal or professional tax advice and does not cover all possible tax\nconsequences.\nGeneral Corporate Tax Structure\nIsraeli companies are generally subject to corporate tax on their taxable income at the rate of 23% in 2018 and thereafter. However, the effective tax rate payable by a company that\nderives income from an Approved Enterprise, a Benefited Enterprise, a Preferred Enterprise or a Technology Enterprise may be considerably less. Capital Gain derived by an Israeli resident\ncompany and / or royalties for which no tax clearance has been obtained from the ITA are subject to tax at the regular corporate tax rate (23% in 2019 and thereafter).\nTax Benefits under the Law for the Encouragement of Capital Investments, 1959\nWe have one capital investment program that has been granted Approved Enterprise status under the Investment Law, and one program that qualify as a Benefited Enterprise\npursuant to an amendment to the Investment Law that came into effect on April 1, 2005 (the April 2005 amendment). These programs were waived as part of the \"Preferred Enterprise\"\nwhich is part of the \"2011 Amendment\".\n72\nPrior to the April 2005 amendment, the Investment Law provided that capital investments in a production facility (or other eligible assets), may be designated as an Approved\nEnterprise upon prior approval from the Investment Center of the Israel Ministry of Industry, Trade and Labor (the Investment Center).\nThe April 2005 amendment revised the criteria for investments qualified to receive tax benefits. An eligible investment program under that amendment provided for benefits as a\nBenefited Enterprise (rather than the previous terminology of Approved Enterprise). Among other things, the April 2005 amendment provided tax benefits to both local and foreign\ninvestors. Companies that meet the specified criteria received the tax benefits without need for prior approval and instead, a company was to claim the tax benefits offered by the Investment\nLaw directly in its tax returns.\nThe period of tax benefits for the then new beneficiary enterprise commences in the year that is the later of: (i) the year in which taxable income is first generated by a company, or\n(ii) a year selected by the company for commencement, on the condition that the company meets certain provisions provided by the Investment Law. The amendment does not apply to\ninvestment programs approved prior to December 31, 2004 and applies only to new investment programs. We began to generate income under the provision of the new amendment as of the\nbeginning of 2006.\nAfter expiration of the initial tax exemption period, the company is eligible for what was considered then a reduced corporate tax rate of 10% to 25%, depending on the extent of\nforeign investment in the company, for the following five to eight years, depending on the geographic location of the Benefited Enterprise within Israel. The benefits period was limited to\n12 years from completion of the investment under the approved plan or 14 years from the date of the approval, whichever is earlier. A company in which more than 25% of the shareholders\nare non-residents of Israel, defined under the Investment Law as a Foreign Investors Company, may be eligible for benefits for an extended period of up to ten years.\nIn addition, pursuant to a recent amendment of the Law, any distribution of dividend as of August 15, 2021 will be prorated between exempt income and taxable income. As such,\nupon dividend distribution, in case the company has accumulated exempt income, the company will be obligated to pay the corporate income tax it was exempted from with respect to the\nexempt profits portion. Distribution of dividends derived from Approved Enterprise and Benefited Enterprise income that was taxed at reduced rates, but not tax exempt, does not result in\nadditional tax consequences to the company. Shareholders who receive dividends derived from approved enterprise and Benefited Enterprise income were generally taxed at a rate of 15%\nwhich was withheld and paid by the company paying the dividend if the dividend was distributed during the benefits period or within the following 12 years.\nThe benefits available to an Approved Enterprise and Benefited Enterprise were conditioned upon terms stipulated in the Investment Law and the related regulations (which include\nmaking specified investments in property and equipment, and financing a percentage of these investments with share capital), and, for an Approved Enterprise, the conditions contained in\nthe certificate of approval from the Investment Center. If we do not fulfill these conditions, in whole or in part, the benefits can be cancelled and we may be required to refund the amount of\nthe benefits, linked to the CPI in Israel plus interest. We believe that our Approved Enterprise and Benefited Enterprise programs were operated in compliance with all applicable conditions\nand criteria.\nWe had derived a material portion of our operating income from our Approved Enterprise and Benefited Enterprise facilities. We were therefore eligible for a tax exemption for a\nlimited period on undistributed Approved Enterprise and Benefited Enterprise income. We intend to reinvest the entire amount of our tax-exempt income and not to distribute this income as\na dividend\nUntil December 31, 2010, TAT and Turbochrome have elected to participate in the alternative package of tax benefits for their Approved and Benefited Enterprise under the law.\nPursuant to such Law, the income derived from those enterprises was exempted from Israeli corporate tax for a specified benefit period (except to the extent that dividends are\ndistributed during the tax-exemption period other than upon liquidation) and subject to reduced corporate tax rates for an additional period.\n73\nTax Benefits under the 2011 Amendment\nUnder the transitional provisions of the 2011 Amendment, the company elected to irrevocably implement the 2011 Amendment with respect to its existing Approved and\nBeneficiary Enterprises while waiving benefits provided under the legislation prior to the 2011 Amendment.\nDividends paid out of income attributed to a Preferred Enterprise will be subject to a withholding tax at the source at the rate of 20%, or such lower rate as may be provided in an\napplicable tax treaty. However, if such dividends are paid to an Israeli company, no tax is required to be withheld (although, if the funds are subsequently distributed to individuals or to non-\nIsraeli residents (individuals and corporations), the withholding tax would apply).\nAs of January 1, 2014, a Preferred Company is entitled to a reduced corporate tax rate of 16% with respect to its income derived from its Preferred Enterprise, unless the Preferred\nEnterprise is located in development area A, in which case the tax rate as of January 1, 2017 was 7.5% (our operations are currently not located in development area A). Income which is not\nderived from Preferred Enterprise is subject to the regular corporate tax rate (23% in tax year 2018 and thereafter).\nTAT is located in an area in Israel that is designated as elsewhere and as such is entitled to reduce tax rates of 16% (as of 2014).\nTurbochrome is located in an area in Israel that is designated as Zone A and as such entitled to reduce tax rates of 7.5% (as of 2017).\nTax Benefits under the 2017 Amendment\nAn amendment to the Investment Law, which became effective as of January 1, 2017, provides new tax benefit to Preferred companies for two types of \"Technology Enterprise\", as\ndescribed below, and is in addition to the other existing tax beneficial programs under the Investment Law.\nThe new incentives regime will apply to \"Preferred Technological Enterprises\" that meet certain conditions, as detailed in the 2017 amendment. Preferred Technological Enterprises\nwill be subject to a corporate tax rate of 12% unless the Preferred Technological Enterprise is located in development zone A, in which case the rate will be 7.5% with respect to the portion\nof income derived from intellectual property developed in Israel. The withholding tax on dividends from income derived from intellectual property of the Preferred Technological\nEnterprises will be 4% for dividends paid to a foreign parent company holding at least 90% of the shares of the distributing company. For other dividend distributions, the withholding tax\nrate will be 20% (or a lower rate under a tax treaty, if applicable).\nWe cannot assure you that we will continue to qualify as an Industrial Company or that the benefits described above will be available to us in the future.\nTax Benefits and Grants for Research and Development\nIsraeli tax law allows, under specific conditions, a tax deduction in the year incurred for expenditures, including capital expenditures, relating to scientific research and development\nprojects, if the expenditures are approved by the relevant Israeli government ministry, determined by the field of research, and the research and development is for the promotion of the\ncompany and is carried out by or on behalf of the company seeking such deduction. Expenditures not so approved are deductible over a three-year period. However, expenditures from\nproceeds made available to us through government grants are not deductible according to Israeli law.\n74\nTax Benefits under the Law for the Encouragement of Industry (Taxes), 1969\nAccording to the Law for the Encouragement of Industry (Taxes), 1969 (the Industry Encouragement Law), an Industrial Company is an Israeli resident company, with at least\n90% of the income of which, in a given tax year, (exclusive of income from some government loans) is derived from an Industrial Enterprise owned by it and located in Israel or in the\n\"Area\", in accordance with the definition in the section 3a of the Ordinance. An Industrial Enterprise is defined as an enterprise whose major activity in a given tax year is industrial\nproduction activity.\nUnder the Industry Encouragement Law, Industrial Companies are entitled to the following tax benefits:\n Amortization of purchases of acquired technology and patents over an eight-year period for tax purposes;\n Amortization of specified expenses incurred in connection with a public issuance of securities over a three-year period for tax purposes;\n Right to elect, under specified conditions, to file a consolidated tax return with additional related Israeli Industrial Companies; and\n Accelerated depreciation rates on equipment and buildings.\nEligibility for benefits under the Industry Encouragement Law is not subject to receipt of prior approval from any governmental authority.\nSpecial Provisions Relating to Taxation under Inflationary Conditions\nThe Income Tax Law (Inflationary Adjustments), 1985, referred to as the Inflationary Adjustments Law, attempts to overcome the problems presented to a traditional tax system by\nan economy undergoing rapid inflation. The Inflationary Adjustments Law is highly complex.\nOn February 26, 2008, the Israeli Parliament (the Knesset) enacted the Income Tax Law (Inflationary Adjustments) (Amendment No. 20) (Restriction of Effective Period), 2008\n(the Inflationary Adjustments Amendment). In accordance with the Inflationary Adjustments Amendment, as of the 2008 tax year the provisions of the law are no longer apply, other than\nthe transitional provisions intended at preventing distortions in the tax calculations. In accordance with the Inflationary Adjustments Amendment, commencing the 2008 tax year, income\nfor tax purposes is no longer be adjusted to a real (net of inflation) measurement basis. Furthermore, the depreciation of inflation immune assets and carried forward tax losses are no longer\nlinked to the CPI in Israel.\nTaxation of Dividends Paid on our Ordinary Shares\n(cid:0)V(cid:0)G(cid:0)U(cid:0)R(cid:0)H(cid:0)K(cid:0)H(cid:0)O(cid:0)U(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)K(cid:0)O(cid:0)D(cid:0)6(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0),(cid:0)L(cid:0)I(cid:0)D(cid:0)H(cid:0)Q(cid:0)V(cid:0)U(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)R(cid:0)L(cid:0)R(cid:0)D(cid:0)[(cid:0)W(cid:0)D(cid:0)7\nA distribution of dividends from income, which is not attributed to an Approved Enterprise/ Benefited Enterprise/ Preferred Enterprise to an Israeli resident individual, will\ngenerally be subject to Israeli income tax, at the rate of 25%, or 30% for a recipient that is a \"Controlling Shareholder\" (within the meaning of the Israeli Income Tax Ordinance) at the time\nof distribution or at any time during the 12-month period preceding such distribution.\nHowever, dividends distributed from taxable income accrued during the benefits period of a Benefited Enterprise, subject to certain time limitations, are generally subject to Israeli\nincome tax at the reduced rate of 15%. Dividends paid out of income attributed to a Preferred Enterprise are generally subject to Israeli income tax at the source at the rate of 20%.\n75\nGenerally, Israeli resident corporations are exempt from Israeli corporate tax on the receipt of dividends paid on shares of Israeli resident corporations and that the dividends were\nfully taxed at the corporate tax rate in Israel, unless the dividends are distributed from taxable income that has accrued during the benefits period of Approved Enterprise of Benefited\nEnterprise, in which case they are taxable at the rate of 15%.\nIn addition, a 3% surtax will apply with respect to individuals on top of the aforementioned tax rates when annual taxable income exceeds NIS 698,280 (with respect to 2023). The\namount is updated every year.\nIt should be noted that we cannot assure you that we will designate the profits that are being distributed in a way that will reduce shareholders tax liability to those tax rates.\n(cid:0)U(cid:0)V(cid:0)O(cid:0)G(cid:0)H(cid:0)H(cid:0)R(cid:0)D(cid:0)U(cid:0)K(cid:0)O(cid:0)L(cid:0)H(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)6(cid:0)K(cid:0)D(cid:0)Q(cid:0),(cid:0)V(cid:0)U(cid:0)(cid:16)(cid:0)R(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)1(cid:0)Q(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)R(cid:0)W(cid:0)L(cid:0)R(cid:0)I(cid:0)D(cid:0)[(cid:0)D(cid:0)7\nThe Ordinance generally provides that a non-Israeli resident (either individual or corporation) is subject to, an Israeli income tax at the rate of 25%, or 30% if the recipient is a\n\"Controlling Shareholder\" at the time of distribution or at any time during the 12-month period preceding such distribution, unless a different rate is provided in a treaty between Israel and\nthe shareholders country of residence.\nAs aforesaid, dividends derived from any of our income generated by an Approved Enterprise or Benefited Enterprise, are subject to withholding tax at a rate of 15% (or less based\non applicable tax treaty), and dividends derived from any of our income generated by a Preferred Enterprise are subject to withholding tax at a rate of 20% (or less based on applicable tax\ntreaty).\nIt should be noted that 3% surtax will apply on individuals on top of the aforementioned tax rates when annual taxable income exceeds NIS 698.280 (with respect to 2023). The\namount is updated every year.\nUnder the United States-Israel Tax Treaty, the maximum rate of tax withheld at source in Israel on dividends paid to a holder of our ordinary shares who is a U.S. resident (for\npurposes of the United States-Israel Tax Treaty) is 25%. However, generally the maximum rate of withholding tax on dividends, not generated by Approved / Benefited / Preferred\nEnterprises, that are paid to a U.S. corporation holding at least 10% or more of our outstanding voting capital from the start of the tax year preceding the distribution of the dividend through\n(and including) the distribution of the dividends, is 12.5%, provided that no more than 25% of our gross income of such preceding year consists of certain types of dividends and interest if a\ncertificate for a reduced withholding tax rate is obtained in advance from the Israeli Tax Authority. Notwithstanding the foregoing, dividends distributed from income attributed to an\nApproved Enterprise, Benefited Enterprise or a Preferred Enterprise are subject to withholding tax rate of 15% for such a U.S. corporation shareholder, provided that the condition related to\nour gross income for the previous year (as set forth in the previous sentence) is met.\nThe aforementioned rates under the United States-Israel Tax Treaty will not apply if the dividend income was derived through a permanent establishment of the U.S. resident in\nIsrael.\nWhen the amount of tax due is not fully withheld at source, such non-Israeli resident is obligated to file a tax return, report his or her Israeli income and pay the balance of the\namount of tax due.\nCapital gains taxes applicable to non-Israeli shareholders\nCapital gains from the sale of our ordinary shares by non-Israeli shareholders are exempt from Israeli taxation, provided that the capital gain is not derived from a permanent\nestablishment in Israel according to section 97(b2) to the Israeli income tax ordinance. In addition, the U.S.-Israel Tax Treaty exempts U.S. residents who hold less than 10% of our voting\nrights, and who held less than 10% of our voting rights during the 12 months prior to a sale of their shares, from Israeli capital gains tax in connection with such sale.\n76\nUnited States Federal Income Tax Consequences\n(cid:0)H(cid:0)7(cid:0)K(cid:0)J(cid:0)Z(cid:0)L(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)Q(cid:0)O(cid:0)O(cid:0)R(cid:0)I(cid:0)R(cid:0)Q(cid:0)X(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)L(cid:0)V(cid:0)L(cid:0)V(cid:0)F(cid:0)R(cid:0)V(cid:0)G(cid:0)D(cid:0)V(cid:0)L(cid:0)P(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)](cid:0)P(cid:0)H(cid:0)U(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)V(cid:0)X(cid:0)K(cid:0)H(cid:0)W(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)D(cid:0)O(cid:0)U(cid:0)L(cid:0)W(cid:0)D(cid:0)H(cid:0)P(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)(cid:17)(cid:0)6(cid:0)(cid:17)(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)8(cid:0)U(cid:0)O(cid:0)H(cid:0)D(cid:0)G(cid:0)I(cid:0)H(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)H(cid:0)P(cid:0)Q(cid:0)R(cid:0)F(cid:0)L(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)V(cid:0)[(cid:0)Q(cid:0)W(cid:0)D(cid:0)L(cid:0)R(cid:0)U(cid:0)D(cid:0)H(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)U(cid:0)R(cid:0)Q(cid:0)V(cid:0)W(cid:0)L(cid:0)H(cid:0)G(cid:0)O(cid:0)O(cid:0)O(cid:0)H(cid:0)Q(cid:0)\\(cid:0)F(cid:0)J(cid:0)D(cid:0)E(cid:0)H(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)O(cid:0)D(cid:0)L(cid:0)F(cid:0)S(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)S(cid:0)W(cid:0)D(cid:0)R(cid:0)(cid:15)(cid:0)D(cid:0)H(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)H(cid:0)K(cid:0)V(cid:0)S(cid:0)F(cid:0)W(cid:0)U(cid:0)K(cid:0)V(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)K(cid:0)L(cid:0)Q(cid:0)H(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)Z(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)X(cid:0)R(cid:0)D(cid:0)G(cid:0)S(cid:0)U(cid:0)Q(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)Q(cid:0)W(cid:0)L(cid:0)R(cid:0)V(cid:0)R(cid:0)V(cid:0)G(cid:0)S(cid:0)L(cid:0)L(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)R(cid:0)I(cid:0)D(cid:0)U(cid:0)V(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)U(cid:0)(cid:17)(cid:0)L(cid:0)H(cid:0)Q(cid:0)\\(cid:0)R(cid:0)X(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)G(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)D(cid:0)R(cid:0)K(cid:0)U(cid:0)U(cid:0)V\n(cid:0)V(cid:0)O(cid:0)W(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)D(cid:0)V(cid:0)V(cid:0)(cid:17)(cid:0)H(cid:0)L(cid:0)W(cid:0)D(cid:0)S(cid:0)V(cid:0)D(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)D(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)F(cid:0)V(cid:0)H(cid:0)D(cid:0)V(cid:0)G(cid:0)K(cid:0)U(cid:0)D(cid:0)U(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)L(cid:0)Q(cid:0)\\(cid:0)U(cid:0)R(cid:0)L(cid:0)U(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)H(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)W(cid:0)K(cid:0)K(cid:0)O(cid:0)G(cid:0)R(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)R(cid:0)K(cid:0)Z(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)Z(cid:0)(cid:12)(cid:0)O(cid:0)R(cid:0)G(cid:0)H(cid:0)I(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)E(cid:0)L(cid:0)H(cid:0)Q(cid:0)H(cid:0)D(cid:0)G(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)G(cid:0)V(cid:0)U(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)V(cid:0)R(cid:0)+(cid:0)H(cid:0)O(cid:0)(cid:11)(cid:0)(cid:17)(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)H(cid:0)6(cid:0)(cid:17)(cid:0)8(cid:0)D(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)U(cid:0)W(cid:0)H(cid:0)K(cid:0)W(cid:0)D(cid:0)V(cid:0)O(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)G(cid:0)U(cid:0)K(cid:0)R(cid:0)H(cid:0)K(cid:0)D(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)V(cid:0)K(cid:0)U(cid:0)Z(cid:0)L(cid:0)W(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)R(cid:0)O(cid:0)\\(cid:0)O(cid:0)V(cid:0)Q(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)\\(cid:0)D(cid:0)H(cid:0)U(cid:0)G(cid:0)D(cid:0)V(cid:0)P(cid:0)P(cid:0)K(cid:0)V(cid:0)X(cid:0)(cid:15)(cid:0)L(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)G(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)W(cid:0)W(cid:0)H(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)V(cid:0)W(cid:0)D(cid:0)Z(cid:0)L(cid:0)V(cid:0)H(cid:0)U(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)H(cid:0)V(cid:0)V(cid:0)O(cid:0)R(cid:0)W(cid:0)H(cid:0)K(cid:0)Q(cid:0)8\nAs used in this section, the term U.S. Holder means a beneficial owner of an ordinary share who is:\n An individual citizen or resident of the United States or an individual treated as a U.S. citizen or resident for U.S. federal income tax purposes;\n A corporation or other entity taxable as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes created or organized in or under the laws of the United States, any State or the\nDistrict of Columbia;\n An estate, the income of which is subject to U.S. federal income taxation regardless of its source; or\n Any trust if (A)(i) a court within the United States is able to exercise primary supervision over the administration of the trust and (ii) one or more United States persons have\nthe authority to control all substantial decisions of the trust, or (B) such trust validly elects to be treated as a United States person.\nThe term Non-U.S. Holder means a beneficial owner of an ordinary share that is an individual, corporation, estate or trust and is not a U.S. Holder. The tax consequences to a\nNon-U.S. Holder may differ substantially from the tax consequences to a U.S. Holder. Certain aspects of U.S. federal income tax relevant to a Non-U.S. Holder are discussed below.\nThis description is based on provisions of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code), existing and proposed U.S. Treasury regulations promulgated\nthereunder, administrative and judicial interpretations thereof, and the U.S.-Israel Tax Treaty, each as in effect as of the date of this annual report. In addition, this description also relates to\nthe Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) signed into law on December 22, 2017. These sources may change, possibly with retroactive effect, and are open to differing interpretations. This\ndescription does not discuss all aspects of U.S. federal income taxation that may be applicable to investors in light of their particular circumstances or to investors who are subject to special\ntreatment under U.S. federal income tax law, including:\n Insurance companies;\n Dealers in stocks, securities or currencies;\n Financial institutions and financial services entities;\n Real estate investment trusts;\n Regulated investment companies;\n Persons that receive ordinary shares in connection with the performance of services;\n Tax-exempt organizations;\n Persons that hold ordinary shares as part of a straddle or appreciated financial position or as part of a hedging, conversion or other integrated instrument;\n Persons who hold the ordinary shares through partnerships or other pass-through entities;\n Individual retirement and other tax-deferred accounts;\n Expatriates of the United States and certain former long-term residents of the United States;\n Persons liable for the alternative minimum tax;\n Persons having a functional currency other than the U.S. dollar; and\n Direct, indirect or constructive owners of 10% or more, by voting power or value, of our company.\n77\nIf a partnership or an entity treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes owns ordinary shares, the U.S. federal income tax treatment of a partner in such a\npartnership will generally depend upon the status of the partner and the activities of the partnership. A partnership that owns ordinary shares and the partners in such partnership should\nconsult their own tax advisors about the U.S. federal income tax consequences of holding and disposing of ordinary shares.\nThis discussion does not consider the possible application of U.S. federal gift or estate tax or alternative minimum tax.\nAll investors are urged to consult their own tax advisors as to the particular tax consequences to them of an investment in our ordinary shares, including the effect and applicability\nof United States federal, state, local and foreign income and other tax laws (including estate and gift tax laws) and tax treaties.\nDistributions Paid on the Ordinary Shares\nSubject to the discussion below under Passive Foreign Investment Company Considerations, a U.S. Holder generally will be required to include in his or her gross income as\nordinary dividend income the amount of any distributions paid on the ordinary shares, including the amount of any Israeli taxes withheld, to the extent that those distributions are paid out of\nour current or accumulated earnings and profits, as determined for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Subject to the discussion below under Passive Foreign Investment Company\nConsiderations, distributions in excess of our earnings and profits will be applied against and will reduce the U.S. Holders tax basis in its ordinary shares and, to the extent they exceed that\ntax basis, will be treated as gain from a sale or exchange of those ordinary shares. In some cases, our dividends will not qualify for the dividends-received deduction applicable to U.S.\ncorporations.\nDividends that we pay in NIS, including the amount of any Israeli taxes withheld therefrom, will be included in your income in a U.S. dollar amount calculated by reference to the\nexchange rate in effect on the day such dividends are received, regardless of whether the payment is in fact converted into U.S. dollars. A U.S. Holder who receives payment in NIS and\nconverts NIS into U.S. dollars at an exchange rate other than the rate in effect on such day will have a foreign currency exchange gain or loss that would be treated as ordinary income or\nloss. U.S. Holders should consult their own tax advisors concerning the U.S. tax consequences of acquiring, holding and disposing of NIS.\nSubject to certain limitations, qualified dividend income received by a non-corporate U.S. Holder will generally be subject to taxation in the U.S at a lower rate than ordinary\nincome. Distributions taxable as dividends paid on the ordinary shares should qualify for lower tax rate provided that we are not a passive foreign investment company (as described below)\nfor U.S. tax purposes and that either: (i) we are entitled to benefits under the U.S.-Israel Tax Treaty or (ii) the ordinary shares are readily tradable on an established securities market in the\nUnited States and certain other requirements are met. We believe that we are entitled to benefits under the U.S.-Israel Tax Treaty and that the ordinary shares currently will be readily\ntradable on an established securities market in the United States. However, no assurance can be given that the ordinary shares will remain readily tradable. The rate reduction does not apply\nunless certain holding period requirements are satisfied. With respect to the ordinary shares, the U.S. Holder must have held such shares for at least 61 days during the 121-day period\nbeginning 60 days before the ex-dividend date. The rate reduction also does not apply to dividends received from passive foreign investment companies, see discussion below, or in respect\nof certain hedged positions or in certain other situations. The legislation enacting the reduced tax rate contains special rules for computing the foreign tax credit limitation of a taxpayer who\nreceives dividends subject to the reduced tax rate. U.S. Holders of ordinary shares should consult their own tax advisors regarding the effect of these rules in their particular circumstances.\nSubject to the discussion below under Information Reporting and Back-up Withholding, a Non-U.S. Holder generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income or withholding\ntax on dividends received on ordinary shares unless that income is effectively connected with the conduct by that Non-U.S. Holder of a trade or business in the United States, in which case a\ncorporate Non-U.S. Holder may also be subject to the U.S. branch profits tax.\n78\nForeign Tax Credit\nAny dividend income resulting from distributions we pay to a U.S. Holder with respect to the ordinary shares generally may be treated as foreign source income for U.S. foreign tax\ncredit limitation purposes. For all taxable years ended until December 31, 2017, and subject to certain conditions and limitations, Israeli tax withheld on dividends may be deducted from\ntaxable income or credited against a U.S. Holders U.S. federal income tax liability. The limitation on foreign taxes eligible for credit is calculated separately with respect to specific classes\nof income. For this purpose, in general, any dividend that we distribute should constitute passive category income, or, in the case of certain U.S. Holders, general category income.\nStarting January 1, 2018, and with respect to our corporate U.S. Holders, the TCJA provides a 100% deduction for the foreign-source portion of dividends received after January 1,\n2018 from specified 10-percent owned foreign corporations by U.S. corporate holders, subject to a one-year holding period. No foreign tax credit, including Israeli withholding tax (or\ndeduction for foreign taxes paid with respect to qualifying dividends) would be permitted for foreign taxes paid or accrued with respect to a qualifying dividend. Deduction would be\nunavailable for hybrid dividends. The dividend received deduction enacted under the TCJA may not apply to dividends from a passive foreign investment company.\nThe rules relating to the determination of foreign source income and the foreign tax credit are complex, and the availability of a foreign tax credit depends on numerous factors.\nEach investor who is a U.S. Holder should consult with its own tax advisor to determine whether its income with respect to the ordinary shares would be foreign source income and whether\nand to what extent that investor would be entitled to a foreign tax credit.\nDisposition of Ordinary Shares\nUpon the sale or other disposition of ordinary shares, subject to the discussion below under Passive Foreign Investment Company Considerations, a U.S. Holder generally should\nrecognize capital gain or loss equal to the difference between the amount realized on the disposition and the holders adjusted tax basis in the ordinary shares. U.S. Holders should consult\ntheir own tax advisors with respect to the tax consequences of the receipt of a currency other than U.S. dollars upon such sale or other disposition.\nGain or loss upon the disposition of the ordinary shares will be treated as long-term if, at the time of the sale or disposition, the ordinary shares were held for more than one year.\nThe deductibility of capital losses by a U.S. Holder is subject to limitations. In general, any gain or loss recognized by a U.S. Holder on the sale or other disposition of ordinary shares will\nbe U.S. source income or loss for U.S. foreign tax credit purposes. U.S. Holders should consult their own tax advisors concerning the source of income for U.S. foreign tax credit purposes\nand the effect of the U.S.-Israel Tax Treaty on the source of income.\nSubject to the discussion below under Information Reporting and Back-up Withholding, a Non-U.S. Holder generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income or withholding\ntax on any gain realized on the sale or exchange of ordinary shares unless:\n that gain is effectively connected with the conduct by the Non-U.S. Holder of a trade or business in the United States, and, if a tax treaty applies, is attributable to a permanent\nestablishment or fixed base of the Non-U.S. Holder in the United States; or\n in the case of any gain realized by an individual Non-U.S. Holder, that holder is present in the United States for 183 days or more in the taxable year of the sale or exchange,\nand other conditions are met.\n79\nPassive Foreign Investment Company Considerations\nSpecial U.S. federal income tax rules apply to U.S. Holders owning shares of a passive foreign investment company. A non-U.S. corporation will be considered a passive foreign\ninvestment company for any taxable year in which, after applying certain look-through rules, 75% or more of its gross income consists of specified types of passive income, or 50% or more\nof the average value of its assets consists of assets that produce, or are held for the production of, passive income. For this purpose, passive income may include dividends, interest, royalties,\nrents, annuities and the excess of gains over losses from the disposition of assets which produce passive income.\nIf we were classified as a passive foreign investment company, a U.S. Holder could be subject to increased tax liability upon the sale or other disposition of ordinary shares or upon\nthe receipt of amounts treated as excess distributions. Under these rules, the excess distribution and any gain would be allocated ratably over the U.S. Holders holding period for the\nordinary shares, and the amount allocated to the current taxable year and any taxable year prior to the first taxable year in which we were a passive foreign investment company would be\ntaxed as ordinary income. The amount allocated to each of the other taxable years would be subject to tax at the highest marginal tax rate in effect for the applicable class of taxpayer for that\nyear, and an interest charge for the deemed deferral benefit would be imposed on the resulting tax allocated to such other taxable years. The tax liability with respect to the amount allocated\nto years prior to the year of the disposition, or excess distribution, cannot be offset by any net operating losses. In addition, holders of shares in a passive foreign investment company may\nnot receive a step-up in basis on shares acquired from a decedent. If we are a passive foreign investment company in any year, a U.S. Holder would be required to file an annual return on\nIRS Form 8621 regarding distributions received with respect to ordinary shares and any gain realized on the disposition of ordinary shares.\nBased on our current and projected income, assets and activities, we do not believe that we will be a passive foreign investment company for our current taxable year. However,\nbecause the determination of whether we are a passive foreign investment company is based upon the composition of our income and assets from time to time, we cannot be certain that we\nwill not be considered a passive foreign investment company for the current taxable year or any future taxable year.\nThe passive foreign investment company tax consequences described above will not apply to a U.S. Holder if the U.S. Holder makes a timely election to treat us as a qualified\nelecting fund (QEF). If a U.S. Holder makes a timely QEF election, the U.S. Holder would be required to include in income for each taxable year its pro rata share of our ordinary\nearnings as ordinary income and its pro rata share of our net capital gain as long-term capital gain, whether or not such amounts are actually distributed to the U.S. Holder. However, a U.S.\nHolder would not be eligible to make a QEF election unless we comply with certain applicable information reporting requirements. We will provide U.S. Holders with the information\nneeded to report income and gain under a QEF election should we become a passive foreign investment company.\nAs an alternative to making a QEF election, a U.S. Holder of passive foreign investment company stock which is publicly traded may in certain circumstances avoid certain of the\ntax consequences generally applicable to holders of a passive foreign investment company by electing to mark the stock to market annually and recognizing as ordinary income or loss each\nyear an amount equal to the difference as of the close of the taxable year between the fair market value of the passive foreign investment company stock and the U.S. Holders adjusted tax\nbasis in the passive foreign investment company stock. Losses would be allowed only to the extent of net mark-to-market gain previously included by the U.S. Holder under the election for\nprior taxable years. Income recognized and deductions allowed under the mark-to-market provisions, as well as any gain or loss on the disposition of ordinary shares with respect to which\nthe mark-to-market election is made, are generally treated as ordinary income or loss (except that loss is treated as capital loss to the extent the loss exceeds the net mark-to-market gains, if\nany, that a U.S. Holder included in its income with respect to such ordinary shares in prior years). However, gain or loss from the disposition of ordinary shares (as to which a mark-to-\nmarket election was made) in a year in which we are no longer a passive foreign investment company, will be capital gain or loss. The mark-to-market election is available for so long as\nour ordinary shares constitute marketable stock, which includes stock of a passive foreign investment company that is regularly traded on a qualified exchange or other market.\nGenerally, a qualified exchange or other market includes a national securities exchange that is registered with the SEC or the national market system established pursuant to Section 11A\nof the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. A class of stock that is traded on one or more qualified exchanges or other markets is regularly traded on an exchange or market for any calendar\nyear during which that class of stock is traded, other than in the minimized quantities, on at least 15 days during each calendar quarter. We believe that NASDAQ will constitute a qualified\nexchange or other market for this purpose. However, we cannot be certain that our ordinary shares will continue to trade on NASDAQ or that the ordinary shares will be regularly traded for\nthis purpose.\nThe rules applicable to owning shares of a passive foreign investment company are complex, and each holder who is a U.S. Holder should consult with its own tax advisor\nregarding the consequences of investing in a passive foreign investment company.\n80\n(cid:0)[(cid:0)D(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)D(cid:0)U(cid:0)H(cid:0)F(cid:0)7(cid:0)G(cid:0)L(cid:0)H(cid:0)0\nCertain U.S. Holders that are individuals, estates or trusts may be subject to a 3.8% Net Investment Income tax on all or a portion of their net investment income, which may\ninclude all or a portion of their dividend income and net gains from the disposition of ordinary shares and warrants. Each U.S. Holder that is an individual, estate or trust is urged to consult\nits tax advisors regarding the applicability of the Net Investment Income tax to its income and gains in respect of its investment in our ordinary shares and warrants, including with respect to\nthe eligibility to claim foreign tax credit against such tax.\nInformation Reporting and Backup Withholding\nPayments in respect of ordinary shares may be subject to information reporting to the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (the IRS) and to U.S. backup withholding tax at a rate equal\nto the fourth lowest income tax rate applicable to individuals (which, under current law, is 24%). Backup withholding will not apply, however, if you (i) are a corporation or come within\ncertain exempt categories, and demonstrate the fact when so required, or (ii) furnish a correct taxpayer identification number and make any other required certification. U.S. Holders who are\nrequired to establish their exempt status generally must provide such certification on IRS Form W-9.\nBackup withholding is not an additional tax. Amounts withheld under the backup withholding rules may be credited against a U.S. Holders U.S. tax liability, and a U.S. Holder\nmay obtain a refund of any excess amounts withheld under the backup withholding rules by filing the appropriate claim for refund with the IRS.\nAny U.S. holder who holds 10% or more in vote or value of our ordinary shares will be subject to certain additional United States information reporting requirements.\nU.S. Gift and Estate Tax\nAn individual U.S. Holder of ordinary shares will generally be subject to U.S. gift and estate taxes with respect to ordinary shares in the same manner and to the same extent as with\nrespect to other types of personal property.\nF. Dividends and Paying Agents\nNot applicable.\nG. Statement by Experts\nNot applicable.\nH. Documents on Display\nWe are subject to the reporting requirements of the United States Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, as applicable to foreign private issuers as defined in Rule 3b-4\nunder the Exchange Act, and in accordance therewith, we file annual and interim reports and other information with the SEC.\n81\nAs a foreign private issuer, we are exempt from certain provisions of the Exchange Act. Accordingly, our proxy solicitations are not subject to the disclosure and procedural\nrequirements of Regulation 14A under the Exchange Act and transactions in our equity securities by our officers and directors are exempt from reporting and the short-swing profit\nrecovery provisions contained in Section 16 of the Exchange Act. In addition, we are not required under the Exchange Act to file periodic reports and financial statements as frequently or as\npromptly as United States companies whose securities are registered under the Exchange Act. However, we make available on our website www.tat-technologies.com, our annual audited\nfinancial statements, which have been examined and reported on, with an opinion expressed by an independent public accounting firm, and we intend to file reports with the SEC on Form 6-\nK containing unaudited financial information for the first three quarters of each fiscal year.\nThis annual report on Form 20-F and the exhibits thereto and any other document we file pursuant to the Exchange Act may be inspected without charge and copied at prescribed\nrates at the following SEC public reference room at 100 F Street, N.E., Room 1580, Washington, D.C. 20549; and on the SEC website (http://www.sec.gov) and on our website www.tat-\ntechnologies.com.

Internal control over financial reporting is defined in Rule\n13a-15(f) or 15d-15(f) promulgated under the Exchange Act as a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the companys principal executive and principal financial officers and\neffected by the companys board of directors, management and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of\nfinancial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and includes those policies and procedures that:\n Pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company;\n Provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting\nprinciples, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and\n Provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use of disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect\non the financial statements.\n83\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods\nare subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nOur management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023. In making this assessment, our management used the criteria\nset forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013). Based on that assessment, our management\nconcluded that as of December 31, 2023, our internal control over financial reporting is effective.\n(c) Attestation report of independent registered public accounting firm\nThis annual report does not include an attestation report of our independent registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial report. Managements report\nwas not subject to attestation by our independent registered public accounting firm pursuant to rules of the SEC that permit us to provide only managements report in this annual report.\n(d) Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nThere was no change in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the period covered by this annual report that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely\nto materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.\nItem 16.

Pre-approval of an audit or non-audit service may be given as a general pre-approval, as part of the audit\ncommittees approval of the scope of the engagement of our independent auditor, or on an individual basis. Any proposed services exceeding general pre-approved levels also require\nspecific pre-approval by our audit committee. The policy prohibits retention of the independent public accountants to perform the prohibited non-audit functions defined in Section 201 of\nthe Sarbanes-Oxley Act or the rules of the SEC, and also requires the audit committee to consider whether proposed services are compatible with the independence of the public accountants.\nItem 16D.Exemptions from the Listing Standards for Audit Committee\nNot Applicable.\n85\nItem 16E.

The Audit Committee is responsible for reviewing our policies with respect to cybersecurity risks and relevant contingent liabilities and risks that may be material to the\nCompany, including risks from third parties and business partners.\nWe generally seek to address cybersecurity risks by implementing security measures on our internal computer systems.These security measures include firewalls, intrusion\nprevention and detection systems, anti-malware functionality and access controls, which are evaluated by our IT managers and improved through vulnerability assessments and\ncybersecurity threat intelligence.\nOur Chief Operating Officer is responsible for implementing protection measures for our information systems from cybersecurity threats and promptly responding to any\ncybersecurity incidents.\nTo date, we have not identified risks from known cybersecurity threats, including as a result of any prior cybersecurity incidents, that have materially affected or are reasonably\nlikely to materially affect us, including our operations, business strategy, results of operations, or financial condition.\n87\nPART III\nItem 17.Financial Statements\nWe have elected

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material\nrespects, the financial position of the Companyas of December 31, 2023 and 2022, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended\nDecember 31, 2023in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\n(cid:0)L(cid:0)Q(cid:0)L(cid:0)Q(cid:0)S(cid:0)2(cid:0)R(cid:0)U(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)L(cid:0)R(cid:0)V(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)I(cid:0)V(cid:0)%(cid:0)D\nThese consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Companys management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Companys consolidated financial statements\nbased on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with\nrespect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits of these consolidated financial statements in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain\nreasonable assurance about whether the consolidatedfinancial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we\nengaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but\nnot for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.\nOur audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures\nthat respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also\nincluded evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We\nbelieve that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\n(cid:0)V(cid:0)U(cid:0)W(cid:0)H(cid:0)D(cid:0)L(cid:0)W(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)0(cid:0)W(cid:0)X(cid:0)G(cid:0)O(cid:0)D(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)$(cid:0)F(cid:0)L(cid:0)W(cid:0)L(cid:0)&(cid:0)U\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be\ncommunicated to the audit committee and that (i) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging,\nsubjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are\nnot, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\nKesselman & Kesselman, 146 Derech Menachem Begin St. Tel-Aviv 6492103, Israel,\nP.O Box 7187 Tel-Aviv 6107120, Telephone: +972 -3- 7954555, Fax:+972 -3- 7954556, www.pwc.com/il\nF - 3\nTAT TECHNOLOGIES LTD.\nInventory - Write down of obsolete and unmarketable inventory\nAs described in Notes 2 and 4 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company's consolidated inventory balance was $51,280 thousand as of December 31, 2023. The Company writes\ndown its inventory for estimated obsolescence and unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and net realizable value based upon assumptions for future\ndemand and market conditions. Changes in these assumptions could have a significant impact on the inventory's valuation.\nThe principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the write down of obsolete and unmarketable inventory is a critical audit matter were based on the\nsignificant judgement used by management when determining the assumptions relating to the future demand, market conditions, and sales forecasts. This in turn led to a high degree of\nauditor judgement, subjectivity and effort in performing procedures and evaluating management's significant assumptions related to future demand and market conditions.\nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These\nprocedures included, among others: (i) utilizing historical inventory usage data to analyze the relationship between the inventory impairment calculated, the inventory on hand, and the sales\nover time; (ii) evaluating managements ability to accurately estimate future demand by comparing actual inventory usage to estimates made in prior years; (iii) comparison of\nmanagements assumptions related to market conditions to available external market data for a sample of inventory items; (iv) evaluating the accuracy of the impairment by selecting a\nsample of inventory items and evaluating supporting documentation regarding current and historical sales patterns; (v) assessing whether management's assumptions related to future\ndemand and market conditions were consistent with evidence obtained in other areas of the audit.\nTel-Aviv, Israel Kesselman & Kesselman\nMarch 6, 2024 Certified Public Accountants (Isr.)\nA member firm of PricewaterhouseCoopers International Limited\nWe have served as the Company's auditor since 2009.\nF - 4\nTAT TECHNOLOGIES LTD.\nCONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS\nU.S dollars in thousands\nDecember 31,\n2023 2022\nASSETS\nCURRENT ASSETS:\nCash and cash equivalents $ 15,979 $ 7,722\nAccounts receivable, net of allowance for credit losses of $345\nand $527 thousand as of December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022 respectively 20,009 15,622\nRestricted deposit 661 -\nOther current assets and prepaid expenses 6,397 6,047\nInventory 51,280 45,759\nTotal current assets 94,326 75,150\nNON-CURRENT ASSETS:\nRestricted deposit 302 304\nInvestment in affiliates 2,168 1,665\nFunds in respect of employee rights upon retirement 664 780\nDeferred income taxes 994 1,229\nProperty, plant and equipment, net 42,554 43,423\nOperating lease right of use assets 2,746 2,477\nIntangible assets, net 1,823 1,623\nTotal non-current assets 51,251 51,501\nTotal assets 145,577 $ 126,651\nThe accompanying notes are an integral part of the consolidated financial statements.\nF- 5\nTAT TECHNOLOGIES LTD.\nCONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS\nU.S dollars in thousands, except share data\nDecember 31,\n2023 2022\nLIABILITIES AND EQUITY\nCURRENT LIABILITIES:\nCurrent maturities of long-term loans $ 2,200 $ 1,876\nCredit line from bank 12,138 6,101\nAccounts payable 9,988 10,233\nAccrued expenses and other 13,952 9,876\nOperating lease liabilities 1,033 904\nTotal current liabilities 39,311 28,990\nNON-CURRENT LIABILITIES:\nLong-term loans 12,886 19,408\nLiability in respect of employee rights upon retirement 1,000 1,148\nOperating lease liabilities 1,697 1,535\nTotal non-current liabilities 15,583 22,091\nCOMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES (NOTE 15)\nTotal liabilities 54,894 51,081\nEQUITY:\nOrdinary shares of NIS 0.9 par value:\nAuthorized: 13,000,000 shares at December 31, 2023 and at December 31, 2022; Issued: 10,377,085 and 9,186,019 shares at December\n31, 2023 and at December 31, 2022 respectively; Outstanding: 10,102,612 and 8,911,546 shares at December 31, 2023 and at December\n31, 2022 respectively 3,140 2,842\nAdditional paid-in capital 76,335 66,245\nTreasury shares, at cost, 274,473 shares at December 31, 2023 and 2022 (2,088) (2,088)\nAccumulated other comprehensive income (loss) 27 (26)\nRetained earnings 13,269 8,597\nTotal shareholders' equity 90,683 75,570\nTotal liabilities and shareholders' equity 145,577 $ 126,651\nThe accompanying notes are an integral part of the consolidated financial statements.\nF- 6\nTAT TECHNOLOGIES LTD.\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS\nU.S dollars in thousands\nYear ended December 31,\n2023 2022 2021\nRevenue:\nProducts $ 35,241 $ 25,460 $ 25,870\nServices 78,553 59,096 52,103\n113,794 84,556 77,973\nCost of revenue, net:\nProducts 30,517 21,631 23,761\nServices 60,809 46,997 42,942\n91,326 68,628 66,703\nGross profit 22,468 15,928 11,270\nOperating expenses:\nResearch and development, net 715 479 517\nSelling and marketing, net 5,523 5,629 5,147\nGeneral and administrative, net 10,588 9,970 8,354\nOther (income) expenses (433) (90) (468)\nRestructuring expenses, net - 1,715 1,755\n16,393 17,703 15,305\nOperating income (loss) 6,075 (1,775) (4,035)\nInterest expenses (1,683) (902) (250)\nOther financial income (expenses), net 353 1,029 (290)\nIncome profit (loss) before taxes on income (tax benefit) 4,745 (1,648) (4,575)\nTaxes on income (tax benefit) 576 98 (662)\nProfit (Loss) before share of equity investment 4,169 (1,746) (3,913)\nShare in profit (losses) of equity investment of affiliated companies 503 184 (76)\nNet income (loss) from continued operation $ 4,672 $ (1,562) $ (3,989)\nThe accompanying notes are an integral part of the consolidated financial statements.\nF- 7\nTAT TECHNOLOGIES LTD.

AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nU.S. dollars in thousands\nNOTE 1 - GENERAL\na. TAT Technologies Ltd., (TAT or the Company) an Israeli corporation, incorporated in 1985, is a leading provider of solutions and services to the aerospace and\ndefense industries, focused mainly on the following four segments: (i) original equipment manufacturing (OEM) of heat transfer solutions and aviation accessories\nmainly through our Kiryat Gat facility and our Limco subsidiary; (ii) MRO (Maintenance Repair and Overhaul) services for heat transfer components and OEM of heat\ntransfer solutions through Limco Airepair Inc our wholly-owned subsidiary; (iii) MRO services for aviation components (mainly Auxiliary Power Unit APU and\nLanding Gear LG) through Piedmont Aviation Component Services LLC our wholly-owned subsidiary; and (iv) overhaul and coating of jet engine components through\nTurbochrome our wholly-owned subsidiary. TAT targets the commercial aerospace (serving a wide range of types and sizes of commercial and business jets), military\naerospace and ground defense sectors. TATs shares are listed on both the NASDAQ (TATT) and Tel-Aviv Stock Exchange.\nIn June 2020, the Company's management decided to discontinue the JT8D engine blades reconditioning activity which belong to overhaul and coating of jet engine\ncomponents segment as part of a strategic change, see Note 18.\nIn March 2021, the Company announced a restructuring plan which includes the transfer of the Company's activity of OEM of heat transfer solutions and aviation\naccessories in Gedera to our activity of MRO services for heat transfer components and OEM of heat transfer solutions in Tulsa, Oklahoma and to our overhaul and\ncoating of jet engine components activity in Kiryat Gat, see Note 9.\nb. During the years 2020 to 2022 the COVID-19 pandemic had an adverse effect on our industry and the markets in which we operate. The COVID-19 outbreak has\nsignificantly impacted the aviation market in which TATs customers operate and has resulted in a reduction of TATs business with some of these customers. Global\nsupply shortages emerged for certain products, leading to delays in delivery schedule.\nc. During 2023, global conflicts continue to create volatility in global financial and energy markets and contribute to supply chain shortages adding to the inflationary\npressures in the global economy. This capabilities lead to higher material and labor costs . The company actively collaborate with its suppliers to minimize impacts of\nsupply shortages on manufacturing.\nd. In October 2023, Hamas terrorists infiltrated Israels southern border from the Gaza Strip and conducted a series of attacks on civilian and military targets. Hamas also\nlaunched extensive rocket attacks on the Israeli population and industrial centers located along Israels border with the Gaza Strip and in other areas within the State of\nIsrael. These attacks resulted in thousands of deaths and injuries, and Hamas additionally kidnapped many Israeli civilians and soldiers. Following the attack, Israels\nsecurity cabinet declared war against Hamas and commenced a military campaign against Hamas and other terrorist organizations in parallel to their continued rocket and\nterror attacks. Since the commencement of hostilities, Tat technologies has experienced a considerable increased demand for our merchandise from the Israel Ministry Of\nDefense (IMOD) compared to the routine levels of demands, and we have increased our support to the IMOD, mainly through deliveries of our systems and dedicated\nefforts of our employees. Subject to further developments, this demand may continue and possibly generate material orders to the Company. At the same time, the\nCompany continues to support its international customers. The extent of the effects of the war on the Company's performance will depend on future developments that are\ndifficult to predict at this time, including the duration and scope of the war. We continue to monitor the situation closely Following the attack by Hamas on Israels\nsouthern border, Hezbollah in Lebanon has also launched missile, rocket, and shooting attacks against Israeli military sites, troops, and Israeli towns in northern Israel. In\nresponse to these attacks, the Israeli army has carried out a number of targeted strikes on sites belonging to Hezbollah in southern Lebanon.\nThe intensity and duration of Israels current war against Hamas is difficult to predict, as are such wars economic implications on our business and operations and on\nIsrael's economy in general.\nF- 13\nTAT TECHNOLOGIES LTD.

(Limco-Piedmont), and Turbochrome Ltd. (Turbochrome). Additionally, the Company holds\n51% of TAT-Engineering LLC (TAT-Engineering) as a joint venture, hereinafter collectively referred to as the Group.\nOn November 25, 2015, the Company signed an agreement with Russian-based Engineering Holding of Moscow (Engineering), to establish a new facility for the\nprovision of services for heat transfer products. The Company, TAT-Engineering LLC, is based in Novosibirsks Tolmachevo airport. TAT-Engineering, LLC shall provide\nservices for heat transfer products. 51% of TAT-Engineering LLC's shares are held by TAT and the remaining 49% are held by Engineering. The accounting treatment of\nthe joint venture is based on the equity method due to variable participating rights granted to Engineering. The new entity was established in January 2016.\nNOTE 2 - SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\na. Basis of Presentation\nThe Group's financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (\"U.S. GAAP\").\nb. Use of estimates in the preparation of financial statement\nThe preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported\namounts of assets and liabilities and disclose the nature of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues\nand expenses during the reporting years. Actual results could differ from those estimates.\nAs applicable to these financial statements, the most significant estimates and assumptions relate to: recoverability of inventory, provision for current expected credit\nloss, and income taxes.\nF- 14\nTAT TECHNOLOGIES LTD. AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nU.S. dollars in thousands\nNOTE 2 - SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONT)\nc. Functional currency\nThe majority revenues of the company and subsidiaries are generated in U.S. dollars (\"dollars\") and a substantial portion of the costs of the company and each\nsubsidiary in the Group are incurred in dollars. Accordingly, the dollar is the currency of the primary economic environment in which the Group operates and\naccordingly its functional and reporting currency is the dollar.\nTransactions and balances originally denominated in dollars are presented at their original amounts. Balances in currencies other than the U.S. dollar are translated into\ndollars using historical and current exchange rates for non-monetary and monetary balances, respectively. For non-dollar transactions and other items in the statements\nof income (indicated below), the following exchange rates are used: (i) for transactions  exchange rates at transaction dates or average rates; and (ii) for other items\n(derived from non-monetary balance sheet items such as depreciation and amortization, etc.)  historical exchange rates. Currency transaction gains and losses are\ncarried to other financial income (expenses), net, as appropriate.\nd. Principles of consolidation\nThe consolidated financial statements include the accounts of TAT and its subsidiaries.\nIntercompany balances and transactions, including profits from intercompany sales not yet realized outside the Group, have been eliminated upon consolidation.\ne. Cash and Cash equivalents\nAll highly liquid investments, which include short-term bank deposits, that are not restricted as to withdrawal or use. The period to maturity of which do not exceed\nthree months at the time of investment, are considered to be cash equivalents.\nRestricted Deposit\nRestricted deposit consists primarily of bank deposits to secure obligations under our state loan and a letter of credit to a supplier. Restricted deposit is presented at cost,\nincluding accrued interest, and is classified based on the duration of the restriction.The following table provides a reconciliation of cash and cash equivalents and\nrestricted deposit reported on the balance sheets that sum to the total of the same amounts shown on the statement of cash flows:\n2023 2022\nCash and cash equivalents $ 15,979 $ 7,722\nRestricted deposit short term 661 -\nRestricted deposit long term 302 304\nTotal cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash equivalents $ 16,942 $ 8,026\nF- 15\nTAT TECHNOLOGIES LTD. AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nU.S. dollars in thousands\nNOTE 2 - SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONT)\nf. Accounts receivable, net\nThe Groups accounts receivable balances are due from customers primarily in the airline and defense industries. Credit is extended based on evaluation of a customers\nfinancial condition and generally, collateral is not required. Trade accounts receivable from sales of services and products are typically due from customers within 30 -\n90 days. Trade accounts receivable balances are stated at amounts due from customers net of a provision for current expected losses.\nAccounts receivable have been reduced by an allowance for current expected losses. The Company maintains the allowance for estimated losses resulting from the\ninability of the Companys customers to make required payments. The allowance represents the current estimate of lifetime expected credit losses over the remaining\nduration of existing accounts receivable considering current market conditions and supportable forecasts when appropriate. The estimate is a result of the Companys\nongoing evaluation of collectability, customer creditworthiness, historical levels of credit losses, and future expectations.\nWrite-off activity and recoveries for the periods presented were not material (see note 22).\ng. Inventory\nInventory is measured at the lower of cost and net realizable value.\nInventories include raw materials, parts, work in progress and finished products.\nCost of raw material and parts is determined using the moving average basis. Cost of work in progress and finished products is calculated based on actual costs.\nCapitalized production costs components, mainly labor and overhead, are determined on average basis over the production period.\nSince the Group sells products and services related to airplane accessories for airplanes that can be in service for 20 to 50 years, it must keep a supply of such products\nand parts on hand while the airplanes are in use. The Group writes down its inventory for estimated obsolescence and unmarketable inventory equal to the difference\nbetween the cost of inventory and net realizable value, which includes costs to sell based upon assumptions for future demand and market conditions.\nIf actual market prices are less favorable than those projected by management, inventory write-downs may be required. When inventory is written down, a new lower\ncost basis for that inventory is established.\nF- 16\nTAT TECHNOLOGIES LTD. AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nU.S. dollars in thousands\nNOTE 2 - SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONT)\nh. Property, plant and equipment\nProperty, plant and equipment are stated at cost, after deduction of the related investment grants, net of accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is calculated using the\nstraight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, as follows:\nYears\nBuildings 25  39\nLeasehold improvements 3 - 20\nMachinery and equipment 15 - 20\nMotor vehicles 7\nOffice furniture and equipment 3 - 5\nInternal use software 7\nLeasehold improvements are amortized using the straight-line method over the period of the lease contract, or the estimated useful life of the asset, whichever is shorter\nCapitalized Software Costs\nThe Company accounts for its costs to develop software for internal use accordance with Accounting Standards (ASC) 350-40, Internal use Software. These costs are\ndirectly attributable to the development and implementation of a new ERP and supply chain software. The Company capitalizes the costs incurred during the\ndevelopment stage. Capitalized costs include software design, configuration, interfaces, coding, installation and testing, payroll, payroll-related expenses and external\ndirect costs, which are directly associated with creating and enhancing internal use software Capitalization of such costs begins when the preliminary project stage is\ncomplete and ceases at the point in which the project is substantially complete and is ready for its intended purpose.\nCapitalized software costs are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful life.\nWe evaluate the useful lives of these assets on an annual basis and test for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances occur that could impact the\nrecoverability of these assets. Refer to Note 6 for further information.\nCapitalized software costs are included in property, plant and equipment, net in the consolidated balance sheet.\ni. Government grants:\nGrants received from the IIA for approved research and development projects are recognized at the time the Company is reasonably assured that it will be entitled to\nsuch grants, on the basis of the costs incurred and included as a deduction from research and development expenses. Due to the fact that the Company is defined as a\n\"Traditional Industry Company\", under the IIA regulations, the grants are non-royalty bearing.\nGovernment grants relating to the purchase of property, plant and equipment (refer to note 11) are presented in the statement of financial position as a deduction to the\ncarrying amount of the asset and they are credited to profit or loss on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the related assets.\nGrants received according to the ERC and PPP plan launched by the US Government are recognized at the time the Company is reasonably assured that it will be\nentitled to such grants, on the basis of the costs incurred and included as a deduction from cost of revenues and operational expenses, as applicable.\nj. Investment in affiliates and share in results of equity investment of affiliated companies\nInvestment in which the Group exercises significant influence and which is not considered a subsidiary (\"affiliate\") is accounted for using the equity method, whereby\nthe Group recognizes its proportionate share of the affiliated Company's net income or loss after the date of investment. See Note 5.\nThe Group reviews those investments for impairment whenever events indicate the carrying amount may not be recoverable.\nOn consolidation, transactions between the Group and the affiliate are eliminated in the amount which related to the Group's proportionate share of the affiliate.\nF- 17\nTAT TECHNOLOGIES LTD. AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nU.S. dollars in thousands\nNOTE 2 - SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONT)\nk. Leases\nThe Company determines if an arrangement is a lease at inception. Balances related to operating leases are included in operating lease right-of-use (ROU) assets and\noperating lease liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets.\nROU assets represent the Companys right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent the Companys obligation to make lease payments\narising from the lease. Operating lease ROU assets are recognized as the lease liability, adjusted for lease incentives received and prepayments made. Lease liabilities\nare recognized at the present value of the future lease payments at the lease commencement date. On the commencement date, lease payments that include variable\nlease payments dependent on an index or a rate (such as the Consumer Price Index or a market interest rate), are initially measured using the index or rate at the\ncommencement date. The Companys lease terms may include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that the Company will exercise that\noption. The discount rate for the lease is the rate implicit in the lease unless that rate cannot be readily determined. As the Companys leases do not provide an implicit\nrate, the Companys uses its estimated incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at the commencement date in determining the present value of\nlease payments. Lease expense for lease payments is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term (see also note 2aa).\n(cid:0)(cid:23)(cid:0)(cid:27)(cid:0)(cid:21)(cid:0)&(cid:0)$(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)G(cid:0)U(cid:0)6(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)Q(cid:0)H(cid:0)Q(cid:0)X(cid:0)L(cid:0)F(cid:0)R(cid:0)V(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)D(cid:0)V(cid:0)D(cid:0)W(cid:0)U(cid:0)Q(cid:0)J(cid:0)D(cid:0)V(cid:0)L(cid:0)Q(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)7(cid:0)H(cid:0)/(cid:0)R(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)P(cid:0)U(cid:0)H(cid:0)P(cid:0)R(cid:0)F(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)I(cid:0)Q(cid:0),\nThe Company accounts for certain leasing revenues in accordance with ASC 842, which qualify for operating lease treatment. For operating leases in which the\nCompany is the lessor, lease payments are recognized as leasing revenue over the lease term on a straight-line basis. APUs engines subject to operating leases are\nclassified as property, plant, and equipment and depreciated over the useful life, see Note 7.\nl. Identified intangible assets\nIdentifiable intangible assets are comprised of definite lived intangible assets  commercial license which are amortized over 10 years respectively, using the straight-\nline method over their estimated period of useful life as determined by identifying the period in which substantially all of the cash flows are expected to be generated.\nThe amortization of the commercial license is recorded in the cost of sales.\nm. Impairment of long-lived assets\nLong-lived assets, including property, plant and equipment, operating lease right of use assets and definite life intangible assets are reviewed for impairment whenever\nevents or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets (or asset group) may not be recoverable. In the event that the sum of the expected\nfuture cash flows (undiscounted and without interest charges) of the long-lived assets (or asset group) is less than the carrying amount of such assets, an impairment\ncharge would be recognized and the assets (or asset group) would be written down to their estimated fair values (see also Notes 6,7 and 8).\nF- 18\nTAT TECHNOLOGIES LTD.

Treasury Shares\nCompany shares held by the Company are presented as a reduction of equity at their cost to the Company. The treasury shares have no rights.\no. Revenue Recognition\nThe Group generates its revenues from the sale of OEM products and systems, providing MRO services (remanufacture, maintenance, repair and overhaul services and\nlong - term service contracts) and parts sales.\nA contract with a customer exists only when: the parties to the contract have approved it and are committed to perform their respective obligations, the Company can\nidentify each partys rights regarding the distinct goods or services to be transferred (performance obligations), the Company can determine the transaction price for\nthe goods or services to be transferred, the contract has commercial substance and it is probable that the Company will collect the consideration to which it will be\nentitled in exchange for the goods or services that will be transferred to the customer.\nRevenues are recorded in the amount of consideration to which the Company expects to be entitled in exchange for performance obligations upon transfer of control to\nthe customer, excluding amounts collected on behalf of other third parties and sales taxes.\nTo determine revenue recognition for arrangements that an entity determines are within the scope of Topic 606, the entity performs the following five steps: (i) identify\nthe contract(s) with a customer; (ii) identify the performance obligations in the contract; (iii) determine the transaction price; (iv) allocate the transaction price to the\nperformance obligations in the contract; and (v) recognize revenue when (or as) the performance obligation is satisfied.\nF- 19\nTAT TECHNOLOGIES LTD. AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nU.S. dollars in thousands\nNOTE 2 - SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONT)\nRevenue recognition (cont.)\nThe Company has adopted the following exemptions and accounting policies:\na. The Company has chosen to account for shipping as a fulfillment costs, in cases in which the shipping occurs after the customer has obtained control of a good.\nb. The Company has chosen not to adjust the promised amount of consideration for the effects of a significant financing component, in cases in which the Company\nexpects, at contract inception, that the period between when the Company transfers a promised good or service to the customer and when the customer pays for that\ngood or service will be one year or less.\nc. Revenues from the sale of OEM products is recognized at a point in time when the customer obtains control of the product, typically upon shipment. Invoices are\nissued based on the customer's approved PO and payment terms are due net 30 to net 90 from invoice date.\nRevenues from the sale of MRO services is recognized upon meeting all revenue recognition criteria, which involve receiving customers' purchase orders, completing\nthe service, and fulfilling inspection quality assurance obligations at the company's production site. Payment are due upon net 30 to net 45 from invoice date.\nContract liabilities\nContract liabilities are mainly comprised of deferred revenues which are included under accrued expenses and other.\nF- 20\nTAT TECHNOLOGIES LTD. AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nU.S. dollars in thousands\nNOTE 2 - SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONT)\np. Warranty costs\nThe Group provides warranties for its products and services ranging from one to three years, which vary with respect to each contract and in accordance with the nature\nof each specific product. According to Company's experience, most of the warranty costs incur during the first year of the contract.\nThe Group estimates the costs that may be incurred under its warranty and records a liability in the amount of such costs at the time revenue is recognized under\naccrued expenses on the Companys balance sheet. The Group periodically assesses the adequacy of its recorded warranty liabilities and adjusts the amounts as\nnecessary.\nq. Research and development\nResearch and development costs, net of grants, are charged to expenses as incurred and consist primarily of personnel and related expenses for research and\ndevelopment activities.\nr. Fair value measurement\nThe Group measures fair value and discloses fair value measurements for financial assets and liabilities. Fair value is based on the price that would be received to sell\nan asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.\nThe accounting standard establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes observable and unobservable inputs used to measure fair value into three broad levels, which\nare described below:\nLevel 1: Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets that are accessible at the measurement date for identical assets or liabilities. The fair value hierarchy gives the\nhighest priority to Level 1 inputs.\nLevel 2: Observable prices that are based on inputs not quoted on active markets, but corroborated by market data or active market data for similar but not identical\nassets or liabilities.\nF- 21\nTAT TECHNOLOGIES LTD. AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nU.S. dollars in thousands\nNOTE 2 - SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONT)\nr. Fair value measurement (cont.)\nLevel 3: Unobservable inputs are used when little or no market data is available. The fair value hierarchy gives the lowest priority to Level 3 inputs.\nIn determining fair value, the Group utilizes valuation techniques that maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs to the extent\npossible and considers credit risk in its assessment of fair value.\ns. Concentrations of credit risk\nFinancial instruments that potentially subject the Group to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash and cash equivalents, derivatives and accounts\nreceivable.\nCash and cash equivalents are deposited with several major banks in Israel and the United States. Such deposits in the United States may be in excess of insured limits\nand are not insured in other jurisdictions. Management believes that the financial institutions that hold the Group's cash and cash equivalents are financially sound, and\nthat the Group has not been effected by the recent turmoil in certain banking institutions in the United States. Accordingly, minimal credit risk exists with respect to\nthese financial instruments.\nThe Group's accounts receivable are derived mainly from sales to customers in the United States, Israel and Europe. The Group generally does not require collateral;\nhowever, in certain circumstances the Group may require letters of credit. Management believes that credit risks relating to accounts receivable are minimal since the\nmajority of the Group's customers are world-leading manufacturers of aviation systems and aircrafts, international airlines, governments and air-forces, and world-\nleading manufacturers and integrators of defense and ground systems. In addition, the Group has relatively a large number of customers with wide geographic spread\nwhich mitigates the credit risk. The Group performs ongoing credit evaluation of its customers' financial condition. As part of the risk management, the Company\npurchased a credit insurance policy from a well-known insurance Company. As of December 31, 2023 the Company has a single customer which represents 17.5% of\nthe Company's accounts receivable. As of December 2022, no individual customer represented 10% or more of the Company's accounts receivable.\nt. Income taxes\nIncome taxes are accounted for in accordance with ASC 740 \"Income Taxes\". This statement prescribes the use of the asset and liability method, whereby deferred tax\nassets and liabilities account balances are determined based on temporary differences between financial reporting and tax basis of assets and liabilities and for tax loss\ncarry-forwards. Deferred taxes are measured using the enacted laws and tax rates that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse. The Group provides\na valuation allowance, if it is more likely than not that a portion of the deferred income tax assets will not be realized, see Note 19(h).\nTaxes which would apply in the event of disposal of investments in domestic and foreign subsidiaries have not been taken into account in computing the deferred taxes,\nwhen the Groups intention is to hold, and not to realize the investments.\nF- 22\nTAT TECHNOLOGIES LTD. AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nU.S. dollars in thousands\nNOTE 2 - SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONT)\nt. Income taxes (cont.)\nThe Group did not provide for deferred taxes attributable to dividend distribution out of retained tax-exempt earnings from \"Approved/Benefited Enterprise\" plans (see\nNote 19(a)), since it intends to permanently reinvest them and has no intention to declare dividends out of such tax-exempt income in the foreseeable future.\nManagement considers such retained earnings to be essentially permanent in duration.\nResults for tax purposes for TATs Israeli subsidiaries are measured and reflected in NIS.\nAs explained in (c) above, the consolidated financial statements are measured and presented in U.S. dollars. In accordance with ASC 740, TAT has not provided\ndeferred income taxes on the differences resulting from changes in exchange rate and indexation.\nThe Group follows a two-step approach to recognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions. The first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by\ndetermining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit. The second step is to measure the tax\nbenefit as the largest amount that is more than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate resolution. The Groups policy is to include interest and penalties related to\nunrecognized tax benefits within financial income (expense). Such liabilities are classified as long-term, unless the liability is expected to be resolved within twelve\nmonths from the balance sheet date.\nu. Earnings per share\nBasic earnings (loss) per share are computed by dividing net income (loss) by the weighted average number of shares of the Company's Ordinary Shares, par value NIS\n0.9 per share outstanding for each period, net of treasury shares.\nDiluted earnings (loss) per share are calculated by dividing the net income by the fully-diluted weighted-average number of ordinary shares outstanding during each\nperiod. Potentially dilutive shares include outstanding options granted to employees and directors, using the treasury stock method.\nv. Share-based compensation\nThe Group applies ASC 718 \"Stock Based Compensation\" with respect to employees and directors options, which requires awards classified as equity awards to be\naccounted for using the grant-date fair value method. The fair value of share-based awards is estimated using the Black-Scholes valuation model, the payment\ntransaction is recognized as expense over the requisite service period, net of estimated forfeitures. The Company estimates forfeitures based on historical experience\nand anticipated future conditions.\nThe Group recognizes compensation cost for an award with only service conditions that has a graded vesting schedule using the accelerated method over the requisite\nservice period.\nF- 23\nTAT TECHNOLOGIES LTD. AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nU.S. dollars in thousands\nNOTE 2 - SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONT)\nw. Comprehensive income (loss)\nComprehensive income in 2023, 2022 and 2021 includes, in addition to net income or loss, gains and losses of derivatives designated for cash flow hedge accounting\n(net of related taxes where applicable).\nReclassification adjustments for gain or loss of derivatives are included in the relevant line item in the statement of income. See also Note 2 (aa).\nx. Contingencies\nCertain conditions may exist as of the date the financial statements are issued, which may result in a loss to the Group but which will only be resolved when one or\nmore future events occur or fail to occur. The Groups management assesses such contingent liabilities and estimated legal fees. Such assessment inherently involves an\nexercise of judgment. In assessing loss contingencies related to legal proceedings that are pending against the Group or unasserted claims that may result in such\nproceedings, the Groups management evaluates the perceived merits of any legal proceedings or unasserted claims as well as the perceived merits of the amount of\nrelief sought or expected to be sought.\nManagement applies the guidance in ASC 450-20-25 when assessing losses resulting from contingencies. If the assessment of a contingency indicates that it is probable\nthat a material loss has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be estimated, then the estimated liability is recorded as accrued expenses in the Companys\nfinancial statements. If the assessment indicates that a potential material loss contingency is not probable but is reasonably possible, or is probable but cannot be\nestimated, then the nature of the contingent liability, together with an estimate of the range of possible loss if determinable and material are disclosed.\nLoss contingencies considered to be remote by management are generally not disclosed unless they involve guarantees, in which case the guarantee would be disclosed.\ny. Derivatives and hedging\nThe Company carries out transactions involving foreign currency exchange derivative financial instruments. The transactions are designed to hedge the Companys\nexposure in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Derivatives are recognized at fair value as either assets or liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets in accordance\nwith ASC Topic 815, Derivatives and Hedging.\nFor derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as a cash-flow hedge, the gain or loss on the derivative instrument is reported as a component of other\ncomprehensive income and reclassified into earnings in the same line item associated with the anticipated transaction in the same period or periods during which the\nhedged transaction affects earnings.\nFor derivative instruments that qualify for hedge accounting, the cash flows associated with these derivatives are reported in the consolidated statements of cash flows\nconsistently with the classification of the cash flows from the underlying hedged items that these derivatives are hedging.\nThe effective portion and the ineffective portion of the gain or loss on the hedging instrument is recognized as other comprehensive income (loss).\nThe effective portion is determined by looking into changes in spot exchange rate.\nThe change in fair value attributable to changes other than those due to fluctuations in the spot exchange rate are excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness\nand are recognized in the statement of income under financial expenses-net.\nF- 24\nTAT TECHNOLOGIES LTD.

Restructuring Costs\nRestructuring costs have been recorded in connection with TATs restructuring plan announced in March 2021. Following this decision and in anticipation of ongoing\nefficiency measures in our business, TATs management has made estimates and judgments regarding future plans, mainly related to employee termination benefit\ncosts. Management also assesses the recoverability of long-lived assets employed in the business. In certain instances, asset lives have been shortened based on changes\nin the estimated useful lives of the affected assets. Asset-related impairments and employee's severance and other related costs are reflected within asset impairments of\nfixed assets, provision for restructuring plan and restructuring expenses.\naa.

Fair value is based on the price that would be received to sell an asset\nor paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.\nThe Company's financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis, consisted of the following types of instruments:\nDecember 31, 2023\nLevel 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total\nLiability (Accrued expenses and other):\n- $ (22) - $ (22)\nDecember 31, 2022\nLevel 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total\nLiability (Accrued expenses and other):\n- $ (31) - $ (31)\na. Derivative financial instruments:\nThe Company hedges the foreign currency risk arising from probable forecasted Israeli Shekel (\"ILS\") expenses as part of its risk management policy. The risk management\nobjective is to hedge the foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations associated with ILS denominated forecasted probable expenses according to the Company's hedging\npolicy. The majority of the ILS exposure arises from expected related salary expenses. The Company enters into contracts for derivative financial instruments forward\ncontracts in order to execute its policy. Such derivatives are recognized at fair value. The fair value of forward contracts is calculated as the difference between the forward\nrate on valuation date and the forward rate on the original forward contract, multiplied by the transaction's notional amount. At the inception of a hedge relationship, the\nCompany formally designates and documents the hedge relationship to which the Company wishes to apply hedge accounting and the risk management objective and strategy\nfor undertaking the hedge. The hedge effectiveness is assessed at the end of each reporting period.\nThe estimated net amount of existing gain (loss) that is reported in \"Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss)\" as of December 31, 2023 that is expected to be\nreclassified into earnings within the next 12 months is immaterial.\nF- 26\nTAT TECHNOLOGIES LTD.

Exhibits 77\nINTRODUCTION\nTAT Technologies Ltd. is a leading provider of solutions and services to the aerospace and defense industries, focused mainly on two product areas and services: Thermal Management and Power and\nActuation. The Company operates four operational units: (i) original equipment manufacturing (“OEM”) of heat transfer solutions and aviation accessories through Kiryat Gat facility (TAT Israel); (ii) maintenance\nrepair and overhaul (“MRO”) services for heat transfer components and OEM of heat transfer solutions through its Limco subsidiary; (iii) MRO services for aviation components through its Piedmont subsidiary\n(mainly APU and LG); and (iv) overhaul and coating of jet engine components through its Turbochrome subsidiary.\nTAT targets the commercial aerospace (serving a wide range of types and sizes of commercial and business jets), military aerospace and ground defense sectors. TAT has a global presence with over 500\ncustomers worldwide, including tier one players in their respective markets such as Boeing, Embraer, Lockheed Martin, Collins, Liebherr, Pratt & Whitney (a division of Collins), the U.S. Armed Forces, and\nservice centers of airlines such as KLM, Lufthansa and others. TAT enjoys a strong reputation among its customers for quality and service-oriented approach.\nAs a leading provider in its market, TAT’s business is supported by an extensive number of certifications, including from the American, European, British and Chinese civil aviation authorities, as well as\nleading manufactures such as Boeing and Honeywell International.\nTAT employed as of December 31, 2022 471 employees and operates in Three locations: its facility in Kiryat Gat, Israel (“TAT Israel” and “Turbochrome”); Limco Airepair Inc. (“Limco”) in Tulsa,\nOklahoma; Piedmont Aviation Component Services LLC (“Piedmont”) in Greensboro, North Carolina; the Company's Headquarter in Netanya Israel and strategic sales office in Mooresville North Carolina.\nThrough TAT Israel, TAT is an OEM of a broad range of heat transfer solutions, air conditioning systems and other cooling systems used in mechanical and electronic systems on board military and\ncommercial aircraft as well as in ground systems. TAT Israel is also an OEM for a wide range of aviation accessories and provides limited MRO services for military and commercial customers, mainly for aviation\naccessories. TAT Israel is a repair station certified by the Federal Aviation Administration (“FAA”).\nThrough its Limco subsidiary, TAT provides MRO services for airlines, air cargo carriers, maintenance service centers and the military, primarily for heat transfer components. Limco is a repair station\ncertified by the Federal Aviation Administration (“FAA”) and European Aviation Safety Agency (\"EASA\"). Limco is also an OEM of heat transfer solutions.\nThrough its Piedmont subsidiary, TAT provides MRO services for aviation components in the area of landing gears, APUs and Machining and Plating services (MPG). During 2021 Piedmont has engaged\nin leasing of APUs mainly for the B777 aircraft. Piedmont is an FAA-certified repair station and provides its services to airlines, air cargo carriers, maintenance service centers and, to a lesser extent, the military.\nThrough its Turbochrome subsidiary, TAT provides MRO services in the area of jet engine overhaul, which includes the overhaul and coating of jet engine components such as turbine vanes and blades,\nfan blades, variable inlet guide vanes and afterburner flaps. Turbochrome is certified by the FAA and EASA.\nIn addition, TAT, through its Piedmont subsidiary, holds approximately 5% of the equity securities of First Aviation Services Inc.(“FAvS”).\n1\nDuring the years 2020 and 2021 the COVID-19 pandemic had an adverse effect on our industry and the markets in which we operate. The COVID-19 outbreak has significantly impacted the aviation\nmarket in which TAT’s customers operate and has resulted in a reduction of TAT’s business with some of these customers. Global supply shortages emerged for certain products, leading to delays in delivery\nschedule. Additionally, recent cost inflation stemming from the pandemic may lead to higher material and labor costs. We actively monitor and respond to the changing conditions created by the pandemic, with\nfocus on prioritizing the health and safety of our employees, dedicating resources to support our communities, and innovating to address our customers’ needs. In order to mitigate the impact of the decline in\nbusiness as a result of the pandemic, TAT implemented measures to reduce its expenses, including a reduction in its headcount as well as other cost savings measures. The potential long-term impact and duration\nof the COVID-19 pandemic on the global economy and our business continue to be difficult to assess or predict. Related public health and safety measures have resulted in significant social disruption and have\nhad an adverse effect on economic conditions and spending, inflation, interest rates, and business investment, all of which have affected our business.\nFurther to the actions taken by TAT’s management in 2020 due to the effect of COVID-19 on the TAT's industry, TAT announced a restructuring plan in March 2021, which included the transfer of the\nCompany's activity from our leased facility in Gedera to a facility in Kiryat Gat, Israel which is leased by our wholly-owned subsidiary Turbochrome from the Israel Land Authority (“ILA”) pursuant to a long-\nterm lease agreement expiring in 2045 (with no rental payments due to the ILA in respect of such lease) and to our partially owned facility in Tulsa, Oklahoma. These actions will enable TAT to concentrate in heat\nexchanges cores activity in the United States allowing for better operational flow, getting closer to our customer base, and cutting fixed costs. For more information about the company's restructuring plan please\nsee note 9 to the company financial statements.\nMacroeconomic conditions, including inflation, rising interest rates and recessionary concerns, as well as ongoing labor cost pressures, transportation and shipping cost pressures, and the COVID-19\npandemic, have had, and may continue to have, a negative impact on our business, financial condition, profitability, and cash flows. For instance, we were negatively impacted in fiscal 2022 by persistent cost\npressures, including supply chain and labor costs. We expect inflationary cost pressures to continue in 2023 and we continue to closely monitor macroeconomic conditions, including customer behavior, and the\nimpact of these factors on customer demand. Continuing or worsening inflation, recessionary concerns and/or supply chain and labor challenges, as well as the current turmoil in the banking industry, may\nnegatively impact our business, financial condition, profitability, and/or cash flows.\nGeopolitical events, including the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine and the related economic sanctions by Western governments on Russia, has caused greater uncertainty in the global\neconomy and exacerbated the inflation situation.\nTAT’s ordinary shares are publicly traded on the NASDAQ Global Market (“NASDAQ”) under the symbol “TATT” and on the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange (“TASE”) under the symbol “TAT Tech”. As\nused in this annual report, the terms “TAT”, “we,” “us,” and “our” mean TAT Technologies Ltd. and its subsidiaries, unless otherwise indicated.\nTAT consolidated financial statements appearing in this annual report are prepared in U.S. dollars and in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (“U.S. GAAP”).\nAll references in this annual report to “dollars” or “$” are to U.S. dollars and all references in this annual report to “NIS” are to New Israeli Shekels.\nStatements made in this annual report concerning the contents of any contract, agreement or other document are summaries of such contracts, agreements or documents and are not complete descriptions\nof all of their terms.

Risk Factors\nInvesting in our ordinary shares involves certain risks and uncertainties. You should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below before investing in our ordinary shares. Our business,\nprospects, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected due to any of the following risks. In that case, the value of our ordinary shares could decline, and you could lose all or part of\nyour investment.\n3\nRisks Related to Our Business and Our Industry\n• The aerospace industry is subject to significant regulation and oversight, and TAT and its subsidiaries may incur significant fines, penalties and costs if TAT and its subsidiaries do not comply with\nthese regulations.\n• TAT competes with a number of established companies in all aspects of TAT’s business, many of which have significantly greater resources or capabilities than TAT.\n• TAT derives a material share of its revenues from few major customers. If TAT loses any of these customers or they reduce the amount of business they do with TAT, TAT’s revenues may be seriously\naffected.\n• A part of the revenues of TAT and its subsidiaries are from contracts with the U.S. and Israeli governments and are subject to special risks. A loss of all, or a major portion, of these revenues from\ngovernment contracts could have a material adverse effect on TAT’s operations.\n• If TAT and its subsidiaries do not receive the governmental approvals necessary for the export of their products, TAT’s revenues may decrease. Similarly, if TAT’s suppliers and partners do not\nreceive their government approvals necessary to export their products or designs to TAT, TAT’s revenues may decrease.\n• TAT depends on a limited number of suppliers of components for certain of its products and if TAT or any of its subsidiaries are unable to obtain these components when needed, they would\nexperience delays in manufacturing their products and TAT’s financial results could be adversely affected.\n• TAT may face increased labor and raw materials costs. TAT may not be able to recoup future increases in the cost of wages and raw materials required for its operations through price increases for\nits products.\n• TAT’s future success depends on its ability to develop new offerings and technologies.\n• TAT may face significant risks in the management of its inventory, while failure to effectively manage its inventory levels may result in supply imbalances that could harm its business.\n• TAT’s backlog of projects under contract is subject to unexpected adjustments, delays in payments and cancellations.\n• TAT faces special risks from international sales operations which may have a material adverse effect on TAT’s business, operating results and financial condition.\n• The continuing effects of the COVID-19 pandemic are highly unpredictable and could be significant, and the duration and extent to which this will impact our future results of operations and\noverall financial performance remains uncertain.\n• TAT may engage in future acquisitions that could dilute TAT’s shareholders’ equity and harm TAT’s business, results of operations and financial condition.\n• Our strategic partnerships and relationships carry inherent business risks.\n• Rapid technological changes may adversely affect the market acceptance of TAT's products.\n• TAT has fixed-price contracts with some of its customers and TAT bears the risk of costs in excess of its estimates. In addition, TAT may not be able to pass on increased costs to its customers.\n• TAT depends on its key executives; it may not be able to hire and retain additional key employees or successfully integrate new members of its team; the loss of key employees could have a material\nadverse effect on TAT’s business.\n• TAT depends on its manufacturing and MRO facilities and any material damage to these facilities may adversely impact TAT’s operations.\n• TAT uses equipment that is not easily repaired or replaced, and therefore material equipment failures could cause TAT or its subsidiaries to be unable to meet quality or delivery expectations of its\ncustomers.\n• TAT may fail to maintain effective internal controls in accordance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002.\n• TAT has potential exposure to liabilities arising under environmental laws and regulations.\n• TAT is exposed to potential liabilities arising from product liability and warranty claims.\n• Significant disruptions of our information technology systems or breaches of our data security could adversely affect our business.\n• TAT’s activity in Israel may be adversely affected by a change in the exchange rate of the NIS against the dollar. Because exchange rates between the NIS and the dollar fluctuate continuously,\nexchange rate fluctuations, particularly larger periodic devaluations, may have an impact on TAT’s profitability and period to period comparisons of TAT’s results.\n4\nRisk Factors Related to Our Ordinary Shares\n• TAT’s share price has been volatile in the past and may decline in the future.\n• Substantial future sales of TAT’s ordinary shares by TAT’s principal shareholders may depress TAT’s share price.\nRisks Relating to Our Location in Israel\n• Because TAT has significant operations in Israel, TAT may be subject to political, economic and other conditions affecting Israel that could increase TAT’s operating expenses and disrupt TAT’s\nbusiness.\n• TAT’s results of operations may be negatively affected by the obligation of its personnel to perform military service.\n• Your rights and responsibilities as a shareholder are governed by Israeli law and may differ in some respects from the rights and responsibilities of shareholders under U.S. law.\n• Israeli law may delay, prevent or make difficult an acquisition of TAT, which could prevent a change of control and, therefore, depresses the price of TAT’s shares.\n• Investors and TAT’s shareholders generally may have difficulties enforcing a U.S. judgment against TAT, TAT’s executive officers and directors or asserting U.S. securities laws claims in Israel.\n• As a foreign private issuer whose shares are listed on NASDAQ, TAT may follow certain home country corporate governance practices instead of certain NASDAQ requirements.\nThe aerospace industry is subject to significant regulation and oversight, and TAT and its subsidiaries may incur significant fines, penalties and costs if TAT and its subsidiaries do not comply with these\nregulations.\nThe aerospace industry is highly regulated in the United States and elsewhere. To manufacture, sell and service parts used in aircrafts, TAT and its subsidiaries must be certified or accepted by the FAA,\nEASA, the United States Department of Defense and comparable agencies in other countries and by leading original equipment manufacturers (“OEMs”). If any of our material certifications, authorizations or\napprovals are revoked or suspended, then the operations of TAT or its subsidiaries, as the case may be, will be significantly curtailed and TAT and its subsidiaries could be subjected to significant fines and\npenalties. In the future, new and more demanding government regulations may be adopted or industry oversight may be increased. TAT and its subsidiaries may have to incur significant additional costs to achieve\ncompliance with new regulations or to reacquire a revoked or suspended license or approval, which could materially reduce profitability.\nTAT competes with a number of established companies in all aspects of TAT’s business, many of which have significantly greater resources or capabilities than TAT.\nTAT’s major competitors in the area of OEM heat transfer solutions and aviation accessories, are other OEMs who manufacture heat transfer solutions. These include:\n(i) Manufacturers based in the United States, such as the Hughes-Treitler division of Ametek Inc., Boyd Corporation, , Collins Aerospace, Honeywell International, and Triumph Thermal Systems;\n(ii) Manufacturers based in Europe such as HS Marston Aerospace Ltd., a subsidiary of Collins Aerospace, Secan and Liebherr-Aerospace Toulouse S.A.; and\n(iii) Manufacturers based in Asia such as Sumitomo Precision Products from Japan.\nMany of TAT’s competitors are far larger, have substantially greater resources than TAT, including technical, financial, research and development, marketing and distribution capabilities, and enjoy greater\nmarket recognition. These competitors may be able to achieve greater economies of scale and may be less vulnerable to price competition than TAT. In addition, some of those companies are considered to be tier\none suppliers offering customers a wider range of systems and products, in addition to heat transfer solutions, as a bundle. TAT may not be able to offer its products as part of integrated systems to the same extent\nas its competitors or successfully develop or introduce new products that are more cost effective or offer better performance than those of its competitors. Failure to do so could adversely affect TAT’s business,\nfinancial condition and results of operations.\n5\nTAT’s major competitors in the area of MRO services for heat transfer components are the service divisions of OEMs, including Honeywell-Lori, Honeywell Secan, Honeywell Singapore, Hamilton\nMalaysia, Hamilton Maastricht, and Liebherr Aerospace Saline, in addition to the in-house maintenance services of various commercial airlines and other independent service providers, including Triumph\nAccessory Services, Drake Air – Ametek, American Cooler Service – Aviation Technical Services, Lufthansa Technik and Elite Aerospace, a division of Meggitt.\nTAT’s major competitors in the area of MRO services for aviation components, landing gears and APUs, are the service divisions of OEMs, the in-house maintenance services of various commercial\nairlines and other independent service providers, including Standard Aero Group Inc., Aerotech International Inc., Honeywell International, AAR Corp., Safran, Liebherr, Turbine Aero, Hawker Pacific and APRO.\nTAT’s major competitors in the area of overhaul and coating of jet engine components are the service divisions of OEMs, the in-house maintenance services of various commercial airlines and other\nindependent service providers, including Safran, General Electric, GKN, PAS MCT Japan and others. With respect to masking materials, TAT's major competitors are APV Coatings, Praxair, Saint-Gobain and\nothers.\nCompetition in the MRO market is based on price, quality, engineering solutions, breadth of services, and the ability to perform repairs and overhauls rapidly. A number of our competitors have inherent\ncompetitive advantages. For example, we compete with the service divisions of large OEMs which are able to derive significant brand recognition from their OEM manufacturing activities. We also compete with\nthe in-house service divisions of large commercial airlines where there is a strong incentive for an airline to fully-utilize the services of its maintenance employees and facilities.\nFurther, TAT’s competitors may have additional competitive advantages, such as:\n• The ability to adapt faster to changes in customer requirements and industry conditions or trends;\n• Greater access to capital;\n• Stronger relationships with customers and suppliers;\n• Greater name recognition;\n• Access to superior technology and greater marketing resources;\n• The ability to offer complete systems in addition to components; and\n• The ability to bundle heat transfer components and solutions and other aircraft components.\nIf TAT is unable to overcome these competitive disadvantages, then TAT’s business, financial condition and results of operations would be adversely affected.\n6\nTAT derives a material share of its revenues from few major customers. If TAT loses any of these customers or they reduce the amount of business they do with TAT, TAT’s revenues may be seriously affected.\nFive customers accounted for approximately 26.4%, 27.8% and 24.6% of TAT’s revenues for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. TAT’s major customers may not maintain\nthe same volume of business with TAT in the future. If TAT loses any of these customers or they reduce the amount of business they do with TAT, TAT’s revenues may be seriously affected.\nA part of the revenues of TAT and its subsidiaries are from contracts with the U.S. and Israeli governments and are subject to special risks. A loss of all, or a major portion, of these revenues from\ngovernment contracts could have a material adverse effect on TAT’s operations.\nA portion of the revenues of TAT and its subsidiaries are from contracts with the U.S. and Israeli governments. Sales to the U.S. and Israeli governments accounted for approximately 6.3%, 5.6% and\n8.1% of TAT’s revenues on a consolidated basis for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\nBusiness with the U.S. and Israeli governments, as well as with the governments of other countries, is subject to unique risks which do not exist when doing business with other private parties. These risks\ninclude the ability of the governmental authorities to unilaterally:\n• Suspend TAT or any of its subsidiaries from receiving new contracts pending resolution of alleged violations of procurement laws or regulations;\n• Terminate existing contracts, with or without cause, at any time;\n• Condition the receipt of new contracts on conditions which are beyond the control of TAT;\n• Reduce the value of existing contracts;\n• Audit the contract-related costs and fees of TAT and its subsidiaries, including allocated indirect costs; and\n• Control or prohibit the export of products of TAT and its subsidiaries.\n• Suspend TAT or any of its subsidiaries from receiving new contracts pending resolution of alleged violations of procurement laws or regulations;\nAlso, military and defense budget cuts may result in reduced demand for the products and manufacturing services of TAT and its subsidiaries. Smaller budgets could result in reduction in the business\nrevenues of TAT and its subsidiaries.\nIf TAT and its subsidiaries do not receive the governmental approvals necessary for the export of their products, TAT’s revenues may decrease. Similarly, if TAT’s suppliers and partners do not receive their\ngovernment approvals necessary to export their products or designs to TAT, TAT’s revenues may decrease.\nUnder Israeli law, the export of certain products and know-how of TAT and its subsidiaries is subject to approval by the Israeli Ministry of Defense. Prior to initiating sales proposals for the export of these\nproducts and know-how and to the actual shipment of such products or know-how, TAT and its subsidiaries must obtain permits from the Ministry of Defense. TAT and its subsidiaries may not be able to receive in\na timely manner, or at all, all the required permits for which they may apply in the future.\nSimilarly, many countries have laws according to which the export of certain military products, technical designs and spare parts require the prior approval of, or export license from, their governments.\nThis process also applies to our partners and suppliers. If TAT and its subsidiaries or its partners and suppliers are unable to receive all the required permits and/or licenses in a timely manner, or at all, TAT’s\nrevenues may decrease.\n7\nTAT depends on a limited number of suppliers of components for certain of its products and if TAT or any of its subsidiaries are unable to obtain these components when needed, they would experience delays\nin manufacturing their products and TAT’s financial results could be adversely affected.\nTAT relies on a limited number of key suppliers for parts for certain of its OEM activities and MRO services. Some of these suppliers are currently the sole source of one or more components upon which\nTAT is dependent. For example, Honeywell International Inc. is a key supplier to TAT of APU spare parts and of certain other components used by TAT and its subsidiaries for OEM activities and in the provision\nof MRO services. TAT's subsidiary, Piedmont, is a Honeywell licensed Authorized Repair Center for APUs under two separate agreements, for military and commercial applications. In September 2020 Piedmont\nsigned a 10 years agreement with Honeywell for the commercial application. Under this contract Piedmont is an authorized MRO station under Honeywell's license.\nDuring June 2021 Piedmont has also signed a similar contract for the APU 331-500 serving the Boeing 777 aircraft.\nIn July 2021 Piedmont signed another contract granting Piedmont a 10 years MRO license for MRO of APU131 serving the Boeing 737 platform and AirBus A319-320-321 platform.\nAlso, Piedmont is a provider of services for the Safran and Liebherr landing gear systems (used on ATRs and Ejet platforms), and to do so, Piedmont is dependent on these OEM’s to provide parts and\nengineering support.\nSuppliers of some of these components require TAT to place orders with significant lead time to assure supply in accordance with TAT’s requirements. A delay in the supply of these components can\nsignificantly delay the delivery of our products and services. If TAT were to engage in a commercial dispute with or be unable to obtain adequate supplies of parts from these suppliers at commercially reasonable\nprices or required lead time, TAT could experience delays in manufacturing and its financial results could be adversely affected. Increased costs associated with supplied materials or components could increase\nTAT’s costs and reduce TAT’s profitability if TAT is unable to pass these cost increases on to its customers.\nIn addition, the COVID-19 pandemic may continue to negatively impact the global supply chain and we may experience negative impacts from supply chain pressures. We are working with our suppliers\nto mitigate delays in our receipt of necessary raw materials, components and other supplies and to reduce supply chain costs.\nTAT may face increased labor and raw materials costs. TAT may not be able to recoup future increases in the cost of wages and raw materials required for its operations through price increases for its\nproducts.\nWe are impacted by inflationary increases in wages and cost of raw materials. In all countries in which we operate, wage and benefit inflation, whether driven by competition for talent, or ordinary course\npay increases and other inflationary pressure, may increase our cost of providing services and reduce our profitability. In addition, border closings, lockdowns and labor shortages resulting from COVID-19, as\nwell as the continuing economic recovery, negatively impacted global supply and distribution capabilities. Decreases in the availability of supplies, increases in the cost of supplies, and delivery issues have caused\nshortages and delays, as well as increased costs for the procurement of raw materials, components and other supplies required for our performance. TAT may not be able to recoup future increases in the cost of\nlabor and raw materials through price increases for its products and services. Our operating profits and margins under our contracts could be adversely affected by these factors, particularly if the current\ninflationary pressures are prolonged. If TAT is unable to obtain the raw materials required for its operation, TAT could experience delays or disruptions in the provision of its services and its financial results could\nbe adversely affected.\nTAT’s future success depends on its ability to develop new offerings and technologies.\nThe markets we serve are characterized by rapid changes in technologies and evolving industry standards. In addition, some of our products are installed on, and some of our services are provided in\nconnection with, platforms that may have a limited life or become obsolete. Unless we develop new offerings or enhance our existing offerings, we may be susceptible to loss of market share resulting from the\nintroduction of new or enhanced offerings by competitors.\n8\nTAT may face significant risks in the management of its inventory, while failure to effectively manage its inventory levels may result in supply imbalances that could harm its business\nWe maintain an inventory of exchangeable units of heat transfer solutions, aviation accessories, aviation components, APUs, landing gears, engine blades and coating materials and other spare parts\nrelated to our products and services in various locations, including with third party logistics providers. Due to the long lead time of our suppliers and manufacturing cycles, we need to forecast demand and commit\nsignificant resources towards these inventories. As such, we are subject to significant risks in managing the inventory needs of our business, including estimates of the appropriate demand across our products.\nShould actual market conditions differ from our estimates, our future results of operations could be materially adversely affected. In the future, we may be required to record write-downs of finished products and\nmaterials on-hand as a result of future changes in our sales forecasts.\nTAT’s backlog of projects under contract is subject to unexpected adjustments, delays in payments and cancellations.\nOur backlog includes purchase orders received from our customers for our products or services and our estimation of the maximum potential revenues that are expected to be derived from frame\nagreements with our customers. There is no legal obligation from the customer to purchase our products or services under those frame agreements. In addition, we use estimations to evaluate the potential revenue\nfrom these agreements. From time to time, for reasons beyond our control, projects are delayed, scaled back, suspended or cancelled, or the customer delays making payments, which may adversely affect the\nrevenue, profit and cash flow that we ultimately receive from contracts reflected in our backlog.\nTAT faces special risks from international sales operations which may have a material adverse effect on TAT’s business, operating results and financial condition.\nIn the years ending December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, approximately 92%, 89% and 91% of TAT’s sales, respectively, resulted from TAT’s operations out of Israel. This revenue concentration is subject\nto various risks, including:\n• Governmental embargoes or foreign trade restrictions;\n• Changes in U.S. and foreign governmental regulations;\n• Changes in foreign exchange rates;\n• Tariffs;\n• Other trade barriers;\n• Political, economic and social instability; and\n• Difficulties collecting accounts receivable.\nAccordingly, TAT and its subsidiaries may encounter significant difficulties in connection with the sale of their products in international markets.\nAs a result of the current geopolitical tensions and conflict between Russia and Ukraine, and the recent invasion by Russia of Ukraine, the governments of the United States, EU, Japan and other\njurisdictions have recently announced the imposition of sanctions on certain industry sectors and parties in Russia and certain impacted regions, as well as enhanced export controls on certain products and\nindustries. Due to such sanctions, our subsidiary Limco, has ceased selling its products to customers in Russia. While our business in Russia is of limited in scope, these restrictions may cause a reduction of our\nsales and financial results.\n9\nThe continuing effects of the COVID-19 pandemic are highly unpredictable and could be significant, and the duration and extent to which this will impact our future results of operations and overall\nfinancial performance remains uncertain.\nDuring the years 2020 and 2021 the COVID-19 pandemic had an adverse effect on our industry and the markets in which we operate. The COVID-19 outbreak has significantly impacted the aviation\nmarket in which TAT’s customers operate and has resulted in a reduction of TAT’s business with some of these customers. In order to mitigate the impact of the decline in business as a result of the pandemic, TAT\nimplemented measures to reduce its expenses, including the Company's restructuring plan announced in March 2021, reduction in its headcount as well as other cost savings measures. Please see Note 9 to the\ncompany financial statements. The Company applied and received governmental assistance as part of the COVID-19 relief programs provided by the Israeli government and certain states in the United States in\nwhich the Company and its subsidiaries operate. Please see Notes 10 and 11 to the company financial statements for long term loans, credit lines and grants received in connection with governmental assistance.\nThe potential long-term impact and duration of the COVID-19 pandemic on the global economy and our business continue to be difficult to assess or predict. Related public health and safety measures have\nresulted in significant social disruption and have had an adverse effect on economic conditions and spending, inflation, interest rates, and business investment, all of which have affected our business.\nTAT may engage in future acquisitions that could dilute TAT’s shareholders’ equity and harm TAT’s business, results of operations and financial condition.\nTAT has pursued, and will continue to pursue, growth opportunities through organic growth as well as acquisition of businesses, products and technologies.\nTAT is unable to predict whether or when any prospective acquisition will be completed. TAT may not be able to successfully identify suitable acquisition candidates, complete acquisitions, integrate the\nacquired businesses into its operations, or expand into new markets. The process of integrating an acquired business may be prolonged due to unforeseen difficulties and may require a disproportionate amount of\nTAT’s resources, including management attention. Furthermore, once integrated, acquisitions may not achieve comparable levels of revenues, profitability or productivity as TAT’s existing business or otherwise\nperform as expected. The occurrence of any of these events could harm TAT’s business, financial condition or results of operations. Future acquisitions may require substantial capital resources, which may require\nTAT to seek additional debt or equity financing.\nFuture acquisitions by TAT could result in the following, any of which could materially harm TAT’s results of operations or the price of TAT’s ordinary shares:\n• Issuance of equity securities that would dilute TAT’s shareholders’ percentages of ownership;\n• Large one-time write-offs;\n• The incurrence of debt and contingent liabilities;\n• Difficulties in the assimilation and integration of operations, personnel, technologies, products and information systems of the acquired companies;\n• Diversion of management’s attention from other business activities and concerns;\n• Contractual disputes;\n• Risks of entering geographic and business markets in which TAT has no or only limited prior experience; and\n• Potential loss of key employees of acquired organizations.\nOur strategic partnerships and relationships carry inherent business risks.\nWe may participate in strategic partnerships and joint ventures in a number of countries. For example, in November 2015, we signed a joint venture agreement with Russian-based Engineering, to\nestablish a new facility for the provision of MRO services for heat transfer components in Russia and the Commonwealth of Independent States (“CIS”). The new company, TAT-Engineering LLC, is based in\nNovosibirsk’s Tolmachevo airport.\nOur actions with respect to these affiliated companies may be restricted to some degree by shareholder agreements entered into with our strategic partners. Our business, financial condition, results of\noperations and prospects may be materially harmed if disagreements develop with our partners. Our ability to withdraw funds and dividends from these entities may depend on the consent of partners. If one of our\nstrategic partners becomes subject to investigation, sanctions or liability, TAT might be adversely affected. Furthermore, strategic partnerships in emerging markets are accompanied by risks inherent to those\nmarkets, such as an increased probability of a partner defaulting on obligations or losing a partner with important insights in that region. Strategic partnerships in emerging markets are subject to greater risks than\nstrategic partnerships in more developed markets, including significant political, legal and economic risks and risks related to fluctuations in currencies. As a result of the current geopolitical tensions and conflict\nbetween Russia and Ukraine, and the recent invasion by Russia of Ukraine, the governments of the United States, EU, Japan and other jurisdictions have recently announced the imposition of sanctions on certain\nindustry sectors and parties in Russia and certain impacted regions, as well as enhanced export controls on certain products and industries. Due to such sanctions, during 2022 our joint venture in Russia ceased to\npurchase heat-exchange cores from Limco, our US subsidiary, and therefore the joint venture had to materially limit the extent of the MRO services it provides to its customers.\n10\nRapid technological changes may adversely affect the market acceptance of TAT's products.\nThe aerospace and defense markets in which TAT competes are subject to technological changes, introduction of new products, changes in customer demands and evolving industry standards. For\nexample, new materials, new structures and 3D printing – a technology based on the principle of joining thin layers of materials, in horizontal cross-section, to build up a real, three-dimensional object from a\ndigital model – may enable the manufacturing of high-quality and new characterization heat exchangers in serial production with a better return of value. The future success of TAT will depend upon its ability to\nkeep pace with technological developments and to timely address the increasingly sophisticated needs of its customers by supporting existing and new technologies and by developing enhancements to its current\nproducts and by introducing new ones.\nTAT has fixed-price contracts with some of its customers and TAT bears the risk of costs in excess of its estimates. In addition, TAT may not be able to pass on increased costs to its customers.\nTAT has entered into multi-year, fixed-price contracts with some of its MRO and OEM customers. Pursuant to these contracts, TAT realizes all the benefits or costs resulting from any increases or\ndecreases in the cost of providing services and products to these customers. Several of TAT’s contracts do not allow TAT to recover for increases in raw material prices, taxes or labor costs, while other contracts\nmay permit, to a limited extent, periodic price adjustments. Any increase in these costs could increase the cost of operating our business and reduce our profitability. Factors such as inaccurate pricing and increases\nin the cost of labor, materials or overhead may result in cost over-runs and losses on those agreements. TAT may not succeed in obtaining customer approval to re-price a particular product and may not be able to\nrecoup previous losses resulting from incomplete or inaccurate engineering data. In addition, as costs increase, TAT may not be able to pass on such increased costs to other customers. This could materially impact\nTAT’s profitability.\nTAT depends on its key executives; it may not be able to hire and retain additional key employees or successfully integrate new members of its team; the loss of key employees could have a material adverse\neffect on TAT’s business.\nTAT’s success depends to a large extent on the experience and expertise of its senior management. Any member of TAT’s senior management may choose to end his or her employment with TAT and seek\nemployment with others for any reason. The loss of the expertise of TAT’s senior management through death, disability or an employee’s decision to end his or her employment could have a material and adverse\neffect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. TAT is not the beneficiary of life or disability insurance covering any of its senior management, key employees or other personnel.\nTAT depends on its manufacturing and MRO facilities and any material damage to these facilities may adversely impact TAT’s operations.\nTAT’s results of operations depend in large part on its ability to provide prompt and efficient service to its customers upon receipt of orders, either the manufacture and delivery of OEM products or the\nprovision of MRO services. As a result, any material disruption of TAT’s day-to-day operations could have a material adverse effect on its business, customer relations and profitability. TAT relies on its Kiryat\nGat, Israel, Kernersville and Greensboro, North Carolina and Tulsa, Oklahoma facilities for the manufacture of its OEM products and provision of its MRO services. A war or terrorist act, fire, flood, earthquake or\nother disaster or condition that significantly damaged or destroyed any of these facilities would have a material adverse effect on the operations of TAT.\nTAT uses equipment that is not easily repaired or replaced, and therefore material equipment failures could cause TAT or its subsidiaries to be unable to meet quality or delivery expectations of its customers.\nMany of TAT’s service and manufacturing processes are dependent on equipment that is not easily repaired or replaced. As a result, unexpected equipment failures could result in production delays or the\nmanufacture of defective products. TAT’s ability to meet its customers’ expectations with respect to on-time delivery of repaired components or quality OEM products is critical. Failure by TAT to meet the quality\nor delivery expectations of its customers could lead to the loss of one or more of its significant customers.\nTAT may fail to maintain effective internal controls in accordance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002.\nThe Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 imposes certain duties on TAT and its executives and directors. TAT’s efforts to comply with the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (“SOX”)\ngoverning internal controls and procedures for financial reporting have resulted in increased general and administrative expenses and a diversion of management time and attention. TAT expects these efforts to\nrequire the continued commitment of significant resources. TAT may identify material weaknesses or significant deficiencies in its assessments of its internal controls over financial reporting. Failure to maintain\neffective internal controls over financial reporting could result in investigation or sanctions by regulatory authorities and could have a material adverse effect on TAT’s operating results, investor confidence in\nTAT’s reported financial information and the market price of TAT’s ordinary shares. Our independent registered public accounting firm is not required to performed audit of our internal controls over financial\nreporting as of December 31, 2022.\n11\nTAT has potential exposure to liabilities arising under environmental laws and regulations.\nTAT’s business operations and facilities are subject to various federal, state, and local laws and regulations related to the environment, including, but not limited to, regulations that govern the discharge of\npollutants and hazardous substances into the air and water and the handling, storage and disposal of such materials. Compliance with such laws as they relate to the handling, storage and disposal of hazardous\nsubstances is a significant obligation for TAT at each of its facilities. If it fails to comply with these and other environmental-related laws and regulations, TAT would be subject to serious consequences, including\nfines and other sanctions, and limitations on its operations due to changes to, or revocations of, the environmental permits applicable to its facilities. The adoption of new laws and regulations, stricter enforcement\nof existing laws and regulations, the discovery of previously unknown contamination or the imposition of new cleanup requirements could require TAT to incur costs and become subject to new or increased\nliabilities that could increase TAT’s operating costs and adversely affect the manner in which we conduct our business.\nUnder certain environmental laws, liability associated with an investigation or remediation of hazardous substances can arise from a broad range of properties, including properties currently or formerly\noperated by TAT or any of its predecessors, as well as properties to which TAT sent hazardous substances or wastes for treatment, storage, or disposal. Costs and other obligations can arise from claims for toxic\ntorts, natural resource and other damages, as well as the investigation and clean-up of contamination at such properties. Under certain environmental laws, such liability may be imposed jointly and severally, so\nTAT may be responsible for more than its proportionate share and may even be responsible for the entire liability at issue. The extent of any such liability can be difficult to predict.\nTAT is exposed to potential liabilities arising from product liability and warranty claims.\nTAT is exposed to potential liabilities for personal injury or death as a result of the failure of an aircraft component that was designed, manufactured, serviced or supplied by TAT. TAT believes that, in an\neffort to improve operating margins, some customers have delayed the replacement of parts beyond their recommended lifetime, which may undermine aircraft safety and increase the risk of liability of TAT and its\nsubsidiaries.\nIf any of our products are defective, we could be required to redesign or recall those products or pay substantial damages or warranty claims. Such an event could result in significant expenses, disrupt\nsales and damage our reputation and that of our products and services. There can be no assurance that TAT will not experience material product liability losses in the future, that it will not incur significant costs to\ndefend such claims, that, although TAT maintains product liability insurance, its insurance coverage will be adequate if claims were to arise or that it would be able to maintain insurance coverage in the future at\nan acceptable cost. A successful claim brought against TAT or its subsidiaries in excess of its available insurance coverage may have a material adverse effect on TAT’s business.\nIn addition, contractual disputes over warranties can arise in the ordinary course of business. TAT may be subject to requests from customers for cost sharing or pricing adjustments as a part of their\ncommercial relationships, even though the customers had previously agreed to bear these risks.\nSignificant disruptions of our information technology systems or breaches of our data security could adversely affect our business.\nOur operations depend on the continued and secure functioning of our computer and communications systems and the protection of information stored in computer databases maintained by us, and in\ncertain circumstances, by third parties. Such systems and databases are subject to breach, damage, disruption or failure from, among other things, cyber-attacks and other unauthorized intrusions. In particular, we\nmay be targeted by experienced computer hackers who may attempt to penetrate our computer systems and misappropriate or compromise our confidential information or that of our customers. A significant\ninvasion, interruption, destruction or breakdown of our information technology, or IT, systems and/or infrastructure by persons with authorized or unauthorized access could negatively impact our business and\noperations. We could also experience business interruption, information theft and/or reputational damage from cyber-attacks, which may compromise our systems and lead to data leakage either internally or at our\nthird-party providers. Both data that has been inputted into our main IT platform, which covers records of transactions, financial data and other data reflected in our results of operations, as well as data related to\nour proprietary rights (such as research and development, and other intellectual property-related data), are subject to material cyber security risks. To date, we are not aware that we have experienced any loss of, or\ndisruption to, material information as a result of any such malware or cyber-attack.\nTAT’s activity in Israel may be adversely affected by a change in the exchange rate of the NIS against the dollar. Because exchange rates between the NIS and the dollar fluctuate continuously, exchange rate\nfluctuations, particularly larger periodic devaluations, may have an impact on TAT’s profitability and period to period comparisons of TAT’s results.\nTAT’s financial statements are stated in dollars, while a portion of TAT’s expenses in Israel, primarily labor expenses, are incurred in NIS and a portion of its revenues are quoted in NIS and in Euro.\nAdditionally, certain assets, as well as a portion of TAT’s liabilities, are denominated in NIS. Because exchange rates between the NIS and the dollar fluctuate continuously, exchange rate fluctuations, particularly\nlarger periodic devaluations, may have an impact on TAT’s profitability and period to period comparisons of TAT’s results. TAT’s results may be adversely affected by the devaluation of the NIS in relation to the\ndollar (or if such devaluation is on a lagging basis), if TAT’s revenues in NIS are higher than TAT’s expenses in NIS and/ or the value of TAT’s assets in NIS are higher than TAT’s liabilities in NIS. Alternatively,\nTAT’s results may be adversely affected by an appreciation of the NIS in relation to the dollar (or if such appreciation is on a lagging basis), if TAT’s expenses in NIS are higher than TAT’s revenues in NIS and/or\nTAT’s liabilities in NIS are higher than TAT’s assets in NIS. From time to time, we enter into hedging transactions to attempt to limit the impact of foreign currency fluctuations. However, the protection provided\nby such hedging transactions may be partial and leave certain exchange rate-related losses and risks uncovered. Therefore, our business and profitability may be harmed by such exchange rate fluctuations.\n12\nRisk Factors Related to Our Ordinary Shares\nTAT’s share price has been volatile in the past and may decline in the future.\nTAT’s ordinary shares have experienced significant market price and volume fluctuations in the past and may experience significant market price and volume fluctuations in the future, in response to\nfactors such as the following, some of which are beyond TAT’s control:\n• Quarterly variations in TAT’s operating results;\n• Operating results that vary from the expectations of securities analysts and investors;\n• Changes in expectations as to TAT’s future financial performance, including financial estimates by securities analysts and investors;\n• Announcements of technological innovations or new products by TAT or TAT’s competitors;\n• Announcements by TAT or TAT’s competitors of significant contracts, acquisitions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures or capital commitments;\n• Announcements by third parties of significant claims or proceedings against us;\n• Additions or departures of key personnel;\n• Future sales of TAT’s ordinary shares (by our controlling shareholders or others);\n• De-listing of TAT’s shares from NASDAQ and/or from the TASE;\n• Stock market price and volume fluctuation;\n• Legal proceedings against TAT’s controlling shareholders; and\n• Regulatory actions by securities authorities which impacts TAT’s interaction with securities analysts and institutional investors.\nEquity stock markets can undergo extreme price and volume fluctuations. Market fluctuations, as well as political and economic conditions, such as a recession, interest rate or currency rate fluctuations\nand political events or hostilities in or surrounding Israel, could adversely affect the market price of TAT’s ordinary shares.\nIn the past, securities class action litigation has often been brought against companies following periods of volatility in the market price of their securities. TAT may be the target of similar litigation in the\nfuture. Securities litigation could result in substantial costs and divert management’s attention and resources both of which could have a material adverse effect on TAT’s business and results of operations.\nSubstantial future sales of TAT’s ordinary shares by TAT’s principal shareholders may depress TAT’s share price.\nTAT’s principal shareholders, FIMI Israel Opportunity FIVE, Limited Partnership and FIMI Opportunity V, L.P. (“FIMI” or the “FIMI Funds”), beneficially own together 58.96% of TAT’s outstanding\nshares. If FIMI sells a substantial number of TAT’s ordinary shares or if the perception exists that FIMI may sell a substantial number of TAT’s ordinary shares, the market price of TAT’s ordinary shares may fall.\nAny substantial sales of TAT’s shares in the public market may also impede our ability to sell equity or equity-related securities in the future at a time, in a place and on terms TAT deems appropriate.\n13\nRisks Relating to Our Location in Israel\nBecause TAT has significant operations in Israel, TAT may be subject to political, economic and other conditions affecting Israel that could increase TAT’s operating expenses and disrupt TAT’s business.\nTAT is incorporated under the laws of the State of Israel. TAT’s executive offices, its research and development facilities and manufacturing plant are also located in Israel. As a result, political, economic\nand military conditions affecting Israel directly influence TAT. Any major hostilities involving Israel, a full or partial mobilization of reserve forces of the Israeli army, the interruption or curtailment of trade\nbetween Israel and its present trading partners, or a significant downturn in the economic or financial condition of Israel could have a material adverse effect on TAT’s business, financial condition and results of\noperations.\nSince its establishment in 1948, Israel and its Arab neighbors have engaged in a number of armed conflicts. A state of hostility, varying from time to time in intensity and degree, has led to security and\neconomic challenges for Israel. Major hostilities between Israel and its neighbors may hinder Israel’s international trade and lead to economic downturn. This, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on TAT’s\noperations and business. In recent years, there has been an escalation in violence among Israel, Hamas (which controls the Gaza Strip), the Palestinian Authority (which controls in the West Bank) and other\ngroups, as well as extensive hostilities along Israel’s border with the Gaza Strip such as the missiles fired from the Gaza Strip into Israel. Ongoing violence between Israel and the Palestinians as well as tension\nbetween Israel and its Arab neighbors and Iran may have a material adverse effect on TAT’s business, financial conditions and results of operations.\nFurthermore, there are a number of countries, primarily Arab and Muslim countries, that restrict or frown upon business with Israel or Israeli companies, and TAT is precluded from marketing its products\nto these countries. Restrictive laws or policies directed towards Israel or Israeli companies may have an adverse impact on TAT’s operations, TAT’s financial results or the expansion of TAT’s business.\nAdditionally, Israel’s most recent general elections were held on November 1, 2022. These elections were the fifth round of elections since April 2019. As of February 2023, the current elected\ngovernment in Israel is pursuing extensive reforms to Israel’s judicial system. Certain financial, legal and commercial organizations and entities have claimed that such changes, if adopted, could adversely affect\nthe macroeconomic condition in which we operate. At this stage, the proposed legislation has not become effective, and its scope has not been fully determined; we cannot assess the potential impacts of these\nchanges and their likelihood on our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operation.\nTAT’s results of operations may be negatively affected by the obligation of its personnel to perform military service.\nMany of TAT’s employees and some of TAT’s directors and senior management based in Israel are obligated to perform annual reserve duty in the Israel Defense Forces (“IDF”) and may be called for\nactive duty under emergency circumstances at any time. If a military conflict or war arises, these individuals could be required to serve in the military for extended periods of time. TAT’s operations could be\ndisrupted by the absence of one or more of its senior management, key employees or a significant number of other employees for a significant period due to military service. Any such disruption in TAT’s\noperations could adversely affect TAT’s business.\nYour rights and responsibilities as a shareholder are governed by Israeli law and may differ in some respects from the rights and responsibilities of shareholders under U.S. law.\nTAT is incorporated under Israeli law. The rights and responsibilities of holders of TAT’s ordinary shares are governed by TAT’s memorandum of association, articles of association and by Israeli law.\nThese rights and responsibilities differ in some respects from the rights and responsibilities of shareholders in typical U.S. corporations. In particular, each shareholder of an Israeli company has a duty to act in\ngood faith and in a customary manner in exercising his or her rights and fulfilling his or her obligations toward the company and other shareholders and to refrain from abusing his power in the company,\nincluding, among other things, in voting at the general meeting of shareholders on certain matters. Israeli law provides that these duties are applicable in shareholder votes on, among other things, amendments to a\ncompany’s articles of association, increases in a company’s authorized share capital, mergers and interested party transactions requiring shareholder approval. In addition, a controlling shareholder of an Israeli\ncompany, or a shareholder who knows that he or she possesses the power to determine the outcome of a shareholder vote or who has the power to appoint or prevent the appointment of a director or officer in the\ncompany, has a duty of fairness toward the company. However, Israeli law currently does not define the substance of this duty of fairness. Because Israeli corporate law has undergone extensive revision in recent\nyears, there is relatively little case law available to assist in understanding the implications of these provisions that govern shareholder behavior.\n14\nIsraeli law may delay, prevent or make difficult an acquisition of TAT, which could prevent a change of control and, therefore, depresses the price of TAT’s shares.\nIsraeli corporate law regulates mergers, requires tender offers for acquisitions of shares above specified thresholds, requires special approvals for transactions involving directors, officers or significant\nshareholders and regulates other matters that may be relevant to these types of transactions. Furthermore, Israeli tax considerations may make potential transactions unappealing to TAT or to some of TAT’s\nshareholders. These provisions of Israeli law may delay, prevent or make difficult an acquisition of TAT, which could prevent a change of control and therefore depress the price of TAT’s shares.\nInvestors and TAT’s shareholders generally may have difficulties enforcing a U.S. judgment against TAT, TAT’s executive officers and directors or asserting U.S. securities laws claims in Israel.\nTAT is incorporated in Israel and the majority of TAT’s executive officers and directors reside outside the United States. Service of process upon them may be difficult to effect within the United States.\nFurthermore, many of TAT’s assets and most of the assets of TAT’s executive officers and directors are located outside the United States. Therefore, a judgment obtained against TAT or certain of its executive\nofficers and directors in the United States, including one based on the civil liability provisions of the U.S. federal securities laws, may not be collectible in the United States and may not be enforced by an Israeli\ncourt. It also may be difficult for you to assert U.S. securities law claims in original actions instituted in Israel. However, subject to certain time limitations and other conditions, Israeli courts may enforce final\njudgments of U.S. courts for liquidated amounts in civil matters, including judgments based upon the civil liability provisions of those and similar acts.\nAs a foreign private issuer whose shares are listed on NASDAQ, TAT may follow certain home country corporate governance practices instead of certain NASDAQ requirements.\nAs a foreign private issuer whose shares are listed on NASDAQ, TAT is permitted to follow certain home country corporate governance practices instead of certain requirements of the NASDAQ\nMarketplace Rules. A foreign private issuer that elects to follow a home country practice instead of such requirements must submit to NASDAQ in advance a written statement from an independent counsel in such\nissuer’s home country certifying that the issuer’s practices are not prohibited by the home country’s laws. In addition, a foreign private issuer must disclose in its annual reports filed with the SEC or on its website\neach such requirement that it does not follow and describe the home country practice followed by the issuer instead of any such requirement. For example, Israel’s corporate governance or laws require that TAT\nobtain shareholder approval for certain dilutive events, such as for the establishment or amendment of certain equity-based compensation plans, an issuance that will result in a change of control of TAT, certain\ntransactions other than a public offering involving issuances of a 20% or more interest in TAT and certain acquisitions of the stock or assets of another company, which are not required by NASDAQ.\nItem 4. Information on the Company\nHistory and Development of TAT\nTAT was incorporated under the laws of the State of Israel in April 1985 under the name Galaxy Graphics Ltd. TAT changed its name to Galagraph Ltd. in August 1986 and to TAT Technologies Ltd. in\nMay 1992. TAT is a public limited liability company under the Israeli Companies Law 1999-5759, (“Israeli Companies Law”), and operates under this law and associated legislation. TAT’s registered offices and\nprincipal place of business are located at 5 Hamelacha St., Netanya 4250540 Israel, and its telephone number is +972-8-862-8500. TAT’s website is\nwww.tat-technologies.com. The information on TAT’S website is not incorporated by reference into this annual report.\nTAT was founded in 1985 to develop the computerized systems business of its then parent company, TAT Industries Ltd. (“TAT Industries”), a publicly-held Israeli corporation then engaged in the\nmanufacture and sale of aeronautical equipment. In December 1991, TAT acquired the heat exchange operations of TAT Industries and in 2000, TAT purchased the remaining operations of TAT Industries relating\nto the manufacture and maintenance of aviation accessories and leased certain of its properties.\nIn March 1987, TAT completed the initial public offering of its securities in the United States. TAT was listed on the NASDAQ Global Market (then known as the NASDAQ National Market) from its\ninitial public offering until July 1998 when the listing of TAT’s ordinary shares was transferred to the NASDAQ Capital Market. On June 24, 2009, TAT’s ordinary shares resumed trading on the NASDAQ Global\nMarket. Since August 2005 TAT’s shares have been traded also on the TASE.\nToday TAT is a provider of a variety of solutions and services to the commercial and military aerospace and ground defense industries through its Kiryat Gat facility, as well as through its subsidiaries,\nLimco and Piedmont in the U.S. (Limco and Piedmont are held by TAT through Limco-Piedmont, Inc. (“Limco-Piedmont”)) and Turbochrome in Kiryat Gat, Israel.\n15\nIn 1993, TAT acquired Limco Airepair, Inc. (“Limco”). Located in Tulsa, Oklahoma, Limco’s FAA-certified repair station provides MRO services for airlines, air cargo carriers, maintenance service\ncenters and the military, especially for heat transfer components. In addition to its MRO services, Limco is an OEM of heat transfer solutions for aircraft and system manufacturers and other selected related\nproducts.\nIn 2005, Limco acquired Piedmont, a company certified by the FAA to perform MRO services of APUs and landing gears. Located in Greensboro, North Carolina, Piedmont’s FAA-certified repair station\nprovides MRO services for airlines, air cargo carriers, maintenance service centers and the military, especially for landing gears and APUs.\nIn July 2007, Limco-Piedmont completed an initial public offering of its common stock and Limco-Piedmont’s shares were listed on the NASDAQ Global Market (symbol: LIMC) until July 2, 2009,\nwhen TAT acquired all of the publicly held shares of Limco-Piedmont (approximately 32% of Limco-Piedmont’s total shares) in a stock for stock merger. As a result of such merger, Limco-Piedmont again became\na wholly-owned subsidiary of TAT.\nFollowing a series of transactions occurring between March 2008 and March 2009, TAT acquired 70% control of Bental Industries Ltd.

This will enable TAT to develop the long-term high-value\nrelationships it strives to have with its customers to effectively complete and continue grow business and improve profitability. Currently, TAT’s focus is on two main markets: thermal management solutions and\nservices and Power and Actuation solutions and services.\nExecution of TAT’s strategy is based on the following principles:\n• Enhancing OEM capabilities — capitalizing on our technical expertise, experience and reputation in the market of heat transfer solutions to expand the scope of our OEM offerings to new aircrafts or to\nnew platforms in the existing aircrafts.\n• Expand the scope of MRO services—leveraging our technical expertise, engineering resources and facilities to broaden MRO services to additional types of aircraft and additional aircraft systems,\nsubsystems and components while developing the required technical expertise to provide these additional MRO services.\n• Increasing market share — continuing aggressive marketing efforts to win new customers as well as to expand activities with existing customers, partly by focusing on cross selling opportunities\nbetween our different businesses. As part of our efforts, we also intend to expand our marketing presence in existing territories, like the United States and Western Europe as well as new territories, where\nTAT currently has a smaller presence and fewer customers, such as Eastern Europe, Latin America and Asia.\n• Effective synergy among group members — enhancing the synergies between our various businesses. For example, by supplying Limco with heat transfer components manufactured in Gedera, we enable\nLimco to offer a superior product and more competitive pricing on its MRO services, thereby improving Limco's overall competitive position in the market.\n• Organic growth and M&A — in addition to growing our existing businesses organically as detailed above, we intend to evaluate complementary acquisition opportunities.\nProducts and Services\nOEM of Heat Transfer Solutions and Aviation Accessories\nTAT Israel manufactures a wide range of heat transfer solutions used on board aircraft, air conditioning systems, environmental control systems and cooling systems for electronics for military use. These\nsolutions are manufactured in compliance with all of the stringent quality assurance standards that apply to the manufacture of aircraft parts. TAT Israel's quality system complies with ISO 9001, AS9100, Boeing\nquality systems approval D6-82479 and FAR 21.303 (the FAA standard for Parts Manufacturer Approval) and NADCAP for non-destructive testing and welding.\nHeat Transfer Solutions\nTAT Israel specializes in the design and manufacture of highly efficient, compact and reliable heat transfer solutions that are designed to meet stringent constraints such as size, weight and environmental\nconditions. Heat transfer solutions, such as heat exchangers and cold plates, are integral components of a wide variety of environmental control, mechanical and engine systems, as well as a wide range of\nelectronic systems. These systems generate heat during operation that must be removed and dissipated. Heat transfer solutions facilitate the exchange of heat created through the operation of these systems by\ntransmitting the heat from a hot medium (air, oil or other fluids) to a cold medium for disposal.\n20\nIn the aerospace industry, there is a constant need for improvements in performance, weight, cost and reliability. In addition, as electronic systems become smaller and more densely packed, the need for\nsophisticated and efficient heat transfer components used to provide the cooling functions becomes more critical. Using TAT Israel's technological expertise, TAT believes it is well positioned to respond to these\nindustry demands through continued new product development and product improvements.\nTAT Israel's principal heat transfer solutions include heat exchangers and cold plates. Typically, air-to-air heat exchangers cool a jet engine’s bleed air which, when cooled, is then used in the aircraft’s air\nconditioning, pressurization and pneumatic systems. The liquid-to-air heat exchangers cool liquids such as engine oil, hydraulic oil and others used in other systems.\nTAT Israel provides a one-stop-shop for all types of heat transfer solutions. TAT Israel's heat exchangers are generally priced between approximately $2,000 and $45,000 per unit. A significant portion of\nTAT Israel's heat transfer solutions is sold to customers in connection with the original manufacture or retrofitting of particular aircraft equipment. TAT Israel generally enters into long-term supply contracts with\nits customers, which require TAT Israel to supply heat transfer products as part of a larger project.\nTAT Israel also manufactures other heat transfer solutions, such as cooling chassis, heat sinks and cold plates (which may be air-to-air, liquid-to-air or liquid-to-liquid), to control and dispose heat emitted\nby the operation of various electronic systems. Such products are currently utilized mainly in radar systems, avionics, electronic warfare systems and various pods for targeting, navigation and night vision.\nAs a result of the specialized nature of the systems in which TAT Israel's parts are included, spare and replacement parts for the original heat transfer solutions are also usually provided by TAT Israel.\nDuring 2021, as part of a strategic plan by TAT’s management, TAT started transferring the heat exchangers activity from its Gedera facility to Limco in the US. The transfer was accomplished according\nto TAT’s management strategic plan in 2022. Such transfer is expected to create a unified independent MRO\\OEM center for heat exchangers, and as part of such transfer TAT will build its strategic R&D center\nfor heat exchangers in the US.\nAviation Flow Control Accessories\nTAT Israel is also engaged in the design, development, manufacture and MRO services for aviation flow control accessories. These accessories include components such as valves and pumps.\nCooling and Air Conditioning Systems\nTAT Israel is also engaged in the design, development and manufacture of complete environmental control systems and cooling systems. This product line includes ground cooling systems mainly for\nmilitary applications such as mobile command and control units, command and control vehicles, armored vehicles, mobile broadcast units, mobile hospitals, etc. In addition, TAT Israel designs, develops and\nmanufactures power electronics cooling systems based on customer specifications, while providing a complete engineering solution in compliance with strict civil aviation standards. TAT Israel's systems are used\nglobally and are tested under strict standards.\n21\nMRO Services for Heat Transfer Components and OEM of Heat Transfer Solutions\nMRO Services for Heat Transfer Components\nThrough its Limco subsidiary in the U.S., TAT provides MRO services for heat transfer components. The demand for MRO services is driven by the size and age of the aircraft fleet (including new\naircrafts entering into service), aircraft utilization and regulations set OR promulgated by the FAA and other governmental authorities.\nDue to the increased maintenance costs of their aging fleets many carriers are seeking ways to reduce costs, minimize down-time, increase aircraft reliability and extend time between overhauls. One way\nto accomplish this goal is through the outsourcing of more of their maintenance and support functions to reliable third parties. Furthermore, we believe that commercial carriers making the decision to outsource\ntheir MRO requirements are searching for MRO service providers with a wide-range of service capabilities. Such MRO service providers allow the carriers to concentrate their outsourcing of MRO services to a\nselect group of third-party providers. The global military aircraft fleet also presents similar opportunities for MRO service providers. We believe that an aging military fleet and the increased use of upgrade\nprograms aimed at extending the useful life of military aircraft will provide continued MRO growth opportunities.\nLimco specializes in the repair and overhaul of heat transfer components. These components include heat exchangers, oil coolers, pre-coolers, reheaters, condensers, water separators, fuel heaters,\nevaporators and ozone converters.\nLimco is continually expanding its MRO capabilities based on market need and/or customer request. Limco’s capabilities include heat transfer components used in aircraft and systems manufactured by\nAirbus, Boeing, Bombardier, Cessna, Embraer, Lockheed Martin, Fokker, Liebherr-Aerospace, Collins Aerospace, Honeywell Aerospace and others.\nAs part of the TAT's strategic plan announced in March 2021, the Company will enhance Limco's Heat exchange cores manufacturing capabilities by, among other things, strengthening Limco’s\nemployees’ engineering knowledge, recruitment and training of employees and investment in new machines and infrastructures.\nLimco performs MRO services at its repair station in Tulsa, Oklahoma which has ISO9001, AS9110 and AS9100 certification, NADCAP certification for dye penetrant testing, welding and heat treating,\nand is licensed to provide MRO services by the FAA and EASA, as well as by the civil aviation Administrations of Thailand, Indonesia and China.\nLimco offers different or various MRO services for heat transfer components. If the damage is significant, Limco will remanufacture the unit, which generally entails replacing the core matrix of the\ndamaged or old heat transfer component in lieu of replacing the entire unit with a new one. Limco designs and develops these customized remanufactured units as a cost-effective alternative to new part\nreplacement. In the event of less severe damage, Limco will either overhaul or repair the unit as necessary. Re-manufactured units carry warranties which are often equal or better than those provided to new units.\nOEM Authorizations and Licenses\nLimco believes that establishing and maintaining relationships with OEMs of aircraft systems and components is an important factor in achieving sustainable success as an independent MRO service\nprovider. OEMs grant independent MRO service providers authorization to perform repair and overhaul services on their behalf. OEMs generally grant very few authorizations and maintain tight controls over\ntheir authorized MRO service providers in order to maintain high quality of service to their customers. Obtaining OEM authorization requires sophisticated technological capabilities, experience-based industry\nknowledge and substantial capital investment. Furthermore, Limco believes that service providers that have OEM authorization gain a competitive advantage as they typically receive discounts on parts, technical\ninformation and OEM warranty support. Limco is an independent MRO service provider that is a well-recognized repair center of Collins Aerospace (Hamilton Sundstrand), one of the largest heat transfer\nsolutions manufacturers in North America or in the United States.\nOEM of Heat Transfer Solutions\nIn addition to its MRO services, Limco also acts as an OEM manufacturer of heat transfer solutions used mainly in military aircraft and other ground applications and to a lesser extent, in commercial,\nregional and business aircraft. Limco specializes in the design and manufacture of highly efficient heat transfer solutions, which are designed to meet stringent constraints such as size, weight and applicable\nenvironmental conditions. These units include heat exchangers, oil coolers, precoolers, reheaters, condensers, fuel heaters and evaporators.\nLimco also manufactures demineralizer systems for U.S. Navy vessels, including ships and nuclear submarines. Limco currently offers tens of OEM parts to the aerospace and ground defense industries.\nThese parts are manufactured in compliance with the stringent quality assurance standards that apply to the manufacture of aircraft and military parts.\nLimco’s quality systems are ISO9001, AS9110, AS9100 and NADCAP for non-destructive testing, welding and heat treating and FAR 21.303 (the FAA standard for Parts Manufacturer Approval).\n22\nMRO Services for Aviation Components\nThrough its Piedmont subsidiary, TAT provides MRO services for aviation components, including APUs and landing gear. As previously mentioned, the demand for MRO services is driven by the size\nand age of the aircraft fleet, aircraft utilization and regulations by the FAA and other governmental authorities.\nDue to increased maintenance costs of their aging fleets many carriers are seeking ways to reduce costs, minimize down-time, increase aircraft reliability and extend time between overhauls. One way to\naccomplish this goal is through the outsourcing of more of their maintenance and support functions to reliable third parties. Furthermore, we also believe that commercial carriers making the decision to outsource\ntheir MRO requirements are searching for MRO service providers that offer a wide-range of service capabilities. These MRO service providers allow the carriers to concentrate their outsourcing of MRO services\nto a select group of third-party providers. The global military aircraft fleet also presents similar opportunities for MRO service providers. We believe that an aging military fleet and the increased use of upgrade\nprograms aimed at extending the useful life of aircrafts will provide continued MRO growth opportunities.\nPiedmont specializes in the repair and overhaul of APUs and landing gears. APUs are relatively small, self-contained generators used to start jet engines, usually with compressed air, and to provide\nelectricity, hydraulic pressure and air conditioning while an aircraft is on the ground. In many aircraft, an APU can also provide electrical power during in-flight emergency situations. Landing gears are the\nstructure that support an aircraft on the ground and allow it to taxi, takeoff and land.\nPiedmont performs MRO services at its repair station in Greensboro, North Carolina, which is licensed by the FAA and EASA. Piedmont specializes in providing comprehensive repair and overhaul\nservices for APU models manufactured by both Honeywell and Hamilton Sundstrand, two leading OEMs in the United States. In addition, Piedmont provides full repair, overhaul, machining, plating and grinding\nservices for landing gear systems for commercial and military aircraft. Piedmont has a long history in providing landing gear MRO services for regional airliners, including aircraft manufactured by Bombardier\n(CRJ 100/200/Dash8), the French-Italian ATR (42/72), Gulfstream (G4), Lockheed Martin (P3/C130) and the Brazilian Embraer (E170/E190). During 2020 Piedmont stopped providing services to the CRJ\nplatform. At the end of 2020 Piedmont signed a new exclusive contract with Honeywell as Honeywell's exclusive rental bank provider for the APU 331-500 (used in the Boeing 777 platform). By signing this\nagreement with Honeywell and purchasing 18 APU331-500 engines Piedmont entered a new segment of APU leasing. Piedmont also signed a contract to be an authorized repair station for the 331-500 APU\n(serving the Boeing 777 platform) as well as the APU 131 serving the Boeing 737 platform and Airbus 319-320-321 platform.\nOEM Authorizations and Licenses\nPiedmont believes that establishing and maintaining relationships with OEMs of aircraft systems and components is an important factor in achieving sustainable success as an independent MRO service\nprovider. OEMs grant independent MRO service providers authorizations or licenses to perform repair and overhaul services on the equipment they manufacture. OEMs generally grant few authorizations or\nlicenses and maintain tight controls over their authorized and licensed MRO service providers, in order to maintain high quality of service to their customers. Obtaining OEM authorizations requires sophisticated\ntechnological capabilities, experience-based industry knowledge and substantial capital investment. Piedmont believes that service providers that have OEM authorizations and licenses gain a competitive\nadvantage as they typically receive discounts on parts, technical information, OEM warranty support and use of the OEM name in marketing. Piedmont is an authorized repair station licensed by Honeywell, the\nlargest manufacturer of APUs, for several of its APU models.\nMachining, Plating and Grinding, or MPG Services\nPiedmont has extended its services to include the provision of MPG services, either as supplementary to its traditional MRO services or as stand-alone services. We believe that establishing and\nmaintaining customer relationships with our MPG shop is an important factor in achieving sustainable success as an independent MRO service provider and creates a competitive advantage.\n23\nOverhaul and Coating of Jet Engine Components\nThrough its subsidiary, Turbochrome, TAT provides MRO services for jet engine components to the aerospace industry. Turbochrome’s FAA- and EASA-certified repair station provides its services\nmainly to maintenance service centers, airlines and the military. Turbochrome specializes in MRO services for engine components such as turbine vanes and blades, compressor vanes and blades, fan blades and\nafter burner flaps. Generally, manufacturer specifications, government regulations and military maintenance regimens require that engine components undergo MRO servicing at regular intervals or as necessary.\nCommercial engine components typically require MRO services after three to five years of service or sooner if required. Engine manufacturers typically provide warranties on new engines and their components\nand subsystems, which may range from one to five years depending on the bargaining power of the purchaser. Engine manufacturers may also offer extended warranty agreements for 10 to 15 years for the\nengines. Warranty claims are generally the responsibility of the OEM during the warranty period. Turbochrome’s business opportunity usually begins upon the conclusion of the warranty period for these\ncomponents. Turbochrome offers its customers DER (Designated Engineering Representatives) and DOA (Design Organization Approval) repairs approved by the FAA and EASA.

These products are manufactured in compliance with all of the stringent\nquality assurance standards that apply to the maintenance of aircraft engine components.\nCustomers\nGeneral\nTAT targets a broad range of customers within the commercial and military aerospace and ground defense industries. Our customers include commercial manufacturers of military equipment, commercial\nairlines, aircraft manufacturers, military forces, the defense industry, and other manufacturers of electronic systems, aviation units and machinery in the United States, Europe, CIS, Asia, Latin America and Israel.\nDuring 2022, TAT had revenues generated by more than 500 customers worldwide.\nMajor Customers\nOEM Customers\nTAT, primarily through TAT Israel, sells its OEM solutions and systems to commercial and military aircraft manufacturers and defense contractors and to the U.S. and Israeli governments.\nPartial lists of OEM customers are set in the following table:\nAircraft manufacturers Boeing, Textron, Pilatus, Embraer, Lockheed Martin, Honda Aircraft, Cirrus, Gulfstream.\nSystem manufacturers/integrators and defense contractors Liebherr, Thales, Rafael, Elbit, IAI, Parker, Lockheed Martin, Eaton Aerospace, Safran.\nThe development projects and purchasing processes of many of TAT’s OEM customers are lengthy and complex and accordingly, with some customers, TAT enters into frame agreements that determine\ncertain legal conditions, but under which the customer is not obligated to purchase any quantity of products. Typically, customers issue purchase orders with the required supply quantity, price, lead times and other\nrelated terms.\n24\nMRO Customers\nTAT services MRO customers primarily through Limco, Piedmont and Turbochrome, including major U.S. domestic and international airlines, air cargo carriers, maintenance service centers, the U.S.\nArmed Forces and other air forces from around the world.\nTAT’s partial list of MRO customers is set forth in the following table:\nU.S. Domestic and international airlines and air cargo carriers Air France-KLM, Lufthansa, FedEx, UPS, American Airlines, Delta Airlines, United, Air Canada Jazz,\nRepublic Airways, DHL, Austrian Airlines, TAM, Thai, Korean Air, Air India, Swiftair, Allegiant Air,\nEmpire Airlines, Mountain Air Cargo, Alliance Airlines, CAM – Cargo Aircraft Management, ASL\nairlines, Virgin Australia.\nMaintenance service centers Fokker, Honeywell International, Kellstrom Commercial, Aero Kool, Lufthansa Technik, RTX through\nCollins, SR Technics, Embraer, Evergreen Aviation Component Services, Turkish Technic, Delta Tech\nOps, ST Aerospace Engineering, , Gulfstream, IAI, Haeco Americas , Air New-Zeeland.\nGovernments and military air forces U.S. Army, U.S. Air Force and U.S. Navy; Israeli Ministry of Defense, IAF; Belgium Air Force, Polish\nAir Force, Portuguese Air Force, Japan Air Force.\nMilitary Contracts\nDirect sales to the U.S. government, our largest government customer, accounted for approximately 5.2% of TAT’s revenues for the year ended December 31, 2022, approximately 5.6% of our revenues\nfor the year ended December 31, 2021 and approximately 6.1% of our revenues for the year ended December 31, 2020.\nMany of TAT’s military contracts are awarded on a competitive basis based on technical merit, personnel qualifications, experience and price. TAT also receives some contract awards involving special\ntechnical capabilities on a negotiated, noncompetitive basis due to TAT’s technical capabilities.\nTAT provides products under government contracts that usually require performance over a period of several months to several years. Long-term contracts for the U.S. military may be conditioned upon\ncontinued availability of congressional appropriations. Variances between anticipated budget and congressional appropriations may result in a delay, modification of scope or termination of these contracts.\nThe vast majority of the governmental contracts to which TAT is party to are fixed-price contracts, some of which contain fixed-price escalation mechanism. Under these contracts, TAT agrees to perform\nspecific work for a fixed price and, accordingly, realizes the benefit or detriment to the extent that the actual cost of performing the work differs from the contract price. The allowable government contract costs\nand fees of TAT are subject to audit and may result in non-reimbursement of some contract costs and fees. While governments reserve the right to conduct further audits, audits conducted for periods through fiscal\nyear 2021 and 2022 have resulted in no material cost recovery disallowances for TAT.\nTAT’s eligibility to perform under its government contracts requires us to maintain adequate security measures. TAT has implemented security procedures that it believes adequately satisfies the\nrequirements of its current government contracts.\nBacklog and Long-Term Agreements\nOur backlog includes the following: (i) actual purchase orders, and (ii) the maximum estimated sales we expect to generate from long-term agreements for which we do not have actual purchase orders. It\nshould be noted that under these long-term agreements there is no legal obligation from the customer to purchase our products or services, yet typically our customers would not sign such an agreement unless\nthere is a specific business opportunity. As such, backlog information may not necessarily be indicative of future sales.\nAs of December 31, 2022, our backlog included: (i) outstanding purchase orders representing an aggregate amount of $62.4 million, and (ii) sales that we expect to generate from long-term agreements (the longest\nof which is until 2033) for which we have not yet received actual purchase orders in an aggregate amount of $341 million.\nProduct and Service Warranties\nTAT provides warranties for its products and services ranging from one to three years, depending on the nature of the specific product. To date, TAT’s warranty costs have not been substantial. As of\nDecember 31, 2022, the combined warranty reserve for TAT was $0.2 million.\n25\nCompetitive Environment\nOEM of Heat Transfer Solutions and Aviation Accessories\nThe aerospace and defense OEM industries in general and specifically, the commercial and military aviation markets, are characterized by intense competition and the need to constantly be in the forefront\nof technological innovations in order to be able to offer technologically-advanced and attractive products. Competition in these OEM markets is also based on price, quality and on time delivery. TAT estimates the\nmarket size of heat transfer solutions to be significant based on the scope of development projects and purchasing processes of the potential customers. TAT estimates that there is a small number of competing\nsuppliers in the aerospace and defense OEM markets due to the high barriers to entry to these markets, which include the need for highly qualified and trained personnel, technologically advanced facilities and the\nneed to obtain appropriate governmental approvals. The nature of the projects in the commercial and military aviation OEM industry, which are often time consuming and complex, also require long-term supplier\nrelationships and customer loyalty in order to succeed.\nTAT’s competitors in the global OEM aerospace and defense industries can be divided into two main groups:\n• Complete system manufacturers that either independently or through subcontractors, design, develop and manufacture complete systems (such as a manufacturer of aircraft hydraulic systems) directly\nfor the platform manufacturer (i.e., for business jets). These companies will typically compete on bids for complete systems and/or projects where the components/products TAT develops are part of the\ncomplete system. In such cases, it is very likely that these companies will subcontract to companies such as TAT the design and manufacturing of one or a few components in the system. Although some\nof these companies have the capabilities to design and manufacture each standalone component in a complete system (i.e., a heat exchanger integrated in hydraulic systems) they usually do not compete\nwith TAT in projects where there is a specific requirement for a stand-alone component.\n• Component manufacturers, such as TAT, for which the design and manufacture of components (such as heat exchangers or other types of heat transfer solutions) is the main business (and which are\nnormally situated in the “value chain” one tier below the system manufacturers, such as a manufacturer of an aircraft’s hydraulic system and two tiers below the platform manufacturer, such as a\nmanufacturer of a new aircraft). These companies typically compete in projects where there is a specific requirement for a standalone aviation component (such as a heat exchanger or other types of heat\ntransfer solutions) and in tenders by manufacturers of complete systems or products for sub-contractors. Although some of the component manufacturers have the capabilities to design, develop and\nmanufacture a complete system (i.e., environmental control system for a business jet) for a certain platform, these companies usually do not compete on projects for complete systems in which their\nmanufactured component constitutes a small part of the complete system, mainly due to the high barriers to entry and to the difficulty to move up the “value chain” from a component supplier to a whole\nsystem manufacturer.\nThe major competitors of TAT in the area of OEM of heat transfer solutions and aviation accessories include manufacturers in the United States such as the Hughes-Treitler division of Ametek, Lytron,\nNiagara Thermal, Hamilton Sundstrand, Honeywell International and Triumph Thermal Systems; manufacturers based in Europe such as I.M.I. Marston, a subsidiary of Hamilton Sundstrand, Safran and Liebherr;\nand manufacturers based in Asia such as Sumitomo Precision Products from Japan. These competitors may enjoy competitive advantages over Gedera, such as:\n• The ability to adapt faster to changes in customer requirements and industry conditions or trends;\n• Greater access to capital;\n• Stronger relationships with customers and suppliers;\n• Greater name recognition;\n• Access to superior technology and greater marketing resources;\n• Ability to offer complete systems in addition to components; and\n• The ability to bundle heat transfer solutions and other aircraft components.\n26\nMRO Services for Heat Transfer Components\nThe market for MRO services in the field of heat transfer components is highly competitive. Competition in this market is based on price, turnaround time, quality and breadth of services. TAT’s global\ncompetitors in the field of servicing heat transfer components can be divided into two main groups:\n• Service divisions of OEMs – generally, each OEM of products in the heat transfer solutions segment has the necessary capabilities to provide MRO services for products it designs and manufactures\nthroughout its lifetime, commencing with the initial warranty period and through the after-market period. Service divisions of OEMs may also acquire capabilities to service products of other OEMs to\nfurther expand their MRO services.\n• Service centers – which often provide MRO services for a broad range of components and systems. These service centers can be either the in-house maintenance services of commercial airlines or other\nindependent service providers, such as TAT or Limco.\nFor heat transfer MRO services, TAT’s major competitors are Triumph Thermal Systems, Lori Heat Transfer Center of Honeywell, Drake Air – Ametek, Liebherr-Aerospace, American Cooler Service, Hamilton\nMalaysia, Lufthansa Technik, Meggitt (Elite) and others.\nAs an independent MRO service provider, Limco’s competitors have inherent competitive advantages. For example, Limco competes with the service divisions of large OEMs which in some cases have\ndesign authority with respect to their OEM solutions and are able to derive significant pricing advantages from their OEM manufacturing activities. Limco also competes with the in-house service divisions of\nlarge commercial airlines where there is a strong incentive for an airline to fully utilize the services of its maintenance employees and facilities. Further, Limco’s competitors may have additional competitive\nadvantages, such as:\n• Ability to bundle heat transfer and other aircraft components;\n• Access to greater marketing resources;\n• Access to superior technology; and\n• Greater resources which allow for better turnaround time.\nMRO Services for Aviation Components\nThe market for MRO services in which Piedmont operates is highly competitive. Competition in this market is based on quality, price, turnaround time and breadth of services. Piedmont’s primary MRO\nservices competitors are the service divisions of OEMs, the in-house maintenance services of various commercial airlines and other independent service providers, such as TAT or Piedmont. For APU and landing\ngear MRO services Piedmont’s major competitors are Standard Aero Group., Aerotech International, Honeywell International, Chase Aerospace, Professional Aviation, Messier-Dowty Aerospace (MD), AAR,\nHawker Pacific, APRO and others.\nA number of Piedmont’s competitors have inherent competitive advantages. For example, Piedmont competes with the service divisions of large OEMs which in some cases have design authority with\nrespect to their OEM products and are able to derive significant brand recognition from their OEM manufacturing activities. Piedmont also competes with the in-house service divisions of large commercial\nairlines where there is a strong incentive for an airline to fully utilize the services of its maintenance employees and facilities. Further, Piedmont’s competitors may have additional competitive advantages, such as:\n• Better name recognition;\n• Ability to bundle aviation and other aircraft components;\n• Stronger relationships with customers and suppliers;\n• Lower cost structure;\n• Regional support near customers’ location;\n• Access to greater marketing resources;\n• Access to superior technology\n• Greater access to capital; and\n• Greater resources which allow for better turnaround time.\n27\nOverhaul and Coating of Jet Engine Components\nThe market for MRO services in which Turbochrome operates is highly competitive. Competition in this market is based on quality, price, level of service and turnaround time. Turbochrome’s primary\nMRO services competitors are the service divisions of OEMs, the in-house maintenance services of various commercial airlines and other independent service providers, including Safran (Snecma), General\nElectric, GKN, PAS, Chromalloy Southwest, MCT Japan and others. With respect to coating and masking materials, Turbochrome's competitor is APV Coatings.\nA number of Turbochrome’s competitors have inherent competitive advantages. For example, Turbochrome competes with the service divisions of large OEMs which may have design authority with\nrespect to their OEM products and are able to derive significant brand recognition from their OEM manufacturing activities. Turbochrome also competes with the in-house service divisions of large commercial\nairlines and there is a strong incentive for an airline to fully utilize the services of its maintenance employees and facilities. Further, Turbochrome’s competitors may have additional competitive advantages, such\nas:\n• The ability to adapt faster to changes in customer requirements and industry conditions or trends;\n• Better name recognition;\n• Ability to bundle jet engine and other aircraft components;\n• Stronger relationships with customers, OEMs and suppliers;\n• Lower cost structure;\n• Regional support near customers’ location;\n• Access to greater marketing resources;\n• Access to superior technology;\n• Greater access to capital; and\n• Greater resources which allow for better turnaround time\nCompetitive Strengths\nWe believe that TAT’s success can be attributed to several critical factors, including the following:\n• Engaging in active efforts to preserve its customer base in existing projects, while working to broaden and increase its involvement with such clients.\n• Conducting marketing activities aimed at penetrating new geographical markets and winning new customers, while taking advantage of the unique knowledge and expertise that TAT and its\nsubsidiaries have gained in various areas.\n• Entering into additional related operating segments that will enable TAT and its subsidiaries to fulfill their growth potential.\n• Providing customers with the best value, including competitive prices, by tailoring comprehensive service packages that combine the design and planning of an OEM component, the manufacture of\nsuch component, and the provision of maintenance services.\n• Extending MRO capabilities in order to establish a ‘one-stop-shop’ center for comprehensive MRO services for the types of aircraft Limco and/or Piedmont and/or Turbochrome target.\n• Enhancing our engineering capabilities in order to support customer needs related to new projects and in order to certify MRO services that differ from processes previously approved by the FAA,\nEASA or other regulatory authorities. This allows shortening the long and complex approval process, streamlining the design and certification process and reducing costs.\n• Leveraging operational efficiencies to achieve shorter delivery times and reduce costs.\n• Investing in new technologies and manufacturing techniques in the heat transfer solutions product line.\n• Investing in innovations and improvements aimed at enhancing the quality and performance of our existing solutions and services as well as the development of new products in an effort to strengthen\nour market position and enter into more advanced platforms.\n28\nEngineering\nWe believe that our engineering capabilities is a strategic core competency and key competitive advantage, which allows us to effectively compete in the market with companies which, in many cases,\nhave better name recognition and greater resources than we do. Our strong engineering capabilities enable us to meet our customers’ increasingly complex demands to deliver high-quality and cost-effective\nsolutions while maintaining efficient development cycles. These capabilities are based on proprietary technological expertise and know-how developed by highly-experienced multi-disciplinary teams over the\nyears. We believe that this proprietary knowledge coupled with our innovative and problem-solving approach allows us to provide our customers with an overall superior solution – in both manufacturing and\nMRO services – in terms of quality, cost and turnaround time. Our strong engineering capabilities are a key factor in preserving customer loyalty as well as supporting our efforts to expand our services to new\nareas of growth.\nTAT Israel's engineering staff has extensive knowledge and experience in designing heat transfer solutions. In general, TAT Israel has manufacturing capabilities for most heat transfer solutions. TAT\nIsrael manufactures the necessary tools, fixtures, test equipment and special jigs which are required to manufacture, assemble and test these products. TAT Israel developed proprietary design and analysis\ntechniques which assist in the mechanical and thermal design of its products. All of TAT Israel's products are inspected and tested by trained inspectors using highly sophisticated test equipment in accordance with\nits customer requirements.\nLimco’s engineering department enhances its ability to provide its customers with high-end top-quality MRO services, supports the development of MRO services for new products with commercial\npotential and supports its OEM activity. Limco’s engineering department employs certified mechanical and aerospace engineers. Limco’s multi-disciplinary team of engineers specializes in, among others, heat\ntransfer solutions and components and supports all processes of thermal and structural analysis, mechanical and metallurgical research and development for manufacturing design. Limco’s engineers have direct\nexperience with aerospace component repair and with obtaining supplemental type certificates from the FAA. Limco’s engineering department supports the development of new repairs capabilities that extend\nbeyond the limits of the component maintenance manual and utilizes DER to obtain the necessary FAA approvals.\nPiedmont’s engineering department employs experienced mechanical and aerospace engineers with repair station and manufacturing experience in both engineering and quality. Piedmont also has an\nFAA-certified DER on staff with delegations in Power plant (APUs) & Mechanical Systems and with special delegation to manage and approve repair specifications. In addition to developing quality major\nrepairs, Piedmont’s engineers have experience in obtaining supplemental type certificates and parts manufacturer approvals while working directly with the FAA Aircraft Certification Office.\nTurbochrome’s engineering department enhances its ability to provide its customers with high-end top-quality MRO services. Turbochrome’s engineering department employs several certified mechanical\nand metallurgical engineers. Turbochrome’s multi-disciplinary team of engineers specializes in, among other things, turbine components and supports all processes of thermal and structural analysis and\nmechanical and metallurgical research and development. Turbochrome’s engineers have substantial experience with aerospace component repair and with obtaining DER and DOA certificates from the FAA and\nEASA.\nResearch and Development\nThe technological developments in TAT’s markets drive the need to constantly examine the use of new materials and technologies in an effort to improve both the physical characteristics of the products\n(size, weight), as well as their performance (optimal heat transfer, higher reliability and increased lifespan). TAT also develops new products and enhanced functionalities for its existing products based on\ncustomer demands and in response to the competitive environment and market potential. TAT invests resources to attain such technological and product improvements in cooperation with its customers.\n29\nSource and Availability of Raw Materials and Spare Parts\nTAT and its subsidiaries acquire most of the components for the manufacture of their products and provision of their services from a limited number of suppliers and subcontractors, the majority located in\nIsrael and the United States. Some of these suppliers are currently the sole source of one or more components upon which TAT and its subsidiaries are dependent. Since many of TAT's and its subsidiaries’\npurchases require long lead times, a delay in the supply of an item can significantly delay the delivery of a product. Generally, TAT and its subsidiaries have not experienced significant difficulty in obtaining\ntimely deliveries of necessary components; however, if they are unable to obtain these components when needed, they would experience delays in manufacturing their products and their financial results could be\nadversely affected.\nThe raw materials used in manufacturing programs are generally readily available metals and alloys. TAT and its subsidiaries have not had any significant difficulty in obtaining such materials in the past.\nTAT and its subsidiaries select their suppliers primarily based on their ability to ensure that their parts are serviceable and traceable to OEM-approved sources, their delivery performance and their ability\nto help reduce the total cost of procuring those parts. For quality control, cost and efficiency reasons, TAT and its subsidiaries generally purchase supplies only from vendors with who they have ongoing\nrelationships or who their customers have previously approved.\nAuthorizations from OEMs often require that TAT purchase component parts that are needed for its MRO services from the OEM or its designated distributors.\nWherever possible, TAT and its subsidiaries have made and continue to make an effort to qualify second sources or have identified alternate sources for many of their parts needs.\nIsraeli Export Policy\nExports of military related products are subject to the military export policy of the State of Israel. Currently the Israeli government encourages exports to approved customers, provided that such exports\ndo not run counter to Israeli policy or national security considerations. TAT Israel must obtain a permit prior to initiating a sales proposal and ultimately an export license for the transaction is required. Israeli law\nalso regulates the export of “dual use” items (items that are typically sold for civilian uses or purposes but that may also have military purposes).\nWhile we have been successful in obtaining export permits in the past, we may not be able to obtain the necessary export permits or licenses in the future. In addition, governmental policy with respect to\nmilitary exports (or dual use items) may be altered.\n30\nU.S. Export Regulations\nExport of defense products, military technical data and technical services by our U.S. subsidiaries to Israel and other countries is subject to applicable approvals by the U.S. government under the U.S.\nInternational Traffic in Arms Regulations (“ITAR”). Such approvals are typically in the form of an export license or a technical assistance agreement (“TAA”). Other U.S. companies wishing to export defense\nproducts or military-related services and technology to our Israeli and other non-U.S. entities are also required to obtain such export licenses and TAAs. An application for an export license or a TAA requires\ndisclosure of the intended end user and the use of the technology. Pursuant to recent export control reform initiatives in the United States, a greater part of our U.S. subsidiaries’ and our U.S. suppliers' activities are\nbecoming subject to control under the Export Administration Act \"dual use\" regulations. The U.S. government may deny an export authorization if it determines that a transaction is counter to U.S. policy or\nnational security.\nProprietary Rights\nAt the present time, TAT and its subsidiaries do not own any patents. TAT and its subsidiaries rely on laws protecting trade secrets, and consider such items proprietary; however, we believe that our\nsuccess depends less on the ownership of such proprietary rights than on our innovative skills, technical competences, marketing and engineering abilities. TAT and its subsidiaries have no material registered\ntrademarks.\nB. Government Regulations\nAerospace and Safety Regulations\nThe commercial aerospace industry is highly regulated by the FAA in the United States, EASA in Europe, and other governmental authorities elsewhere in the world, while the military aerospace industry\nis governed by military quality specifications established by the U.S. Department of Defense for the manufacturing and repair industries and ISO-9000. TAT is required to be certified by one or more of these\nentities and, in some cases, by individual OEMs. TAT must also satisfy the requirements of its customers, including OEMs and airlines that are subject to FAA regulations and to evolving industry standards, and\nprovide these customers with products that comply with the government regulations applicable to commercial flight operations. TAT believes it currently satisfies or exceeds these FAA maintenance standards in\nits repair and overhaul activities. Our active or operating repair stations in Israel and the United States are approved by the FAA (while TAT-Engineering, our joint venture in Russia, is currently pursuing such\ncertification or is currently in process of pursuing such certification). TAT also believes it currently satisfies all industry standards in its facilities.\nTAT’s operations are also subject to a variety of worker and community safety laws including the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970, known as OSHA, which mandates general requirements for\nsafe workplaces for all U.S. employees. In addition, OSHA provides special procedures and measures for the handling of certain hazardous and toxic substances. TAT believes that its operations are in compliance\nwith OSHA’s requirements.\nTAT believes that it is in material compliance with U.S., European and other governmental regulations affecting the aerospace and defense industries.\nIsraeli Regulations\nTAT’s operations in Israel are subject to supervision by the Israeli Ministry of Defense and Civil Aviation Administration of Israel. TAT Israel is certified by the IAF and the Israeli Ministry of Defense for\nboth manufacturing and maintenance. TAT Israel is also licensed as a repair station for certain components by the Civil Aviation Administration of Israel. In addition, TAT Israel export of certain products and/or\nknow-how is subject to approval by the Defense Export Controls Agency (“DECA”) of the Israeli Ministry of Defense. DECA permits are required prior to submitting sales proposals with regard to such exports,\nas well as for the actual export of such products.\n31\nEnvironmental Matters\nTAT’s operations are subject to a number of stringent federal, state and local environmental laws in the United States and Israel, as well as to regulation set or promulgated by government agencies,\nincluding the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. Among other matters, these regulatory authorities impose requirements that regulate the emission, discharge, generation, management, transportation and\ndisposal of pollutants and hazardous substances. These authorities may require TAT to initiate actions to remediate the effects of hazardous substances which may be or have been released into the environment and\nrequire TAT to obtain and maintain permits in connection with TAT’s operations. This extensive regulatory framework imposes significant compliance burdens and risks. During the years 2020-2021, the Israeli\nWater Authority requested that TAT perform sampling of certain groundwater wells in TAT’s facility in Gedera. During March 2022 TAT has terminated its lease agreement in Gedera facility and has no further\nrequests from the water authority.\nAlthough TAT seeks to maintain its operations and facilities in compliance with applicable environmental laws, there can be no assurance that TAT has no violations, or that change in such laws,\nregulations or interpretations of such laws, will not require TAT to make significant additional expenditures to ensure compliance in the future.\nC. Property, Plants and Equipment\nDuring 2022 TAT completed the strategic plan announced in March 2021, which includes transferring TAT’s activity from the leased facility in Gedera to a facility in Tulsa, Oklahoma (see information\nregarding such facility below) and to a facility in Kiryat Gat, Israel which is leased by our wholly owned subsidiary Turbochrome. The facility in Kiryat Gat is approximately 138,000 square feet, and the land on\nwhich the facility is located is leased from the ILA. The leasehold rights are for a period ending in 2045 and are recorded in Turbochrome's name. Turbochrome paid the entire lease payments due until 2045 in a\none-time payment (discounted to present value).\nLimco owns and operates a 55,000 square feet manufacturing plant in Tulsa, Oklahoma which has historically supported all its business, including its aftermarket heat transfer component repair station.\nThis facility also has housed Limco’s administration, engineering, quality control and support services.\nLimco also leases building #2, building #3, building #4, building #5, and building #6. Building #2 lease is effective from June 1, 2017 to November 30, 2026. The lessee or lessor may terminate the lease\nby giving lessee or lessor six months advance written notice. The rent for building #2 is $4,000 per month plus the annual percentage increase in the CPI-W. Building #3 lease expired on January 31, 2014,\nhowever, the lease has renewed automatically from year to year since that date. Either party has the right to cancel the lease with 30 days’ advance notice prior to the annual expiration of the term. The rent for\nbuilding #3 is $1,505 per month plus the annual percentage increase in the CPI-W. Building #4 lease is effective from April 1, 2017 to March 31, 2029. The lessee or lessor may terminate the lease by giving the\nlessee or lessor 6 months advance written notice. The rent for building #4 is $3,200 per month plus the annual percentage increase in the CPI-W. The lease on building #5 expires on March 31, 2025. The lessee\nor lessor may terminate the lease by giving the lessee or lessor 6 months advance written notice. The rent for building #5 is $4,100 per month plus the annual percentage increase in the CPI-W. The lease on\nbuilding #6 expires on March 31, 2032. The lessee or lessor may terminate the lease by giving the lessee or lessor 6 months advance written notice. The rent for building #6 is $9,364 per month plus the annual\npercentage increase in the CPI-W.\nIn 2022, 2021 and 2020, the rental expense for this property was $271, $158 and $149 thousand, respectively, for each one of these years.\nIn the second half of 2015, Piedmont leased approximately 82,000 square feet in Greensboro, North Carolina, for its new landing gear component and overhaul repair station as well as the MPG operation.\nThe lease expires on June 30, 2025. In 2022, 2021 and 2020 the rental expense was $357 thousand, respectively, for each one of these years. In addition, Piedmont leases approximately 56,000 square feet space\nfor its facility in Kernersville, North Carolina to support its APU component and overhaul repair station. During 2018, Piedmont vacated the first floor of the facility while continuing to lease the second-floor\nspace, approximately 28,000 square feet. In 2022, 2021 and 2020, the rental expense for this property was $48 thousand for each year respectively. The lease expired on October 31, 2016 and is now extended\nuntil May 2025.\n32\nItem 4A. Unresolved Staff Comments\nNot applicable.\nItem 5. Operating and Financial Review and Prospects Operating Results\nThe following discussion of our results of operations should be read together with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes, which appear elsewhere in this annual report. The following\ndiscussion contains forward-looking statements that reflect our current plans, estimates and beliefs and involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results may differ materially from those discussed in the forward-\nlooking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include those discussed below and elsewhere in this annual report.\nOverview\nTAT is reliant on the robustness of the commercial and military aerospace and ground defense industries. Any downturn in these industries could weaken demand for its solutions and services and\nnegatively impact its financial results. The commercial airline industry is cyclical and has historically been subject to fluctuations due to general economic and political conditions, such as fuel and labor costs,\nprice competition, downturns in the global economy and national and international events.\nTAT’s cost of revenues for OEM operations and MRO services consists of component and material costs, direct labor costs, quality assurance costs, shipping expenses, royalties, overhead related to\nmanufacturing and depreciation of manufacturing equipment. TAT’s gross margin is affected by the proportion of its revenues generated from each of its operational segments.\nThe principal factors that affect the operating income of TAT’s four segments, in addition to their gross profit, is the expenditure on selling and marketing expenses and general and administrative\nexpenses. While TAT closely monitors its operating expenses to prevent unnecessary spending, we believe that these operating expenses may increase in the future in accordance with our plans to grow the\nbusiness.\nTAT’s research and development expenses are related to new products and technologies or significant improvement of existing products and technologies.\nTAT’s selling and marketing expenses are related to commission payments, compensation and related expenses of TAT’s sales teams, participation in trade shows, travel expenses, advertising expenses\nand related costs for facilities and equipment.\nTAT’s general and administrative expenses are related to compensation and related expenses for executive, finance and administrative personnel, professional fees such as legal, audit, SOX, internal audit,\ninsurance premiums and general corporate expenses and related costs for facilities and equipment.\nSources of Revenues\nTAT, directly and through its subsidiaries, provides a variety of solutions and services to the commercial and military aerospace and ground defense industries, including:\n(i) OEM of heat transfer solutions and aviation components, such as heat exchangers, pre-coolers and oil/fuel hydraulic coolers (through TAT Israel);\n(ii) MRO services for heat transfer components and OEM of heat transfer solutions (through our Limco subsidiary);\n(iii) MRO services for aviation components (through our Piedmont subsidiary); and\n(iv) Overhaul and coating of jet engine components (through our Turbochrome subsidiary).\n33\nTAT’s revenues from its four operational segments for the three years ended December 31, 2022 were as follows:\nYear Ended December 31,\n2022 2021 2020\nRevenues % of Revenues % of Revenues % of\nin Total in Total in Total\nThousands Revenues Thousands Revenues Thousands Revenues\nRevenues\nOEM of heat transfer solutions and aviation accessories 21,844 25.8% 25,977 33.3% 23,125 30.6%\nMRO services for heat transfer components and OEM of\nheat transfer solutions 24,796 29.3% 18,846 24.2% 20,640 27.4%\nMRO services for aviation components 35,879 42.4% 33,232 42.6% 31,189 41.4%\nOverhaul and coating of jet engine components 5,770 6.8% 3,834 4.9% 3,546 4.7%\nEliminations (3,733) (4.3)% (3,916) (5)% (3,141) (4.1)%\nTotal Revenues $ 84,556 100% $ 77,973 100% $ 75,359 100%\nThe following table reflects the geographic breakdown of TAT’s revenues for each of the three years ended December 31, 2022:\nYears Ended December 31,\n2022 2021 2020\nRevenues % of Revenues % of Revenues % of\nin Total in Total in Total\nThousands Revenues Thousands Revenues Thousands Revenues\nUnited States $ 56,570 66.9% $ 47,947 61.5% $ 47,095 62.5%\nIsrael 7,162 8.5% 7,745 9.9% 6,851 9.1%\nOther 20,824 24.6% 22,281 28.6% 21,413 28.4%\nTotal $ 84,556 100.0% $ 77,973 100.0% $ 75,359 100.0%\nCosts and Expenses\nCost of revenues.

Research and development expenses, net are related to new products and technologies or to a significant improvement of products and technologies, net of\ngrants and participations received.\nSelling and marketing expenses. Selling and marketing expenses consist primarily of commission payments, compensation and related expenses of TAT’s sales teams, participation in trade shows, travel\nexpenses, advertising expenses and related costs for facilities and equipment.\nGeneral and administrative expenses. General and administrative expenses consist of compensation and related expenses for executive, finance and administrative personnel, professional fees such as\nlegal, audit, SOX, internal audit, other general corporate expenses and related costs for facilities and equipment.\nOther income (expense). Other income (expense) results from capital gain on sale of property and equipment and onetime expenses.\nFinancial income (expense), net. Financial income (expense), net consists of exchange rate and interest income or expense. Interest income or expense relates to the interest received from or paid to\nbanks and changes in the rate of the NIS or other currencies against the U.S. dollar.\nTax expense (income). Tax expense consists of Israeli and U.S. federal and state taxes on the income of TAT’s business and changes in deferred tax assets or liabilities.\n34\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nTAT’s consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. These accounting principles require management to make certain estimates, judgments and assumptions based upon\ninformation available at the time that they are made, historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. These estimates, judgments and assumptions can\naffect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements, as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented. While all the accounting\npolicies impact the financial statements, certain policies may be viewed to be critical. These policies are those that are both most important to the portrayal of TAT’s financial condition and results of operations and\nrequire management’s most difficult, subjective and complex judgments and estimates. Actual results could differ from those estimates.\nIn many cases, the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by U.S. GAAP and does not require management’s judgment in its application. There are also areas in which\nmanagement’s judgment in selecting among available alternatives would not produce a materially different result. Management has reviewed these critical accounting policies and related disclosures with TAT’s\naudit committee.\nTAT’s management believes the significant accounting policies which affect management’s more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of TAT’s consolidated financial statements\nand which are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating the reported financial results include the following:\n• Inventory valuation\n• Income taxes\n• Allowance for current expected credit losses (CECL)\nInventory valuation\nInventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realizable value. Cost of raw material and parts is determined using the moving average basis. Cost of work in progress and finished products is\ncalculated based on actual costs and the capitalized production costs, mainly labor and overhead and is determined based on the average basis. TAT’s policy for valuation of inventory and commitments to purchase\ninventory, including the determination of obsolete or excess inventory, requires it to perform a detailed assessment of inventory at each balance sheet date which includes a review of, among other factors, an\nestimate of future demand for products within specific time frames, valuation of existing inventory, as well as product lifecycle and product development plans. The business environment in which TAT operates,\nthe wide range of products that TAT offers and the relatively short sales cycles TAT experiences, all contribute to the exercise of judgment relating to maintaining and writing-off of inventory levels. The estimates\nof future demand that TAT uses in the valuation of inventory are the basis for its revenue forecast, which is also consistent with its short-term manufacturing plan. Inventory reserves are also provided to cover risks\narising from slow-moving items. Inventory management remains an area of management focus as TAT balances the need to maintain strategic inventory levels to ensure competitive lead times against the risk of\ninventory obsolescence due to changing technology and customer requirements. TAT writes down obsolete or slow-moving inventory in an amount equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the net\nrealizable value based upon assumptions about future demand, market conditions and sale forecasts.\nIf actual market conditions are less favorable than TAT anticipates, additional inventory write-downs may be required.\n35\nIncome Taxes\nTAT operates within multiple tax jurisdictions and is subject to audits in these jurisdictions. These audits can involve complex issues, which may require an extended period of time to resolve. In\nmanagement’s opinion, adequate provisions for income taxes have been made for all years. Although management believes that its estimates are reasonable, no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome of\nthese issues will not be different than those reflected in its historical income tax provisions.\nTAT uses the liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on temporary differences between the financial statement and tax\nbases of assets and liabilities and net operating loss and credit carry forwards using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. The effect on deferred tax assets and\nliabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. Valuation allowances are established when it is more likely than not that some portion of the deferred tax\nassets will not be realized. To the extent that TAT’s decisions and assumptions and historical reporting are determined not to be compliant with applicable tax laws, TAT may be subject to adjustments in its\nreported income for tax purposes as well as interest and penalties.\nAccording to an acceptable interpretation that prescribes a minimum recognition threshold a tax position is required to meet before being recognized in the financial statements. The interpretation also\nprovides guidance on de-recognition of tax positions, classification on the balance sheet, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure and transition. In addition, the interpretation requires\nsignificant judgment with respect to determining what constitutes an individual tax position as well as assessing the outcome of each tax position. Changes in judgment as to recognition or measurement of tax\npositions can materially affect the estimate of the effective tax rate and consequently, affect our operating results.\nLosses generated prior to January 1, 2018 will still be subject to the 20-year carryforward limitation. Other potential impacts due to the Act include the repeal of the domestic manufacturing deduction,\nmodification of taxation of controlled foreign corporations, a base erosion anti-abuse tax, modification of interest expense limitation rules, modification of limitation on deductibility of excessive executive\ncompensation, and taxation of global intangible low-taxed income.\nAllowances for Current Expected Credit Losses\nTAT performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers’ financial condition and requires collateral as deemed necessary. Accounts receivable have been reduced by an allowance for current expected\nlosses. The Company maintains the allowance for estimated losses resulting from the inability of the Company’s customers to make required payments. In judging the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful\naccounts, TAT considers multiple factors including the aging of receivables, historical bad debt experience and the general economic environment. Management applies considerable judgment in assessing the\nrealization of receivables, including assessing the probability of collection and the current credit worthiness of each customer. If the financial condition of TAT’s customers were to deteriorate, resulting in an\nimpairment of their ability to make payments, additional allowances may be required.\nKey Indicators\nTAT’s management evaluates its performance by focusing on key performance indicators, which are revenues, sources of revenues, gross profit and operating income. These key performance indicators\nare primarily affected by the competitive landscape in which TAT operates and its ability to meet the challenges posed.\n36\nThe following table presents, for the periods indicated, information concerning TAT’s results of operations:\nYear Ended December 31\n2022 2021 2020\n(in thousands)\nRevenues\nOEM of heat transfer solutions and aviation accessories $ 21,844 25,977 23,125\nMRO services for heat transfer components and OEM of heat transfer solutions 24,796 18,846 20,640\nMRO services for aviation components 35,879 33,232 31,189\nOverhaul and coating of jet engine components 5,770 3,834 3,546\nEliminations (3,733) (3,916) (3,141)\nTotal revenues 84,556 77,973 75,359\nCost of revenues\nOEM of heat transfer solutions and aviation accessories 18,778 24,044 21,703\nMRO services for heat transfer components and OEM of heat transfer solutions 20,750 16,922 17,885\nMRO services for aviation components 28,890 26,444 26,961\nOverhaul and coating of jet engine components 3,495 2,978 3,312\nEliminations (3,285) (3,685) (2,937)\nTotal cost of revenues 68,628 66,703 66,924\nGross profit 15,928 11,270 8,435\nResearch and development costs, net 479 517 185\nSelling and marketing 5,629 5,147 4,369\nGeneral and administrative 9,970 8,354 7,612\nOther expenses (income) (90) (468) 315\nRestructuring expenses, net 1,715 1,755 -\nOperating income (loss) (1,775) (4,035) (4,046)\nFinancial income (expense), net 127 (540) (770)\nIncome (loss) before taxes on income (tax benefit) (1,648) (4,575) (4,816)\nTaxes on income (tax benefit) 98 (662) (1,517)\nincome (loss) before equity investment (1,746) (3,913) (3,299)\nShare in results of affiliated company and impairment of share in affiliated companies 184 (76) (185)\nNet income (loss) from continued operation $ (1,562) $ (3,989) $ (3,484)\nNet income (loss) from discontinued operation - 427 (1,845)\nNet income (loss) $ (1,562) $ (3,562) $ (5,329)\n37\nThe following table presents, for the periods indicated, information concerning TAT’s results of operations as a percentage of revenues:\nYear Ended December 31,\n2022 2021 2020\nRevenues\nOEM of heat transfer solutions and aviation components 25.8% 33.3% 30.6%\nMRO services for heat transfer components and OEM of heat transfer solutions 29.3 24.2 27.4\nMRO services for aviation components 42.4 42.6 41.4\nOverhaul and coating of jet engine components 6.8 4.9 4.7\nEliminations (4.4) (5) (4.1)\nTotal revenues 100 100 100\nCost of revenues\nOEM of heat transfer solutions and aviation components 22.2 30.8 28.8\nMRO services for heat transfer components and OEM of heat transfer solutions 24.5 21.7 23.7\nMRO services for aviation components 34.2 33.9 35.7\nOverhaul and coating of jet engine components 4.1 3.8 4.4\nEliminations (3.9) (4.7) (3.8)\nCost of revenues 81.2 85.5 88.8\nGross profit 18.8 14.5 11.2\nResearch and development costs, net 0.6 0.7 0.2\nSelling and marketing 6.7 6.6 5.9\nGeneral and administrative 11.8 10.7 10.1\nOther expenses (income) (0.1) (0.6) 0.4\nRestructuring expenses, net 2 2.2\n21 19.6 16.6\nOperating income (loss) (2.1) (5.1) (5.4)\nFinancial income (expense), net 0.2 (0.7) (1)\nIncome (loss) before taxes on income (tax benefit) (1.9) (5.8) (6.4)\nTaxes on income (tax benefit) 0.1 (0.8) (2)\nincome (loss) before equity investment (2.1) (5) (4.4)\nShare in results of affiliated company and impairment of share in affiliated companies 0.2 (0.1) (0.2)\nNet income (loss) from continued operation (1.8) (5.1) (4.6)\nNet income (loss) from discontinued operation - 0.5 (2.5)\nNet income (loss) (1.8)% (4.6)% (7.1)%\n________________________\n* Less than 0.1 percent\n38\nYear ended December 31, 2022 compared with Year ended December 31, 2021\nIn 2022 the effects of COVID-19 pandemic have moderated, and demand for TAT’s products and services improved compared to the severe impacts of the pandemic on the company's results of operations\nin 2021 and 2020.\nRevenues. Total revenues were $84.5 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2022, compared to $77.9 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2021, an increase of 8.4%. This\nreflects (i) the decrease in revenues in the OEM of heat transfer solutions and aviation accessories segment; (ii) the increase in revenues in the MRO services for heat transfer components and OEM of heat transfer\nsolutions segment; (iii) the increase in revenues in the MRO services for aviation components segment; and (iv) the increase in revenue in the overhaul and coating of jet engine components segment.\nRevenues from OEM of heat transfer solutions and aviation components. Revenues from this operating segment decreased to $21.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, from $25.9 million for\nthe year ended December 31, 2021, a decrease of 15.8%.\nRevenues from MRO services for heat transfer components and OEM of heat transfer solutions. Revenues from the MRO services for heat transfer components and OEM of heat transfer solutions\noperating segment increased to $24.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, from $18.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, an increase of 31.9%.\nRevenues from MRO services for aviation components. Revenues from MRO services for aviation components operating segment increased to $35.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, from\n$33.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, an increase of 8.1%.\nRevenues from overhaul and coating of jet engine components. Revenues from overhaul and coating of jet engine components segment increased to $5.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2022,\nfrom $3.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 an increase of 53%.\nCost of revenues. Cost of revenues was $68.6 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2022, compared to $66.7 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2021, an increase of 2.8%.\nCost of revenues as a percentage of revenues decreased to 81.2% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2022, from 85.5% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2021. The decrease is primarily\ndue to the increase in prices for the company's products and services, the reduction in fixed costs as a result of the restructuring plan led by the company's management, and the U.S. Employee Retention Credit\n(“ERC”) of $1.2 million.\nCost of revenues for OEM of heat transfer solutions and aviation accessories. Cost of revenues for this operating segment was $18.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to $24\nmillion for the year ended December 31, 2021, a decrease of 21.7%.\nCost of revenues as a percentage of revenues in this segment decreased to 86% in the year ended December 31, 2022, from 92.5% for the year ended December 31, 2021. The decrease is primarily due to\nreduction in expenses derived from the company's restructuring plan (including a reduction in labor cost due lower headcount following the implementation of the restructuring plan, and savings on lease\npayments after the transfer of operations from the Gedera facility to Kiryat Gat.\nCost of revenues for MRO services for heat transfer components and OEM of heat transfer solutions. Cost of revenues for the MRO services for heat transfer components and OEM of heat transfer\nsolutions operating segment increased to 20.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 from $16.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, an increase of 23.1%.\nCost of revenues as a percentage of revenues in this segment increased to 83.6% in the year ended December 31, 2022 from 89.8% for the year ended December 31, 2021. The increase is primarily due to\nthe transfer of heat exchange cores manufacturing capabilities to Limco in accordance with the company restructuring plan, which increase the labor cost and raw material usage as part of the learning curve in the\nnew operational production line. The increase was partially offset with government-supported employees’ retention credit grant in an amount of $0.4 million that was included in cost of sales.\nCost of revenues for MRO services for aviation components. Cost of revenues for MRO services for aviation components operating segment increased to $28.9 million for the year ended December 31,\n2022 from $26.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, an increase of 9.5%.\n39\nCost of revenues as a percentage of revenues in this segment increased to 80.5% in the year ended December 31, 2022 from 79.6% for the year ended December 31, 2021. The increase is primarily due to\ngovernment grants as PPP and ERC (employees’ retention credit) recognized in 2021 in the amount of $2.5 compared to $0.8 million in 2022 that have been included in cost of sales.\nCost of revenues for overhaul and coating of jet engine components. Cost of revenues for the overhaul and coating of jet engine components segment increased to $3.5M for the year ended December 31,\n2022 from $3 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, an increase of 17.4%.\nCost of revenues as a percentage of revenues in this segment decreased to 60.6% in the year ended December 31, 2022 from 77.7% in the year ended December 31, 2021. The decrease is primarily due an\nincrease in revenues and management’s actions in cost reduction.\nResearch and development, net. Research and development expenses were $0.5 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2022, compared to $0.5 million for the twelve months ended December\n31, 2021.\nResearch and development expenses as a percentage of revenues were 0.6% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2022 compared to 0.6% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2021.\nSelling and marketing. Selling and marketing expenses were $5.6 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2022, compared to $5.1 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2021.\nSelling and marketing expenses as a percentage of revenues were 6.7% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2022, compared to 6.6% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2021.\nGeneral and administrative. General and administrative expenses were $10 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2022, compared to $8.3 million for the twelve months ended December 31,\n2021, an increase of 19%.\nGeneral and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues were 11.8% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2022, compared to 10.7% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2021. The\nincrease is primarily due to increase in headcount and recruitments cost, travel expenses and auditors’ fees.\nOther expenses (income). Other expenses (income) were ($0.1) million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2022, compared to ($0.5) million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2021, a\ndecrease of 80.8%.\nOther income as a percentage of revenues were 0.1% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2022, compared to 0.6% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2021. The change is mainly derived\nfrom the sale of fixed assets.\nRestructuring expenses. Restructuring expenses were $1.7 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2022, compared to $1.8 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2021.\nRestructuring expenses as a percentage of revenues were 2% for the twelve months ended in December 31, 2022 compared to 2.2% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2021. Such expenses are\ndue to the company’s restructuring plan that was launched in 2021 and include an expense on a guarantee in the amount of $0.8 million related to the company’s evacuation of the Gedera facility.\nFinancial expenses, net. Financial income, net for the twelve months ended December 31, 2022 were $0.1 million, compared to $0.5 million of financial expenses for the twelve months ended December\n31, 2021. The decrease was mainly due to exchange rate differences as a result of a stronger US dollar compared to the Israeli Shekel in 2022 (the Israeli Shekel weakened by 13.2% against the US dollar in 2022,\ncompared to 2021 in which the Israeli Shekel strengthen by 3.3% against the US dollar). TAT obtained government-guaranteed and commercial loans in a total amount of $8 million (as of December 31, 2022)\nwhich are denominated in Israeli Shekel.\nTaxes on income (tax benefit). Taxes on income for the twelve months ended December 31, 2022, amounted to $0.1 million, compared to $0.7 million tax benefits for the twelve months ended December\n31, 2021.\nShare in results of equity investment of affiliated companies. Share in results of equity investment of affiliated companies for the twelve months ended December 31, 2022, amounted to a gain of $0.2\nmillion compared to a loss of less than $0.1 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2021.\n40\nYear ended December 31, 2021 compared with Year ended December 31, 2020\nPlease see Item 5 on Form 20-F for the Year ended December 31, 2021 filed on March 14, 2022 for this comparison.\nConditions in Israel\nTAT is incorporated under the laws of the State of Israel, and its principal executive offices and manufacturing and research and development facilities are located in Israel. See “RISK FACTORS” for a\ndescription of governmental, economic, fiscal, monetary or political policies or factors that have materially affected or could materially affect TAT’s operations.\nTrade Relations\nIsrael is a member of the United Nations, the International Monetary Fund, the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development and the International Finance Corporation. Israel is a member of\nthe World Trade Organization and is a signatory to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. In addition, Israel has been granted preferences under the Generalized System of Preferences from the United\nStates, Australia, Canada and Japan. These preferences allow Israel to export the products covered by such programs either duty-free or at reduced tariffs.\nIsrael and the European Union Community, known now as the “European Union,” concluded a Free Trade Agreement in July 1975 that confers some advantages with respect to Israeli exports to most\nEuropean countries and obligates Israel to lower its tariffs with respect to imports from these countries over a number of years. In 1985, Israel and the United States entered into an agreement to establish a Free\nTrade Area. The Free Trade Area has eliminated all tariff and some non-tariff barriers on most trade between the two countries. On January 1, 1993, an agreement between Israel and the European Free Trade\nAssociation, known as the “EFTA,” established a free-trade zone between Israel and the EFTA nations. In November 1995, Israel entered into a new agreement with the European Union, which includes a\nredefinition of rules of origin and other improvements, such as allowing Israel to become a member of the Research and Technology programs of the European Union. In recent years, Israel has established\ncommercial and trade relations with a number of other nations, including Russia, China, India, Turkey and other nations in Eastern Europe and the Asia-Pacific region.\nImpact of Currency Fluctuation and of Inflation\nTAT reports its financial results in dollars and receives payment primarily in dollars or dollar-linked NIS for all of its sales while it incurs a portion of its expenses, principally salaries and related\npersonnel expenses in Israel, in NIS. Additionally, certain assets, as well as a portion of its liabilities, are denominated in NIS. Therefore, the dollar cost of its operations is influenced by the extent to which any\ninflation in Israel is offset on a lagging basis or is not offset by the devaluation of the NIS in relation to the U.S. dollar. When the rate of inflation in Israel exceeds the rate of devaluation of the NIS against the U.S.\ndollar, the dollar cost of operations in Israel increases. If the dollar cost of operations in Israel increases, its dollar-measured results of operations will be adversely affected. It is uncertain whether TAT will be\nmaterially and adversely affected in the future if inflation in Israel exceeds the devaluation of the NIS against the dollar or if the timing of the devaluation lags behind inflation in Israel.\nBecause exchange rates between the NIS and the dollar fluctuate continuously, exchange rate fluctuations and especially larger periodic devaluations will have an impact on TAT’s profitability and period-\nto-period comparisons of its results. The effects of foreign currency re-measurements are reported in TAT’s consolidated financial statements in current operations. Although TAT hedges a portion of its exchange\nrate risk through the use of forward contracts and other derivative instruments, there is no certainty that future results of operations may not be materially adversely affected by currency fluctuations.\n41\nCorporate Tax Rate\nIsraeli companies are generally subject to corporate tax on their taxable income (including capital gains). The regular corporate tax rate for Israel was 23% for the year ended December 31, 2020,\nDecember 31, 2021 and December 31, 2022.\nHowever, the rate is effectively reduced for income derived from Approved and Beneficiary Enterprises, as defined by the Law for the Encouragement of Capital Investments, 1959, as amended (the\n\"Investment Law\"). Until December 31, 2010, TAT elected to participate in the alternative package of tax benefits for its current Approved and Beneficiary Enterprises. Pursuant to such law, the income derived\nfrom those enterprises was exempt from Israeli corporate tax for a specified benefit period (except to the extent that dividends are distributed from tax exempt income generated from the Approved and Beneficiary\nEnterprises or during the tax-exemption period other than upon liquidation) and subject to reduced corporate tax rates for an additional period.\nCertain amendments to the Investment Law became effective in January 2011 (the “2011 Amendment”). Under the 2011 Amendment, income derived by ‘Preferred Companies’ from ‘Preferred\nEnterprises’ (both as defined in the 2011 Amendment) would be subject to a uniform reduced corporate tax rate as opposed to the incentives that are limited to income from Approved or Beneficiary Enterprises\nduring their benefits period. According to the 2011 Amendment, the uniform tax rate on such income, referred to as ‘Preferred Income’, would be 10% in areas designated as Israel’s Development Zone A and 15%\nelsewhere in Israel during 2011-2012, 7% and 12.5%, respectively, in 2013-2014, and 6% and 12%, respectively, thereafter. Dividends distributed from taxable income derived from Preferred Income would be\nsubject to a 15% tax (or lower, if so provided under an applicable tax treaty), which would generally be withheld by the distributing company. While a company may incur additional tax liability in the event of\ndistribution of dividends from tax exempt income generated from its Approved and Beneficiary Enterprises, no additional tax liability will be incurred by the company in the event of distribution of dividends from\nincome taxed in accordance with the 2011 Amendment.\nUnder the transitional provisions of the 2011 Amendment, TAT elected to irrevocably implement the 2011 Amendment with respect to its existing Approved and Beneficiary Enterprises while waiving\nbenefits provided under the legislation prior to the 2011 Amendment.\nAccording to a more recent amendment which was announced in August 2013 and implemented in 2014, dividends paid out of income attributed to a Preferred Enterprise will be subject to a withholding\ntax rate of 20% (instead of 15%). In addition, tax rates under the Preferred Enterprise were also raised effective as of January 1, 2014, to 9% in Zone A and 16% elsewhere (instead of the 6% and 12%,\nrespectively) with respect to Preferred Income as defined in the Investment law. In 2017, following the approval of the Israeli Budget Law for 2017 and 2018 (the “Budget Law”), the tax rate under a Preferred\nEnterprise with respect to Preferred Income as defined in the Investment law, generated in a Development Zone A will drop effective as of January 1, 2017, to 7.5%, while the tax rate of Preferred Income derived\nelsewhere in Israel remains 16%.\nCertain investment income derived by TAT from investments may not be regarded by the Israeli tax authorities as income from TAT’s Preferred Enterprise and consequently may be taxed at the regular\nstatutory rate in Israel.\nCertain of TAT’s subsidiaries operate in and are subject to the tax laws of various other jurisdictions, primarily the United States. TAT’s U.S. subsidiaries are taxed based on federal and state tax laws. The\nU.S. federal statutory flat tax rate for tax years 2021 and 2022 is 21%.\nRecently Issued Accounting Standards\nRecently adopted accounting pronouncements:\n1. In December 2019, the FASB issued ASU 2019-12, “Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes. (Topic 740)” (\"the Update\"). The amendments in this Update simplify the accounting for income\ntaxes by removing the following exceptions in ASC 740: 1. Exception to the incremental approach for intra-period tax allocation when there is a loss from continuing operations and income or a gain from\nother items; 2. Exception to the requirement to recognize a deferred tax liability for equity method investments when a foreign subsidiary becomes an equity method investment; 3. Exception to the ability\nnot to recognize a deferred tax liability for a foreign subsidiary when a foreign equity method investment becomes a subsidiary;4. Exception to the general methodology for calculating income taxes in an\ninterim period when a year-to-date loss exceeds the anticipated loss for the year.\nIn addition, this Update also simplify the accounting for income taxes in certain topics as follows: 1. Requiring that an entity recognize a franchise tax (or similar tax) that is partially based on income as\nan income-based tax and account for any incremental amount incurred as a non-income-based tax; 2. Requiring that an entity evaluate when a step up in the tax basis of goodwill should be considered part\nof the business combination in which the book goodwill was originally recognized and when it should be considered a separate transaction;3. Specifying that an entity can elect (rather than required to)\nallocate the consolidated amount of current and deferred tax expense to a legal entity that is not subject to tax in its separate financial statements;4. Requiring that an entity reflect the effect of an enacted\nchange in tax laws or rates in the annual effective tax rate computation in the interim period that includes the enactment date. See Note 19 in the financial statements.\nThe amendments in this Update are effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2020. The new standard does not have a material effect on the\nCompany's financial statements upon adoption.\nAccounting pronouncements issued but not yet adopted:\n1. In November 2021, the FASB issued ASU 2021-10, Government Assistance (Topic 832), which increases the transparency of government assistance including disclosure of the type of assistance, an\nentity’s accounting for the assistance, and the effect of the assistance on an entity’s financial statements. ASU 2021-10 is effective for all entities for financial statements issued for annual periods\nbeginning after December 15, 2021. An entity should apply the amendments either prospectively to all transactions within the scope of the ASU that are reflected in the financial statements at the date of\ninitial application and that are entered into after that date or retrospectively to those transactions. See Note 6 in the financial statements.\n42\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nAs of December 31, 2022, TAT had cash and cash equivalents of $8 million compared to $13.2 million as of December 31, 2021, a decrease of $5.2 million primarily due to investments in machinery,\ninfrastructure, buildings and new manufacturing capabilities in an amount of $ 16.1million.\nDuring 2022, TAT increased its loans and lines of credit from commercial banks by $16.6 million, and repaid loans in the amount of $1.1 million.\nDuring 2022, TAT received a loan from a commercial bank in the amount of $3.7 million. The loan bears annual interest rate of 6.65% (Prime Rate +0.9%) and is repaid in equal monthly installment as of\nApril 2022 through March 2029.\nDuring 2022, TAT received loans from a commercial bank in the US in an aggregate amount of $7.9 million. These loans are secured with a first degree lien on TAT’s US subsidiaries equipment. The\nloans bear annual interest of 3.75% and 4.2% and are repaid in equal monthly installments until 2029 and 2031.\nIn March 2022 TAT received a short-term credit line of $5 million from a commercial bank in the US.

TAT funded these expenditures mainly from\nits own cash resources, cash flows from operations and new loans and credit line from banks. TAT expects that its available cash and cash equivalents and cash flow generated from operations will be sufficient to\nfund its capital expenditures.\nManagement believes that anticipated cash flow from operations and its current cash balances will be sufficient to meet its cash requirements for at least 12 months from the financial statement issuance\ndate. TAT’s future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including its rate of revenue growth, the expansion of its selling and marketing activities, costs associated with expansion into new markets and\nthe timing of the introduction of new products and services.\nCash Flows\nThe following table summarizes TAT’s cash flows for the periods presented:\nYear Ended December 31,\n(in thousands)\n2022 2021 2020\nNet cash provided by (used in) operating activities $ (4,867) $ (2,269) $ 5,947\nNet cash used in investing activities (16,120) (15,639) (5,407)\nNet cash provided by financing activities 15,798 6,042 7,652\nNet cash provided by (used in) discontinued activities - 777 153\nNet increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents (5,189) (11,089) 8,345\nCash and cash equivalents at beginning of the year 13,215 24,304 15,959\nCash and cash equivalents at end of the year $ 8,026 $ 13,215 $ 24,304\n43\nNet cash used in operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2022, amounted to approximately $4.9 million, compared to net cash used in operating activities of $2.3 million for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2021 and net cash provided by operating activities of $5.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2020.\nNet cash used in operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2022 was impacted by the company's restructuring plan costs with an amount of $1.7 million.\nNet cash used in operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2022 was principally derived from the following adjustments of non-cash line items: an upward adjustment of $3.7 million for\ndepreciation and amortization; a upward adjustment of $1.1 million for an increase in trade accounts payable; an upward adjustment of $2.7 million for accrued expenses.

Trend Information\nIn recent years, the aerospace industry in which we operate has been impacted by the increase in number of commercial and defense aircraft, increase in commercial passenger traffic and a corresponding\nincrease in airlines’ revenue.

Our board of directors\ndetermined, accordingly, that at least two directors must have ‘‘accounting and financial expertise’’ as such term is defined by regulations promulgated under the Israeli Companies Law.\nWe are exempt from the requirements of the NASDAQ Marketplace Rules with regard to the nomination process of directors since we are a controlled company within the meaning of NASDAQ\nMarketplace Rule 5615(c)(2). See below in this Item 6. “Directors, Senior Management and Employees - Board Practices - NASDAQ Exemptions for a Controlled Company.”\nExternal and Independent Directors\nExternal Directors. Under the Israeli Companies Law, Israeli companies whose shares have been offered to the public or whose shares are listed in an authorized stock exchange (accordingly, such shares\nare considered as held by \"the public\") are required to appoint at least two external directors who meet the independence criteria set by the Israeli Companies Law.\nA person is qualified to serve as an external director only if he or she has “accounting and financial expertise” or “professional qualifications,” as such terms are defined by the Israeli Companies\nRegulations (Conditions and Criteria for a Director Who Possesses Accounting Expertise and a Director Who Possesses Professional Competence), 2005. At least one of the external directors must have\n“accounting and financial expertise.” Each of our external directors has “accounting and financial expertise.”\nExternal directors are elected by a majority vote at a shareholders’ meeting. In addition to the majority vote, the shareholder approval of the election of an external director must satisfy either of two\nadditional tests:\n• The majority includes at least a majority of the shares voted by shareholders other than controlling shareholders or shareholders who have a personal interest in the election of the external\ndirectors (excluding a personal interest that is not related to a relationship with the controlling shareholders); or\n• The total number of shares held by non-controlling shareholders and disinterested shareholders that voted against the election of the external director does not exceed 2% of the aggregate voting\nrights of the company.\nIn general, external directors serve for a three-year term and may be re-elected to two additional three-year terms by one of the following mechanisms: (1) the board of directors proposes the re-election of\nthe nominee and the re-election is approved by the majority required for appointment of external directors for their initial term; or (2) a shareholder holding 1% or more of the company's voting rights proposes the\nre-election of the nominee, and the re-election is approved by a majority of the votes cast by the shareholders of the company, excluding the votes of controlling shareholders or those who have a personal interest\nin the nomination, provided that the aggregate votes cast in favor of the re-election by shareholders who are not controlling shareholders and do not have a personal interest in the nomination constitute more than\n2% of the company's voting rights. Israeli companies listed on certain stock exchanges outside Israel, including The NASDAQ Global Market, such as our company, may appoint an external director for additional\nterms of not more than three years subject to certain conditions. Such conditions include the determination by the audit committee and board of directors, that in view of the director's professional expertise and\nspecial contribution to the company's board of directors and its committees, the appointment of the external director for an additional term is in the best interest of the company.\n50\nAn external director may be removed from office at the initiative of the board of directors at a special general meeting of shareholders, if the board resolves that the statutory requirements for that person’s\nappointment as external director no longer exist, or that the external director has violated his or her duty of loyalty to the company. The resolution of the special general meeting of shareholders regarding the\ntermination of office of an external director requires the same majority that is required for the election of an external director. The court may order the termination of the office of an external director on the same\ngrounds, following a motion filed by a director or a shareholder. If an external directorship becomes vacant and as a result there are fewer than two directors who serve as external directors in the company, the\nboard of directors is required under the Israeli Companies law to convene a shareholder meeting immediately to appoint a new external director.\nEach committee of the board of directors that is authorized to exercise powers vested in the board of directors must include at least one external director and the audit committee must include all of the\nexternal directors. An external director is entitled to compensation as provided in regulations adopted under the Israeli Companies Law and is otherwise prohibited from receiving any other compensation, directly\nor indirectly, in connection with such service.\nUntil the lapse of two years from termination of office, we may not engage an external director or his spouse or child, to serve as an office holder and cannot employ or receive services from these persons,\neither directly or indirectly, including through a corporation controlled by that person; and with regards to a related person (to a such external director) as defined in the Israeli Companies law which is not a spouse\nor child – until the lapse of one year from termination of office.\nIndependent Directors. As a controlled company, within the meaning of NASDAQ Marketplace Rule 5615(c)(2), we are exempt from the NASDAQ Marketplace Rule which requires that a majority of\nour board of directors qualify as independent directors, within the meaning of the NASDAQ Marketplace Rules. See Item 6. “Directors, Senior Management and Employees - Board Practices - NASDAQ\nExemptions for a Controlled Company”.\nAudit Committee\nUnder the Israeli Companies Law, the board of directors of any public company must establish an audit committee. In general, the audit committee must consist of at least three directors and must include\nall of the external directors; furthermore, a majority of the audit committee members must comply with the director independence requirements prescribed by the Israeli Companies Law. The audit committee may\nnot include (i) the chairman of the board of directors, (ii) any director employed by the Company or by a controlling shareholder of the company (including a company which is controlled by the controlling\nshareholder), (iii) any director providing services to the company or to a controlling shareholder of the company (including to a company which is controlled by the controlling shareholder) on an ongoing basis, or\n(iv) a controlling shareholder or any of the controlling shareholder’s relatives.\nIn addition, the NASDAQ Marketplace Rules require us to establish an audit committee comprised of at least three members, all of whom must be independent directors, each of whom is financially\nliterate and satisfies the respective “independence” requirements of the SEC and NASDAQ and one of whom has accounting or related financial management expertise at senior levels within a company.\nOur audit committee acts also as a committee for the review and the approval of our financial statements, and as such, assists our board of directors in overseeing the accounting and financial reporting\nprocesses of our company and audits of our financial statements, including the integrity of our financial statements, compliance with legal and regulatory requirements, our independent registered public\naccountants’ qualifications and independence, the performance of our internal audit function and independent registered public accountants, finding any defects in the business management of our company and\nproposing to our board of directors ways to correct such defects, approving related-party (officers, directors, controlling shareholder, etc.) transactions with the company as required by Israeli law, examining the\nscope of work and the payment to our independent auditors and such other duties as may be directed by our board of directors. The audit committee may consult from time to time with our independent auditors\nand internal auditor with respect to matters involving financial reporting and internal accounting controls.\nOur audit committee consists of three members of our board of directors (including two external directors and one independent director) who satisfy the respective “independence” requirements of the\nSEC, NASDAQ and Israeli law for audit committee members. Our board of directors has determined that each member of our audit committee qualifies as an audit committee financial expert, as defined by rules\nof the SEC. The audit committee meets at least once each quarter.\n51\nCompensation Committee\nUnder the Israeli Companies Law, the board of directors of any public company must establish a compensation committee. The compensation committee must consist of at least three directors, include all\nof the external directors (including one external director serving as the chair of the compensation committee), and a majority of the committee members must comply with the director independence requirements\nprescribed by the Israeli Companies Law. Similar to the rules that apply to the audit committee, the compensation committee may not include the chairman of the board, or any director employed by us, by a\ncontrolling shareholder or by any entity controlled by a controlling shareholder, or any director providing services to us, to a controlling shareholder or to any entity controlled by a controlling shareholder on a\nregular basis, or any director whose primary income is dependent on a controlling shareholder, and may not include a controlling shareholder or any of its relatives. Individuals who are not permitted to be\ncompensation committee members may not participate in the committee’s meetings other than to present a particular issue; provided, however, that an employee that is not a controlling shareholder or relative may\nparticipate in the committee’s discussions but not in any vote; other than the company’s legal counsel and corporate secretary who may participate in the committee’s discussions and votes if requested by the\ncommittee.\nThe compensation committee’s duties include recommending to the board of directors a compensation policy for executives and monitor its implementation, approve compensation terms of executive\nofficers, directors and employees affiliated with controlling shareholders, make recommendations to the board of directors regarding the issuance of equity incentive awards under our equity incentive plan and\nexempt certain compensation arrangements from the requirement to obtain shareholder approval under the Israeli Companies Law. The compensation committee meets at least twice a year, with further meetings to\noccur, or actions to be taken by unanimous written consent, when deemed necessary or desirable by the committee or its chairperson.\nOur compensation committee consists of our two external directors and an independent director under the respective requirements of the SEC and NASDAQ and complies with the Israeli Companies Law\ncriteria for compensation committee members.\nInternal Audit\nThe Israeli Companies Law requires the board of directors of a public company to appoint an internal auditor following a recommendation by the audit committee. The role of the internal auditor is to\nexamine, among other things, the company’s compliance with applicable law and orderly business practice. The internal auditor must meet certain statutory requirements of independence. Mr. Doron Cohen has\nserved as our internal auditor since December 24, 2008.\nDirectors’ Service Contracts\nThere are no arrangements or understandings between us and any of our subsidiaries, on the one hand, and any of our directors, on the other hand, providing for benefits upon termination of their\nemployment or service as directors of our company or any of our subsidiaries.\nChairman of the Board\nUnder the Israeli Companies Law, the general manager of a company (or a relative of the general manager) may not serve as the chairman of the board of directors, and the chairman of the board of\ndirectors (or a relative of the chairman of the board of directors) may not serve as the general manager, unless approved by the shareholders by a special majority vote prescribed by the Israeli Companies Law. The\nshareholder vote cannot authorize the appointment for a period of longer than three years, which period may be extended from time to time by the shareholders with a similar special majority vote. The chairman of\nthe board of directors shall not hold any other position with the company (except as general manager if approved in accordance with the above procedure) or in any entity controlled by the company, other than as\nchairman of the board of directors of a controlled entity, and the company shall not delegate to the chairman duties that, directly or indirectly, make him or her subordinate to the general manager.\nApproval of Related Party Transactions under Israeli Law\nFiduciary Duties of Office Holders\nThe Israeli Companies Law codifies the fiduciary duties that “office holders,” including directors and executive officers, owe to a company. An office holder’s fiduciary duties consist of a duty of care and\na duty of loyalty. The duty of care requires an office holder to act at a level of care that a reasonable office holder in the same position would employ under the same circumstances. This includes the duty to utilize\nreasonable means to obtain (i) information regarding the business feasibility of a given action brought for his approval or performed by him by virtue of his position and (ii) all other information of importance\npertaining to the foregoing actions. The duty of loyalty requires that an office holder acts in good faith and for the benefit of the company, including (i) avoiding any conflict of interest between the office holder’s\nposition in the company and any other position he holds or his personal affairs, (ii) avoiding any competition with the company’s business, (iii) avoiding exploiting any business opportunity of the company in\norder to receive personal gain for the office holder or others, and (iv) disclosing to the company any information or documents relating to the company’s affairs that the office holder has received by virtue of his\nposition as an office holder.\n52\nDisclosure of Personal Interests of an Office Holder; Approval of Transactions with Office Holders\nThe Israeli Companies Law requires that an office holder promptly, and no later than the first board meeting at which such transaction is considered, disclose any personal interest that he or she may have\nand all related material information known to him or her and any documents in their position, in connection with any existing or proposed transaction by us. An office holder who did not disclose his or her\npersonal interests will be deemed as breaching his or her fiduciary duties. In addition, if the transaction is an extraordinary transaction, that is, a transaction other than in the ordinary course of business or other\nthan in accordance with market terms, or likely to have a material impact on the company’s profitability, assets or liabilities, the office holder must also disclose any personal interest held by the office holder’s\nspouse, sibling, parent, grandparent, child as well as sibling or parent of such person's spouse or the spouse of any of the above, or by any corporation in which the office holder or his relative (as defined in the\nIsraeli Companies Law) is a 5% or greater shareholder, director or general manager or in which he or she has the right to appoint at least one director or the general manager.\nUnder the Israeli Companies Law, in general, all arrangements as to compensation of office holders who are not directors (other than the Chief Executive Officer) require the approval of the compensation\ncommittee and the board of directors, including exculpation, insurance and indemnification of, or an undertaking to, indemnify an office holder who is not a director. The compensation of office holders who are\ndirectors and compensation of the Chief Executive Officer must be approved by the compensation committee, board of directors and the general meeting of shareholders.\nSome transactions, actions and arrangements involving an office holder (or a third party in which an office holder has an interest) must be approved by the board of directors or as otherwise provided for\nin a company’s articles of association. If the transaction is an extraordinary transaction (which is defined as a transaction not in the ordinary course of business and for a material value) such a transaction must be\napproved by the audit committee and by the board of directors itself, and under certain circumstances shareholder approval may be required. A director who has a personal interest in a transaction that is considered\nat a meeting of the board of directors or the audit committee may not be present during the board of directors or audit committee discussions and may not vote on the transaction, unless the transaction is not an\nextraordinary transaction or the majority of the members of the board or the audit committee have a personal interest, as the case may be. In the event the majority of the members of the board of directors or the\naudit committee have a personal interest, then the approval of the general meeting of shareholders is also required.\nDisclosure of Personal Interests of a Controlling Shareholder; Approval of Transactions with Controlling Shareholders\nThe disclosure requirements that apply to an office holder also apply to a transaction in which a controlling shareholder of the company has a personal interest. The Israeli Companies Law provides that an\nextraordinary transaction with a controlling shareholder or an extraordinary transaction with another person in whom the controlling shareholder has a personal interest or a transaction with a controlling\nshareholder or his relative regarding terms of service and employment, must be approved by the audit committee (or the compensation committee, as the case may be), the board of directors and the shareholders\nby a special majority, as follows. The shareholders’ approval must include the majority of shares voted at the meeting. In addition to the majority vote, the shareholder approval must satisfy either of two additional\ntests:\n• The majority includes at least a majority of the shares voted by shareholders who have no personal interest in the transaction; or\n• The total number of shares held by disinterested shareholders that voted against the approval of the transaction does not exceed 2% of the aggregate voting rights of our company.\nAccording to regulations promulgated under the Israeli Companies Law, certain extraordinary transactions between a public company and its controlling shareholder(s) do not require shareholder\napproval. In addition, under such regulations, directors’ compensation and employment arrangements in a public company do not require the approval of the shareholders if both the audit committee and the board\nof directors agree that such arrangements are solely for the benefit of the company or if the directors’ compensation does not exceed the maximum amount of compensation for external directors determined by\napplicable regulations. Also, employment and compensation arrangements for an office holder that is a controlling shareholder of a public company do not require shareholder approval if certain criteria are met.\nThe foregoing exemptions from shareholder approval will not apply if one or more shareholders holding at least 1% of the issued and outstanding share capital of the company or of the company’s voting rights,\nobjects to the use of these exemptions provided that such objection is submitted to the company in writing not later than fourteen days from the date of the filing of a report regarding the adoption of such\nresolution by the company. If such objection is duly and timely submitted, then the transaction or compensation arrangement of the directors will require shareholders’ approval as detailed above.\nIn addition, a private placement of securities that will (i) cause a person to become a controlling shareholder or (ii) increase the relative holdings of a shareholder that holds 5% or more of the company’s\noutstanding share capital, or (iii) will cause any person to become, as a result of the issuance, a holder of more than 5% of the company’s outstanding share capital in a private placement in which 20% or more of\nthe company’s outstanding share capital prior to the placement are offered, the payment for which (in whole or in part) is not in cash or not under market terms, requires approval by the board of directors and the\nshareholders of the company.\n53\nCompensation of Executive Officers and Directors\nIn accordance with the Israeli Companies Law, we have adopted a compensation policy for our executive officers and directors. The purpose of the policy is to describe our overall compensation strategy\nfor our executive officers and directors and to provide guidelines for setting their compensation, as prescribed by the Israeli Companies Law. In accordance with the Israeli Companies Law, the policy must be\nreviewed and readopted at least once every three years.\nApproval of the compensation committee, the board of directors and our shareholders, in that order, is required for the adoption of the compensation policy. The shareholders’ approval must include the\nmajority of shares voted at the meeting. In addition to the majority vote, the shareholder approval must satisfy either of two additional tests:\n• The majority includes at least a majority of the shares voted by shareholders other than our controlling shareholders or shareholders who have a personal interest in the adoption of the\ncompensation policies; or\n• The total number of shares held by non-controlling shareholders and disinterested shareholders that voted against the adoption of the compensation policies does not exceed 2% of the aggregate\nvoting rights of our company.\nUnder the Israeli Companies Law, the compensation arrangements for officers (other than the Chief Executive Officer) who are not directors require the approval of the compensation committee and the\nboard of directors; provided, however, that if the compensation arrangement is not in compliance with our executive compensation policy, the arrangement may only be approved by the compensation committee\nand the board of directors for special reasons to be noted, and the compensation arrangement shall also require a special shareholder approval. If the compensation arrangement is an immaterial amendment to an\nexisting compensation arrangement of an officer who is not a director and is in compliance with our executive compensation policy, the approval of the compensation committee is sufficient.\nArrangements regarding the compensation of the Chief Executive Officer and directors require the approval of the compensation committee, the board of directors and our shareholders, in that order. In\ncertain limited cases, the compensation of a new Chief Executive Officer who is not a director may be the approved without approval of the shareholders.\nVariable Cash Incentive\nThe compensation committee and board of directors may adopt, from time to time, a cash incentive plan, which will set forth for each executive certain targets which form such executives on target cash\npayment (the “On Target Cash Plan”) and the rules or formula for calculation of the On Target Cash Plan payment once actual achievements are known.\nThe compensation committee and board of directors may include in the On Target Cash Plan predetermined thresholds and caps to correlate an executive’s On Target Cash Plan payments with actual\nachievements.\nThe actual payment of the annual On Target Cash Plan for the active chairman of the board of directors (the “Active Chairman”), the CEO and other executives in a given year shall be capped as\ndetermined by our board of directors, but in no event shall exceed the ratio set forth in the table below.\n54\nThe On Target Cash Plans may be composed based on a mix of (i) the company target; (ii) personal targets (KPIs); and (iii) personal evaluation. The weight to be assigned to each of the components per\neach of the executives shall be as set forth in the table below.\nActive Chairman CEO Other Executives\nCompany Target 100% 75% - 100% 50%-100%\nPersonal KPIs NONE NONE 0%-30%\nPersonal Evaluation NONE 0%-25% 0%-30%\nThe company target shall be determined in accordance with all or part of pre-determined targets of the sales budget, gross profit, operating profit, EBITDA, net income and net cash from operating\nactivities, all in accordance with TAT’s annual budget. If a company target shall apply to a Chief Executive Officer or a President of a subsidiary, such target may be applied up to 100% with respect to the financial\nresults of the relevant subsidiary, and the remaining cash incentive with respect to the financial results of TAT and its subsidiaries on a consolidated basis.\nThe board of directors may determine to exclude certain profits or loss items from the company target including, but not limited to, certain expenses related to acquisition of a new company, certain\nexpenses related to distribution of dividend, certain items of revenue or any other items per the board of directors’ sole discretion.\nWith regard to each one of the measurable targets, reference points shall be determined in terms of numerical values, so that compliance with the precise numerical target as determined in the On Target\nCash Plan shall constitute compliance with 100% of the target, and also, numerical values shall be determined which will constitute the lower threshold for compliance with the target. The actual rate of\ncompliance with the targets shall be calculated in accordance with the said reference points. Failure to comply with the minimum threshold of at least 75% of a specific target shall not entitle the executive to an On\nTarget Cash Plan payment in respect of the said target. In the event of compliance at a rate of 75% or more with a specific target, the annual On Target Cash Plan shall be calculated in accordance with a key (i.e.\nlinear, steps, etc.) which shall determine – in relation to the point of compliance with the target – the amount of the payment in terms of a percentage of the executive annual base salary, all as shall be set forth in\nthe On Target Cash Plan. In this respect, the compensation committee and the board of directors shall have the right to determine a higher (but not lower) entitlement threshold.\nThe annual cash incentive shall be paid to the executive in the following manner:\n- 80% of the amount of the On Target Cash Plan payment will be paid following the approval of the financial statements of the relevant year by the board of directors.\n- 20% of the amount of the On Target Cash Plan payment shall be deferred by one year, and shall be paid following the approval of the financial statements of such year (“Deferred Bonus”) by the board\nof directors.\nThe executive's eligibility to the payment of the Deferred Bonus shall be subject to the following cumulative conditions: (i) TAT recorded a positive EBITDA for the following year; and (ii) TAT did not\nterminate its engagement with the executive for cause.\nIndemnification and Insurance of Directors and Officers\nInsurance of Office Holders\nThe Israeli Companies Law provides that a company may, if permitted by its articles of association, enter into a contract to insure an office holder for acts or omissions performed by the office holder in\nsuch capacity for:\n• Breach of his or her duty of care to the company or to another person;\n• Breach of his or her duty of loyalty to the company, provided that the office holder acted in good faith and had reasonable cause to assume that his act would not prejudice the company’s interests;\n• Monetary liability imposed upon the office holder in favor of another person;\n• A monetary obligation imposed on the office holder in favor of another person who was injured by a violation, as this term is defined in section 52(54)(a)(1)(a) of the Israeli Securities Law, 1968\n(“Israeli Securities Law”); and\n• Expenses expended by the office holder, including reasonable litigation expenses, and including attorney's fees, in respect of any proceeding under chapters 8-C, 8-D or 9-A of the Israeli Securities\nLaw or in respect to any monetary sanction.\n55\nIndemnification of Office Holders\nThe Israeli Companies Law provides that a company may, if permitted by its articles of association, indemnify an office holder for acts or omissions performed by the office holder in such capacity for:\n• Monetary liability imposed on the office holder in favor of another person by any judgment, including a settlement or an arbitrator’s award approved by a court;\n• Reasonable litigation expenses, including attorney’s fees, actually incurred by the office holder as a result of an investigation or proceeding instituted against him or her by a competent authority,\nprovided that such investigation or proceeding concluded without the filing of an indictment against the office holder or the imposition of any monetary liability in lieu of criminal proceedings, or\nconcluded without the filing of an indictment against the office holder and a monetary liability was imposed on the officer holder in lieu of criminal proceedings with respect to a criminal offense that\ndoes not require proof of criminal intent;\n• A monetary obligation imposed on the office holder in favor of another person who was injured by a violation, as this term is defined in section 52(54)(a)(1)(a) of the Israeli Securities Law;\n• Expenses expended by the office holder, including reasonable litigation expenses, and including attorney's fees, in respect of any proceeding under chapters 8-C, 8-D or 9-A of the Israeli Securities\nLaw or in respect to any monetary sanction;\n• Reasonable litigation expenses, including attorneys’ fees, incurred by such office holder or which were imposed on him by a court, in proceedings the company instituted against the office holder or\nthat were instituted on the company’s behalf or by another person, or in a criminal charge from which the office holder was acquitted, or in a criminal proceeding in which the office holder was\nconvicted of a crime which does not require proof of criminal intent; or\n• Any other liability, payment or expense which the company may indemnify its office holders under the Israeli Company Law, the Israeli Securities Law or other Israeli law.\nIn accordance with the Israeli Companies Law, a company’s articles of association may permit the company to:\n• Undertake in advance to indemnify an office holder, except that with respect to a financial liability imposed on the office holder by any judgment, settlement or court-approved arbitration award, the\nundertaking must be limited to types of occurrences, which, in the opinion of the company’s board of directors, are, at the time of the undertaking, foreseeable due to the company’s activities and to\nan amount or standard that the board of directors has determined is reasonable under the circumstances; and\n• Undertake in advance to indemnify an office holder for reasonable litigation expenses, including attorney’s fees, actually incurred by the office holder as a result of an investigation or proceeding\ninstituted against him or her by a competent authority, provided that such investigation or proceeding concluded without the filing of an indictment against the office holder or the imposition of any\nmonetary liability in lieu of criminal proceedings, or concluded without the filing of an indictment against the office holder and a monetary liability was imposed on the officer holder in lieu of\ncriminal proceedings with respect to a criminal offense that does not require proof of criminal intent.\n• Undertake in advance to indemnify an office holder for reasonable litigation expenses, including attorneys’ fees, incurred by such office holder or which were imposed on him by a court, in\nproceedings the company instituted against the office holder or that were instituted on the company’s behalf or by another person, or in a criminal charge from which the office holder was acquitted,\nor in a criminal proceeding in which the office holder was convicted of a crime which does not require proof of criminal intent.\n• Retroactively indemnify an office holder of the company.\nLimitations on Exculpation, Insurance and Indemnification\nThe Israeli Companies Law provides that neither a provision of the articles of association permitting the company to enter into a contract to insure the liability of an office holder, nor a provision in the\narticles of association or a resolution of the board of directors permitting the indemnification of an office holder, nor a provision in the articles of association exempting an office holder from duty to the company\nshall be valid, where such insurance, indemnification or exemption relates to any of the following:\n• Breach by the office holder of his duty of loyalty, except with respect to insurance coverage or indemnification if the office holder acted in good faith and had reasonable grounds to assume that the\nact would not prejudice the company;\n• Breach by the office holder of his duty of care if such breach was committed intentionally or recklessly, unless the breach was committed only negligently;\n• Any act or omission committed with intent to derive an unlawful personal gain; and\n• Any fine or forfeiture imposed on the office holder.\n56\nPursuant to our articles of association, the total amount of indemnification that we will pay (in addition to amounts received from an insurance company, if any) to all officers of the company, in\naggregate, shall not exceed, in all circumstances, more than 25% of the company's shareholders equity as set forth in the company's recent consolidated financial statements prior to the date that the indemnity is\npaid. Our articles of association include provisions which allow us to insure, indemnify and exempt our office holders, subject to the provisions of the Israeli Companies Law.\nWe maintain a directors’ and officers’ liability insurance policy with a per claim and aggregate coverage limit of $10 million, including legal costs incurred in Israel. In addition, our audit committee,\nboard of directors and shareholders resolved to indemnify our office holders, pursuant to a standard indemnification agreement that provides for indemnification of an office holder in an aggregate amount not to\nexceed 25% of our equity capital (net worth). To date, we have provided letters of indemnification to all of our officers and directors.\nNASDAQ Exemptions for a Controlled Company\nWe are a controlled company within the meaning of NASDAQ Marketplace Rule 5615(c)(2), or Rule 5615(c)(2), because the FIMI Opportunity V, L.P. and FIMI Israel Opportunity FIVE, Limited\nPartnership (the “FIMI Funds”) beneficially own more than 50% of our voting shares.\nUnder Rule 5615(c)(2), a controlled company is exempt from the following requirements of NASDAQ Marketplace Rules 5605(b)(1), 5605(d) and 5605(e) that would otherwise require that:\n• The majority of the company’s board of directors qualifies as independent directors, as defined under NASDAQ Marketplace Rules.\n• The compensation of the chief financial officer and all other executive officers be determined, or recommended to the board of directors for determination, either by (i) a majority of the independent\ndirectors or (ii) a compensation committee comprised solely of independent directors.\n• Director nominees must be selected or recommended for the board of directors, either by (a) a majority of independent directors or (b) a nominations committee comprised solely of independent\ndirectors.\nWe intend to continue to rely on these exemptions provided under Rule 5615(c)(2).\nD. Employees\nAs of December 31, 2022, TAT and its subsidiaries employed 471 employees, of whom 391 were employed in manufacturing and quality control, 15 were employed in engineering and research and\ndevelopment and 65 were employed in general & administration, sales and marketing. Of such employees, 145 were located in Israel and 326 were employed by Limco and Piedmont located in the United States.\nEmployees in Israel are employed under collective or individual employment agreements. Senior employees in special positions and members of management are employed under individual agreements.\nCollective bargaining agreements are signed for specified terms and are renewed from time to time. During 2022, TAT's management and the union of TAT Israel agreed to enter into a new collective bargaining\nagreement with respect to employees of TAT Israel. The new agreement was signed on September 7, 2022 and will be in effect until April 30, 2025.\nIn Turbochrom, a new collective bargaining agreement was signed with Turbochrome’s union on September 18, 2022, and will be in effect until April 30, 2025.\nCertain provisions of the collective bargaining agreements between the Histadrut (General Federation of Labor in Israel) and the Coordinating Bureau of Economic Organizations (including the\nManufacturers Association of Israel) are applicable to our Israeli employees by order of the Israeli Ministry of Economy and Industry. These provisions concern mainly the length of the workday, minimum daily\nwages for professional workers, pension contributions, insurance for work-related accidents, procedures for terminating employees, determination of severance pay and other employment terms. We generally\nprovide our employees with benefits and working conditions exceeding the required minimums. Furthermore, under the collective bargaining agreements, the wages of most of our employees are linked to the CPI\nin Israel, although the extent of the linkage is limited.\nIn addition, Israeli law generally requires severance pay upon the retirement or death of an employee or termination of employment without due cause. Furthermore, Israeli employees and employers are\nrequired to pay predetermined sums to the National Insurance Institute which is similar to the United States Social Security Administration. These payments amount to approximately 12% of wages, with the\nemployee contributing approximately 43% and the employer approximately 56%.\nWe currently also generally grant senior employees based in Israel participation in a particular insurance product called “management insurance”. Management insurance provides a combination of\nsavings plan, insurance and severance pay benefits to the employee, giving the employee a lump sum payment upon retirement (rather than receiving annuity payments) and securing his or her right to receive\nseverance pay, if legally entitled, upon termination of employment. In general, the employee contributes an amount equal to approximately 5% to 6% of his or her wage and the employer contributes an additional\namount of approximately 13-1/3% to 16% of such wage. Management insurance is not a legally mandated by Israeli law.\nLimco-Piedmont sponsors a 401(K) QACA safe harbor profit sharing plan covering substantially all of its employees in the United States. The plan requires the employer to contribute a match which is\ncurrently done on a payroll period basis, matching 100% of the first 2% and 50% of the next 3%. In addition, the plan allows for a discretionary qualified non-elective contribution for the plan year.\n57\nE. Share Ownership\nBeneficial Ownership of Executive Officers and Directors\nExcept as set forth under ‘Stock Option Plans’ and in Item 7A below, none of our directors and executive officers beneficially owns more than 1% of our outstanding shares.\nStock Option Plans\nIn November 2011, our audit committee and board of directors approved a stock option plan (the “2012 Plan”), which was subsequently approved by TAT’s shareholders, on June 28, 2012. According to\nthe 2012 Plan an aggregate of 980,000 options exercisable into up to 980,000 ordinary shares, 0.9 NIS par value, of TAT may be granted to certain members of our board of directors and certain senior executives\nat an exercise price not less than the fair market value of the shares covered by the option on the date of grant.\nOn August 30, 2018 the Company's compensation committee, followed by the Board of Directors, approved the amended and restated company's 2012 Plan. On October 4, 2018 the company's amended\nand restated 2012 Plan was approved at the annual general meeting of shareholders. As part of the company's 2012 Plan’s amendments it was determined that if the Company declares a cash dividend to its\nshareholders, and the distribution date of such dividend will precede the exercise date of an Option, including for the avoidance of doubt, Options that have yet to become vested and Options which have been\ngranted prior to the adoption of such amendment to the Plan, the exercise price of the option shall be reduced in the amount equal to the cash dividend per share distributed by the Company.\nFollowing the approval of TAT's audit committee and board of directors, on November 8, 2022 the Company’s shareholders approved the 2022 stock option plan (the “2022 Plan”, and together with the\n2012 Plan, the “Plans”). According to the 2022 Plan an aggregate of 550,000 options exercisable into up to 550,000 ordinary shares, 0.9 NIS par value, of TAT may be granted to certain members of our board of\ndirectors and certain senior executives at an exercise price not less than the fair market value of the shares covered by the option on the date of grant\nTotal aggregate option pool under the Plans is 1,530,000 (*) ordinary share of the company.\nIn general, the options under the Plans vest over a period of 4 years as follows: 25% of the options vest upon the lapse of 12 months following the date of grant and the remaining 75% vest on a quarterly\nbasis over the remaining 3-year period. Pursuant to the Plans, any options that are cancelled or not exercised within the option period determined in the relevant option agreement will become available for future\ngrants.\nThe grant of options to Israeli employees under the Plans is subject to the terms stipulated by Sections 102 and 102A of the Israeli Income Tax Ordinance. Each option grant is subject to the track chosen\nby the Company, either Section 102 or Section 102A of the Israeli Income Tax Ordinance, and pursuant to the terms thereof, the Company is not allowed to claim as an expense for tax purposes the amounts\ncredited to employees as benefits, including amounts recorded as salary benefits in the Company’s accounts, in respect of options granted to employees under the Plans, with the exception of the work income\nbenefit component, if any, determined on grant date. For nonemployees and for non-Israeli employees, the share option plan is subject to Section 3(i) of the Israeli Income Tax Ordinance.\nAs of December 31, 2022, options to purchase 675,000 ordinary shares were outstanding under the Plan, exercisable at an average exercise price of $7.17 per share.\n(*) of which 1,335,132 options are approved by the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange to be allocated to grantees.\nF.

Major Shareholders\nThe following table sets forth certain information as of December 31, 2022, regarding the beneficial ownership by all shareholders known to us to own beneficially 5% or more of our ordinary shares:\nNumber of\nOrdinary Shares\nBeneficially Percentage of\nName Owned(1) Ownership(2)\nFIMI Funds (3) 5,254,908 58.97%\n(1) Beneficial ownership is determined in accordance with the rules of the SEC and generally includes voting or investment power with respect to securities. Ordinary shares relating to options and\nwarrants currently exercisable or exercisable within 60 days of the date of this table are deemed outstanding for computing the percentage of the person holding such securities but are not deemed\noutstanding for computing the percentage of any other person. Except as indicated by footnote, and subject to community property laws where applicable, the persons named in the table above\nhave sole voting and investment power with respect to all shares shown as beneficially owned by them.\n(2) The percentages shown are based on 8,909,046 ordinary shares issued and outstanding as of December 31, 2022 (net of 274,473 dormant shares).\n(3) Based on a Schedule 13D filed on August 14, 2013, and on Schedule 13D/A filed on December 12, 2016, FIMI Funds, FIMI FIVE 2012 Ltd., Shira and Ishay Davidi Management Ltd. and Mr.\nIshay Davidi share voting and dispositive power with respect to the 5,254,908 ordinary shares held by the FIMI Funds. FIMI FIVE 2012 Ltd. is the managing general partner of the FIMI Funds.\nShira and Ishay Davidi Management Ltd. controls FIMI FIVE 2012 Ltd. Mr. Ishay Davidi controls the Shira and Ishay Davidi Management Ltd. and is the Chief Executive Officer of all the\nentities listed above. The principal business address of each of the above entities and of Mr. Davidi is c/o FIMI FIVE 2012 Ltd., Electra Tower, 98 Yigal Alon St., Tel Aviv 6789141, Israel.\nSignificant Changes in the Ownership of Major Shareholders\nOn October 2012 two lenders to TAT’s then controlling shareholders, KMN Industries and TAT Industries, filed separate petitions to the court to enforce liens granted to such lenders by each of the\ncontrolling shareholders in certain collateral including KMN Industries’ holdings of an approximately 80% ownership interest in TAT Industries (which in turn owned approximately 43% of TAT's outstanding\nshare capital) and KMN Industries’ direct holdings in TAT (which represented approximately 10% of TAT's outstanding share capital).\nOn December 18, 2012, the court-appointed permanent receivers on behalf of the two lenders mentioned above for the purpose of jointly enforcing the liens granted to such lenders. On March 15, 2013,\nthe receivers of TAT’s shares announced a tender process for the sale of such shares.\nOn August 7, 2013, the court-appointed permanent receivers informed TAT that the FIMI Funds acquired 4,732,351 ordinary shares of TAT constituting 53.8% of TAT’s outstanding share capital as of the\ntransaction date, after receiving all required court approvals and the transfer of the consideration by the FIMI Funds to the receivers.\nOn December 12, 2016, FIMI Funds acquired an additional 522,557 ordinary shares of TAT constituting 5.7% of TAT’s outstanding share capital as of the transaction date.\n59\nMajor Shareholders Voting Rights\nOur major shareholders do not have different voting rights.\nRecord Holders\nBased on a review of the information provided to us by our transfer agent, as of December 31, 2022, there were 32 holders of record of our ordinary shares, of which 29 record holders holding less than\n1.0% of our ordinary shares had registered addresses in the United States. These numbers are not representative of the number of beneficial holders of our shares nor is it representative of where such beneficial\nholders reside since many of these ordinary shares were held by brokers or other nominees including CEDE & Co., the nominee for the Depositary Trust Company (the central depositary for the U.S. brokerage\ncommunity), which held approximately 69% of our outstanding ordinary shares as of such date.\nB.

Memorandum and Articles of Association\nSet out below is a description of certain provisions of our memorandum of association, articles of association and of the Israeli Companies Law related to such provisions. This description is only a\nsummary and does not purport to be complete and is qualified by reference to the full text of the memorandum of association and articles of association, which are incorporated by reference as exhibits to this\nannual report, and to Israeli law.\nPurposes and Objects of the Company\nWe are a public company registered with the Israeli Companies Registry and have been assigned company number 52-0035791. Section 2 of our memorandum of association provides that we were\nestablished for the purpose of engaging in the business of providing services of planning, development, consultation and instruction in the electronics field. In addition, the purpose of our company is to perform\nvarious corporate activities permissible under Israeli law.\nOn February 1, 2000, the Israeli Companies Law came into effect and superseded most of the provisions of the Israeli Companies Ordinance (New Version), 5743-1983, except for certain provisions\nwhich relate to liens, bankruptcy, dissolution and liquidation of companies. Under the Israeli Companies Law, various provisions, some of which are detailed below, overrule the current provisions of our articles of\nassociation.\nPowers of the Directors\nUnder the provisions of the Israeli Companies Law which prevails over our articles of association in certain issues, a director cannot participate in a meeting nor vote on a proposal, arrangement or\ncontract in which he or she is materially interested except in cases where a majority of the directors are materially interested in the same transaction. In addition, our directors cannot vote on compensation to\nthemselves without the approval of our compensation committee and our shareholders at a general meeting, except for certain cases in which there is no need for the approval of the general meeting in accordance\nwith the regulations promulgated under the Israeli Companies Law. See Item 6. “Directors, Senior Management and Employees – Board Practices – Approval of Related Party Transactions Under Israeli Law.”\nThe authority of our directors to enter into borrowing arrangements on our behalf is not limited, except in the same manner as any other transaction by us.\nOur articles of association do not impose any mandatory retirement or age-limit requirements on our directors and our directors are not required to own shares in our company in order to qualify to serve\nas directors.\n62\nRights Attached to Shares\nOur authorized share capital consists of 13,000,000 ordinary shares of a nominal value of NIS 0.90 each. All outstanding ordinary shares are validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable.\nPlease refer to Exhibit 2.1 for Items 10.B.3, B.4, B.5, B.6, B.7, B.8, B.9 and B.10.\nC. Exchange Controls\nIsraeli law and regulations do not impose any material foreign exchange restrictions on non-Israeli holders of our ordinary shares. In May 1998, a new “general permit” was issued under the Israeli\nCurrency Control Law, 1978, which removed most of the restrictions that previously existed under such law, and enabled Israeli citizens to freely invest outside of Israel and freely convert Israeli currency into\nnon-Israeli currencies.\nNon-residents of Israel who purchase our ordinary shares will be able to convert dividends, if any, thereon, and any amounts payable upon our dissolution, liquidation or winding up, as well as the\nproceeds of any sale in Israel of our ordinary shares to an Israeli resident, into freely-repatriable dollars, at the exchange rate prevailing at the time of conversion, provided that the Israeli income tax has been\nwithheld (or paid) with respect to such amounts or an exemption has been obtained.\nD. Taxation\nThe following is a discussion of Israeli and United States tax consequences material to our shareholders. To the extent that the discussion is based on new tax legislation which has not been subject to\njudicial or administrative interpretation, the views expressed in the discussion might not be accepted by the tax authorities in question. The discussion is not intended, and should not be construed, as legal or\nprofessional tax advice and does not exhaust all possible tax considerations.\nYou are urged to consult your own tax advisor as to the Israeli, United States and other tax consequences of the purchase, ownership and disposition of our ordinary shares, including, in particular, the effect of any\nnon-Israeli, state or local taxes.\nIsraeli Tax Considerations\nThe following is a summary of the principal Israeli tax laws applicable to us, of the Israeli Government programs from which we benefit and of the Income Tax Law (Inflationary Adjustments), 1985. This\nsection also contains a discussion of material Israeli tax consequences to our shareholders who are not residents or citizens of Israel. This summary does not discuss all aspects of Israeli tax law that may be\nrelevant to a particular investor in light of his or her personal investment circumstances, or to some types of investors subject to special treatment under Israeli law. Examples of investors subject to special\ntreatment under Israeli law include residents of Israel, traders in securities, or persons who own, directly or indirectly, 10% or more of our outstanding voting capital, all of whom are subject to special tax regimes\nnot covered in this discussion. Some parts of this discussion are based on new tax legislation that has not been subject to judicial or administrative interpretation. The discussion should not be construed as legal or\nprofessional tax advice and does not cover all possible tax consequences.\nGeneral Corporate Tax Structure\nIsraeli companies are generally subject to corporate tax on their taxable income at the rate of 23% in 2018 and thereafter. However, the effective tax rate payable by a company that derives income from an\nApproved Enterprise, a Benefited Enterprise, a Preferred Enterprise or a Technology Enterprise may be considerably less. Capital Gain derived by an Israeli resident company and / or royalties for which no tax\nclearance has been obtained from the ITA are subject to tax at the regular corporate tax rate (23% in 2018 and thereafter).\n63\nTax Benefits under the Law for the Encouragement of Capital Investments, 1959\nWe have one capital investment program that has been granted “Approved Enterprise” status under the “Investment Law”, and one program that qualify as a “Benefited Enterprise” pursuant to an\namendment to the Investment Law that came into effect on April 1, 2005 (the “April 2005 amendment”). These programs were waived as part of the \"Preferred Enterprise\" which is part of the \"2011 Amendment\".\nPrior to the April 2005 amendment, the Investment Law provided that capital investments in a production facility (or other eligible assets), may be designated as an Approved Enterprise upon prior\napproval from the Investment Center of the Israel Ministry of Industry, Trade and Labor (the “Investment Center”).\nThe April 2005 amendment revised the criteria for investments qualified to receive tax benefits. An eligible investment program under that amendment provided for benefits as a Benefited Enterprise\n(rather than the previous terminology of Approved Enterprise). Among other things, the April 2005 amendment provided tax benefits to both local and foreign investors. Companies that meet the specified criteria\nreceived the tax benefits without need for prior approval and instead, a company was to claim the tax benefits offered by the Investment Law directly in its tax returns.\nThe period of tax benefits for the then new beneficiary enterprise commences in the year that is the later of: (i) the year in which taxable income is first generated by a company, or (ii) a year selected by\nthe company for commencement, on the condition that the company meets certain provisions provided by the Investment Law. The amendment does not apply to investment programs approved prior to December\n31, 2004 and applies only to new investment programs. We began to generate income under the provision of the new amendment as of the beginning of 2006.\nAfter expiration of the initial tax exemption period, the company is eligible for what was considered then a reduced corporate tax rate of 10% to 25%, depending on the extent of foreign investment in the\ncompany, for the following five to eight years, depending on the geographic location of the Benefited Enterprise within Israel. The benefits period was limited to 12 years from completion of the investment under\nthe approved plan or 14 years from the date of the approval, whichever is earlier. A company in which more than 25% of the shareholders are non-residents of Israel, defined under the Investment Law as a Foreign\nInvestors Company, may be eligible for benefits for an extended period of up to ten years.\nIn addition, pursuant to a recent amendment of the Law, any distribution of dividend as of August 15, 2021 will be prorated between exempt income and taxable income. As such, upon dividend\ndistribution, in case the company has accumulated exempt income, the company will be obligated to pay the corporate income tax it was exempted from with respect to the exempt profits portion. Distribution of\ndividends derived from Approved Enterprise and Benefited Enterprise income that was taxed at reduced rates, but not tax exempt, does not result in additional tax consequences to the company. Shareholders who\nreceive dividends derived from approved enterprise and Benefited Enterprise income were generally taxed at a rate of 15% which was withheld and paid by the company paying the dividend if the dividend was\ndistributed during the benefits period or within the following 12 years.\nThe benefits available to an Approved Enterprise and Benefited Enterprise were conditioned upon terms stipulated in the Investment Law and the related regulations (which include making specified\ninvestments in property and equipment, and financing a percentage of these investments with share capital), and, for an Approved Enterprise, the conditions contained in the certificate of approval from the\nInvestment Center. If we do not fulfill these conditions, in whole or in part, the benefits can be cancelled and we may be required to refund the amount of the benefits, linked to the CPI in Israel plus interest. We\nbelieve that our Approved Enterprise and Benefited Enterprise programs were operated in compliance with all applicable conditions and criteria.\nWe had derived a material portion of our operating income from our Approved Enterprise and Benefited Enterprise facilities. We were therefore eligible for a tax exemption for a limited period on\nundistributed Approved Enterprise and Benefited Enterprise income. We intend to reinvest the entire amount of our tax-exempt income and not to distribute this income as a dividend\nUntil December 31, 2010, TAT and Turbochrome have elected to participate in the alternative package of tax benefits for their Approved and Benefited Enterprise under the law.\nPursuant to such Law, the income derived from those enterprises was exempted from Israeli corporate tax for a specified benefit period (except to the extent that dividends are distributed during the tax-\nexemption period other than upon liquidation) and subject to reduced corporate tax rates for an additional period.\n64\nTax Benefits under the 2011 Amendment\nUnder the transitional provisions of the 2011 Amendment, the company elected to irrevocably implement the 2011 Amendment with respect to its existing Approved and Beneficiary Enterprises while\nwaiving benefits provided under the legislation prior to the 2011 Amendment.\nDividends paid out of income attributed to a Preferred Enterprise will be subject to a withholding tax at the source at the rate of 20%, or such lower rate as may be provided in an applicable tax treaty.\nHowever, if such dividends are paid to an Israeli company, no tax is required to be withheld (although, if the funds are subsequently distributed to individuals or to non-Israeli residents (individuals and\ncorporations), the withholding tax would apply).\nAs of January 1, 2014, a Preferred Company is entitled to a reduced corporate tax rate of 16% with respect to its income derived from its Preferred Enterprise, unless the Preferred Enterprise is located in\ndevelopment area A, in which case the tax rate as of January 1, 2017 was 7.5% (our operations are currently not located in development area A). Income which is not derived from Preferred Enterprise is subject to\nthe regular corporate tax rate (24% in tax year 2017 and 23% as of January 1, 2018).\nTAT is located in an area in Israel that is designated as elsewhere and as such is entitled to reduce tax rates of 16% (as of 2014).\nTurbochrome is located in an area in Israel that is designated as Zone A and as such entitled to reduce tax rates of 7.5% (as of 2017).\nTax Benefits under the 2017 Amendment\nAn amendment to the Investment Law, which became effective as of January 1, 2017, provides new tax benefit to Preferred companies for two types of \"Technology Enterprise\", as described below, and is\nin addition to the other existing tax beneficial programs under the Investment Law.\nThe new incentives regime will apply to \"Preferred Technological Enterprises\" that meet certain conditions, as detailed in the 2017 amendment. Preferred Technological Enterprises will be subject to a\ncorporate tax rate of 12% unless the Preferred Technological Enterprise is located in development zone A, in which case the rate will be 7.5% with respect to the portion of income derived from intellectual\nproperty developed in Israel. The withholding tax on dividends from income derived from intellectual property of the Preferred Technological Enterprises will be 4% for dividends paid to a foreign parent company\nholding at least 90% of the shares of the distributing company. For other dividend distributions, the withholding tax rate will be 20% (or a lower rate under a tax treaty, if applicable).\nWe cannot assure you that we will continue to qualify as an Industrial Company or that the benefits described above will be available to us in the future.\nTax Benefits and Grants for Research and Development\nIsraeli tax law allows, under specific conditions, a tax deduction in the year incurred for expenditures, including capital expenditures, relating to scientific research and development projects, if the\nexpenditures are approved by the relevant Israeli government ministry, determined by the field of research, and the research and development is for the promotion of the company and is carried out by or on behalf\nof the company seeking such deduction. Expenditures not so approved are deductible over a three-year period. However, expenditures from proceeds made available to us through government grants are not\ndeductible according to Israeli law.\n65\nTax Benefits under the Law for the Encouragement of Industry (Taxes), 1969\nAccording to the Law for the Encouragement of Industry (Taxes), 1969 (the “Industry Encouragement Law”), an ‘Industrial Company’ is an Israeli resident company, with at least 90% of the income of\nwhich, in a given tax year, (exclusive of income from some government loans) is derived from an Industrial Enterprise owned by it and located in Israel or in the \"Area\", in accordance with the definition in the\nsection 3a of the Ordinance. An ‘Industrial Enterprise‘ is defined as an enterprise whose major activity in a given tax year is industrial production activity.\nUnder the Industry Encouragement Law, Industrial Companies are entitled to the following tax benefits:\n• Amortization of purchases of acquired technology and patents over an eight-year period for tax purposes;\n• Amortization of specified expenses incurred in connection with a public issuance of securities over a three-year period for tax purposes;\n• Right to elect, under specified conditions, to file a consolidated tax return with additional related Israeli Industrial Companies; and\n• Accelerated depreciation rates on equipment and buildings.\nEligibility for benefits under the Industry Encouragement Law is not subject to receipt of prior approval from any governmental authority.\nSpecial Provisions Relating to Taxation under Inflationary Conditions\nThe Income Tax Law (Inflationary Adjustments), 1985, referred to as the Inflationary Adjustments Law, attempts to overcome the problems presented to a traditional tax system by an economy\nundergoing rapid inflation. The Inflationary Adjustments Law is highly complex.\nOn February 26, 2008, the Israeli Parliament (the Knesset) enacted the Income Tax Law (Inflationary Adjustments) (Amendment No. 20) (Restriction of Effective Period), 2008 (the “Inflationary\nAdjustments Amendment”). In accordance with the Inflationary Adjustments Amendment, as of the 2008 tax year the provisions of the law are no longer apply, other than the transitional provisions intended at\npreventing distortions in the tax calculations. In accordance with the Inflationary Adjustments Amendment, commencing the 2008 tax year, income for tax purposes is no longer be adjusted to a real (net of\ninflation) measurement basis. Furthermore, the depreciation of inflation immune assets and carried forward tax losses are no longer linked to the CPI in Israel.\n66\nTaxation of Dividends Paid on our Ordinary Shares\nTaxation of Israeli Shareholders\nA distribution of dividends from income, which is not attributed to an Approved Enterprise/ Benefited Enterprise/ Preferred Enterprise to an Israeli resident individual, will generally be subject to Israeli\nincome tax, at the rate of 25%, or 30% for a recipient that is a \"Controlling Shareholder\" (within the meaning of the Israeli Income Tax Ordinance) at the time of distribution or at any time during the 12-month\nperiod preceding such distribution.\nHowever, dividends distributed from taxable income accrued during the benefits period of a Benefited Enterprise, subject to certain time limitations, are generally subject to Israeli income tax at the\nreduced rate of 15%. Dividends paid out of income attributed to a Preferred Enterprise are generally subject to Israeli income tax at the source at the rate of 20%.\n.\nGenerally, Israeli resident corporations are exempt from Israeli corporate tax on the receipt of dividends paid on shares of Israeli resident corporations and that the dividends were fully taxed at the\ncorporate tax rate in Israel, unless the dividends are distributed from taxable income that has accrued during the benefits period of Approved Enterprise of Benefited Enterprise, in which case they are taxable at the\nrate of 15%.\n3% surtax will apply with respect to individuals on top of the aforementioned tax rates when annual taxable income exceeds NIS 663,240 (with respect to 2022). The amount is updated every year.\nIt should be noted that we cannot assure you that we will designate the profits that are being distributed in a way that will reduce shareholders’ tax liability to those tax rates.\nTaxation of Non-Israeli Shareholders\nThe Ordinance generally provides that a non-Israeli resident (either individual or corporation) is subject to, an Israeli income tax at the rate of 25%, or 30% if the recipient is a \"Controlling Shareholder\" at\nthe time of distribution or at any time during the 12-month period preceding such distribution, unless a different rate is provided in a treaty between Israel and the shareholder’s country of residence.\nAs aforesaid, dividends derived from any of our income generated by an Approved Enterprise or Benefited Enterprise, are subject to withholding tax at a rate of 15% (or less based on applicable tax\ntreaty), and dividends derived from any of our income generated by a Preferred Enterprise are subject to withholding tax at a rate of 20% (or less based on applicable tax treaty).\nIt should be noted that 3% surtax will apply on individuals on top of the aforementioned tax rates when annual taxable income exceeds NIS 663,240 (with respect to 2022). The amount is updated every\nyear.\nUnder the United States-Israel Tax Treaty, the maximum rate of tax withheld at source in Israel on dividends paid to a holder of our ordinary shares who is a U.S. resident (for purposes of the United\nStates-Israel Tax Treaty) is 25%. However, generally the maximum rate of withholding tax on dividends, not generated by Approved / Benefited / Preferred Enterprises, that are paid to a U.S. corporation holding\nat least 10% or more of our outstanding voting capital from the start of the tax year preceding the distribution of the dividend through (and including) the distribution of the dividends, is 12.5%, provided that no\nmore than 25% of our gross income of such preceding year consists of certain types of dividends and interest if a certificate for a reduced withholding tax rate is obtained in advance from the Israeli Tax Authority.\nNotwithstanding the foregoing, dividends distributed from income attributed to an Approved Enterprise, Benefited Enterprise or a Preferred Enterprise are subject to withholding tax rate of 15% for such a U.S.\ncorporation shareholder, provided that the condition related to our gross income for the previous year (as set forth in the previous sentence) is met.\nThe aforementioned rates under the United States-Israel Tax Treaty will not apply if the dividend income was derived through a permanent establishment of the U.S. resident in Israel.\nWhen the amount of tax due is not fully withheld at source, such non-Israeli resident is obligated to file a tax return, report his or her Israeli income and pay the balance of the amount of tax due.\n67\nCapital gains taxes applicable to non-Israeli shareholders\nCapital gains from the sale of our ordinary shares by non-Israeli shareholders are exempt from Israeli taxation, provided that the capital gain is not derived from a permanent establishment in Israel\naccording to section 97(b2) to the Israeli income tax ordinance. In addition, the U.S.-Israel Tax Treaty exempts U.S. residents who hold less than 10% of our voting rights, and who held less than 10% of our voting\nrights during the 12 months prior to a sale of their shares, from Israeli capital gains tax in connection with such sale.\nUnited States Federal Income Tax Consequences\nThe following discussion summarizes the material U.S. federal income tax considerations generally applicable to the purchase, ownership and disposition of our ordinary shares. Unless otherwise stated,\nthis summary deals only with shareholders that are U.S. Holders (as defined below) who hold their ordinary shares as capital assets.\nAs used in this section, the term “U.S. Holder” means a beneficial owner of an ordinary share who is:\n• An individual citizen or resident of the United States or an individual treated as a U.S. citizen or resident for U.S. federal income tax purposes;\n• A corporation or other entity taxable as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes created or organized in or under the laws of the United States, any State or the District of Columbia;\n• An estate, the income of which is subject to U.S. federal income taxation regardless of its source; or\n• Any trust if (A)(i) a court within the United States is able to exercise primary supervision over the administration of the trust and (ii) one or more United States persons have the authority to control\nall substantial decisions of the trust, or (B) such trust validly elects to be treated as a United States person.\nThe term “Non-U.S. Holder” means a beneficial owner of an ordinary share that is an individual, corporation, estate or trust and is not a U.S. Holder. The tax consequences to a Non-U.S. Holder may\ndiffer substantially from the tax consequences to a U.S. Holder. Certain aspects of U.S. federal income tax relevant to a Non-U.S. Holder are discussed below.\nThis description is based on provisions of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”), existing and proposed U.S. Treasury regulations promulgated thereunder, administrative and\njudicial interpretations thereof, and the U.S.-Israel Tax Treaty, each as in effect as of the date of this annual report. In addition, this description also relates to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (“TCJA”) signed into law on\nDecember 22, 2017. These sources may change, possibly with retroactive effect, and are open to differing interpretations. This description does not discuss all aspects of U.S. federal income taxation that may be\napplicable to investors in light of their particular circumstances or to investors who are subject to special treatment under U.S. federal income tax law, including:\n• Insurance companies;\n• Dealers in stocks, securities or currencies;\n• Financial institutions and financial services entities;\n• Real estate investment trusts;\n• Regulated investment companies;\n• Persons that receive ordinary shares in connection with the performance of services;\n• Tax-exempt organizations;\n• Persons that hold ordinary shares as part of a straddle or appreciated financial position or as part of a hedging, conversion or other integrated instrument;\n• Persons who hold the ordinary shares through partnerships or other pass-through entities;\n• Individual retirement and other tax-deferred accounts;\n• Expatriates of the United States and certain former long-term residents of the United States;\n• Persons liable for the alternative minimum tax;\n• Persons having a “functional currency” other than the U.S. dollar; and\n• Direct, indirect or constructive owners of 10% or more, by voting power or value, of our company.\n68\nIf a partnership or an entity treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes owns ordinary shares, the U.S. federal income tax treatment of a partner in such a partnership will generally\ndepend upon the status of the partner and the activities of the partnership. A partnership that owns ordinary shares and the partners in such partnership should consult their own tax advisors about the U.S. federal\nincome tax consequences of holding and disposing of ordinary shares.\nThis discussion does not consider the possible application of U.S. federal gift or estate tax or alternative minimum tax.\nAll investors are urged to consult their own tax advisors as to the particular tax consequences to them of an investment in our ordinary shares, including the effect and applicability of United States\nfederal, state, local and foreign income and other tax laws (including estate and gift tax laws) and tax treaties.\nDistributions Paid on the Ordinary Shares\nSubject to the discussion below under “Passive Foreign Investment Company Considerations,” a U.S. Holder generally will be required to include in his or her gross income as ordinary dividend income\nthe amount of any distributions paid on the ordinary shares, including the amount of any Israeli taxes withheld, to the extent that those distributions are paid out of our current or accumulated earnings and profits,\nas determined for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Subject to the discussion below under “Passive Foreign Investment Company Considerations,” distributions in excess of our earnings and profits will be applied\nagainst and will reduce the U.S. Holder’s tax basis in its ordinary shares and, to the extent they exceed that tax basis, will be treated as gain from a sale or exchange of those ordinary shares. In some cases, our\ndividends will not qualify for the dividends-received deduction applicable to U.S. corporations.\nDividends that we pay in NIS, including the amount of any Israeli taxes withheld therefrom, will be included in your income in a U.S. dollar amount calculated by reference to the exchange rate in effect\non the day such dividends are received, regardless of whether the payment is in fact converted into U.S. dollars. A U.S. Holder who receives payment in NIS and converts NIS into U.S. dollars at an exchange rate\nother than the rate in effect on such day will have a foreign currency exchange gain or loss that would be treated as ordinary income or loss. U.S. Holders should consult their own tax advisors concerning the U.S.\ntax consequences of acquiring, holding and disposing of NIS.\nSubject to certain limitations, “qualified dividend income” received by a non-corporate U.S. Holder will generally be subject to taxation in the U.S at a lower rate than ordinary income. Distributions\ntaxable as dividends paid on the ordinary shares should qualify for lower tax rate provided that we are not a passive foreign investment company (as described below) for U.S. tax purposes and that either: (i) we\nare entitled to benefits under the “U.S.-Israel Tax Treaty” or (ii) the ordinary shares are readily tradable on an established securities market in the United States and certain other requirements are met. We believe\nthat we are entitled to benefits under the U.S.-Israel Tax Treaty and that the ordinary shares currently will be readily tradable on an established securities market in the United States. However, no assurance can be\ngiven that the ordinary shares will remain readily tradable. The rate reduction does not apply unless certain holding period requirements are satisfied. With respect to the ordinary shares, the U.S. Holder must have\nheld such shares for at least 61 days during the 121-day period beginning 60 days before the ex-dividend date. The rate reduction also does not apply to dividends received from passive foreign investment\ncompanies, see discussion below, or in respect of certain hedged positions or in certain other situations. The legislation enacting the reduced tax rate contains special rules for computing the foreign tax credit\nlimitation of a taxpayer who receives dividends subject to the reduced tax rate. U.S. Holders of ordinary shares should consult their own tax advisors regarding the effect of these rules in their particular\ncircumstances.\nSubject to the discussion below under “Information Reporting and Back-up Withholding,” a Non-U.S. Holder generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income or withholding tax on dividends received\non ordinary shares unless that income is effectively connected with the conduct by that Non-U.S. Holder of a trade or business in the United States, in which case a corporate Non-U.S. Holder may also be subject\nto the U.S. branch profits tax.\nForeign Tax Credit\nAny dividend income resulting from distributions we pay to a U.S. Holder with respect to the ordinary shares generally may be treated as foreign source income for U.S. foreign tax credit limitation\npurposes. For all taxable years ended until December 31, 2017, and subject to certain conditions and limitations, Israeli tax withheld on dividends may be deducted from taxable income or credited against a U.S.\nHolder’s U.S. federal income tax liability. The limitation on foreign taxes eligible for credit is calculated separately with respect to specific classes of income. For this purpose, in general, any dividend that we\ndistribute should constitute “passive category income,” or, in the case of certain U.S. Holders, “general category income.”\nStarting January 1, 2018, and with respect to our corporate U.S. Holders, the TCJA provides a 100% deduction for the foreign-source portion of dividends received after January 1, 2018 from “specified\n10-percent owned foreign corporations” by U.S. corporate holders, subject to a one-year holding period. No foreign tax credit, including Israeli withholding tax (or deduction for foreign taxes paid with respect to\nqualifying dividends) would be permitted for foreign taxes paid or accrued with respect to a qualifying dividend. Deduction would be unavailable for “hybrid dividends.” The dividend received deduction enacted\nunder the TCJA may not apply to dividends from a passive foreign investment company.\nThe rules relating to the determination of foreign source income and the foreign tax credit are complex, and the availability of a foreign tax credit depends on numerous factors. Each investor who is a\nU.S. Holder should consult with its own tax advisor to determine whether its income with respect to the ordinary shares would be foreign source income and whether and to what extent that investor would be\nentitled to a foreign tax credit.\n69\nDisposition of Ordinary Shares\nUpon the sale or other disposition of ordinary shares, subject to the discussion below under “Passive Foreign Investment Company Considerations,” a U.S. Holder generally should recognize capital gain\nor loss equal to the difference between the amount realized on the disposition and the holder’s adjusted tax basis in the ordinary shares. U.S. Holders should consult their own tax advisors with respect to the tax\nconsequences of the receipt of a currency other than U.S. dollars upon such sale or other disposition.\nGain or loss upon the disposition of the ordinary shares will be treated as long-term if, at the time of the sale or disposition, the ordinary shares were held for more than one year. The deductibility of\ncapital losses by a U.S. Holder is subject to limitations. In general, any gain or loss recognized by a U.S. Holder on the sale or other disposition of ordinary shares will be U.S. source income or loss for U.S.\nforeign tax credit purposes. U.S. Holders should consult their own tax advisors concerning the source of income for U.S. foreign tax credit purposes and the effect of the U.S.-Israel Tax Treaty on the source of\nincome.\nSubject to the discussion below under “Information Reporting and Back-up Withholding,” a Non-U.S. Holder generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income or withholding tax on any gain realized\non the sale or exchange of ordinary shares unless:\n• that gain is effectively connected with the conduct by the Non-U.S. Holder of a trade or business in the United States, and, if a tax treaty applies, is attributable to a permanent establishment or fixed\nbase of the Non-U.S. Holder in the United States; or\n• in the case of any gain realized by an individual Non-U.S. Holder, that holder is present in the United States for 183 days or more in the taxable year of the sale or exchange, and other conditions are\nmet.\nPassive Foreign Investment Company Considerations\nSpecial U.S. federal income tax rules apply to U.S. Holders owning shares of a passive foreign investment company. A non-U.S. corporation will be considered a passive foreign investment company for\nany taxable year in which, after applying certain look-through rules, 75% or more of its gross income consists of specified types of passive income, or 50% or more of the average value of its assets consists of\nassets that produce, or are held for the production of, passive income. For this purpose, passive income may include dividends, interest, royalties, rents, annuities and the excess of gains over losses from the\ndisposition of assets which produce passive income.\nIf we were classified as a passive foreign investment company, a U.S. Holder could be subject to increased tax liability upon the sale or other disposition of ordinary shares or upon the receipt of amounts\ntreated as “excess distributions.” Under these rules, the excess distribution and any gain would be allocated ratably over the U.S. Holder’s holding period for the ordinary shares, and the amount allocated to the\ncurrent taxable year and any taxable year prior to the first taxable year in which we were a passive foreign investment company would be taxed as ordinary income. The amount allocated to each of the other\ntaxable years would be subject to tax at the highest marginal tax rate in effect for the applicable class of taxpayer for that year, and an interest charge for the deemed deferral benefit would be imposed on the\nresulting tax allocated to such other taxable years. The tax liability with respect to the amount allocated to years prior to the year of the disposition, or “excess distribution,” cannot be offset by any net operating\nlosses. In addition, holders of shares in a passive foreign investment company may not receive a “step-up” in basis on shares acquired from a decedent. If we are a passive foreign investment company in any year,\na U.S. Holder would be required to file an annual return on IRS Form 8621 regarding distributions received with respect to ordinary shares and any gain realized on the disposition of ordinary shares.\nBased on our current and projected income, assets and activities, we do not believe that we will be a passive foreign investment company for our current taxable year. However, because the determination\nof whether we are a passive foreign investment company is based upon the composition of our income and assets from time to time, we cannot be certain that we will not be considered a passive foreign investment\ncompany for the current taxable year or any future taxable year.\nThe passive foreign investment company tax consequences described above will not apply to a U.S. Holder if the U.S. Holder makes a timely election to treat us as a qualified electing fund (“QEF”). If a\nU.S. Holder makes a timely QEF election, the U.S. Holder would be required to include in income for each taxable year its pro rata share of our ordinary earnings as ordinary income and its pro rata share of our\nnet capital gain as long-term capital gain, whether or not such amounts are actually distributed to the U.S. Holder. However, a U.S. Holder would not be eligible to make a QEF election unless we comply with\ncertain applicable information reporting requirements. We will provide U.S. Holders with the information needed to report income and gain under a QEF election should we become a passive foreign investment\ncompany.\n70\nAs an alternative to making a QEF election, a U.S. Holder of passive foreign investment company stock which is publicly traded may in certain circumstances avoid certain of the tax consequences\ngenerally applicable to holders of a passive foreign investment company by electing to mark the stock to market annually and recognizing as ordinary income or loss each year an amount equal to the difference as\nof the close of the taxable year between the fair market value of the passive foreign investment company stock and the U.S. Holder’s adjusted tax basis in the passive foreign investment company stock. Losses\nwould be allowed only to the extent of net mark-to-market gain previously included by the U.S. Holder under the election for prior taxable years. Income recognized and deductions allowed under the mark-to-\nmarket provisions, as well as any gain or loss on the disposition of ordinary shares with respect to which the mark-to-market election is made, are generally treated as ordinary income or loss (except that loss is\ntreated as capital loss to the extent the loss exceeds the net mark-to-market gains, if any, that a U.S. Holder included in its income with respect to such ordinary shares in prior years). However, gain or loss from\nthe disposition of ordinary shares (as to which a “mark-to-market” election was made) in a year in which we are no longer a passive foreign investment company, will be capital gain or loss. The mark-to-market\nelection is available for so long as our ordinary shares constitute “marketable stock,” which includes stock of a passive foreign investment company that is “regularly traded” on a “qualified exchange or other\nmarket.” Generally, a “qualified exchange or other market” includes a national securities exchange that is registered with the SEC or the national market system established pursuant to Section 11A of the\nSecurities Exchange Act of 1934. A class of stock that is traded on one or more qualified exchanges or other markets is “regularly traded” on an exchange or market for any calendar year during which that class of\nstock is traded, other than in the minimized quantities, on at least 15 days during each calendar quarter. We believe that NASDAQ will constitute a qualified exchange or other market for this purpose. However,\nwe cannot be certain that our ordinary shares will continue to trade on NASDAQ or that the ordinary shares will be regularly traded for this purpose.\nThe rules applicable to owning shares of a passive foreign investment company are complex, and each holder who is a U.S. Holder should consult with its own tax advisor regarding the consequences of\ninvesting in a passive foreign investment company.\nMedicare Tax\nCertain U.S. Holders that are individuals, estates or trusts may be subject to a 3.8% Net Investment Income tax on all or a portion of their “net investment income,” which may include all or a portion of\ntheir dividend income and net gains from the disposition of ordinary shares and warrants. Each U.S. Holder that is an individual, estate or trust is urged to consult its tax advisors regarding the applicability of the\nNet Investment Income tax to its income and gains in respect of its investment in our ordinary shares and warrants, including with respect to the eligibility to claim foreign tax credit against such tax.\nInformation Reporting and Backup Withholding\nPayments in respect of ordinary shares may be subject to information reporting to the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (the “IRS”) and to U.S. backup withholding tax at a rate equal to the fourth lowest\nincome tax rate applicable to individuals (which, under current law, is 24%). Backup withholding will not apply, however, if you (i) are a corporation or come within certain exempt categories, and demonstrate the\nfact when so required, or (ii) furnish a correct taxpayer identification number and make any other required certification. U.S. Holders who are required to establish their exempt status generally must provide such\ncertification on IRS Form W-9.\nBackup withholding is not an additional tax. Amounts withheld under the backup withholding rules may be credited against a U.S. Holder’s U.S. tax liability, and a U.S. Holder may obtain a refund of any\nexcess amounts withheld under the backup withholding rules by filing the appropriate claim for refund with the IRS.\nAny U.S. holder who holds 10% or more in vote or value of our ordinary shares will be subject to certain additional United States information reporting requirements.\nU.S. Gift and Estate Tax\nAn individual U.S. Holder of ordinary shares will generally be subject to U.S. gift and estate taxes with respect to ordinary shares in the same manner and to the same extent as with respect to other types\nof personal property.\nE. Dividends and Paying Agents\nNot applicable.\nF. Statement by Experts\nNot applicable.\nG. Documents on Display\nWe are subject to the reporting requirements of the United States Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, as applicable to “foreign private issuers” as defined in Rule 3b-4 under the Exchange Act,\nand in accordance therewith, we file annual and interim reports and other information with the SEC.\n71\nAs a foreign private issuer, we are exempt from certain provisions of the Exchange Act. Accordingly, our proxy solicitations are not subject to the disclosure and procedural requirements of Regulation\n14A under the Exchange Act and transactions in our equity securities by our officers and directors are exempt from reporting and the “short-swing” profit recovery provisions contained in Section 16 of the\nExchange Act. In addition, we are not required under the Exchange Act to file periodic reports and financial statements as frequently or as promptly as United States companies whose securities are registered\nunder the Exchange Act. However, we make available on our website www.tat-technologies.com, our annual audited financial statements, which have been examined and reported on, with an opinion expressed by\nan independent public accounting firm, and we intend to file reports with the SEC on Form 6-K containing unaudited financial information for the first three quarters of each fiscal year.\nThis annual report on Form 20-F and the exhibits thereto and any other document we file pursuant to the Exchange Act may be inspected without charge and copied at prescribed rates at the following\nSEC public reference room at 100 F Street, N.E., Room 1580, Washington, D.C. 20549; and on the SEC website (http://www.sec.gov) and on our website www.tat-technologies.com. You may obtain information\non the operation of the SEC’s public reference room in Washington, D.C. by calling the SEC at 1-800-SEC-0330. The Exchange Act file number for our SEC filings is 0-16050.\nIn addition, since August 16, 2005, we are also listed on the TASE. From such date we submit copies of all our filings with the SEC to the ISA and TASE. Such copies can be retrieved electronically\nthrough the TASE internet messaging system (www.maya.tase.co.il) and, in addition, through the MAGNA distribution site of the ISA (www.magna.isa.gov.il).\nThe documents concerning our company which are referred to in this annual report may also be inspected at our offices located at Re’em Industrial Park Neta, Boulevard Bnei Ayish, Gedera, Israel.\nH. Subsidiary Information\nNot applicable.\nItem 11. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk\nWe do not own and have not issued any market risk sensitive instruments about which disclosure is required to be provided pursuant to this Item.\nEffects of Currency Exchange Fluctuations\nOur financial statements are stated in dollars, while a portion of our expenses, primarily labor expenses, is incurred in NIS and a part of our revenues are quoted in NIS. Additionally, certain assets, as well\nas a portion of our liabilities, are denominated in NIS. As a result, our operations may be affected by fluctuations of the U.S. dollar/NIS exchange rate. We are hedging a portion of our exchange rate risk through\nforward transactions and the use of other derivative instruments.\nItem 12. Description of Securities Other than Equity Securities\nNot Applicable.\n72\nPART II\nItem 13. Defaults, Dividend Arrearages and Delinquencies\nNone.\nItem 14. Material Modifications to the Rights of Security Holders\nNone.\nItem 15. Controls and Procedures\n(a) Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nWe maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our Exchange Act reports is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within\nthe time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our chief executive officer and chief financial officer to allow timely decisions regarding\nrequired disclosure. Our management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, conducted an evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined under Exchange Act Rule\n13a-15(e), as of the end of the period covered by this annual report on Form 20-F. Based upon that evaluation, our chief executive officer and chief financial officer have concluded that, as of such date, our\ndisclosure controls and procedures were effective.\n(b) Management's Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over our financial reporting. Internal control over financial reporting is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) or 15d-15(f)\npromulgated under the Exchange Act as a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the company’s principal executive and principal financial officers and effected by the company’s board of directors,\nmanagement and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally\naccepted accounting principles and includes those policies and procedures that:\n• Pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company;\n• Provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts\nand expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and\n• Provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use of disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial\nstatements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk\nthat controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nOur management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022. In making this assessment, our management used the criteria set forth by the\nCommittee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013). Based on that assessment, our management concluded that as of December 31,\n2022, our internal control over financial reporting is effective.\n73\n(c) Attestation report of independent registered public accounting firm\nThis annual report does not include an attestation report of our independent registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial report. Management’s report was not subject to\nattestation by our independent registered public accounting firm pursuant to rules of the SEC that permit us to provide only management’s report in this annual report.\n(d) Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nThere was no change in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the period covered by this annual report that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect,\nour internal control over financial reporting.\nItem 16. [Reserved]\nItem 16A. Audit Committee Financial Expert\nOur board of directors has determined that each member of our audit committee each of whom also qualifies as independent director, meets the definition of an audit committee financial expert, as defined\nby rules of the SEC. For a brief listing of the relevant experience of the member of our audit committee, see Item 6.A. “Directors, Senior Management and Employees — Directors and Senior Management.”\nItem 16B. Code of Ethics\nWe have adopted a code of ethics that applies to our chief executive officer and all senior financial officers of our company, including the chief financial officer, chief accounting officer or controller, or\npersons performing similar functions. The code of ethics is publicly available on our website at www.tat-technologies.com. Written copies are available upon request. If we make any substantive amendment to the\ncode of ethics or grant any waivers, including any implicit waiver, from a provision of the codes of ethics, we will disclose the nature of such amendment or waiver on our website.\nItem 16C. Principal Accountant Fees and Services\nFees Paid to Independent Public Accountant\nThe following table sets forth, for each of the years indicated, the fees paid to our principal independent registered public accounting firm. All of such fees were pre-approved by our audit committee.\nYear Ended December 31,\nServices Rendered 2022 2021\nAudit (1) $ 248,524 $ 192,834\nTax (2) 23,262 17,685\nTotal $ 271,786 $ 210,519\n(1) Audit fees are for audit services for each of the years shown in the table, including fees associated with the annual audit and reviews of our quarterly financial results, consultations on\nvarious accounting issues and audit services provided in connection with other statutory or regulatory filings.\n(2) Tax fees relate to professional services rendered for tax compliance and tax advice. These services include assistance regarding international and Israeli taxation.\n74\nPre-Approval Policies and Procedures\nOur audit committee has adopted a policy and procedures for the pre-approval of audit and non-audit services rendered by our independent registered public accounting firm Kesselman & Kesselman, a\nmember of PricewaterhouseCoopers International Ltd. Pre-approval of an audit or non-audit service may be given as a general pre-approval, as part of the audit committee’s approval of the scope of the\nengagement of our independent auditor, or on an individual basis. Any proposed services exceeding general pre-approved levels also require specific pre-approval by our audit committee. The policy prohibits\nretention of the independent public accountants to perform the prohibited non-audit functions defined in Section 201 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act or the rules of the SEC, and also requires the audit committee to\nconsider whether proposed services are compatible with the independence of the public accountants.\nItem 16D. Exemptions from the Listing Standards for Audit Committee\nNot Applicable.\nItem 16E. Purchase of Equity Securities By The Issuer and Affiliated Purchasers\nNot Applicable.\nItem 16F. Change in Registrant’s Certifying Accountant.\nNot Applicable.\nItem 16G. Corporate Governance\nThe following are the significant ways in which our corporate governance practices differ from those followed by United States companies under Nasdaq rules:\nShareholder Approval. Although Nasdaq rules generally require shareholder approval of equity compensation plans and material amendments thereto, we follow Israeli Companies Law, which is to have\nsuch plans and amendments approved only by the board of directors, unless such arrangements are for the compensation of directors, Chief Executive Officer or a transaction with the controlling shareholder, in\nwhich case they also require the approval of the compensation committee and the shareholders.\nIn addition, rather than follow Nasdaq rules requiring shareholder approval for the issuance of securities in certain circumstances, we follow Israeli law, under which a private placement of securities\nrequires approval by our board of directors and shareholders if it will cause a person to become a controlling shareholder (generally presumed at 25% ownership) or if:\no The securities issued amount to 20% or more of our outstanding voting rights before the issuance;\no Some or all of the consideration is other than cash or listed securities or the transaction is not in accordance with market terms; and\no The transaction will increase the relative holdings of a shareholder that holds 5% or more of our outstanding share capital or voting rights or that it will cause any person to become, as a result of the\nissuance, a holder of more than 5% of our outstanding share capital or voting rights.\nAnnual Reports. While NASDAQ rules generally require that companies send an annual report to shareholders prior to the annual general meeting, we follow the generally accepted business practice for\ncompanies in Israel. Specifically, we file annual reports on Form 20-F, which contain financial statements audited by an independent registered public accounting firm, electronically with the SEC and post a copy\non our website.\n75\nPART III\nItem 17.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2022\nand 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of\nAmerica.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s consolidated financial statements based on our audits.\nWe are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the\nU.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits of these consolidated financial statements in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about\nwhether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control\nover financial reporting. As part of our audits we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the\nCompany's internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.\nOur audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks.\nSuch procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used\nand significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matters\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit\ncommittee and that (i) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication\nof critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate\nopinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\nInventory - Write down of obsolete and unmarketable inventory\nAs described in Notes 2 and 4 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company's consolidated inventory balance was $45,759 thousand as of December 31, 2022. The Company writes down its inventory for\nestimated obsolescence and unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and net realizable value based upon assumptions for future demand and market conditions. Changes in\nthese assumptions could have a significant impact on the inventory's valuation.\nThe principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the write down of obsolete and unmarketable inventory is a critical audit matter were based on the significant judgement\nused by management when determining the assumptions relating to the future demand, market conditions, and sales forecasts. This in turn led to a high degree of auditor judgement, subjectivity and effort in\nperforming procedures and evaluating management's significant assumptions related to future demand and market conditions.\nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included, among\nothers: (i) utilizing historical inventory usage data to analyze the relationship between the inventory impairment calculated, the inventory on hand, and the sales over time; (ii) evaluating management’s ability to\naccurately estimate future demand by comparing actual inventory usage to estimates made in prior years; (iii) comparison of management’s assumptions related to market conditions to available external market\ndata for a sample of inventory items; (iv) evaluating the accuracy of the impairment by selecting a sample of inventory items and evaluating supporting documentation regarding current and historical sales\npatterns; (v) assessing whether management's assumptions related to future demand and market conditions were consistent with evidence obtained in other areas of the audit.\nTel-Aviv, Israel /s/ Kesselman & Kesselman\nMarch 29, 2023 Certified Public Accountants (lsr.)\nA member firm of PricewaterhouseCoopers International Limited\nWe have served as the Company's auditor since 2009.\nF - 3\nTAT TECHNOLOGIES LTD.\nCONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS\nU.S dollars in thousands\nDecember 31,\n2022 2021\nASSETS\nCURRENT ASSETS:\nCash and cash equivalents $ 7,722 $ 12,872\nAccounts receivable, net of allowance for credit losses of $527\nand $389 thousand as of December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021 respectively 15,622 13,887\nOther current assets and prepaid expenses 6,047 4,219\nInventory, net 45,759 41,003\nTotal current assets 75,150 71,981\nNON-CURRENT ASSETS:\nRestricted deposit 304 343\nInvestment in affiliates 1,665 695\nFunds in respect of employee rights upon retirement 780 1,157\nDeferred income taxes 1,229 1,252\nProperty, plant and equipment, net 43,423 30,462\nOperating lease right of use assets 2,477 3,114\nIntangible assets, net 1,623 1,829\nTotal non-current assets 51,501 38,852\nTotal assets $ 126,651 $ 110,833\nThe accompanying notes are an integral part of the consolidated financial statements.\nF - 4\nTAT TECHNOLOGIES LTD.

AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nU.S. dollars in thousands\nNOTE 1 - GENERAL\na. TAT Technologies Ltd., (“TAT” or the “Company”) an Israeli corporation, incorporated in 1985, is a leading provider of solutions and services to the aerospace and defense industries, focused\nmainly on the following four segments: (i) original equipment manufacturing (“OEM”) of heat transfer solutions and aviation accessories mainly through our Kiryat Gat facility and our Limco\nsubsidiary; (ii) MRO (“Maintenance Repair and Overhaul”) services for heat transfer components and OEM of heat transfer solutions through Limco Airepair Inc our wholly-owned\nsubsidiary; (iii) MRO services for aviation components (mainly Auxiliary Power Unit “APU” and Landing Gear “LG”) through Piedmont Aviation Component Services LLC our wholly-\nowned subsidiary; and (iv) overhaul and coating of jet engine components through Turbochrome our wholly-owned subsidiary. TAT targets the commercial aerospace (serving a wide range of\ntypes and sizes of commercial and business jets), military aerospace and ground defense sectors. TAT’s shares are listed on both the NASDAQ (TATT) and Tel-Aviv Stock Exchange.\nIn June 2020, the Company's management decided to discontinue the JT8D engine blades reconditioning activity which belong to “overhaul and coating of jet engine components” segment as\npart of a strategic change, see Note 18.\nIn March 2021, the Company announced a restructuring plan which includes the transfer of the Company's activity of “OEM of heat transfer solutions and aviation accessories” in Gedera to\nour activity of “MRO services for heat transfer components and OEM of heat transfer solutions” in Tulsa, Oklahoma and to our “overhaul and coating of jet engine components” activity in\nKiryat Gat, see Note 9.\nDuring the years 2020 and 2021 the COVID-19 pandemic had an adverse effect on our industry and the markets in which we operate. The COVID-19 outbreak has significantly impacted the\naviation market in which TAT’s customers operate and has resulted in a reduction of TAT’s business with some of these customers. Global supply shortages emerged for certain products,\nleading to delays in delivery schedule. Additionally, recent cost inflation stemming from the pandemic may lead to higher material and labor costs. We actively monitor and respond to the\nchanging conditions created by the pandemic, with focus on prioritizing the health and safety of our employees, dedicating resources to support our communities, and innovating to address\nour customers’ needs. In order to mitigate the impact of the decline in business as a result of the pandemic, TAT implemented measures to reduce its expenses, including a reduction in its\nheadcount as well as other cost savings measures. The potential long-term impact and duration of the COVID-19 pandemic on the global economy and our business continue to be difficult to\nassess or predict. Related public health and safety measures have resulted in significant social disruption and have had an adverse effect on economic conditions and spending, inflation,\ninterest rates, and business investment, all of which have affected our business.\nb. TAT has the following wholly owned subsidiaries: Limco-Piedmont Inc. (“Limco-Piedmont”), and Turbochrome Ltd. (“Turbochrome”). Additionally, the Company holds 51% of TAT-\nEngineering LLC (“TAT-Engineering”) as a joint venture, hereinafter collectively referred to as the “Group”.\nOn November 25, 2015, the Company signed an agreement with Russian-based Engineering Holding of Moscow (“Engineering”), to establish a new facility for the provision of services for\nheat transfer products. The new Company, TAT-Engineering LLC, is based in Novosibirsk’s Tolmachevo airport. TAT-Engineering, LLC shall provide services for heat transfer products. 51%\nof TAT-Engineering LLC's shares are held by TAT and the remaining 49% are held by Engineering. The accounting treatment of the joint venture is based on the equity method due to variable\nparticipating rights granted to Engineering. The new entity was established in January 2016.\nF - 12\nTAT TECHNOLOGIES LTD. AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nU.S. dollars in thousands\nNOTE 2 - SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\na. Basis of Presentation\nThe Group's financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (\"U.S. GAAP\").\nb. Use of estimates in the preparation of financial statement\nThe preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and\nliabilities and disclose the nature of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting years. Actual\nresults could differ from those estimates.\nAs applicable to these financial statements, the most significant estimates and assumptions relate to: recoverability of inventory, provision for current expected credit loss and income taxes.\nc. Functional currency\nThe majority of the company and subsidiaries are generated in U.S. dollars (\"dollars\") and a substantial portion of the costs of the company and each subsidiary in the Group are incurred in\ndollars. Accordingly, the dollar is the currency of the primary economic environment in which the Group operates and accordingly its functional and reporting currency is the dollar.\nTransactions and balances originally denominated in dollars are presented at their original amounts. Balances in currencies other than the U.S. dollar are translated into dollars using historical\nand current exchange rates for non-monetary and monetary balances, respectively. For non-dollar transactions and other items in the statements of income (indicated below), the following\nexchange rates are used: (i) for transactions - exchange rates at transaction dates or average rates; and (ii) for other items (derived from non-monetary balance sheet items such as depreciation\nand amortization, etc.) - historical exchange rates. Currency transaction gains and losses are carried to financial income or expenses, as appropriate.\nd. Principles of consolidation\nThe consolidated financial statements include the accounts of TAT and its subsidiaries.\nIntercompany balances and transactions, including profits from intercompany sales not yet realized outside the Group, have been eliminated upon consolidation.\ne. Cash and Cash equivalents\nAll highly liquid investments, which include short-term bank deposits, that are not restricted as to withdrawal or use. The period to maturity of which do not exceed three months at the time of\ninvestment, are considered to be cash equivalents.\nF - 13\nTAT TECHNOLOGIES LTD. AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nU.S. dollars in thousands\nNOTE 2 - SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONT)\nf. Accounts receivable, net\nThe Group’s accounts receivable balances are due from customers primarily in the airline and defense industries. Credit is extended based on evaluation of a customer’s financial condition\nand generally, collateral is not required. Trade accounts receivable from sales of services and products are typically due from customers within 30 - 90 days. Trade accounts receivable\nbalances are stated at amounts due from customers net of a provision for current expected losses.\nAccounts receivable have been reduced by an allowance for current expected losses. The Company maintains the allowance for estimated losses resulting from the inability of the Company’s\ncustomers to make required payments. The allowance represents the current estimate of lifetime expected credit losses over the remaining duration of existing accounts receivable considering\ncurrent market conditions and supportable forecasts when appropriate. The estimate is a result of the Company’s ongoing evaluation of collectability, customer creditworthiness, historical\nlevels of credit losses, and future expectations.\nWrite-off activity and recoveries for the periods presented were not material (see note 22).\ng. Inventory\nInventory is measured at the lower of cost and net realizable value.\nInventories include raw materials, parts, work in progress and finished products.\nCost of raw material and parts is determined using the “moving average” basis. Cost of work in progress and finished products is calculated based on actual costs. Capitalized production costs\ncomponents, mainly labor and overhead, are determined on average basis over the production period.\nSince the Group sells products and services related to airplane accessories for airplanes that can be in service for 20 to 50 years, it must keep a supply of such products and parts on hand while\nthe airplanes are in use. The Group writes down its inventory for estimated obsolescence and unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and net realizable\nvalue, which includes costs to sell based upon assumptions for future demand and market conditions.\nIf actual market prices are less favorable than those projected by management, inventory write-downs may be required. When inventory is written down, a new lower cost basis for that\ninventory is established.\nF - 14\nTAT TECHNOLOGIES LTD.

Property, plant and equipment\nProperty, plant and equipment are stated at cost, after deduction of the related investment grants, net of accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is calculated using the straight-line method\nover the estimated useful lives of the assets, as follows:\nYears\nBuildings and leasehold improvements 15 - 39\nMachinery and equipment 15 - 20\nMotor vehicles 7\nOffice furniture and equipment 3 - 5\nInternal use software 7\nLeasehold improvements are included in buildings and amortized using the straight-line method over the period of the lease contract, or the estimated useful life of the asset, whichever is\nshorter. During 2021 the Company's management reassessed and updated the useful life of each one of the groups of fixed assets. The change in the estimated useful life was accounted for\nprospectively in accordance with ASC 250-10.\nCapitalized Software Costs\nWe capitalize costs related to our internal-use software systems that have reached the application development stage. Such capitalized costs include payroll, payroll-related expenses, and\nexternal direct costs, which are directly associated with creating and enhancing internal use software. Capitalization of such costs begins when the preliminary project stage is complete and\nceases at the point in which the project is substantially complete and is ready for its intended purpose. The costs capitalized in the application development stage primarily include the costs of\ncoding and testing of a new system or of a significant upgrade and enhancement. Costs related to preliminary project activities and post implementation activities are expensed as incurred.\nCapitalized software costs are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful life.\nWe evaluate the useful lives of these assets on an annual basis and test for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances occur that could impact the recoverability of these assets.\nRefer to Note 6 for further information.\nCapitalized software costs are included in property, equipment and software, net in the consolidated balance sheet.\ni. Government grants:\nGrants received from the IIA for approved research and development projects are recognized at the time the Company is reasonably assured that it will be entitled to such grants, on the basis\nof the costs incurred and included as a deduction from research and development expenses. Due to the fact that the Company is defined as a \"Traditional Industry Company\", under the IIA\nregulations, the majority of grants are non-royalty bearing.\nGovernment grants relating to the purchase of property, plant and equipment (refer to note 6) are presented in the statement of financial position as a deduction to the carrying amount of the\nasset and they are credited to profit or loss on a straight-line basis over the expected lives of the related assets.\nGrants received according to the ERC and PPP plan launched by the US Government are recognized at the time the Company is reasonably assured that it will be entitled to such grants, on\nthe basis of the costs incurred and included as a deduction from cost of revenues and operational expenses.\nF - 15\nTAT TECHNOLOGIES LTD.

Investment in affiliates and share in results of equity investment of affiliated companies\nInvestment in which the Group exercises significant influence and which is not considered a subsidiary (\"affiliate\") is accounted for using the equity method, whereby the Group recognizes its\nproportionate share of the affiliated company's net income or loss after the date of investment. See Note 5.\nThe Group reviews those investments for impairment whenever events indicate the carrying amount may not be recoverable. See Note 1(c).\nOn consolidation, transactions between the Group and the affiliate are eliminated in the amount which related to the Group's proportionate share of the affiliate.\nk. Leases\nThe Company determines if an arrangement is a lease at inception. Balances related to operating leases are included in operating lease right-of-use (“ROU”) assets and operating lease\nliabilities in the consolidated balance sheets.\nROU assets represent the Company’s right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent the Company’s obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease.\nOperating lease ROU assets are recognized as the lease liability, adjusted for lease incentives received and prepayments made. Lease liabilities are recognized at the present value of the future\nlease payments at the lease commencement date. The Company’s lease terms may include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that the Company will exercise\nthat option. The discount rate for the lease is the rate implicit in the lease unless that rate cannot be readily determined. As the Company’s leases do not provide an implicit rate, the Company’s\nuses its estimated incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at the commencement date in determining the present value of lease payments. Lease expense for lease\npayments is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term (see also note 2aa).\nRevenue from Leasing Transactions under ASC 842\nThe Company accounts for certain leasing revenues in accordance with ASC 842, which qualify for operating lease treatment. For operating leases in which the Company is the lessor, lease\npayments are recognized as leasing revenue over the lease term on a straight-line basis. APUs engines subject to operating leases are classified as property, plant, and equipment and\ndepreciated on a straight-line basis over the useful life, see Note 7.\nl. Identified intangible assets\nIdentifiable intangible assets are comprised of definite lived intangible assets - customer relationships and commercial license which are amortized over 7 and 10 years respectively, using the\nstraight-line method over their estimated period of useful life as determined by identifying the period in which substantially all of the cash flows are expected to be generated. Amortization of\ncustomer relationships is recorded under selling and marketing expenses (this intangible asset was fully impaired during the year ended December 31, 2020, see note 8) and the amortization of\nthe commercial license is recorded in the cost of sales.\nF - 16\nTAT TECHNOLOGIES LTD.

Impairment of long-lived assets\nLong-lived assets, including property, plant and equipment, operating lease right of use assets and definite life intangible assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in\ncircumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets (or asset group) may not be recoverable. In the event that the sum of the expected future cash flows (undiscounted and without\ninterest charges) of the long-lived assets (or asset group) is less than the carrying amount of such assets, an impairment charge would be recognized and the assets (or asset group) would be\nwritten down to their estimated fair values (see also Notes 6,7 and 8).\nn. Treasury Shares\nCompany shares held by the Company are presented as a reduction of equity at their cost to the Company. The treasury shares have no rights.\no. Revenue Recognition\nThe Group generates its revenues from the sale of OEM products and systems, providing MRO services (remanufacture, maintenance, repair and overhaul services and long - term service\ncontracts) and parts services.\nA contract with a customer exists only when: the parties to the contract have approved it and are committed to perform their respective obligations, the Company can identify each party’s\nrights regarding the distinct goods or services to be transferred (“performance obligations”), the Company can determine the transaction price for the goods or services to be transferred, the\ncontract has commercial substance and it is probable that the Company will collect the consideration to which it will be entitled in exchange for the goods or services that will be transferred to\nthe customer.\nRevenues are recorded in the amount of consideration to which the Company expects to be entitled in exchange for performance obligations upon transfer of control to the customer, excluding\namounts collected on behalf of other third parties and sales taxes.\nTo determine revenue recognition for arrangements that an entity determines are within the scope of Topic 606, the entity performs the following five steps: (i) identify the contract(s) with a\ncustomer; (ii) identify the performance obligations in the contract; (iii) determine the transaction price; (iv) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and (v)\nrecognize revenue when (or as) the performance obligation is satisfied.\nF - 17\nTAT TECHNOLOGIES LTD.

Revenue Recognition (cont.)\nThe Company has adopted the following exemptions and accounting policies:\na. The Company has chosen to account for shipping as a fulfillment costs, in cases in which the shipping occurs after the customer has obtained control of a good.\nb. The Company has chosen not to adjust the promised amount of consideration for the effects of a significant financing component, in cases in which the Company expects, at contract\ninception, that the period between when the Company transfers a promised good or service to the customer and when the customer pays for that good or service will be one year or less.\nc. The Company has chosen to present all sales taxes collected from customers on a net basis.\nThe group recognizes revenues from the sale of OEM products when it satisfies a performance obligation, i.e. when the customer obtains control of the product, typically upon shipment to the\ncustomer. The Group does not grant a right of return.\nThe Group recognizes revenues from MRO services over time as it satisfies its performance obligations.\nContract liabilities\nContract liabilities are mainly comprised of deferred revenues which are included under accrued expenses and other.\nF - 18\nTAT TECHNOLOGIES LTD. AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nU.S. dollars in thousands\nNOTE 2 - SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONT)\np. Warranty costs\nThe Group provides warranties for its products and services ranging from one to three years, which vary with respect to each contract and in accordance with the nature of each specific\nproduct. According to Company's experience, most of the warranty costs incur during the first year of the contract.\nThe Group estimates the costs that may be incurred under its warranty and records a liability in the amount of such costs at the time revenue is recognized under accrued expenses on the\nCompany’s balance sheet. The Group periodically assesses the adequacy of its recorded warranty liabilities and adjusts the amounts as necessary.\nq. Research and development\nResearch and development costs, net of grants, are charged to expenses as incurred.\nr. Fair value measurement\nThe Group measures fair value and discloses fair value measurements for financial assets and liabilities. Fair value is based on the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to\ntransfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.\nThe accounting standard establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes observable and unobservable inputs used to measure fair value into three broad levels, which are described below:\nLevel 1: Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets that are accessible at the measurement date for identical assets or liabilities. The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to Level 1\ninputs.\nLevel 2: Observable prices that are based on inputs not quoted on active markets, but corroborated by market data or active market data for similar but not identical assets or liabilities.\nLevel 3: Unobservable inputs are used when little or no market data is available. The fair value hierarchy gives the lowest priority to Level 3 inputs.\nIn determining fair value, the Group utilizes valuation techniques that maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs to the extent possible and considers\ncredit risk in its assessment of fair value.\nF - 19\nTAT TECHNOLOGIES LTD. AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nU.S. dollars in thousands\nNOTE 2 - SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONT)\ns. Concentrations of credit risk\nFinancial instruments that potentially subject the Group to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash and cash equivalents, derivatives and accounts receivable.\nCash and cash equivalents are deposited with several major banks in Israel and the United States. Such deposits in the United States may be in excess of insured limits and are not insured in\nother jurisdictions. Management believes that the financial institutions that hold the Group's cash and cash equivalents are financially sound, and that the Group has not been effected by the\nrecent turmoil in certain banking institutions in the United States. Accordingly, minimal credit risk exists with respect to these financial instruments.\nThe Group's accounts receivable are derived mainly from sales to customers in the United States, Israel and Europe. The Group generally does not require collateral; however, in certain\ncircumstances the Group may require letters of credit. Management believes that credit risks relating to accounts receivable are minimal since the majority of the Group's customers are world-\nleading manufacturers of aviation systems and aircrafts, international airlines, governments and air-forces, and world-leading manufacturers and integrators of defense and ground systems. In\naddition, the Group has relatively a large number of customers with wide geographic spread which mitigates the credit risk. The Group performs ongoing credit evaluation of its customers'\nfinancial condition. As part of the risk management, the Company purchased a credit insurance policy from a well-known insurance Company.\nt. Income taxes\nIncome taxes are accounted for in accordance with ASC 740 \"Income Taxes\". This statement prescribes the use of the asset and liability method, whereby deferred tax assets and liabilities\naccount balances are determined based on temporary differences between financial reporting and tax basis of assets and liabilities and for tax loss carry-forwards. Deferred taxes are measured\nusing the enacted laws and tax rates that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse. The Group provides a valuation allowance, if it is more likely than not that a portion of\nthe deferred income tax assets will not be realized, see Note 19(h).\nTaxes which would apply in the event of disposal of investments in domestic and foreign subsidiaries have not been taken into account in computing the deferred taxes, when the Group’s\nintention is to hold, and not to realize the investments.\nTaxes which would apply in the event of distribution of earnings from domestic and foreign subsidiaries of the Company, have been taken into account in computing the deferred taxes, when\nthere is a possibility of future distribution of earnings from such foreign subsidiaries.\nF - 20\nTAT TECHNOLOGIES LTD. AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nU.S. dollars in thousands\nNOTE 2 - SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONT)\nt. Income taxes (cont.)\nThe Group did not provide for deferred taxes attributable to dividend distribution out of retained tax-exempt earnings from \"Approved/Benefited Enterprise\" plans (see Note 19(a)), since it\nintends to permanently reinvest them and has no intention to declare dividends out of such tax exempt income in the foreseeable future. Management considers such retained earnings to be\nessentially permanent in duration.\nResults for tax purposes for TAT’s Israeli subsidiaries are measured and reflected in NIS.\nAs explained in (c) above, the consolidated financial statements are measured and presented in U.S. dollars. In accordance with ASC 740, TAT has not provided deferred income taxes on the\ndifferences resulting from changes in exchange rate and indexation.\nThe Group follows a two-step approach to recognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions. The first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of\navailable evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit. The second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50%\nlikely of being realized upon ultimate resolution. The Group’s policy is to include interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits within financial income (expense). Such liabilities\nare classified as long-term, unless the liability is expected to be resolved within twelve months from the balance sheet date.\nu. Earnings per share\nBasic earnings (loss) per share are computed by dividing net income (loss) by the weighted average number of shares of the Company's Ordinary Shares, par value NIS 0.9 per share\noutstanding for each period, net of treasury shares.\nDiluted earnings (loss) per share are calculated by dividing the net income by the fully-diluted weighted-average number of ordinary shares outstanding during each period. Potentially dilutive\nshares include outstanding options granted to employees and directors, using the treasury stock method.\nv. Share-based compensation\nThe Group applies ASC 718 \"Stock Based Compensation\" with respect to employees and directors’ options, which requires awards classified as equity awards to be accounted for using the\ngrant-date fair value method. The fair value of share-based awards is estimated using the Black-Scholes valuation model, the payment transaction is recognized as expense over the requisite\nservice period, net of estimated forfeitures. The Company estimates forfeitures based on historical experience and anticipated future conditions.\nThe Group recognizes compensation cost for an award with only service conditions that has a graded vesting schedule using the accelerated method over the requisite service period for the\nentire award.\nF - 21\nTAT TECHNOLOGIES LTD.

Comprehensive income (loss)\nComprehensive income in 2022, 2021 and 2020 includes, in addition to net income or loss, gains and losses of derivatives designated for cash flow hedge accounting (net of related taxes\nwhere applicable).\nReclassification adjustments for gain or loss of derivatives are included in the relevant line item in the statement of income. See also Note 2 (z).\nx. Contingencies\nCertain conditions may exist as of the date the financial statements are issued, which may result in a loss to the Group but which will only be resolved when one or more future events occur or\nfail to occur. The Group’s management assesses such contingent liabilities and estimated legal fees. Such assessment inherently involves an exercise of judgment. In assessing loss\ncontingencies related to legal proceedings that are pending against the Group or unasserted claims that may result in such proceedings, the Group’s management evaluates the perceived merits\nof any legal proceedings or unasserted claims as well as the perceived merits of the amount of relief sought or expected to be sought.\nManagement applies the guidance in ASC 450-20-25 when assessing losses resulting from contingencies. If the assessment of a contingency indicates that it is probable that a material loss has\nbeen incurred and the amount of the liability can be estimated, then the estimated liability is recorded as accrued expenses in the Company’s financial statements. If the assessment indicates\nthat a potential material loss contingency is not probable but is reasonably possible, or is probable but cannot be estimated, then the nature of the contingent liability, together with an estimate\nof the range of possible loss if determinable and material are disclosed.\nLoss contingencies considered to be remote by management are generally not disclosed unless they involve guarantees, in which case the guarantee would be disclosed.\nF - 22\nTAT TECHNOLOGIES LTD.

Derivatives and hedging\nThe Company carries out transactions involving foreign currency exchange derivative financial instruments. The transactions are designed to hedge the Company’s exposure in currencies\nother than the U.S. dollar. Derivatives are recognized at fair value as either assets or liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets in accordance with ASC Topic 815, “Derivatives and\nHedging”.\nFor derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as a cash-flow hedge, the gain or loss on the derivative instrument is reported as a component of other comprehensive income and\nreclassified into earnings in the same line item associated with the anticipated transaction in the same period or periods during which the hedged transaction affects earnings.\nIf a derivative does not meet the definition of a cash flow hedge, the changes in the fair value are included in \"financial expense (income), net\".\nFor derivative instruments that qualify for hedge accounting, the cash flows associated with these derivatives are reported in the consolidated statements of cash flows consistently with the\nclassification of the cash flows from the underlying hedged items that these derivatives are hedging.\nz. Restructuring Costs\nRestructuring costs have been recorded in connection with TAT’s restructuring plan announced in March 2021. Following this decision and in anticipation of ongoing efficiency measures in\nour business, TAT’s management has made estimates and judgments regarding future plans, mainly related to employee termination benefit costs. Management also assesses the recoverability\nof long-lived assets employed in the business. In certain instances, asset lives have been shortened based on changes in the expected useful lives of the affected assets. Asset-related\nimpairments and employee's severance and other related costs are reflected within asset impairments of fixed assets, provision for restructuring plan and restructuring expenses.\naa. Recently Issued Accounting Principles:\nRecently adopted accounting pronouncements:\n(1) In n November 2021, the FASB issued ASU 2021-10 “Government Assistance (Topic 832),” which requires annual disclosures that increase the transparency of transactions involving\ngovernment grants, including (1) the types of transactions, (2) the accounting for those transactions, and (3) the effect of those transactions on an entity’s financial statements. The\nCompany applied the guidance prospectively to all in-scope transactions beginning fiscal year 2022. The adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on the Company’s\nfinancial statements.\nF - 23\nTAT TECHNOLOGIES LTD. AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nU.S. dollars in thousands\nNOTE 3 - FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT\nRecurring Fair Value Measurements\nThe Group measures fair value and discloses fair value measurements for financial assets and liabilities. Fair value is based on the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a\nliability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.\nThe Company's financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis, consisted of the following types of instruments:\nDecember 31, 2022\nLevel 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total\nLiability:\nDerivative financial instruments - $ (31) - $ (31)\nDecember 31, 2021\nLevel 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total\nAssets:\nDerivative financial instruments - $ 51 - $ 51\na. Derivative financial instruments:\nThe Company hedges the foreign currency risk arising from probable forecasted Israeli Shekel (\"ILS\") expenses as part of its risk management policy. The risk management objective is to\nhedge the foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations associated with ILS denominated forecasted probable expenses according to the Company's hedging policy. The majority of the ILS\nexposure arises from expected related salary expenses. The Company enters into contracts for derivative financial instruments forward contracts in order to execute its policy. Such derivatives\nare recognized at fair value. The fair value of forward contracts is calculated as the difference between the forward rate on valuation date and the forward rate on the original forward contract,\nmultiplied by the transaction's notional amount. At the inception of a hedge relationship, the Company formally designates and documents the hedge relationship to which the Company\nwishes to apply hedge accounting and the risk management objective and strategy for undertaking the hedge. The hedge effectiveness is assessed at the end of each reporting period.\nThe effective portion and the ineffective portion of the gain or loss on the hedging instrument is recognized as other comprehensive income (loss).\nThe effective portion is determined by looking into changes in spot exchange rate.\nThe change in fair value attributable to changes other than those due to fluctuations in the spot exchange rate are excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness and are recognized in\nthe statement of income under financial expenses-net.\nF - 24\nTAT TECHNOLOGIES LTD.
