The company will vertically integrate the manufacturing supply chain, primarily producing its battery cell technology, both cylindrical and prismatic. A percent of that production will be utilized for 3rd party sales, enabling more manufacturers to participate with domestic content. The company will also expand into inverter production and assembly.\n\nDomestic content requirements for the entire industry were codified in the bipartisan Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) in 2022, and President-elect Trump has continued to promote American production throughout this transition announcements. “Strengthening U.S. manufacturing and increasing vital domestic content is a bi-partisan issue that transcends national elections, and we are proud to be part of this national effort,”**stated Ardes Johnson, Chief Executive Officer of NeoVolta.**\n\nNeoVolta has received financial offers for the establishment of a headquarters, manufacturing facility, and regional offices from 23 state economic development agencies, offering a wide range of grants for capital expenditures, workforce development, cost of relocation, cost of expansion, and off take agreements with state utilities. The company is now reviewing each of these offers, making a determination on where to proceed for a best and final offer. \n\n“Given the renewed focus on U.S. manufacturing and componentry, combined with the need for grid resilience and stability, NeoVolta is preparing to launch and expand U.S. manufacturing, while completing the development of our commercial grade products,” **added Johnson**. “We are pleased to hear the President-elect’s multiple pro-solar energy statements throughout the campaign and look forward to providing American made solar technology storage solutions that will strengthen our grid and efforts to achieve energy independence.”\n\nUnder the  _Title 17 Clean Energy Financing Program_ , projects must be able to feasibly and financially support clean energy deployment infrastructure and investment to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and air pollution. The program has been financed since the Energy Policy Act of 2005 and has since been amended, most recently by the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act in 2021 and the Inflation Reduction Act in 2022. \n\nNeoVolta is seeking to be deemed by DOE as an “Innovative Energy” project that will reduce greenhouse gas emissions through designing, creating, producing and selling advanced commercial Battery Energy Storage Solutions nationwide using lithium iron. DOE LPO programs are backed by a federal guarantee, with a favorable interest rate as low as .0375%. According to the DOE, these applications take around 12 months to complete. However, the project must be deemed feasible financially and conceptually at phase one in order to proceed. \n\n“We are confident in our application to the DOE,” **added Johnson** , “and believe that we are well positioned to provide technical feasibility, as well as other required due diligence.” \n\n### About NeoVolta\n\nNeoVolta is a leading innovator in energy storage solutions dedicated to advancing the future of clean energy. ​ Founded to provide reliable, sustainable, and high-performance energy storage systems, the company has quickly established itself as a critical player in the industry. ​ NeoVolta’s flagship products are designed to meet the growing demand for efficient energy management in residential and commercial applications. ​ With a focus on cutting-edge technology and strategic partnerships, NeoVolta is committed to driving progress in renewable energy and enhancing how the world stores and uses power.\n\nFor more information visit: [**NeoVolta.com**](/) email us: **Contact:** Kate Countryman press@neovolta.com Or call us: **858-239-2349**\n\n### Forward-Looking Statements\n\nSome of the statements in this release are forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, which involve risks and uncertainties.

          "content": "NEOVOLTA, INC.\nCODE OF ETHICS\nIntroduction\nNeoVolta, Inc. and each of its subsidiaries, if any, (collectively, the “Company”) are committed\nto the highest standards of ethics and business conduct. The Company conducts its business as a good\ncorporate citizen and complies with all laws, rules and regulations applicable to it or the conduct of its\nbusiness. This commitment and standard of conduct governs our relationships with customers, suppliers,\nshareholders, competitors, the communities in which we operate, and with each other as employees at\nevery organizational level. Maintaining the highest ethical standards at all levels within our organization\nis critical for our success as a corporation. This Code of Ethics (“Code”) applies to the corporation as a\nwhole and to all employees, directors, officers, as well as consultants and vendors.\nThe Code is an expression of our core values and represents a framework for decision making.\nTo this end, all of us are responsible for understanding the Code and acting in accordance with it. The\nCode cannot and is not intended to cover every applicable law, rule or regulation or provide answers to all\nquestions that may arise; for that, we must ultimately rely on each employee’s, officer’s and director’s\ngood sense of what is right, including a sense of when it is proper to seek guidance from others with\nrespect to the appropriate course of conduct. The Company maintains an open door policy for resolving\nissues that arise in the workplace. Employees are encouraged to first discuss any questions regarding any\nlaw, rule, regulation, or principle discussed in this Code, which may govern business conduct, with the\nemployee’s immediate supervisor. If open communication with the employees’ supervisor does not\nresolve the issue or makes the employee uncomfortable, the employee should subsequently consult his or\nher next level supervisor or his or her Human Resources representative. If this does not result in\nsatisfactory resolution of the issue, the employee should consult the Company’s Chief Financial Officer.\nThe Code does not in any way constitute an employment contract or an assurance of continued\nemployment. It is for the sole and exclusive benefit of the Company and may not be used or relied upon\nby any other party. The Company may modify or repeal the provisions of the Code or adopt a new Code\nat any time it deems appropriate, with or without notice.\nThe Code must be strictly observed and failure to do so could result in disciplinary action, up to\nand including termination. This Code applies equally to all employees, officers, directors, consultants and\nvendors of the Company. The Company encourages employees to seek or to ask for advice from their\nsupervisors or human resources representative when ethical issues arise in the workplace.\nCompliance with Laws, Rules, Regulations and Policies\nWe all are expected to act honestly and maintain the highest standards of ethics and business\nconduct, consistent with the professional image of the Company. We are required to comply fully with\nall laws, rules and regulations affecting the Company’s business and its conduct in business matters. We\nare expected to uphold both the letter and the spirit of the law and the Company’s policies.\nThe Company conducts its business in the United States and internationally. Applicable laws,\nrules, regulations, customs and social requirements may be different in other countries from those in the\nUnited States. It is the Company’s policy to abide by the national and local laws of our host nations and\ncommunities. In the case of any conflict between the laws of another country and the United States, or in\nany situation where an employee has a doubt as to the proper course of conduct, it is incumbent upon an\nemployee to immediately consult first his or her supervisor, and then his or her human resources\nrepresentative.\nConfidential, Proprietary Information\nOne of the Company’s most valuable assets is information. Employees, officers and directors\nshould maintain the confidentiality of information (whether specifically regarded as proprietary or not)\nentrusted to them not only by the Company, but also by suppliers, former employers, customers and\nothers related to our business. Confidential information includes all non-public information that might be\nof use to our competitors or harmful to the Company, or its customers or suppliers, if disclosed.\nExamples of confidential information include, but are not limited to, trade secrets, new product or\nmarketing plans, customer lists, employee lists, research and development ideas, manufacturing\nprocesses, or acquisition or divestiture prospects.\nEmployees, officers and directors should take steps to safeguard confidential information by\nkeeping such information secure, limiting access to such information to those employees who have a\n“need to know” in order to do their job, and avoiding discussion of confidential information in public\nareas, for example, in elevators, on planes, and on mobile phones. Employees, officers and directors must\nsafeguard documents with confidential information, and should take steps to ensure proper disposal of\ndocuments with confidential information through shredding or other appropriate means, so that such\ndocuments cannot be acquired by those without proper authorization. Confidential information may be\ndisclosed to others when disclosure is authorized by the Company or legally mandated. The obligation to\npreserve confidential information is ongoing, even after termination of employment.\nUse of Inside Information/ Insider Trading\nFederal and state law prohibits the use of “material inside information” when trading in or\nrecommending the Company securities. In accordance with applicable federal and state law, no\nemployee, officer or director may engage in transactions in the Company stock (whether for their own\naccount, for the Company’s account or otherwise) while in possession of material inside information\n(“Insider Trading”) relating to the Company. Further, no employee, officer or director who is in\npossession of material inside information may communicate such information to third parties who may\nuse such information in the decision to purchase or sell Company stock (“Tipping”). These restrictions\nalso apply to securities of other companies if an employee, officer or director learns of material inside\ninformation in the course of his or her duties for the Company. In addition to violating the Company\npolicy, Insider Trading and Tipping are illegal.\nWhat constitutes “material inside information” is a complex legal question, but is generally\nconsidered to be information not available to the general public, which a reasonable investor\ncontemplating a purchase of the Company’s stock would be substantially likely to take into account in\nmaking his or her investment decision. Such information includes information relating to a stock split\nand other actions relating to capital structure, major management changes, contemplated acquisitions or\ndivestitures, and information concerning earnings or other financial information. Such information\ncontinues to be “inside” information until two business days following the broad disclosure to the general\npublic.\nAny person who is in possession of material inside information is deemed to be an “insider.”\nThis would include directors, officers, employees (management and non- management), as well as\nspouses, friends or brokers who may have acquired such information directly or indirectly from an insider\n“tip.”\nSubstantial penalties may be assessed against people who trade while in possession of material\ninside information and can also be imposed upon companies and so-called controlling persons such as\nofficers and directors who fail to take appropriate steps to prevent or detect insider trading violations by\ntheir employees or subordinates. To avoid severe consequences, employees should review this policy and\nthe Insider Trading Policy before trading in securities and consult with the Company’s chief financial\nofficer if any doubts exist as to what constitutes “material inside information.”\nConflicts of Interest\nEmployees must base business decisions and actions on the best interests of the Company.\nAccordingly, the Company policy prohibits conflicts of interest. A conflict of interest occurs when an\nindividual’s personal interest interferes in any way—or even appears to interfere—with the interests of\nthe Company as a whole. A conflict situation can arise when an employee or a member of an employee’s\nfamily takes actions or has interests that may make it difficult to perform his or her work objectively and\neffectively. Conflicts of interest also arise when an employee or a member of his or her family or close\npersonal friend, receives improper personal benefits as a result of his or her position in the Company.\nFamily members include an employee’s spouse, child, stepchild, grandchild, parent, step-parent,\ngrandparent, sibling, in-laws and anyone living in an employee’s household and/or economically\ndependent upon an employee, including all adoptive relationships.\nSuch conflicts of interest can undermine our business judgment and our responsibility to the\nCompany and threaten the Company’s business and reputation. Accordingly, all apparent, potential, and\nactual conflicts of interest should be scrupulously avoided. Though it is not possible to list every activity\nor situation that might raise a conflict of interest issue(s), the list below is included to help you recognize\nsome of the more significant ones:\n• Corporate Opportunities. Taking personally opportunities that are discovered\nthrough the use of corporate property, information or position (unless the Company has already\nbeen offered the opportunity and turned it down), or using corporate property, information or\nposition for personal gain or competing with the Company. Such action is prohibited. In\naddition, directors owe a duty to the Company to advance its legitimate interests when the\nopportunity to do so arises.\n• Gifts. Receiving from, or giving to, a supplier, customer or competitor, gifts,\ngratuities, special allowances, inappropriate discounts or other benefits of significant value (as\ndefined below) that may have the potential to influence a business decision. The purpose of\nbusiness entertainment and gifts in a commercial setting is to create goodwill and sound working\nrelationships, not to gain unfair advantage with suppliers or customers. Gifts and entertainment of\nmore than a significant value, that is, other than as is customary (i.e. holiday gift baskets or\nvendor attended entertainment), must be pre- approved, by a vice president or an officer of a\nhigher level, other than the recipient of the gift. In addition, any item that costs greater than $500\nwill be deemed to be of significant value and require pre-approval. If an employee is unsure\nregarding any gifts received or given, he or she should seek approval from his or her vice\npresident. Any vice president seeking approval shall seek such approval from the Chief Financial\nOfficer.\n• Loans. Providing loans to, or guarantees of obligations of, employees or their\nfamily members. Such activity will not be allowed without the prior written approval of the Chief\nFinancial Officer, and if appropriate, the Board of Directors or a committee of the Board of\nDirectors. The Company will not extend, maintain or arrange any personal loan (or the equivalent\nthereof) to or for any director or executive officer or members of their families, or make\nguarantees of any of their obligations.\n• Outside Activity. Engaging in any outside activity that materially detracts from\nor interferes with the performance by an employee of his or her services to the Company.\n• Outside Employment. Serving as a director, representative, employee, partner,\nconsultant or agent of, or providing services to, an organization or individual that is a supplier,\ncustomer or otherwise seeking to do or doing business with the Company or a competitor of the\nCompany.\n• Personal Investments.

Employees\nshould take care to report conflicts to a person who they believe is not involved in the matter giving rise\nto the conflict.\nIf a director believes he or she has an actual or potential conflict of interest with the Company, the\ndirector should notify the Chief Financial Officer and the Chairman of the Audit Committee (or any\nsuccessor committee thereto) as promptly as practicable. The director should not participate in any\ndecision by the Board of Directors, or any Committee of the Board of Directors, that in any way relates to\nthe matter that gives rise to the conflict of interest or potential conflict of interest until the issue has been\nresolved to the satisfaction of the Chairman of the Audit Committee or the entire Board of Directors.\nAny employee who has a doubt about whether a conflict of interest exists after consulting this\nprovision of the Code, should contact their human resources representative or, so that he or she can be\nassisted in making that determination.\nQuality of Disclosures\nThe federal and state securities laws impose continuing disclosure requirements on the Company,\nand require the Company to regularly file certain reports with and make certain submissions (the\n“Reports”) to the Securities and Exchange Commission and the stock exchange on which the Company’s\nsecurities are traded and disseminate them to its shareholders. Such Reports must comply with all\napplicable legal and exchange requirements and may not contain material misstatements or omit material\nfacts.\nAll employees, officers and directors directly or indirectly involved in preparing such Reports,\nany employees, officers or directors who regularly communicate with the press, investors and analysts\nconcerning the Company, and all representatives who assist the Company in preparing such Reports and\ncommunications, will ensure that such Reports and communications are (i) full, fair, timely, accurate and\nunderstandable and (ii) meet all legal requirements. This policy applies to all public disclosure of material\ninformation about the Company, including written disclosures, oral statements, visual presentations, press\nconferences and media calls.\nProtection and Proper Use of Assets\nProper and efficient use of assets of the Company, suppliers, customers and others, such as\nelectronic communication systems, vehicles, cell phones, information (proprietary or otherwise), facilities\nand equipment, as well as intangible assets, is the responsibility of each employee, officer and director.\nEmployees, officers and directors must not inappropriately use such assets for non-Company business or\npersonal profit for themselves or others unless such use is permitted under an approved written policy,\ncompensation or expense reimbursement program.

All reports of violations will be promptly investigated and, if\nappropriate, remedied, and if legally required, immediately reported to the proper governmental authority.\nEmployees will be expected to cooperate in assuring that violations of the Code are promptly\naddressed. The Company will protect confidentiality of those making reports of possible misconduct to\nthe maximum extent possible, consistent with the requirements necessary to conduct an effective\ninvestigation and the law. Any form of retaliation against someone for reporting an activity that he or she\nin good faith believes to be a violation of any law, rule, regulation, or this Code will not be tolerated.\nAny supervisor or other employee intimidating or imposing sanctions on an employee for reporting a\nmatter will be disciplined up to and including termination.\nIt is illegal to retaliate against a person, including any action regarding his employment, for\nproviding truthful information to a law enforcement officer relating to the possible commission of any\nfederal offense. Employees, officers or directors who believe that they have been retaliated against by the\nCompany, its employees, officers, directors, contractors, subcontractors or agents, for providing\ninformation to or assisting in an investigation conducted by a federal agency, Congress or a person with\nsupervisory authority over the employee (or another employee who has the authority to investigate or\nterminate misconduct) in connection with conduct that the employee, officer or director reasonably\nbelieves constitutes a violation of federal criminal fraud statutes or any rule or regulation of the Securities\nand Exchange Commission, may file a complaint with the Secretary of Labor, or in federal court if the\nSecretary does not take action in a timely manner. The Company encourages employees to report any\nretaliation for reporting violations of law to their human resources representative or the Chief Financial\nOfficer in addition to the appropriate government authorities.\nResponding to Improper Conduct\nThis Code will be enforced on a uniform basis for everyone, without regard to an employee’s\nposition within the Company. If an employee violates the Company’s Code, he or she will be subject to\ndisciplinary action. Supervisors and managers of a disciplined employee may also be subject to\ndisciplinary action for their failure to properly oversee an employee’s conduct, or for retaliation against an\nemployee who reports a violation(s).\nThe Company’s response to misconduct will depend upon a number of factors, including whether\nthe improper behavior involved illegal conduct. Disciplinary action may include, but is not limited to,\nreprimands and warnings, probation, suspension, demotion, reassignment, reduction in salary or\nimmediate termination. Employees should be aware that certain actions and omissions prohibited by the\nCode might be crimes that could lead to individual criminal prosecution and, upon conviction, to fines\nand imprisonment.\nEmployment Practices/ Equal Employment Opportunity\nPeople are the greatest asset of the Company. The Company strives to maintain a workplace free\nof discrimination or harassment.

A waiver of this Code for any\nexecutive officer or director may be made only by the Board of Directors or a committee of the Board of\nDirectors and must be promptly disclosed to shareholders in accordance with applicable law and\nexchange requirements."
