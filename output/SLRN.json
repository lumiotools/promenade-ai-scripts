(Nasdaq: SLRN), a late-stage clinical biopharma company focused on accelerating the development and delivery of transformative medicines in immunology, today reported financial results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2024 and highlighted other corporate updates and milestones.\n\n“We are executing on our refocused pipeline strategy and are excited by the near-term catalysts ahead for ACELYRIN, particularly as we advance subcutaneous lonigutamab into Phase 3 development as the next generation IGF-1R inhibitor for thyroid eye disease. We recently concluded a positive end of phase 2 interaction with the FDA, established a world-class scientific and patient advisory board, and remain on track to initiate our Phase 3 development program in TED next quarter,” said Mina Kim, Chief Executive Officer of ACELYRIN. “We are also looking forward to announcing topline results from our Phase 2b/3 trial of izokibep in uveitis in December 2024 and hosting a lonigutamab investor event in early 2025.”\n\n**Recent Pipeline Updates and Upcoming Milestones**\n\n**__Lonigutamab__** Lonigutamab is a subcutaneously (SC) delivered humanized IgG1 monoclonal antibody targeting the insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor (IGF-1R), a validated mechanism of action (MoA) for the treatment for thyroid eye disease (TED).\n\n  * ACELYRIN recently completed a positive end of Phase 2 (EOP2) interaction with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), achieving alignment on important elements of the Phase 3 registrational program design including size, primary and secondary endpoints, and proposed dose selection. The Company will host a webcast event in early 2025 to review the Phase 2 data, FDA feedback and Phase 3 program design.\n\n\n  * Earlier this year, ACELYRIN reported the first positive proof of concept data for an anti-IGF-1R in TED patients, which showed that lonigutamab was well-tolerated and demonstrated rapid improvements in proptosis and clinical activity score (CAS) – within three weeks after the first dose. Additional data from the ongoing Phase 2 trial has been recently presented by leading clinicians at international medical congresses including those of the American Society of Ophthalmic Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery, the European Society of Ophthalmic Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery, and the American Academy of Ophthalmology. These presentations can be found on the “Presentations and Publications” section of ACELYRIN’s website at [www.acelyrin.com](http://www.acelyrin.com)[.](https://www.acelyrin.com/presentations-publications)\n\n\n  * The Phase 2 dose exploration trial is continuing with additional cohorts to establish both a minimum eﬀective and optimal dose level and dose regimen for the Phase 3 registrational program. Cohort 3 testing 50mg of lonigutamab administered every four weeks has been completed and Cohort 4 testing 70-100mg of lonigutamab administered every four weeks is ongoing.\n\n\n  * Finally, ACELYRIN [established a scientific and patient advisory board](https://www.acelyrin.com/scientific-advisory) convening world class clinicians and advocates to provide important strategic input, clinical expertise and patient perspectives as the Company prepares to advance lonigutamab into Phase 3 clinical development for TED.\n\n\n\n**__Izokibep__** Izokibep is a small protein therapeutic designed to inhibit IL-17A with high potency and small molecular size, approximately 1/10th the size of a monoclonal antibody.\n\nACELYRIN previously announced that enrollment in a Phase 2b/3 trial evaluating 160mg of izokibep administered weekly as a treatment for non-infectious, non-interior uveitis had been completed in May 2024 with 96 patients. The Company expects to report topline data from the trial in December 2024.\n\n**__Third Quarter 2024 Financial Highlights__**\n\n**Cash Position:** Cash, cash equivalents and short-term marketable securities totaled $562.4 million at September 30, 2024. The Company expects these to fund operations to mid-2027.\n\n**R &D Expenses:** Research and development expenses were $31.6 million for the third quarter ended September 30, 2024, as compared to $74.6 million for the same period in 2023. The decreases were primarily a result of reduced clinical development activity as the Phase 3 trials for izokibep move toward completion.\n\n**G &A Expenses:** For the third quarter ended September 30, 2024, general and administrative expenses were $12.3 million, compared to $19.9 million for the same period in 2023. The decreases were primarily a result of lower stock-based compensation expenses.\n\n**Net Loss:** Net loss for the third quarter ended September 30, 2024 totaled $48.5 million, compared to $83.9 million for the same period in 2023. The net loss for the third quarter ended September 30, 2024 includes non-recurring restructuring expenses of $10.8 million related to the August 2024 announcement of a refocused pipeline strategy that prioritizes development of lonigutamab in thyroid eye disease. These restructuring expenses are net of a $35.7 million credit voucher that can be used to offset cash obligations for manufacturing costs including those for the lonigutamab program.\n\n**Webcast and Conference Call Information** ACELYRIN will host a conference call and webcast today, November 13, 2024, at 4:30pm ET to discuss these recent corporate updates. A live webcast of the conference call can be accessed in the “Events & Presentations” section of ACELYRIN’s website at [www.acelyrin.com.](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=AC4MdrErG0esUJvSry4awdMGdqY4BPb1jh9JlyiFnLFGdlByT5ZDLocO9wHT5OlmXMvJ_B5YHZv7modDHAjo-mk_OzOjnkszpBBHmlsP3AHDsFQNEBKsKx1awr5pe-1AtqSethJWL4EY7lboZoQbjiZ_WGI1DxyAsERhVCr97NtMY7PO2DiJOVo2N1S1RBrftON_LEUDTAaXN1IXXx_VBujvLZU7XLFtGwqNyZADv23F2TzCzeKriBXUXnS5hkKfgRnID2sUvQwlhYxCoHuT-LlyD2wvXF-ObYWFTqEZ0e-pG77J9waYT6LTNzQpHpO7) A recording of the webcast will be available and archived on the Company’s website for approximately 30 days.\n\n**Upcoming** **Investor** **Presentation** ACELYRIN management will attend the Jefferies London Healthcare Conference 2024 taking place from November 19-21, 2024, holding 1x1 meetings and a webcasted fireside chat on November 20, 2024.

Forms Scientific and Patient Advisory Board Featuring Leading Voices in Thyroid Eye Disease\n\nOctober 16, 2024\n\n[PDF Version](/node/8051/pdf)\n\n_Experts and advocates to provide important strategic input and clinical expertise as ACELYRIN completes its Phase 2 trial of lonigutamab in TED and prepares to initiate Phase 3 program in ﬁrst quarter of 2025_\n\nLOS ANGELES, Oct. 16, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- ACELYRIN, INC. (Nasdaq: SLRN), a late-stage clinical biopharma company focused on accelerating the development and delivery of transformative medicines in immunology, today announced the formation of a scientific and patient advisory board comprised of leading experts and advocates in thyroid eye disease (TED). This group of advisors will provide important strategic input, clinical expertise and patient perspectives as ACELYRIN prepares to advance lonigutamab, a subcutaneously delivered IgG1 monoclonal antibody targeting the anti-insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) receptor, into Phase 3 clinical development for TED in the ﬁrst quarter of 2025.\n\n“Convening this esteemed group of clinical thought leaders and patient advocates is an important step forward for us as we prepare to advance lonigutamab into the pivotal Phase 3 program for TED,” said Shephard (Shep) Mpofu, M.D., Chief Medical Officer of ACELYRIN. “Each member brings distinct expertise spanning multiple facets of TED including disease pathology, clinical trial leadership and patient experience. We believe their collective insights will position us extremely well to execute on our goal of delivering the potentially best-in-class subcutaneous anti-IGF-1R treatment for TED patients.”\n\nInaugural members of the ACELYRIN scientific and patient advisory board are listed below; full bios are available on the [ACELYRIN website](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=zL5OCTx83wK_WfiJ9r2OiyXs8DW-Stwcn0lYXFvNp97uINryB8noSuqaiNYf7QRhp4WqXVOW0iqg8jx8XwNarFwtoRAJFZbjW8lyL6Wv0r_b8zPQxGFaV9PZt-nmuD-v).\n\n**Scientific Advisors**\n\n  * George J. Kahaly, MD, PhD, Professor of Medicine and Endocrinology Metabolism and Chief Physician of the Endocrine Outpatient Clinic at the Johannes Gutenberg University Medical Center, Mainz, Germany;\n  * Andrea Lora Kossler, MD, FACS, Associate Professor of Ophthalmology at Stanford University School of Medicine and Director of the Oculofacial Plastic, Reconstructive Surgery and Orbital Oncology Service at the Byers Eye Institute at Stanford;\n  * Prem Subramanian, MD, PhD, Professor of Ophthalmology, Neurology, and Neurosurgery, University of Colorado School of Medicine; and\n  * Shoaib Ugradar, MD, Department of Orbital and Oculoplastic Surgery, private practice, Beverly Hills, California.\n\n\n\n**Patient Advisor**\n\n  * Christine Gustafson, Executive Director and CEO of the TED Community Organization, the only global 501c3 nonprofit dedicated to Thyroid Eye Disease.\n\n\n\n**About Thyroid Eye Disease** Thyroid Eye Disease (TED) is a vision-threatening autoimmune disease in which there is both inflammation and expansion of the tissues behind the eye, resulting in eye bulging, known as proptosis, and the subsequent inability to close the eyelids. Double vision, or diplopia, can occur, as well as the potential for compression of the optic nerve, which can lead to blindness. Thus, TED is a progressive, chronic inflammatory disease. More than 100,000 people in the United States are estimated to suffer from TED.\n\n**About Lonigutamab** Lonigutamab is a humanized IgG1 monoclonal antibody targeting the anti-insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) receptor and is delivered subcutaneously. Relative to standard of care, lonigutamab binds to a distinct epitope, which results in internalization of the receptor within minutes, and in preclinical binding and functional laboratory assays, it has been shown to be 75-fold more potent. The characteristics of lonigutamab that enable subcutaneous delivery also enable the potential for longer-term, convenient dosing, which can potentially improve depth and durability of clinical response.\n\n**About ACELYRIN** ACELYRIN, INC. (Nasdaq: SLRN) is focused on providing patients life-changing new treatment options by identifying, acquiring, and accelerating the development and commercialization of transformative medicines. ACELYRIN’s lead program, lonigutamab, is a subcutaneously delivered monoclonal antibody targeting IGF-1R being investigated for the treatment of thyroid eye disease.\n\nFor more information about ACELYRIN, visit us at www.acelyrin.com or follow us on [LinkedIn](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=iGWYbLGclfyt7PsxYeVm3gOnVA6_q2Bs5GVq_2Y7s24Jus7Q_epQkXP7KsgPwZKPwj_uImWA7AgyUB65MqgErTnWG_7wWpRZlEhGXnkplqjMV7v-sFQPu7uFtjdMYS4_hDM3nycYb04rxZn27YpeMYLmhkagRhhTSBsTmNqaMGvVgBXrDs8mSoYhKB4Qibv3ul9JV3mNmI4hBu9R6YogeKj7By7bw451zTuMxQi4-ikrsanCqk5f6HBb6D3OYW8i) and [X](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=spNIAmswoBT7pZKQJ8bwmp2ZiHu-EwCDC55YbyXvUkAuGq1n_HRaX-Fe9PlT6U3QIcdcyJI_3ZwsSAyvSssJx5SAh0GBVMQW8AiAMy3rtUV_75dBSTXA3q4uJVgN9yOpwNaCIrxCd4DlGl07dj6ZiTTQRcl6Nk6SEhc_eySl2bQKUO68bT7ocWUrPpmwfigD477QylgACzRV3Xa9-Sbm-Q==).\n\n**Forward Looking Statements** This press release contains forward-looking statements, including, but not limited to, statements regarding ACELYRIN’s ability to address unmet needs of patients, business plans and potential future benefits of our pipeline.
