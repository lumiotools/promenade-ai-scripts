(Nasdaq: RMR)](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.rmrgroup.com&esheet=54136668&newsitemid=20241015030891&lan=en-US&anchor=The+RMR+Group+Inc.+%28Nasdaq%3A+RMR%29&index=1&md5=ada6c84aa50b2b4cd4fc70acde5df6fd) today announced a regular quarterly cash distribution on its shares of Class A Common Stock and Class B-1 Common Stock of $0.45 per share ($1.80 per share per year). This distribution will be paid to RMR’s shareholders of record as of the close of business on October 28, 2024 and distributed on or about November 14, 2024. \n\n**About The RMR Group**\n\nThe RMR Group is a leading U.S. alternative asset management company, unique for its focus on commercial real estate (CRE) and related businesses. RMR’s vertical integration is supported by over 1,100 real estate professionals in more than 35 offices nationwide who manage over $41 billion in assets under management and leverage more than 35 years of institutional experience in buying, selling, financing and operating CRE.

These forward looking statements are based upon RMR’s present beliefs and expectations, but these statements and the implications of these statements are not guaranteed to occur and may not occur for various reasons, some of which are beyond RMR’s control. \n\nFor example, this press release states that RMR’s quarterly dividend will be $0.45 per share ($1.80 per share per year) on RMR Class A Common Stock and Class B-1 Common Stock. A possible implication of this statement is that RMR will continuously pay quarterly dividends of $0.45 per share per quarter or $1.80 per share per year in the future. RMR’s dividend rates are set and reset from time to time by RMR’s Board of Directors. The RMR Board of Directors considers many factors when setting dividend rates including RMR’s current and expected earnings, commitments to fund its investments and the availability of cash to fund dividends as compared to alternative uses of such cash. Accordingly, future dividend rates may be increased or decreased and there is no assurance as to the rate at which future dividends will be declared and paid. \n\nFor these reasons, among others, investors are cautioned not to place undue reliance upon any forward looking statements in this press release. Except as required by law, RMR does not intend to update or change any forward looking statements as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise. \n\n![](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=bwnews&sty=20241015030891r1&sid=q4-prod&distro=nx&lang=en)\n\nKevin Barry, Senior Director, Investor Relations (617) 796-8230 \n\nSource: The RMR Group Inc.\n\nMultimedia Files: \n\n[ ![](//s21.q4cdn.com/317921054/files/doc_multimedia/2024/10/1008953851/RMR_Group_Logo_Charcoal@thumbnail.png) ](//s21.q4cdn.com/317921054/files/doc_multimedia/2024/10/1008953851/RMR_Group_Logo_Charcoal.jpg)\n\n1150 x 1006 jpg 58 KB\n\nDownload: \n\n[ Download original jpg 58 KB 1150 x 1006 ](//s21.q4cdn.com/317921054/files/doc_multimedia/2024/10/1008953851/RMR_Group_Logo_Charcoal.jpg)\n\n[ Download thumbnail png 6 KB 200 x 175 ](//s21.q4cdn.com/317921054/files/doc_multimedia/2024/10/1008953851/RMR_Group_Logo_Charcoal@thumbnail.png)\n\n[ Download lowres png 15 KB 480 x 420 ](//s21.q4cdn.com/317921054/files/doc_multimedia/2024/10/1008953851/RMR_Group_Logo_Charcoal@lowres.png)\n\n[ Download square png 8 KB 250 x 250 ](//s21.q4cdn.com/317921054/files/doc_multimedia/2024/10/1008953851/RMR_Group_Logo_Charcoal@square.png)\n\n[View all Press Releases](/investors-and-media/news/default.aspx)\n\n[Contact Us](https://www.rmrgroup.com/contact/default.aspx) The rmr group Two newton place 255 washington street Newton.

Business\nOur Company\nThe RMR Group Inc., or RMR Inc., is a holding company incorporated as a Maryland corporation and substantially all of its business is conducted by its\nmajority owned subsidiary, The RMR Group LLC, or RMR LLC. RMR LLC is a Maryland limited liability company. RMR Inc. serves as the sole managing\nmember of RMR LLC and, in that capacity, operates and controls the business and affairs of RMR LLC. In this Annual Report on Form 10-K, unless otherwise\nindicated, “we”, “us” and “our” refers to RMR Inc. and its direct and indirect subsidiaries, including RMR LLC.\nAs of September 30, 2024, RMR Inc. owned 15,846,025 class A membership units of RMR LLC, or Class A Units, and 1,000,000 class B membership units of\nRMR LLC, or Class B Units. The aggregate RMR LLC membership units RMR Inc. owns represent approximately 52.9% of the economic interest of RMR LLC. A\nsubsidiary of ABP Trust owns 15,000,000 redeemable Class A Units, representing approximately 47.1% of the economic interest of RMR LLC.\nAdam D. Portnoy, the Chair of our Board, one of our Managing Directors and our President and Chief Executive Officer, is the sole trustee, an officer and the\ncontrolling shareholder of our controlling shareholder, ABP Trust, and owns all of ABP Trust’s voting securities and a majority of the economic interest of ABP\nTrust. As of September 30, 2024, Adam D. Portnoy beneficially owned (including through ABP Trust), in aggregate, (i) 211,561 shares of Class A common stock of\nRMR Inc., or Class A Common Shares; (ii) all the outstanding shares of Class B-1 common stock of RMR Inc., or Class B-1 Common Shares; and (iii) all the\noutstanding shares of Class B-2 common stock of RMR Inc., or Class B-2 Common Shares.\nSince its founding in 1986, RMR LLC has substantially grown assets under management and the number of real estate businesses it manages. As of\nSeptember 30, 2024, we had $40.9 billion of assets under management.\nWe provide management services to four publicly traded equity real estate investment trusts, or REITs, whose securities are listed on The Nasdaq Stock Market\nLLC, or Nasdaq: Diversified Healthcare Trust, a Maryland REIT, including its subsidiaries, or DHC; Industrial Logistics Properties Trust, a Maryland REIT,\nincluding its subsidiaries, or ILPT; Office Properties Income Trust, a Maryland REIT, including its subsidiaries, or OPI; and Service Properties Trust, a Maryland\nREIT, including its subsidiaries, or SVC. DHC, ILPT, OPI and SVC are collectively referred to as the Managed Equity REITs.\nAs manager of the Managed Equity REITs, we are responsible for implementing investment strategies and managing day-to-day operations, subject to\nsupervision and oversight by each Managed Equity REIT’s board of trustees. The Managed Equity REITs have no employees, and we provide the personnel and\nservices necessary for each Managed Equity REIT to conduct its business. The Managed Equity REITs invest in diverse income producing properties across\nmultiple real estate asset classes as follows:\n• DHC (Nasdaq: DHC) owns medical office and life science properties, senior living communities and other healthcare related properties. As of\nSeptember 30, 2024, DHC owned 368 properties located in 36 states and the District of Columbia.\n• ILPT (Nasdaq: ILPT) owns and leases industrial and logistics properties.

SEVN is a publicly traded mortgage REIT that focuses on originating and investing in first mortgage loans secured by middle\nmarket and transitional commercial real estate.\n1\nTable of Contents\nRMR LLC also provided management services to TravelCenters of America Inc., or TA, until it was acquired by BP Products North America Inc., or BP, on\nMay 15, 2023. TA is a real estate operating company that operates and franchises travel centers primarily along the United States, or U.S., interstate highway\nsystem, many of which are owned by SVC, and standalone truck service facilities.\nThe Managed Equity REITs, SEVN and until May 15, 2023, TA, are collectively referred to as the Perpetual Capital clients.\nRMR LLC provides management services to AlerisLife Inc., or AlerisLife, an operator of senior living communities, many of which are owned by DHC, and\nSonesta International Hotels Corporation, or Sonesta, a privately owned franchisor and operator of hotels, resorts and cruise ships in the United States, Latin\nAmerica, the Caribbean and the Middle East, and many of the U.S. hotels that Sonesta operates are owned by SVC.\nOn December 19, 2023, or the Acquisition Date, RMR LLC acquired MPC Partnership Holdings LLC, or MPC, or the Acquisition. In connection with the\nAcquisition, RMR LLC started providing management services through MPC and its subsidiaries to multiple private funds and the underlying residential real estate\nassets of the funds, as well as property management services to third party owners. The residential real estate we manage through MPC and its subsidiaries are\npresented as RMR Residential in these consolidated financial statements.\nIn addition, RMR LLC provides management services to private capital vehicles including ABP Trust and other private entities that own commercial real\nestate, of which certain of our Managed Equity REITs own minority equity interests. The clients of the other private capital vehicles, along with AlerisLife, Sonesta\nand clients of RMR Residential are collectively referred to as the Private Capital clients.\nOur Business Strategy\nOur business strategy is to provide an expanded range of management services to our existing clients, as well as to diversify the number of clients to which we\nprovide services and the sources of capital upon which those clients may rely for growth.\nWe believe we have several strengths that distinguish our business from other alternative asset managers:\n• Strong Revenue Base, Operating Margins and Resulting Cash Flows. Our revenues are primarily earned from long term agreements with credit quality\ncompanies, many of which are permanent capital vehicles. Our agreements with the Managed Equity REITs are 20 year term evergreen contracts with\nsignificant termination fees payable in certain circumstances. For the fiscal year ended September 30, 2024, revenues earned from the Managed Equity\nREITs represented 69.6% of our total management and advisory services revenue, excluding termination fee revenue. We continued to generate strong\noperating margins resulting in net cash from operating activities of $61.4 million and net income of $53.1 million and our regular dividend of $0.45 per\nshare per quarter ($1.80 per share per year) remains well covered by our cash flows.\n• Diverse Portfolio of Managed Real Estate. We provide management services to a wide range of real estate assets and businesses that include healthcare\nfacilities, senior living and other apartments, hotels, office buildings, industrial buildings, leased lands, net-lease service-focused retail, multifamily\nresidential communities, and various specialized properties such as properties leased to government tenants and properties specially designed for medical\nand biotech research. The properties and businesses we managed as of September 30, 2024, are located throughout the United States in 48 states and\nWashington D.C., and in Puerto Rico and Canada. The diversity of our managed portfolio helps provide balance throughout economic cycles, as the\nimpacts to each respective real estate sector can vary.\n• Growth. Since the founding of RMR LLC in 1986, we have substantially grown our assets under management and the number and variety of real estate\nbusinesses we manage. As of September 30, 2024, we had $40.9 billion of assets under management, including over 2,000 properties. The synergies\namong our clients may also facilitate their and our growth. We assist our clients in realizing investment opportunities by working together to make\nacquisitions, obtain financing, identifying possible joint venture partners, completing redevelopment activities, facilitating capital recycling from strategic\nproperty dispositions and assisting in portfolio repositioning and other business arrangements and strategic restructurings.\nIn addition, we expect to use cash on hand, future operating cash flows and may issue equity or incur debt to fund our growth and diversify our operations\nthrough additional acquisition opportunities or seeding new clients. In\n2\nTable of Contents\nrecent years, we sought to expand the sources of capital underlying our assets under management, with our Private Capital clients representing $12.8\nbillion of our assets under management as of September 30, 2024, an increase of $11.1 billion from September 30, 2021. During the fiscal year ended\nSeptember 30, 2024, we executed on this growth strategy through the acquisition of MPC, which added approximately $5.5 billion in assets under\nmanagement as of the Acquisition Date.\n• Quality and Depth of Management. Our highly qualified and experienced management team provides a broad base of deep expertise to our clients. Our\nsenior management has worked together through several business cycles in which they acquired, financed, managed and disposed of real estate assets and\nstarted real estate businesses. We are a vertically integrated manager and as of September 30, 2024, we employed over 1,000 real estate professionals in\nmore than 35 offices throughout the United States. We have also assisted our clients to grow by successfully accessing the capital markets; since our\nfounding in 1986, our clients have successfully completed over $46.0 billion of financing in approximately 190 capital raising transactions.\n• Alignment of Interests. We believe our structure fosters strong alignment of interests between our principal executive officer and our shareholders because\nour principal executive officer, Adam D. Portnoy, has a 50.9% economic interest in RMR LLC. Alignment of interests also exists between us and our\nManaged Equity REITs due to the manner upon which we earn base management fees and incentive management fees under our management agreements\nwith the Managed Equity REITs, as described in more detail below.\nWe can provide no assurance that we will be able to implement our business strategy or achieve our desired growth. Our business and the businesses of our\nclients are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties. See “Risk Factors” beginning on page 12.\nOur Management Agreements with the Managed Equity REITs\nRMR LLC is party to a business management agreement and a property management agreement with each Managed Equity REIT.

A Managed Equity REIT has the right to terminate its management agreements with RMR\nLLC: (1) at any time upon 60 days’ written notice for convenience, (2) immediately upon written notice for cause, as defined in the agreements, (3) upon written\nnotice given within 60 days after the end of an applicable calendar year for a performance reason, as defined in the agreements, and (4) by written notice during the\n12 months following a manager change of control, as defined in the agreements. RMR LLC has the right to terminate the management agreements for good reason,\nas defined in the agreements.\nIf a Managed Equity REIT terminates a management agreement for convenience, or if RMR LLC terminates a management agreement with a Managed Equity\nREIT for good reason, the Managed Equity REIT is obligated to pay RMR LLC a termination fee equal to the sum of the present values of the monthly future fees,\nas defined in the agreement, payable for the remaining term of the agreement, assuming it had not been terminated. If a Managed Equity REIT terminates a\nmanagement agreement for a performance reason, as defined in the agreement, the Managed Equity REIT is obligated to pay RMR LLC the termination fee\ncalculated as described above, but assuming a remaining term of ten years.\nA Managed Equity REIT is not required to pay any termination fee if it terminates its business or property management agreements for cause, or as a result of a\nmanager change of control, in each case as defined in such agreements.\nBusiness Management Agreement Fees and Expense Reimbursement\nEach business management agreement between RMR LLC and a Managed Equity REIT provides for (i) an annual base management fee, payable monthly in\narrears, and (ii) an annual incentive business management fee.\nThe annual base management fee generally is calculated as the lesser of:\n• the sum of (a) 0.5% of the historical cost of transferred real estate assets, if any, as defined in the applicable business management agreement, plus (b)\n0.7% of the average invested capital (exclusive of the transferred real estate assets), as defined in the applicable business management agreement, up to\n$250.0 million, plus (c) 0.5% of the average invested capital exceeding $250.0 million; and\n• the sum of (a) 0.7% of the average market capitalization, as defined in the applicable business management agreement, up to $250.0 million, plus (b) 0.5%\nof the average market capitalization exceeding $250.0 million.\n4\nTable of Contents\nThe annual incentive business management fee payable by each Managed Equity REIT, if any, is calculated as follows:\n• The incentive business management fee is calculated as an amount equal to 12.0% of the product of (a) the equity market capitalization of the Managed\nEquity REIT, as defined in the applicable business management agreement, on the last trading day of the year immediately prior to the measurement\nperiod, and (b) the amount, expressed as a percentage, by which the Managed Equity REIT’s total return per share realized by its common shareholders\n(i.e. share price appreciation plus dividends) or the “total return per share,” exceeds the total shareholder return of a specified REIT index, the “benchmark\nreturn per share,” for the relevant measurement period, with each of (a) and (b) subject to adjustments for net common shares issued by the Managed\nEquity REIT during the measurement period.\n• The measurement period for an annual incentive business management fee is defined as the three year period ending on December 31 of the year for which\nsuch fee is being calculated.\n• The specified REIT index utilized to calculate the benchmark return per share for each of our Managed Equity REITs when calculating the incentive\nbusiness management fees is as follows:\nDHC MSCI U.S. REIT/Health Care Index\nILPT MSCI U.S. REIT/Industrial REIT Index\nOPI MSCI U.S. REIT/Office REIT Index\nSVC MSCI U.S. REIT/Hotel & Resort REIT Index\n• No incentive business management fee is payable by the Managed Equity REIT unless its total return per share during the measurement period is positive.\n• If the Managed Equity REIT’s total return per share exceeds 12% per year in the measurement period, the benchmark return per share is adjusted to be the\nlesser of the total shareholder return of the specified REIT index for such measurement period and 12% per year, or the “adjusted benchmark return per\nshare.” In instances where the adjusted benchmark return per share applies, the incentive fee will be reduced if the Managed Equity REIT’s total return per\nshare is between 200 basis points and 500 basis points below the specified REIT index in any year, by a low return factor, as defined in the applicable\nbusiness management agreement, and there will be no incentive business management fee paid if, in these instances, the Managed Equity REIT’s total\nreturn per share is more than 500 basis points below the specified REIT index in any year, determined on a cumulative basis (i.e., between 200 basis points\nand 500 basis points per year multiplied by the number of years in the measurement period and below the applicable market index).\n• The incentive business management fee payable by the Managed Equity REIT is subject to a cap equal to the value of the number of its common shares\nwhich would, after issuance, represent (a) 1.5% of the number of its common shares outstanding on December 31 of the year for which such fee is being\ncalculated multiplied by (b) the average closing price of its common shares during the 10 consecutive trading days having the highest average closing\nprices during the final 30 trading days of the relevant measurement period.\n• Incentive fees paid by the Managed Equity REIT for any measurement period may be subject to certain “clawback” if the financial statements of the\nManaged Equity REIT for that measurement period are restated due to material non-compliance with any financial reporting requirements under the\nsecurities laws as a result of the bad faith, fraud, willful misconduct or gross negligence of RMR LLC and the amount of the incentive fee paid by the\nManaged Equity REIT was greater than the amount it would have paid based on the restated financial statements.\nIf the business management agreement is terminated, the base business management fee and incentive business management fee due in respect of any partial\nperiod prior to the date of termination will be prorated as provided in the agreement.\nUnder each business management agreement: the Managed Equity REIT pays or reimburses RMR LLC for all of the expenses relating to the Managed Equity\nREIT’s activities, including the costs and expenses of investigating, acquiring, owning and disposing of its real estate (third party property diligence costs,\nappraisal, reporting, audit and legal fees), its costs of borrowing money, its costs of securities listing, transfer, registration and compliance with reporting\nrequirements and its costs of third party professional services, including legal and accounting fees, and as otherwise agreed;

In addition, each management agreement provides\nthat any disputes, as defined in those agreements, arising out of or relating to the agreement or the provision of services pursuant thereto, upon the demand of a\nparty to the dispute, will be subject to mandatory arbitration in accordance with procedures provided in the agreement.\nOther Management Agreements\nRMR LLC provides services and earns fees pursuant to management agreements with ABP Trust regarding AlerisLife; with Sonesta; and until May 15, 2023,\nwith TA.

For a discussion of our organizational structure, see Part I, Item 1 “Business\n– Our Organizational Structure” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2019.\n7\nTable of Contents\nRegulation\nWe and our clients are subject to supervision and regulation by state, federal and non-U.S. governmental authorities and are subject to various laws and judicial\nand administrative decisions imposing various requirements and restrictions upon the ways in which we and our clients do business including various requirements\nfor public disclosure of our and their activities.\nThe Managed Equity REITs and SEVN, or the Managed REITs, have qualified and expect to continue to qualify to be taxed as REITs under Sections 856\nthrough 860 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the Code. In addition, the Managed REITs generally distribute 100.0% of their taxable income to\navoid paying corporate federal income taxes; and as REITs, such companies generally must currently distribute, at a minimum, an amount equal to 90.0% of their\ntaxable income. REITs are also subject to a number of organizational and operational requirements in order to elect and maintain REIT status, including share\nownership tests and assets and gross income composition tests. If a Managed REIT fails to continue to qualify as a REIT under Sections 856 through 860 of the\nCode in any taxable year, it will be subject to federal income tax (including any applicable alternative minimum tax) on its taxable income at regular corporate tax\nrates. Even if a Managed REIT qualifies for taxation as a REIT, it may be subject to state and local income taxes and to federal income tax and excise tax on its\nundistributed income.\nCertain of our clients own or operate healthcare and senior living properties. These companies are subject to numerous federal, state and local laws and\nregulations that are subject to frequent and material changes (sometimes applied retroactively) resulting from legislation, adoption of rules and regulations and\nadministrative and judicial interpretations of existing laws.

Employees of Tremont may also act as transaction originators for its non-investment advisory clients, which we refer to as the Tremont business. These\nactivities result in certain aspects of our asset management business being supervised by the SEC and requires our compliance with numerous obligations, including\nrecord keeping requirements, operational procedures and disclosure obligations. SEVN intends to conduct its business in a manner that does not require its\nregistration under the Investment Company Act of 1940, or the 1940 Act, and to do so, may rely on any available exemption from registration, or exclusion from the\ndefinition of “investment company,” under the 1940 Act. To maintain this exemption from registration, SEVN will be required to ensure the composition of its\nportfolio complies with certain tests.\nThe ownership and operation of real estate properties are subject to various federal, state and local laws and regulations concerning the protection of the\nenvironment, including air and water quality, hazardous or toxic substances and health and safety. Certain of our clients own real estate, and we may be responsible\nfor compliance with some of these environmental protection laws.\nWhile we incur significant expense to comply with the various regulations to which we and our clients are subject, we do not believe that existing statutes and\nregulations have had a material adverse effect on our business. However, it is not possible to forecast the nature of future legislation, regulations, judicial decisions,\norders or interpretations, nor their impact upon our future business, financial condition, results of operations or prospects.\nCompetition\nThe asset management industry is intensely competitive, and we expect it to remain so. Our continued growth will depend upon our ability to manage or assist\nour clients in an effective manner and identify and execute on opportunities to expand our services to new clients and new sources of capital.\nOur existing clients face significant competition in their respective sectors or industries. The Managed Equity REITs compete on a national and regional basis\nwith many third parties engaged in real estate investment activities including other publicly traded REITs, non-traded REITs, commercial and investment banking\nfirms, private institutional funds, private equity funds and other investors. AlerisLife competes with numerous other companies that provide senior living services,\nincluding home healthcare companies and other real estate based service providers. Sonesta competes with other hotel operators and franchisors. RMR Residential\ncompetes with numerous other companies that provide management services to multifamily residential communities in the Sunbelt region of the United States.\nSEVN competes on a national and regional\n8\nTable of Contents\nbasis with a variety of institutional investors, including other REITs, specialty finance companies, public and private funds (including funds or investors that we or\nour affiliates may sponsor, advise or manage), banks, credit unions, insurance companies and other financial institutions.\nWe compete with other businesses in the real estate management and asset management businesses. Many of these competitors may have greater financial,\ntechnical, marketing and other resources than we or our clients have. Such competitors may also enjoy significant competitive advantages that result from, among\nother things, a lower cost of capital, greater business scale and enhanced operating efficiencies. Certain competitors may also be subject to different regulatory\nregimes or rules that may allow them more flexibility or better access to pursue potential investments and raise capital for themselves or their managed companies.\nIn addition, certain competitors may have higher risk tolerance, different risk assessments or lower return thresholds, which could allow them to consider a broader\nrange of investments and to bid more aggressively for investment opportunities. Our ability and the ability of our clients to continue to compete effectively will\ndepend in large part upon the ability to attract, retain and motivate employees.\nCorporate Sustainability\nOver our more than three decades in business, we and our clients have been guided by Environmental, Social and Governance, or ESG, principles. Given the\nmagnitude of our platform, we believe corporate sustainability must be a strategic focus alongside our focus on economic performance. Our sustainability practices\n— minimizing our impact on the environment, embracing the communities where we operate and attracting top professionals — are critical elements supporting our\nlong-term success.\nEnvironmental Focus\nWe recognize our responsibility to minimize the impact of our business on the environment. We seek to preserve natural resources and maximize efficiencies in\norder to reduce the impact the properties we manage have on the planet. Our environmental sustainability strategies and best practices help to mitigate our managed\nproperties’ environmental footprint, optimize operational efficiency and enhance our competitiveness in the marketplace.\nWe remain committed to our “Zero Emissions Promise” announced in 2022, which is our organization’s goal of net zero by 2050 and a 50% reduction by 2029\nfrom a 2019 baseline as it relates to scope 1 and 2 emissions, for all properties where we directly manage energy. We anticipate emissions reductions will occur\nthrough a combination of strategic capital investments in energy efficiency by the Managed Equity REITs, stakeholder engagement to promote sustainable behavior,\nthe deployment of on site solar and the purchase of energy from renewable sources. We believe our efforts toward these goals will add value to our clients’\nproperties, benefit tenants by lowering their operating costs, drive sustainable economic returns and address investor demands that our clients have viable strategies\nto mitigate climate risk. We have made significant progress to date, achieving an overall reduction in emissions of 33%.\nWe have an active pipeline of commercial real estate development projects and maintain a green and energy-efficient equipment purchasing guideline which\nmandates the use of high energy efficiency equipment and environmentally friendly materials for new developments and major asset refurbishments. Our risk\nmitigation practices, such as energy management programs, green purchasing and high-efficiency equipment guidelines, performance benchmarking, and policy\ntracking and climate-related emergency preparedness, are well-established, while the data we obtain to assess future climate change exposure continues to evolve.\nWe drive value, manage risk and benchmark the performance of our managed properties by effectively capturing and managing data through real-time energy\nmonitoring, or RTM. Our cloud-based system connects building automation systems to a central supervisor. RTM facilitates advanced data analytics and access to\ndetect faults and inefficiencies in equipment operations faster, meanwhile enhancing building system control in a cost-effective and scalable way. In 2024, we\nexpanded this program to include fault detection and diagnostics, with the aim of accelerating our identification of energy and emissions reduction opportunities.\nWe launched this program in 2017 and it is now deployed in 82 managed properties, totaling approximately 63% of our managed annual electricity spend as of the\nend of 2023. We continue to expand our RTM program and remain committed to a goal of monitoring 90% of our managed energy spend through RTM by the end\nof 2025, resulting in operational savings and reduced equipment wear and tear, while maintaining high tenant comfort.\nOur energy performance programs drive down energy consumption and reduce carbon emissions of our managed properties. Lower energy use and emissions\nreduce our managed properties' potential exposure to policies that call for a carbon tax or other emissions-based penalties.\n9\nTable of Contents\nOur existing business practices align with the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures, or TCFD, framework across both physical and transition\nrisks and opportunities. We have strengthened our alignment with the TCFD by advancing the depth of our alignment with all four pillars of the TCFD framework\nand we developed a tool to help assess building energy and emissions performance standards across the U.S. This tool overlays property locations, size and use\nprofiles with laws requiring energy, water and emissions reporting or energy and emissions performance standards, and forecasts future compliance risks. We\ncontinue to refine our long-standing engineering, operating and management practices that incorporate environmental resilience and risk mitigation with activities\nand technology related to management oversight, enhanced data gathering, assessing risks and opportunities, and adopting science-based emissions targets.\nAs a result of our sustainability initiatives, we and our managed properties have received honors from The Building Owners and Managers Association, or\nBOMA, The Environmental Protection Agency, or EPA, and the U.S. Green Building Council, or USGBC, amongst others. In 2023, the honors achieved by our\nclients included 70 BOMA 360 Certified Properties, 88 ENERGY STAR Certified Properties, 87 LEED Certified Properties and 22 National Wildlife Sanctuary\nSites Certified Properties. Finally, for the sixth year in a row, we received the 2024 ENERGY STAR Partner of the Year Award, and for the seventh year in a row,\nOPI received the 2024 ENERGY STAR Partner of the Year Award.\nHuman Capital Resources and Governance\nWe are led by an experienced management team with proven ability to manage and grow a resilient business. Moreover, significant insider ownership and the\nstructure of the contracts with our clients provide a strong alignment of interests with our clients and with public shareholders. Our organization is focused on the\nassets of our clients and we blend long-term strategic vision with careful execution of day-to-day operations to optimize efficiency and foster the sustainable growth\nof our clients.\nEmployees and Equal Opportunity\nAs of September 30, 2024, RMR LLC employed over 1,000 real estate professionals, including 31% in our corporate offices and 69% across more than 35\noffices throughout the United States. The average tenure of our employees was 5 years. Our employees are the foundation of our success and in many ways our\nmost critical asset. Our strength lies in the collective experience of a diverse and inclusive workplace. We ensure employees receive competitive salaries and\nbenefits and we aim to attract professionals who will uphold our values of social and environmental stewardship.\nWe are an equal opportunity employer, with all qualified applicants receiving consideration for employment without regard to race, color, religion, sex, sexual\norientation, gender identity, national origin, disability or protected veteran status. Throughout our organization, including our Board, we are committed to racial\nequality and fostering a culture of diversity and inclusion. We have made diversity and inclusion an important part of our hiring, retention and development\nprograms. As of September 30, 2024, 39% of our employees were women and 44% were members of minority communities underrepresented in commercial real\nestate.\nBoard Diversity\nAs of September 30, 2024, our Board of Directors composition included 50% of members from underrepresented communities, including 33% female and 17%\nAfrican American.\nEmployee Engagement, Education and Training\nOur employee engagement initiatives align with our goal of being an employer of choice with a thriving workforce that encourages career enrichment and\npositions us for growth. Our programs are carefully designed for hiring, developing and retaining the best talent in the real estate industry. In connection with the\nacquisition of MPC, we added approximately 500 employees and integrated these employees into our organization. Our compensation is designed to motivate and\nretain employees and align their interests with those of our clients. We believe our compensation and benefits are best in class and are consistent with companies in\nthe alternative asset management industry. We periodically review the effectiveness and competitiveness of our compensation program.\nOur recruiting programs, on-boarding and retention programs and our development and on-going training programs currently include the following:\n• Managing with Impact: Since 2016, we hosted Managing with Impact workshops for managers throughout the company to expand their perspectives and\nincrease their confidence as a new manager. Within their first year, managers complete the workshop and learn how to effectively delegate, solve problems\nand give meaningful performance feedback.\n10\nTable of Contents\n• Tuition Reimbursement Program: We offer tuition assistance up to $20,000 annually for work-related education from accredited colleges and universities\nin order to deepen employees’ skill sets and support personal enrichment.\n• Analyst Accelerator Internship Program: We established an Analyst Accelerator Internship Program which is designed to attract early career talent to our\nindustry from backgrounds underrepresented in real estate. The 10-week program is built upon the premise that hands on exposure as an analyst is an ideal\nway to provide rising juniors or seniors with a solid first step toward a successful and lasting career in real estate. We actively recruit talent from college\ncampuses and student communities interested in real estate who are traditionally underrepresented in the sector, including women and people of color.\nRelationships with programs like the University of Massachusetts Amherst Real Estate Program, involvement with Historically Black Colleges and\nUniversities, and engagement with women’s career forums all amplify our outreach efforts to develop a robust and diverse talent pipeline.\n• Engineering Apprenticeship Program: Given the increasing challenges within the real estate industry of attracting qualified engineers throughout the\ncountry, we made it a strategic focus to develop the next generation of qualified building engineers. Our Engineering Apprenticeship Program standardizes\nthe recruitment and development of engineering candidates to prepare them for open positions and to plan for future engineering needs. We recruit from\nvarious trade schools and job fairs to identify candidates for the two-year program with a curriculum that includes specific onboarding plans for training in\nelectrical, HVAC, or plumbing trades and covers a range of essential engineering staff development topics.\n• Industry Associations & Credentials: In order to further their professional development, many of our employees seek out credentials and association\nmemberships, with any membership costs reimbursed by us. Examples of credentials and association memberships include: BOMA membership, Certified\nProperty Manager, Certified Public Accountant, Certified Apartment Manager, Certified Apartment Portfolio Supervisor and National Association of\nIndustrial and Office Properties.\nInternet Website\nOur internet website address is www.rmrgroup.com.

Risk Factors\nSummary of Risk Factors\nOur business is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties. The following is a summary of the principal risk factors described in this section:\n• unfavorable market and industry conditions may have a material adverse effect on our and our clients’ results of operations, financial condition and ability\nto pay dividends;\n• most of our revenues are derived from services to a limited number of clients;\n• our management fees from our clients are based, in general, on cost of assets, enterprise values, shareholder returns, rent income, construction projects or\ncertain revenues, as applicable, and, accordingly our future revenues, income and cash flows will decline if the business activities, assets, enterprise values,\nshareholder returns, rent income, construction projects or certain revenues of our clients decline;\n• our revenues may be highly variable;\n• potential terminations of our management agreements with our clients;\n• our ability to successfully grow the RMR Residential business and realize our expected returns on our investment within the anticipated timeframe;\n• the ability of Tremont Realty Capital to identify and close suitable investments for our Real Estate Lending Venture and to monitor, service and administer\nexisting investments;\n• our ability to obtain capital from third party investors in our Real Estate Lending Venture to make additional investments and to increase potential returns;\n• uncertainty surrounding interest rates and sustained high interest rates may significantly impact our clients and in turn adversely impact our revenues or\nimpede our growth;\n• our ability to expand our business depends upon the growth and performance of our clients and our ability to obtain or create new clients for our business,\nincluding through our acquisition of new businesses, and is often dependent upon circumstances beyond our control;\n• our ability to continue to pay a regular quarterly dividend is dependent on many factors, including current and expected earnings and alternative uses for\navailable cash and our Board of Directors may decide to lower our dividends;\n• our and our operating company clients’ ability to attract, retain and motivate sufficient qualified personnel in a challenging labor market and to effectively\nmanage our and our operating company clients’ labor costs;\n• our ability to retain the services of our controlling shareholder and other key and talented personnel;\n• our and our clients’ risks associated with our and their costs of compliance with laws and regulations, including securities regulations, exchange listing\nstandards and other laws and regulations affecting public companies;\n• our ESG initiatives, federal and state regulations, other requirements and investor expectations may impose additional costs and expose us and our clients\nto new risks;\n• risks related to the security of our network and information technology;\n• risks related to inflation, including inflation impacting wages and employee benefits;\n12\nTable of Contents\n• risks related to acquisitions, dispositions and other activities by or among our clients;\n• allegations, even if untrue, of any conflicts of interest arising from our management activities; and\n• risks to holders of our Class A Common Shares as a result of our dual class capital structure.\nProspective investors should carefully consider the risks described in this section, together with all of the other information in this Annual Report on Form 10-\nK. These risks may not be the only risks we face but are risks we believe may be material at this time. Additional risks and uncertainties that we do not yet know of,\nor that we currently think are immaterial, may also impair our business operations or financial results. If any of the events or circumstances described in this section\noccur, our business, financial condition or results of operations and the trading price of our securities could decline. Investors and prospective investors should\nconsider these risks, the information contained under the heading “Warning Concerning Forward-Looking Statements” and the risks described elsewhere in this\nAnnual Report on Form 10-K before deciding whether to invest in our securities. We may update these risk factors in our future periodic reports.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nUnfavorable market and industry conditions may have a material adverse effect on our and our clients’ results of operations, financial condition and\nability to pay dividends.\nOur business and operations may be adversely affected by market and economic volatility experienced by the U.S. and global economies, the commercial real\nestate industry and/or the local economies in the markets in which our clients’ properties are located. Unfavorable economic and industry conditions may be due to,\namong other things, uncertainty surrounding interest rates, prolonged inflation, labor market challenges, supply chain disruptions, volatility in the public equity and\ndebt markets, pandemics, geopolitical instability and tensions (such as the ongoing wars in Ukraine and the Middle East), possible economic recession, changes in\nreal estate utilization and other conditions beyond our control. These current conditions, or similar conditions existing in the future, have adversely affected, and\nmay continue to adversely affect, our and our clients’ and their tenants and managers’ results of operations, financial condition and ability to pay dividends.\nUnfavorable market conditions have particularly impacted the office sector as sustained low occupancy in office properties, reduced values of these properties and\nlimited acquisition and disposition volume continue to negatively affect our clients that own office properties. Unfavorable market conditions and the impact on the\ncommercial real estate industry have negatively impacted, and may continue to negatively impact, our clients’ market capitalizations, revenues, construction\nprojects and acquisition and disposition activity, which may reduce the fees we earn from them. These conditions may also give rise to an increase in defaults under\nour clients’ leases and loans, negatively impact market capitalizations, shareholder returns, rent income and construction projects for the Managed Equity REITs\nand acquisition and disposition activity of, financial performance of and returns for our Private Capital clients. Sustained high interest rates may increase the cost of\nour clients’ capital, reduce their ability to make acquisitions and to make dispositions at favorable prices, and have increased their debt service costs. Sustained high\ninterest rates also may reduce dispositions by the Managed Equity REITs due to their forgoing property sales because of depressed asset valuations and reduced\nbuyer demand or more costly acquisition financing for buyers, which could limit our clients’ ability to reduce leverage and recycle capital. Further, unfavorable\nmarket conditions have negatively impacted the stock price of some of the Managed Equity REITs, which in turn has negatively impacted the fees we earn from\nthem. In addition, some of our clients may be negatively impacted by an economic downturn that reduces business and leisure travel, commerce, hotel occupancy\nand demand for office, retail and industrial space, and may also limit the ability of residents and potential residents to pay for senior living community services.\nMost of our revenues are derived from our provision of management services to a limited number of companies. The loss or decline in business or assets of any\nof the Managed Equity REITs or clients comprising a significant part of our Private Capital business could substantially reduce our revenues.\nThe fees we earn from providing management services to, and the reimbursable fees we receive from, the Managed Equity REITs comprise most of our\nrevenues. However, our Private Capital clients have comprised an increasing portion of our assets under management and revenues, and our current business plans\ncontemplate that trend continuing. A decline in the business or assets of our Private Capital clients could reduce our revenue. Our operating results and our ability to\nmaintain and grow our revenues depend upon the ability of our Managed Equity REITs to maintain and grow their investments and market capitalizations and to\nachieve positive shareholder returns in excess of applicable REIT total shareholder return indexes. Additionally, our operating results and ability to maintain or\ngrow revenue also increasingly depend on the ability of our Private Capital clients to raise or contribute capital to invest in real estate assets. Reduced business\nactivities of the Managed Equity REITs or our Private Capital clients may materially reduce our revenues and our profitability.\n13\nTable of Contents\nOur revenues may be highly variable.\nRMR LLC’s business management agreement with each Managed Equity REIT provides for a base business management fee that is based on the lower of the\naverage historical costs of the Managed Equity REIT’s assets under management and its average market capitalization, as calculated in accordance with the\napplicable business management agreement, and an incentive business management fee that is based on the Managed Equity REIT’s relative outperformance of a\nspecified REIT total shareholder return index. The management fees we earn under these agreements are highly variable.\nThe base business management fee payable by a Managed Equity REIT may increase or decrease materially as the Managed Equity REIT acquires or disposes\nof real estate assets or its market capitalization increases or decreases. In addition, we generally only earn an incentive business management fee under our business\nmanagement agreement with a Managed Equity REIT if it outperforms an identified REIT total shareholder return index during the measurement period and certain\nother conditions are satisfied, as measured at the end of the applicable measurement period. The shareholder returns realized by a Managed Equity REIT, its market\ncapitalization and its ability to raise capital or make investments may be impacted by trends in the Managed Equity REIT’s portfolio, the U.S. commercial real\nestate industry generally, the Managed Equity REIT’s industry specifically or other factors that are outside of our or its control, including prolonged inflation,\nsustained high interest rates, supply chain challenges and economic downturns or recessions. Whether we earn an incentive fee, and the amount of any incentive fee\nwe may earn, may have a significant impact on the amount of revenues we earn. For example, in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2019, our incentive business\nmanagement fees earned from the Managed Equity REITs was 39.9% of our total management and advisory services revenues, and we have not subsequently\nearned any incentive business management fees from the Managed Equity REITs. Further, the fees we earn under our property management agreements with the\nManaged Equity REITs and certain of our Private Capital clients are based on a percentage of the rents they receive and a percentage of the costs of construction, in\neach case, at properties we manage for them. To the extent the Managed Equity REITs or certain Private Capital clients receive less rent or incur less construction\ncosts, our property management fee revenues are negatively impacted. Also, the fees under our management agreements with respect to AlerisLife and Sonesta are\nbased on a percentage of revenues earned by them or generated at the properties they operate. AlerisLife and Sonesta experienced high revenue volatility in the past,\nand, given the nature of AlerisLife and Sonesta’s businesses (i.e., senior living communities and hotels), may continue to experience revenue volatility for the\nreasonably foreseeable future.\nThe fees we earn and expect to earn from RMR Residential include promote fees on new co-investments and such fees may be highly variable. The number and\ntiming of new co-investments may vary depending on market opportunities, changes in interest rates, demand for multifamily and commercial real estate in general\nand other factors that may be out of our control.\nOur management agreements with our clients are subject to termination.\nOur management agreements with our clients may be terminated by a client or by us in certain circumstances. For example, if we do not satisfy the applicable\nperformance measures for three consecutive calendar years under our management agreements with the Managed Equity REITs, such Managed Equity REIT will\nhave the right to terminate its management agreement by prior written notice to us within 60 days following the end of the third consecutive calendar year, and in\nwhich case, it would be required to pay us the applicable termination fee. If any of our management agreements with a client is terminated, we may be unable to\nreplace the lost revenue. Even if we receive a termination fee upon the termination of a management agreement with a client, we may be unable to invest the after\ntax proceeds from the termination fee we receive in opportunities that earn returns equal to or greater than the revenues lost as a result of the terminated\nmanagement agreement. The termination of our management agreement with any of our clients could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of\noperations and financial condition.\nWe may be unable to successfully grow the RMR Residential business and achieve the anticipated benefits of the transaction.\nWe may not be able to successfully grow the RMR Residential business or the growth may be more costly or more time-consuming and complex than\nanticipated, and cost savings, synergies and anticipated future financial performance may not be realized or may take longer to realize than expected. In addition,\nthe growth of the RMR Residential business and the time and resources necessary to resume the pace of its acquisition activity may divert our management’s\nattention from our other business opportunities. Our ability to generate revenue from RMR Residential depends on our execution of acquisition opportunities on\nbehalf of the investment funds it manages in the multifamily real estate sector. We do not have significant experience in this commercial real estate sector, and there\ncan be no assurance that we will be successful in this business, that we will achieve our expected objectives, execute acquisition opportunities, operate successfully\nor that we will earn fees from RMR Residential that provide returns on our investment that meet our underwriting expectations. In addition, because RMR\nResidential involves certain joint venture arrangements, investment funds and limited partnerships, we have limited flexibility and discretionary authority with\nrespect to certain assets acquired, or management of assets assumed. Further, in order to grow\n14\nTable of Contents\nthe RMR Residential business we may need to raise additional capital from third party investors and our ability to raise additional capital depends on many factors,\nsome of which are outside of our control. The failure to raise capital in sufficient amounts and on satisfactory terms could result in a decrease in our assets under\nmanagement and our management fees or could result in our being unable to grow the RMR Residential business. Any of the foregoing risks could have a material\nadverse effect on our ability to successfully grow the RMR Residential business and to achieve the anticipated benefits of the transaction.\nWe may not be able to successfully grow our new private capital Real Estate Lending Venture, we have made a limited number of target investments to date and\nwe may not be successful in attracting outside investors.\nIn 2024, we and Tremont Realty Capital, launched our Real Estate Lending Venture which will provide senior secured transitional first mortgage loans for\nmiddle market real estate. We are seeking outside investment partners for this venture and have guaranteed Tremont Realty Capital’s $200 million repurchase\nfacility with UBS AG (the “UBS Master Repurchase Facility”), pursuant to which Tremont Realty Capital may sell to UBS, and later repurchase, commercial\nmortgage loans. In July 2024, RMR LLC funded two first mortgage loans with an aggregate loan value of $67 million that will be included in our Real Estate\nLending Venture’s portfolio. We may be unable to compete with other companies in the middle market mortgage loan business, many of which have significantly\nmore experience and resources than we do. Our ability to achieve our investment objectives depends on our Real Estate Lending Venture’s ability to attract outside\ninvestors and to make investments that generate attractive, risk adjusted returns. In general, the availability of favorable investment opportunities will be affected by\nthe level and volatility of interest rates in the market generally, the availability of adequate short and long term real estate financing and the competition for\ninvestment opportunities. Tremont Realty Capital also provides management services to SEVN and has a policy of allocating investment and loan opportunities\namong its clients on a rotating basis if an opportunity is appropriate for more than one client. The allocation of loan opportunities pursuant to this policy frequently\ninvolves significant and subjective judgments, and Tremont Realty Capital’s allocation of loan opportunities may be perceived to favor one client at the expense of\nanother. Further, we may not be successful in attracting outside investors to invest in our Real Estate Lending Venture. If we are successful in attracting third party\ninvestors to our Real Estate Lending Venture, the joint venture structure may limit our flexibility with jointly owned investments and subject us to certain risks\nrelating to joint venture relationships. There can be no assurance that our Real Estate Lending Venture will obtain sufficient capital from outside investors within a\nreasonable time and on acceptable terms, that Tremont Realty Capital will make suitable investments and successfully monitor, service and administer existing\ninvestments or that our Real Estate Lending Venture will successfully compete in the mortgage lending business and provide a return on our investment that meets\nour expectations.\nUncertainty surrounding interest rates and sustained high interest rates may significantly reduce our revenues or impede our growth.\nUncertainty surrounding interest rates and sustained high interest rates or interest rate reductions may significantly reduce our revenues or impede our growth.\nIn response to significant and prolonged increases in inflation, the Federal Reserve raised interest rates eleven times during 2022 and 2023 and then paused rate\nincreases in the fourth quarter of 2023 following the deceleration of inflationary growth. The Federal Reserve cut interest rates in September 2024, and it may seek\nto further reduce interest rates, increase interest rates or maintain current interest rates. The timing, number and amount of any future interest rate changes are\nuncertain.\nIncreases in interest rates and sustained high interest rates may materially and negatively affect us. One of the factors that investors typically consider important\nin deciding whether to buy or sell the common shares of our Managed REITs is the distribution rate with respect to such shares relative to prevailing interest rates.\nIf interest rates go up, investors may expect a higher distribution rate before investing in a Managed REIT or they may sell the Managed REITs’ common shares and\nseek alternate investments with a higher distribution rate. Several of the Managed Equity REITs have reduced their quarterly dividend to $0.01 per share in recent\nyears. Sales of common shares of the Managed Equity REITs may cause a decline in the market prices of such shares, which reduces the market capitalizations and\ntotal shareholder returns of the Managed Equity REITs, which, in turn, may materially reduce the fees we earn under our business management agreements with\nthem. Moreover, the increases in interest rates has led to increased borrowing costs for our clients and may negatively impact their access to capital to fund future\ngrowth or refinance debt, reduce their earnings and total shareholder returns and cause the Managed REITs’ and our real estate business Private Capital vehicles’\ntenants, operators and borrowers and SEVN’s borrowers to default on their rent and debt obligations, which may materially reduce the fees we earn under our\nmanagement agreements with our clients. Further, during periods of increased borrowing costs, real estate transaction volumes often slow along with real estate\nvaluation growth which may impact the results of operation of our clients and the fees we earn from those clients.\n15\nTable of Contents\nIf we cannot retain and motivate our key and talented personnel and recruit, retain and motivate new talented personnel, our business, operating results and\nfinancial condition could be adversely affected.\nOur people are the foundation of our success and in many ways our most critical asset. Our continued success depends to a great extent on our ability to retain\nand motivate our key and talented personnel and strategically recruit, retain and motivate new talented personnel. However, we may not be successful in these\nefforts as the market for qualified employees in the asset management industry is highly competitive. We do not have employment agreements with our key\nemployees. Our ability to recruit, retain and motivate our personnel is dependent on our ability to offer attractive compensation, opportunities for professional\ngrowth and a desirable work environment. In addition, the Managed REITs have historically granted equity awards to our officers and certain other employees of\nours. If our clients reduce the amount of, or stop making, similar grants in the future, or if the value of any equity awards they may grant are lower than anticipated,\nwe may need to increase other compensation or incentives for our employees. Likewise, if competition for employees increases, in order to recruit and retain\nexisting and future personnel, we may need to increase the level of compensation that we pay.\nWe depend on our controlling shareholder and other key and talented personnel.\nWe depend on the efforts, skills, reputations and business contacts of our controlling shareholder, Adam D. Portnoy, and other key and talented personnel. The\nextent and nature of the experience of our executive officers and of the relationships they have with real estate professionals and financial institutions, although not\na guarantee of positive results, are critical to the success of our business. The loss of the services of any of them or the loss of investor confidence in such personnel\ncould have a material adverse effect on our revenues, operating income and cash flows and could impair our ability to maintain or grow assets under management in\nour clients or otherwise maintain or grow our business.\nWe are subject to substantial regulation and numerous contractual obligations and internal policies, and failure to comply with these provisions could have a\nmaterial adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are subject to substantial regulation and numerous contractual obligations and internal policies. We are subject to regulation by the SEC, Nasdaq, and other\nfederal, state and local or international governmental bodies and agencies or self-regulatory organizations. Our subsidiary, Tremont Realty Capital, is registered\nwith the SEC as an investment adviser under the Investment Advisers Act. The Investment Advisers Act requires registered investment advisers to comply with\nnumerous obligations, including compliance, record keeping, operating and marketing requirements, disclosure obligations and limitations on certain activities.\nInvestment advisers also may owe fiduciary duties to certain of their clients.\nWe are also responsible for managing or assisting with the regulatory aspects of certain of our clients, including the Managed REITs’ compliance with\napplicable REIT rules and SEVN’s maintenance of its exemption from registration under the 1940 Act. The level of regulation and supervision to which we and our\nclients are subject varies from jurisdiction to jurisdiction and is based on the type of business activity involved. For example, our Real Estate Lending Venture and\nSEVN may also be subject to state licensing requirements to conduct lending activities. The regulations to which we and our clients are subject are extensive,\ncomplex and require substantial management time and attention. In addition, regulatory oversight and enforcement may increase and become more rigorous. Our or\nour clients’ failure to comply with any of the regulations, contractual obligations or policies applicable to it may subject us to litigation, extensive investigations,\nenforcement actions, as well as substantial fines, penalties and reputational risk, and our business and operations could be materially adversely affected.\nOur lack of compliance with applicable law could result in, among other things, our inability to enforce contracts, our default under contracts (including our\nmanagement agreements with our clients) and our ineligibility to contract with, and receive revenue from, governmental authorities and agencies, our clients or\nother third parties.\nWe have numerous contractual obligations with which we must comply on a continuous basis to operate our business, the default of which could have a\nmaterial adverse effect on our business and financial condition. We have established internal policies designed to ensure that we manage our business in accordance\nwith applicable law and regulation and in accordance with our contractual obligations. These internal policies may not be effective in all regards; and, if we fail to\ncomply with our internal policies, we could be subjected to additional risk and liability.\nESG initiatives, requirements and market expectations may impose additional costs and expose us and our clients to new risks.\nThere remains a continued focus from regulators, investors, certain of our clients’ tenants, managers, borrowers, customers, employees, and other stakeholders\nconcerning corporate sustainability. For example, California has enacted a climate focused disclosure law and the SEC has adopted climate change related\nregulations, both of which will require us to focus significant time and resources on behalf of ourselves and our clients to comply with these new requirements if\nand when such regulations\n16\nTable of Contents\nbecome effective, and we and these clients may incur significant costs in compliance with such rules. Some investors may use ESG factors to guide their investment\nstrategies and, in some cases, may choose not to invest in us or our clients, or otherwise do business with us or our clients, if they believe our or their policies\nrelating to corporate responsibility are inadequate. Third party providers of corporate responsibility ratings and reports on companies have increased in number,\nresulting in varied and in some cases inconsistent standards. In addition, the criteria by which companies’ corporate responsibility practices are assessed are\nevolving, which could result in greater expectations of us and our clients and cause us and our clients to undertake costly initiatives to satisfy such new criteria.\nAlternatively, if we or our clients elect not to or are unable to satisfy such new criteria or do not meet the criteria of a specific third party provider, some investors\nmay conclude that our or their policies with respect to corporate responsibility are inadequate. Pursuant to our zero emissions goal, we have pledged to reduce our\nscope 1 and 2 emissions to net zero by 2050 with a 50% reduction commitment by 2029 from a 2019 baseline. We and our clients may face reputational damage in\nthe event that our or their corporate responsibility procedures or standards do not meet the goals we or they have set or the standards set by various constituencies.\nIf we and our clients fail to comply with ESG related regulations and to satisfy the expectations of investors and our clients’ tenants, managers, borrowers,\ncustomers, employees and other stakeholders or our or our clients’ announced goals and other initiatives are not executed as planned, our and our clients’ reputation\nand financial results could be adversely affected, the management fees we may earn from our clients may decline, and our revenues, results of operations and ability\nto grow our business may be negatively impacted. In addition, we or our clients may incur significant costs in attempting to comply with regulatory requirements,\nESG policies or third party expectations or demands.\nWe and our clients are subject to risks from adverse weather, natural disasters and adverse impact from global climate change.\nWe and our clients are subject to risks and could be exposed to additional costs from adverse weather, natural disasters and adverse impact from global climate\nchange. For example, the properties owned or operated by us or our clients could be severely damaged or destroyed by physical climate risks that could materialize\nas either singular extreme weather events (for example floods, storms and wildfires) or through long-term impacts of climatic conditions (such as precipitation\nfrequency, weather instability and rise of sea levels). Some of our clients and the investment funds and joint ventures we manage own a significant number of\nproperties in the Southeastern United States which has been increasingly impacted by severe weather and rising sea levels in recent years. Severe weather events\nand climatic conditions could also adversely impact us and our clients and cause significant losses if we or our clients, or our or their tenants, managers or\nborrowers are unable to operate their businesses due to damage resulting from such events. Insurance may not sufficiently cover all losses sustained by us or our\nclients and our or their tenants, managers or borrowers. If we or our clients fail to adequately prepare for such events, our and our clients’ revenues, results of\noperations and financial condition may be impacted.\nWe rely on information technology and systems in our operations, and any material failure, inadequacy, interruption or security breach of that technology or\nthose systems could materially harm our business.\nWe rely on information technology and systems, including the Internet and cloud-based infrastructures and services, commercially available software and our\ninternally developed applications, to process, transmit, store and safeguard information and to manage or support a variety of our business processes, including\nfinancial transactions and maintenance of records, which may include personal identifying information of employees, tenants, borrowers and guarantors and lease\ndata. If we experience material failures, inadequacies or interruptions or security breaches of our information technology, we could incur material costs and losses.\nFurther, third party vendors have experienced and could experience similar events with respect to their information technology and systems that impact the products\nand services they provide to us or our clients. We rely on commercially available systems, software, tools and monitoring, as well as our internally developed\napplications and internal procedures and personnel, to provide security for processing, transmitting, storing and safeguarding confidential tenant, customer,\nborrower, guarantor and vendor information, such as personally identifiable information related to our employees and others and information regarding our and our\nclients’ financial accounts. We take various actions, and we incur significant costs, to maintain and protect the operation and security of our information technology\nand systems, including the data maintained in those systems. However, it is possible that these measures will not prevent the systems’ improper functioning or a\ncompromise in security, such as in the event of a cyberattack or the improper disclosure of personally identifiable information. Security breaches, computer viruses,\nattacks by hackers, online fraud schemes and similar breaches have created and can create significant system disruptions, shutdowns, fraudulent transfer of assets or\nunauthorized disclosure of confidential information. The risk of a security breach or disruption, particularly through cyberattack or cyber intrusion, including by\ncomputer hackers, foreign governments and cyber terrorists, has generally increased as the number, intensity and sophistication of attempted attacks and intrusions\nfrom around the world have increased.\nThe cybersecurity risks to us, our clients and third party vendors are heightened by, among other things, the evolving nature of the threats faced, advances in\ncomputer capabilities, new discoveries in the field of cryptography and new and\n17\nTable of Contents\nincreasingly sophisticated methods used to perpetrate illegal or fraudulent activities against us, including cyberattacks, email or wire fraud and other attacks\nexploiting security vulnerabilities in our or other third parties’ information technology networks and systems or operations. Although most of our staff works from\nour offices for the majority of the work week, flexible working arrangements have resulted in increased remote working. This and other possible changing work\npractices have adversely impacted, and may in the future adversely impact, our ability to maintain the security, proper function and availability of our information\ntechnology and systems since remote working by our employees could strain our technology resources and introduce operational risk, including heightened\ncybersecurity risk. Remote working environments may be less secure and more susceptible to hacking attacks, including phishing and social engineering attempts\nthat have sought, and may seek, to exploit remote working environments. In addition, our data security, data privacy, investor reporting and business continuity\nprocesses could be impacted by a third party’s inability to perform in a remote work environment or by the failure of, or attack on, their information systems and\ntechnology.\nIn July 2023, the SEC adopted rules requiring public companies to disclose material cybersecurity incidents on Form 8-K and periodic disclosure of a\nregistrant’s cybersecurity risk management, strategy, and governance in annual reports. The rules became effective beginning with annual reports for fiscal years\nending on or after December 15, 2023 and beginning with Form 8-Ks on December 18, 2023. With the SEC particularly focused on cybersecurity, we expect\nincreased scrutiny of our policies and systems designed to manage our cybersecurity risks and our related disclosures. We also expect to face increased costs to\ncomply with the new SEC rules, including increased costs for cybersecurity training and management. Many jurisdictions in which we operate have laws and\nregulations relating to data privacy, cybersecurity and protection of personal information, including, the California Consumer Privacy Act and the New York\nSHIELD Act. In addition, the SEC has indicated that one of its examination priorities for the Office of Compliance Inspections and Examinations is to continue to\nexamine cybersecurity procedures and controls, including testing the implementation of these procedures and controls.\nAny failure to maintain the security, proper function and availability of our information technology and systems, or certain third party vendors’ failure to\nsimilarly protect their information technology and systems that are relevant to our or our clients’ operations, or to safeguard our or our clients’ business processes,\nassets and information, or any failure to provide the appropriate regulatory and other notifications in a timely manner could result in financial losses, interrupt our\noperations, damage our reputation, cause us to be in default of material contracts and subject us to liability claims or regulatory penalties, any of which could\nmaterially and adversely affect us.\nWe are incorporating artificial intelligence into some of our business workflows and processes, and challenges with properly managing its use could result in\nreputational harm, competitive harm, legal liability, and increased regulatory costs and adversely affect our results of operations.\nWe have begun using AI and machine learning technologies to enhance certain workflows and processes used in our business, and our research into and\ncontinued deployment of such capabilities remain ongoing. AI is still in its early stages, and the introduction and incorporation of AI technologies may result in\nunintended consequences or other new or expanded risks and liabilities. If the content, analyses or recommendations that AI applications assist in producing are, or\nare alleged to be, deficient, inaccurate or biased, such as due to limitations in AI algorithms, insufficient or biased base data or flawed training methodologies, our\nbusiness, financial condition, results of operations and reputation may be adversely affected. Additionally, AI technology is continuously evolving, and we may\nincur costs to adopt and deploy AI technologies that could become obsolete earlier than expected, and there can be no assurance that we will realize the desired or\nanticipated benefits from AI. Also, our competitors or other third parties may incorporate AI into their products and services more quickly or more successfully than\nus, which could impair our ability to compete effectively and adversely affect our results of operations.\nThe use of AI applications to support business processes carries inherent risks related to data privacy and security, such as unintended or inadvertent\ntransmission of proprietary or sensitive information, including personal data. AI presents emerging ethical issues, and we may be unsuccessful in identifying and\nresolving these issues before they arise. If our use of AI becomes controversial, we may experience brand or reputational harm, competitive harm, or legal liability.\nThere is uncertainty in the legal and regulatory landscape for AI, which is not fully developed, and any laws, regulations or industry standards adopted in response\nto the emergence of AI may be burdensome, could entail significant costs, and may restrict or impede our ability to successfully develop, adopt and deploy AI\ntechnologies efficiently and effectively.\nInflation may continue to negatively impact us and our clients and our and their businesses, results of operations and ability to grow.\nInflation remains above historic levels, and the global economy continues to experience commodity pricing and other inflation, including inflation impacting\nwages and employee benefits. It is uncertain whether inflation will decline further, remain relatively steady or increase; however, some market forecasts indicate\nthat inflation rates may remain elevated for a prolonged period. These conditions have increased the costs for materials, other goods and labor, and these rising costs\nare\n18\nTable of Contents\nimpacting us and our clients. For example, various construction supplies and materials have experienced significant price increases as have other commodities, such\nas food and fuel. These pricing increases as well as increases in labor costs have increased the operating costs for us and certain of our clients and tenants, operators\nand borrowers of our clients. If these inflationary pressures continue, we and our clients may reduce or delay construction projects that we oversee, and may realize\ndecreased earnings, negative impacts on their ability to increase or maintain dividends that they pay to their shareholders and reduced market capitalizations. In that\ncase, the management fees we earn may decline and our revenues, results of operations and ability to grow our business may be negatively impacted.\nEmployee misconduct could harm us by subjecting us to significant legal liability, reputational harm and loss of business.\nAs an asset manager, our business, and our ability to retain and attract new clients, is dependent upon our maintaining a positive reputation in the marketplace.\nThere is a risk that our employees could engage in misconduct that adversely affects our reputation and, hence, our business. We are subject to a number of\nobligations and standards arising from our business and our authority over the companies and assets we manage. The violation of these obligations and standards by\nany of our employees may adversely affect our clients and us. Our business often requires that we deal with confidential matters of great significance to our clients.\nIf our employees improperly use or disclose confidential information, we and the concerned client could suffer serious harm to our and its reputation, financial\nposition and current and future business relationships and face potentially significant litigation. It is not always possible to detect or deter employee misconduct,\nand the precautions we take to detect and prevent this activity may not be effective in all cases. In connection with the acquisition of RMR Residential in 2023, we\nadded approximately 500 employees and fully integrating these employees in our organization, compliance systems and culture may take longer than we anticipate.\nIf any of our employees were to engage in or be accused of misconduct, our business and our reputation could be adversely affected. Misconduct by an employee\nmight rise to the level of a default that would permit a client to terminate its management agreements with us for cause and without paying a termination fee, which\ncould materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. Additionally, alleged misconduct by employees providing services to\nproperties managed by the RMR Residential business has and may in the future contribute to the termination of property management agreements with respect to\naffected properties.\nRMR LLC’s required quarterly tax distributions may limit our ability to implement our business or pursue growth opportunities.\nUnder the RMR LLC operating agreement, RMR LLC is required to make certain pro rata distributions to each member of RMR LLC, including RMR Inc.,\nquarterly on the basis of the assumed tax liabilities of the members. If and when federal, state or local governments impose higher income tax rates or increase the\ntaxable base, RMR LLC’s quarterly tax distributions would generally increase accordingly. From time to time, RMR LLC’s cash flows from operations may be\ninsufficient to enable it to make required minimum tax distributions to its members. RMR LLC may have to borrow funds or sell assets to fund its distribution\nrequirements, and thereby materially adversely affect our liquidity and financial condition. Further, by making cash distributions rather than investing that cash in\nour businesses, we might risk slowing the pace of our growth, or not having a sufficient amount of cash to fund our operations, new investments or unanticipated\ncapital expenditures, should the need arise. In such event, we may not be able to implement our business and growth strategy to the extent intended.\nRisks Related to the Businesses of Our Clients\nRisks associated with our clients’ businesses could adversely affect their respective abilities to grow, generate revenue, increase their market capitalizations and\npay management fees.\nWe have presented in this Annual Report on Form 10-K historical fees that we have earned from our clients. The historical fees earned from our clients,\nincluding those presented in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, should not be considered as indicative of the future results of our clients or of our future results. The\nrisks associated with each client’s business could adversely affect its ability to carry out its business plans and objectives, and, as a result, could adversely impact its\nability to pay us management fees or cause the amounts of those fees to decline. For more information see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial\nCondition and Results of Operations—Overview.” Risks to our clients, in addition to the risks noted elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, include, but are\nnot limited to, the following:\n• adverse economic and market conditions;\n• the inability of our clients’ tenants, managers and borrowers to weather the ongoing adverse economic conditions, including uncertainty surrounding\ninterest rates and sustained high interest rates, prolonged inflation, economic downturn and possible recession and thereby impair their ability to pay rent\nand returns and make loan payments;\n19\nTable of Contents\n• the inability of our clients to access debt and equity capital on attractive terms, or at all which could reduce our clients’ ability to pursue acquisition and\ndevelopment opportunities and refinance existing debt, and reduce our clients’ returns from acquisition and development activities and increase their future\ninterest expense;\n• some of our clients have a substantial amount of debt and are subject to additional risks, including the inability to refinance maturing debt and the cost of\nany such refinanced debt, the inability to reduce debt leverage which may remain at or above current levels for an indefinite period, covenants and\nconditions contained in debt agreements which may restrict such clients’ operations by increasing interest expense and limiting such clients’ ability to\nmake investments in their properties, sell properties securing the debt and pay distributions to their shareholders, potential downgrades to credit ratings and\nother limitations on their ability to access capital at reasonable costs or at all, including the limited availability of debt capital to office and healthcare\nREITs in general;\n• our clients face competition for tenants and customers at substantially all of their properties and competing properties may be more attractive to tenants\nand customers;\n• changing market, consumer and workplace practices and trends that have and could continue to result in decreased demand for office space, business\ntravel, hotel stays and conference facilities;\n• our clients face significant competition for investment opportunities from other investors, some of which have greater financial resources, including\npublicly traded REITs, non-traded REITs, insurance companies, banking firms, private institutional funds, private equity funds and other investors;\n• a sustained period of high interest rates and inflation may increase operating costs, reduce the value of properties, increase cost of capital and make raising\ncapital difficult for our clients whereas low interest rates may increase the amount of debt capital available, which may result in declining capitalization\nrates for property acquisitions and impede the growth of our clients’ businesses;\n• RMR Residential’s inability to grow its business and realize expected returns within the anticipated timeframe;\n• Tremont Realty Capital’s ability to identify and close suitable investments for our Real Estate Lending Venture and SEVN and to monitor, service and\nadminister existing investments;\n• our Real Estate Lending Venture’s ability to obtain third party investors in order to attain its target leverage levels, to make additional investments and to\nincrease potential returns;\n• changing general economic and financial market conditions could significantly reduce the value of the real estate, loans and other investments of our\nclients and reduce the amounts earned on those investments;\n• the real estate and real estate related investments of our clients may be less liquid than other investments and the ability of our clients to adjust their\nportfolios in response to changes in economic or other conditions may be limited;\n• our operating company clients’ ability to attract, retain and motivate sufficient qualified personnel in a challenging labor market and to effectively manage\ntheir labor costs;\n• changes in investor preferences or market conditions could limit our clients’ ability to raise capital to competitively maintain their properties and\noperations or make new investments;\n• geopolitical instability and tensions (such as the ongoing wars in Ukraine and the Middle East);\n• shareholder activism, complaints about management strategies and structures, corporate governance and other matters may divert management attention\nand be disruptive to our clients’ operations;\n• ESG initiatives, requirements and market expectations may impose additional costs and expose our clients to new risks;\n• changes in tax laws, regulation or accounting rules may make certain types of investments in or by our clients less valuable;\n• our clients are exposed to environmental, building and other laws, natural disasters, adverse impacts from global climate change and other factors beyond\ntheir control as a result of their investment in real estate;\n20\nTable of Contents\n• public health safety events, such as pandemics, may adversely impact our clients’ business, operating results, financial condition and value;\n• our clients have significant investments in certain types of assets, such as hotels, senior living communities and office, industrial and healthcare properties,\nand market changes which impact these specific types of assets (e.g., a reduction in levels of business travel and occupancy at hotels and senior living\ncommunities as a result of adverse economic and market conditions, tenant and customer trends, new competition for short term accommodations, changes\nin Medicare and Medicaid rates and other regulatory matters, an insufficient recovery or a further reduction in the demand for office space as a result of\nremote, hybrid and other flexible working arrangements, and declining economic activity, oversupply of industrial buildings or technological or market\npractice changes, such as offshoring, reducing the demand for industrial properties) may adversely impact certain of the clients’ ability to maintain or grow\ntheir businesses;\n• our clients with significant investments in office space have and may continue to experience declines in demand for office space consistent with declines in\nthe office space industry generally, as a result of remote, hybrid and other flexible working arrangements which have adversely impacted such clients\noperating results and financial condition;\n• the failure of a Managed REIT to continue to qualify as a REIT would subject it to U.S. federal income tax and reduce cash available for distributions to its\nshareholders, adversely impacting its ability to raise capital and operate its business;\n• the failure of our clients to comply with applicable laws and regulations could result in legal liability, regulatory fines and the loss of, or an inability to\nobtain, licenses required to operate their businesses; and\n• complying with REIT requirements may cause a Managed REIT to forgo otherwise attractive opportunities or liquidate otherwise attractive investments.\nMany of our clients are SEC registrants and file reports with the SEC as required by the Exchange Act. A discussion of the businesses and the risks associated\nwith the businesses of our clients that are SEC registrants is contained in the reports filed by our clients, including in the section captioned “Risk Factors” in each\nManaged REIT’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, as those Risk Factors may have been updated or supplemented in those\ncompanies’ Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q filed subsequently. Copies of these reports are available at the SEC’s website, www.sec.gov.\nRisks Related to Our Securities\nA trading market that provides adequate liquidity may not be sustained for our Class A Common Shares and the market price of our Class A Common\nShares may fluctuate widely.\nOur public float represents about 48.3% of the economic interest in RMR LLC. As a result, a significant amount of the economic interest in RMR LLC is not\nrepresented in our public float, which may adversely impact trading in our Class A Common Shares. There can be no assurance that an active trading market for our\nClass A Common Shares will be sustained in the future.\nThe market price of our Class A Common Shares may fluctuate widely, depending upon many factors, some of which are beyond our control, including, but not\nlimited to, the following:\n• market and economic volatility due to adverse economic, geopolitical and public health conditions and the resulting market disruption on us and our\nclients;\n• declines in the market prices of our clients’ common shares;\n• a relatively thin trading market for our Class A Common Shares could cause trades of small blocks of shares to have a significant impact on the price of\nour Class A Common Shares;\n• our quarterly or annual earnings, or those of other comparable companies;\n• actual or anticipated fluctuations in our operating results;\n• changes in accounting standards, policies, guidance, interpretations or principles;\n• announcements by us, our clients or our competitors of significant investments, acquisitions or dispositions;\n21\nTable of Contents\n• the inclusion, exclusion, or deletion of our Class A Common Shares from any trading indices;\n• the failure of securities analysts to cover our Class A Common Shares;\n• changes in earnings estimates by securities analysts or in our ability to meet those estimates;\n• the operating and stock price performance of other comparable companies;\n• overall market fluctuations; and\n• general economic conditions.\nStock markets in general often experience volatility that is unrelated to the operating performance of a particular company. These broad market fluctuations\nmay adversely affect the trading price of our Class A Common Shares. Our shareholders may not be able to resell their Class A Common Shares following periods\nof volatility because of the market’s adverse reaction to volatility.\nSome investors may not invest in our Class A Common Shares as a result of our dual class capital structure, which may adversely affect the trading price of our\nClass A Common Shares.\nAlthough S&P Dow Jones, a provider of widely followed stock indices, reversed its prior decision to exclude companies with multiple share classes, such as\nours, in certain of their indices, there is no guarantee that our Class A Common Shares will be included in an S&P index, despite their eligibility. The Council on\nInstitutional Investors remains strongly opposed to dual class structures, and some investors may continue to avoid investing in companies with dual class shares,\nparticularly companies that do not include time limits with respect to such dual class structures. In addition, several stockholder advisory firms oppose the use of\nmultiple class structures. As a result, our Class A Common Shares may not be included in certain stock indices and may cause stockholder advisory firms to publish\nnegative commentary about our corporate governance practices or otherwise seek to cause us to change our capital structure. Many investment funds are precluded\nfrom investing in companies that are not included in stock indices, and these funds would be unable to purchase our Class A Common Shares. Exclusion from\nindices could make our Class A Common Shares less attractive to investors and, as a result, the market price of our Class A Common Shares could be adversely\naffected. Additionally, any actions or publications by stockholder advisory firms critical of our corporate governance practices or capital structure could also\nadversely affect the value of our Class A Common Shares.\nOur dividend policy is subject to change.\nRMR Inc. currently plans to pay a regular quarterly cash dividend equal to $0.45 per share ($1.80 per share per year) to holders of its Class A Common Shares.\nHowever, the amount of distributions RMR LLC may make in the future is not certain, and there is no assurance that future distributions will be made. The\ndeclaration and payment of any dividends to our shareholders will be at the discretion of our Board of Directors which considers many factors when setting\ndividend rates including RMR Inc.’s current and expected earnings and the availability of cash to fund dividends as compared to alternative uses of such cash. Our\nBoard of Directors may change the distribution policy or discontinue the payment of dividends at any time. Accordingly, any future dividends may be increased or\ndecreased and there is no assurance as to the rate at which any future dividends will be paid, and they could decline in amount or be suspended or discontinued. Any\nchange in our dividend policy could have a material adverse effect on the market price of our Class A Common Shares.\nRisks Related to Our Relationships with Our Controlling Shareholder and Our Clients\nOur controlling shareholder has voting control over our outstanding capital stock, and our other shareholders will have less influence over our business\nthan shareholders of most other publicly traded companies.\nSubstantially all of the voting power in RMR Inc. and a majority of the economic interest in RMR LLC is held by ABP Trust, an entity controlled by its sole\ntrustee, Adam D. Portnoy. Mr. Portnoy is Chair of our Board of Directors and one of our Managing Directors and is our President and Chief Executive Officer.\nRMR Inc. is the managing member of RMR LLC. As of September 30, 2024, Adam D. Portnoy beneficially owned in aggregate, directly and indirectly through\nABP Trust, a combined direct and indirect 50.9% economic interest in RMR LLC and controlled 91.1% of the aggregate voting power of our outstanding capital\nstock. As a result of this voting control, Adam D. Portnoy is effectively able to determine the outcome of all matters requiring shareholder approval, including, but\nnot limited to, election of our directors. Adam D. Portnoy is able to cause or prevent a change of control of RMR Inc., and this voting control could preclude any\nunsolicited acquisition of RMR Inc. The voting control of Adam D. Portnoy could deprive our shareholders of an opportunity to receive a premium for their Class A\nCommon Shares as part of a sale of us and may affect the market price of our Class A Common Shares.\n22\nTable of Contents\nOur management agreements with the Managed Equity REITs may discourage our change of control.\nEach Managed Equity REIT may terminate its management agreements with us if we experience a change of control, as defined in those agreements, without\npayment of any termination fee. We may be unable to duplicate the long term management arrangements we have with each of the Managed Equity REITs if the\nmanagement agreements were terminated following our change of control. As a result, the management agreements may discourage a change of control of us,\nincluding a change of control which might result in payment of a premium for our Class A Common Shares.\nThe registration of Tremont Realty Capital under the Investment Advisers Act may discourage our change of control.\nOur subsidiary, Tremont Realty Capital, is registered as an investment adviser under the Investment Advisers Act. Any change in control of Tremont Realty\nCapital, as defined in and interpreted pursuant to the Investment Advisers Act, would trigger a shareholder approval right by SEVN shareholders or other advisory\nclients of Tremont Realty Capital as applicable, under that Act. The need for such approval may discourage a change of control of us, including a change of control\nwhich might result in payment of a premium for our Class A Common Shares.\nThe ability of ABP Trust to sell its ownership stake in us and speculation about any such sale may adversely affect the market price of our Class A Common\nShares.\nABP Trust controls 100.0% of our Class B-1 Common Shares (which are exchangeable for Class A Common Shares) and Class B-2 Common Shares, some of\nour currently outstanding Class A Common Shares and approximately 48.6% of our Class A Units of RMR LLC (which ABP Trust may cause RMR LLC to redeem\nfor, at our election, Class A Common Shares on a one for one basis or cash). Thus, a significant portion of our ownership is not trading in the public markets. ABP\nTrust may sell any or all of its Class A Common Shares at any time without approval by our other shareholders. Speculation by the press, stock analysts, our\nshareholders or others regarding the intention of ABP Trust to dispose of Class A Common Shares could adversely affect the market price of our Class A Common\nShares. Moreover, the market price of our Class A Common Shares may be adversely impacted by the fact that a significant amount of our outstanding shares is not\nincluded in the public float of our Class A Common Shares and by our dual-stock structure. Accordingly, our Class A Common Shares may be worth less than they\nwould be if the Class A Common Shares that ABP Trust controls or has a right to acquire were trading in the public markets.\nWe and our clients are party to transactions with related parties that may increase the risk of allegations of conflicts of interest.\nWe and our clients are party to transactions with related parties, including with entities controlled by Adam D. Portnoy and entities that we manage. For\nexample, because of the relationships among us, Adam D. Portnoy, and our clients, the agreements we are party to with them, including our management\nagreements, are among related parties. Our and our clients’ agreements with related parties or in respect of transactions among related parties may not be on terms\nas favorable to us as they would have been if they had been negotiated among unrelated parties. Our shareholders or the shareholders of one or more of our clients\nmay challenge such related party transactions. Although all past challenges have been unsuccessful, if any future challenges to related party transactions were to be\nsuccessful, we or our clients might not realize the benefits expected from the transactions being challenged. Moreover, any such challenge could result in substantial\ncosts and a diversion of our management’s attention, could have a material adverse effect on our or our clients’ reputation, business and growth and could adversely\naffect our or our clients’ ability to realize the benefits expected from the transactions, whether or not the allegations have merit or are substantiated.\nDeclines in revenue, business or assets of a client may result in a corresponding decline or reduced market capitalizations for another client due to their\nbusiness relationships with each other.\nSome of our clients have or have had significant interests in other clients of ours, including ownership interests and business arrangements, and some of our\nclients may in the future have such interests in other clients. For example: Sonesta manages most of SVC’s hotels, and SVC owns approximately 34% of Sonesta’s\noutstanding common stock; and AlerisLife manages many of the senior living communities owned by DHC, and DHC owns approximately 34% of AlerisLife’s\noutstanding common stock. Accordingly, a decline in the performance or prospects of AlerisLife would be expected to adversely impact DHC, and any similar\ndecline of Sonesta would be expected to adversely impact SVC.\n23\nTable of Contents\nOur management responsibilities to each of our clients and any future companies we may manage may give rise to actual, potential or perceived conflicts of\ninterest.\nSome of our clients have overlapping investment objectives, and if and as we expand our management services to include additional private real estate capital\nclients, additional overlapping investment objectives may result. Allocating investment and loan opportunities appropriately frequently involves significant and\nsubjective judgments. In addition, the perception of non-compliance with such requirements or policies could harm our reputation with private capital investors and\nour public stockholders. Additionally, some of our clients have material business relationships with, and in some instances have engaged in material transactions\nwith, other of our clients that could give rise to conflicting interests. For example, our Real Estate Lending Venture and SEVN both provide first mortgage loans for\nmiddle market real estate and both are managed by our wholly owned subsidiary Tremont Realty Capital. Our controlling shareholder’s investment in some of our\nclients also could give rise to conflicting interests. Our clients rely on information and management services we provide to them. While we believe we and our\nclients have appropriate policies and procedures in place that are intended to manage and mitigate the risks of conflicts of interest, our allocation of investment\nopportunities and cost reimbursements, advice, recommendations and commitments of our management team across our clients might be perceived to favor one\nclient at the expense of another. If we fail or appear to fail to deal appropriately with one or more potential or actual conflict of interest our reputation could be\ndamaged and could have a materially adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations in a number of ways, including an inability to raise\nadditional funds and a reluctance of counterparties to do business with us.\nIn addition to serving as the Chair and a member of our Board of Directors and on our executive team, Adam D. Portnoy serves as the chair of the board and as\na managing trustee of each Managed REIT, as a director of Sonesta (and its parent) and as the sole director of AlerisLife; certain of our other officers serve as\nmanaging trustees or directors of our clients; and all of the executive officers of the Managed REITs, one of the executive officers of AlerisLife and one of the\nexecutive officers of Sonesta is an officer and employee of ours. In addition, some of the independent trustees of the Managed REITs also serve as independent\ntrustees of other Managed REITs. Mr. Portnoy is also the controlling shareholder of AlerisLife and Sonesta. These multiple responsibilities and varying interests\ncould create competition for the time and efforts of Adam D. Portnoy and RMR LLC and its subsidiaries and their officers and employees, and actual, potential or\nperceived conflicts of interest may arise.\nShareholder litigation, dissident shareholder director nominations and dissident shareholder proposals have often been instituted against companies alleging\nconflicts of interest in business dealings with affiliated and related persons and entities. The various relationships noted above may precipitate such activities. In\naddition, certain proxy advisory firms which have significant influence over the voting by shareholders of public companies, have, in the past, recommended that\nshareholders vote against, or withhold votes for, the election of board members at annual meetings of shareholders of our clients and vote against certain proposals\nat special meetings of shareholders, and they may advocate for similar voting actions for future meetings. These actions may affect the outcome of those\nshareholder votes and impact the governance of those clients, which may increase the risk of shareholder activism and litigation at those clients. These activities\ncould result in substantial costs and diversion of our management’s attention and could have a material adverse effect on our and our clients’ reputations and\nbusinesses.\nRisks Related to Our Organization and Structure\nWe are a “controlled company” within the meaning of the Nasdaq listing rules and, as a result, qualify for, and may rely on, exemptions from certain\ncorporate governance requirements. Our shareholders will not have the same protections afforded to shareholders of companies that are subject to such\nrequirements.\nAdam D. Portnoy, as sole trustee of ABP Trust, holds more than 50.0% of the voting power of our shares eligible to vote. As a result, we are a “controlled\ncompany” under the Nasdaq listing rules. Under these rules, a company of which more than 50.0% of the voting power in the election of directors is held by an\nindividual, group or another company is a “controlled company” and may elect not to comply with certain listed company governance requirements, including the\nrequirements that the board of directors be comprised of a majority of independent directors and that we have a compensation committee and a nominating and\ncorporate governance committee composed entirely of independent directors. Although we are not currently availing ourselves of these exceptions, the fact that we\ncould in the future may cause our Class A Common Shares to trade at a lower price than if we were required to afford these protections.\nOur rights and the rights of our shareholders to take action against our directors and officers are limited.\nOur charter limits the liability of our directors and officers to us and our shareholders for money damages to the maximum extent permitted under Maryland\nlaw. Under current Maryland law, our directors and officers will not have any liability to us and our shareholders for money damages other than liability resulting\nfrom:\n24\nTable of Contents\n• actual receipt of an improper benefit or profit in money, property or services; or\n• active and deliberate dishonesty by the director or officer that was established by a final judgment as being material to the cause of action adjudicated.\nAdditionally, our governing documents require us to indemnify, to the maximum extent permitted by Maryland law, any of our present or former directors or\nexecutive officers who is made or threatened to be made a party or otherwise involved in a proceeding by reason of his, her or their service in that capacity and to\npay his, her or their expenses in advance of final disposition of a proceeding upon our receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of such person to repay such\namount if it is ultimately determined that such person is not entitled to be indemnified by us. We also entered into separate agreements with our directors and\nexecutive officers providing for indemnification and advancement of expenses in addition to any rights such person may have under our governing documents.\nAs a result of these limitations on liability and indemnification obligations, we and our shareholders may have more limited rights against our present and\nformer directors and officers than might exist with other companies, which could limit shareholder recourse in the event of actions which some shareholders may\nbelieve are not in our best interest.\nOur bylaws designate the Circuit Court for Baltimore City, Maryland or, if that court does not have jurisdiction, the United States District Court for the District\nof Maryland, Baltimore Division, as the sole and exclusive forum for certain actions and proceedings that may be initiated by our shareholders, which could\nlimit our shareholders’ ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers, manager, agents or employees.\nOur bylaws currently provide that other than any action arising under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, (the “Securities Act”) the Circuit Court for\nBaltimore City, Maryland or, if that court does not have jurisdiction, the United States District Court for the District of Maryland, Baltimore Division, will be the\nsole and exclusive forum for: (1) any Internal Corporate Claim, as such term is defined under the Maryland General Corporation Law; (2) any derivative action or\nproceeding brought on our behalf; (3) any action asserting a claim for breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any director, officer, agent or employee of ours to us or\nour shareholders; (4) any action asserting a claim against us or any director, officer, agent or employee of ours arising pursuant to Maryland law or our charter or\nbylaws, including any disputes, claims or controversies brought by or on behalf of a shareholder either on such shareholder’s own behalf, on our behalf or on behalf\nof any series or class of our stock or our shareholders against us or any of our directors, officers, agents or employees, including any disputes, claims or\ncontroversies relating to the meaning, interpretation, effect, validity, performance or enforcement of our charter or bylaws; or (5) any action asserting a claim\nagainst us or any director, officer, agent or employee of ours that is governed by the internal affairs doctrine of the State of Maryland. Unless we otherwise consent\nin writing, the sole and exclusive forum for claims that arise under the Securities Act, is the federal district courts of the United States of America, to the fullest\nextent of the law. Any person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring or holding any interest in our shares of stock shall be deemed to have notice of and to have\nconsented to these provisions of our bylaws, as they may be amended from time to time. The exclusive forum provisions of our bylaws may limit a shareholder’s\nability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that the shareholder believes is favorable for disputes with us or our directors, officers, employees or agents, which may\ndiscourage lawsuits against us and our directors, officers, employees or agents.\nRMR Inc. is required to pay ABP Trust for certain tax benefits it claims as a result of the tax basis step up we received as part of the RMR LLC reorganization\non June 5, 2015 and will receive upon future redemptions by ABP Trust for Class A Common Shares or for cash. In certain circumstances, payments under the\ntax receivable agreement may be accelerated and/or significantly exceed the actual tax benefits RMR Inc. realizes.\nABP Trust may redeem Class A Units it owns for Class A Common Shares or cash. See “Business-Our Organizational Structure-The RMR LLC Operating\nAgreement-Redemption rights of holders of Class A Units” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2019. Both ABP Trust’s\ninitial purchase of Class A Units and any future redemptions that ABP Trust may effect may result in increases in our tax basis of our assets that otherwise would\nnot have been available. Such increases in tax basis are likely to increase (for tax purposes) depreciation and amortization deductions and therefore reduce the\namount of income tax we otherwise would be required to pay in the future. These increases in tax basis may also decrease gain (or increase loss) on future\ndispositions of certain capital assets to the extent the increased tax basis is allocated to those assets. The Internal Revenue Service, or the IRS, may challenge all or\npart of these tax basis increases, and a court might sustain such a challenge.\nWe have entered into a tax receivable agreement, dated June 5, 2015, by and among RMR Inc., RMR LLC and ABP Trust that provides for the payment by\nRMR Inc. to ABP Trust of 85.0% of the amount of cash savings, if any, in U.S. federal, state and local income tax or franchise tax that RMR Inc. actually realizes as\na result of (a) the increases in tax basis attributable to its dealings with ABP Trust and (b) tax benefits related to imputed interest deemed to be paid by us as a result\nof the tax receivable\n25\nTable of Contents\nagreement. See “Business-Our Organizational Structure-Tax Receivable Agreement” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 30,\n2019 for further information regarding the tax receivable agreement. While the actual increase in tax basis, as well as the amount and timing of any payments under\nthe tax receivable agreement, will vary depending upon a number of factors, including the timing of redemptions, the price of our Class A Common Shares at the\ntime of the redemption, the extent to which such redemptions are taxable, and the amount and timing of our income, we expect that, as a result of the size of the\nincreases in the tax basis of the tangible and intangible assets of RMR LLC attributable to RMR Inc.’s interests in RMR LLC, during the expected term of the tax\nreceivable agreement, the payments that RMR Inc. makes to ABP Trust may be substantial. ABP Trust generally will not reimburse RMR Inc. for any payments that\nmay have been made under the tax receivable agreement. As a result, in certain circumstances RMR Inc. could make payments to ABP Trust under the tax\nreceivable agreement in excess of cash tax savings. Our ability to achieve benefits from any tax basis increase, and the payments to be made under the tax\nreceivable agreement, will depend upon a number of factors, including the timing and amount of our future income.\nIn addition, the tax receivable agreement provides that, upon certain changes of control and certain breaches of the agreement that we fail to cure in accordance\nwith the terms of the agreement, our obligations with respect to Class A Units will be accelerated. In those circumstances, our obligations under the tax receivable\nagreement would be based on certain assumptions, including that we would have sufficient taxable income to fully utilize the deductions arising from the increased\ntax deductions and tax basis and other benefits described in the tax receivable agreement, and that any Class A Units that have not been redeemed will be deemed\nredeemed for the market value of the Class A Common Shares at the time of the change of control or breach, as applicable. Consequently, it is possible, in these\ncircumstances, that the actual cash tax savings realized by RMR Inc. may be significantly less than the corresponding tax receivable agreement payments.\nOur governing documents permit our directors and officers, our clients and ABP Trust to retain corporate opportunities for their own benefit.\nUnder RMR Inc.’s charter and RMR LLC’s operating agreement, no director or officer of ours who is also serving as an officer, employee or agent of a client\nor ABP Trust or any of its affiliates is required to present, communicate or offer any business opportunity to us, and such person shall have the right to hold any\nbusiness opportunity for themselves or transfer it to any other person to the maximum extent permitted by Maryland law. If any of these persons fails to present an\nopportunity to us or takes the opportunity for themselves, to the maximum extent permitted under Maryland law they will not be liable to us. We have renounced all\npotential interest or expectation in certain business opportunities which may fit our growth objectives in the future or otherwise have value to us. These\nopportunities may be directed to the clients or other persons or entities to which RMR LLC may have a relationship. Additionally, under our governing documents,\nour directors, officers, employees and agents are permitted to engage in other business activities that are similar to, or even competitive with, our own. If such\npersons engage in competitive business activities, we may have no remedy under our governing documents in these circumstances.\nOur governing documents do not limit our ability to enter into new lines of businesses and doing so may result in additional risks and uncertainties in our\nbusinesses.\nOur governing documents do not limit our business to the management of commercial real estate assets or businesses related thereto. Accordingly, we may\npursue other business initiatives. To the extent we enter into a new line of business, we will face numerous risks and uncertainties, including risks associated with:\n(i) the required investment of capital and other resources; (ii) the possibility that we have insufficient expertise to engage in such activities competently or\nprofitably; (iii) combining or integrating operational and management systems and controls; and (iv) the broadening of our geographic footprint, including the risks\nassociated with conducting operations in non-U.S. jurisdictions. Entry into certain lines of business may subject us to new laws and regulations with which we are\nnot familiar, or from which we are currently exempt, and may lead to increased litigation and regulatory risk. During the past three years, we expanded our Private\nCapital through the execution of new business ventures; our Private Capital assets under management increased from approximately $1.7 billion as of September\n30, 2021 to approximately $12.8 billion as of September 30, 2024. We entered the multifamily residential real estate sector in December 2023 through our\nacquisition of RMR Residential and in July 2024 we launched our Real Estate Lending Venture. In addition, our strategic initiatives include joint ventures or\npartnerships, in which case we may be subject to additional risks and uncertainties because we may be dependent upon, and subject to liability, losses or\nreputational damage relating to systems, controls and personnel that are not under our control. There can be no assurance that our increased focus on private real\nestate capital or any other business initiative we decide to pursue will be successful in the future or that we will achieve our performance objectives.\n26\nTable of Contents\nOur only material asset is our interest in RMR LLC, and we are accordingly dependent upon distributions from RMR LLC to pay our taxes and expenses.\nRMR Inc. is organized as a holding company of RMR LLC and its only material asset is its limited liability company membership units of RMR LLC. RMR\nInc. has no independent means of generating revenue. Pursuant to RMR Inc.’s agreements with RMR LLC, RMR Inc., as the managing member of RMR LLC,\nintends to cause RMR LLC to make distributions in an amount that is at least sufficient to cover applicable taxes payable by its members, other expenses and some\nor all of the dividends, if any, declared by us.\nDeterioration in the financial condition, earnings or cash flow of RMR LLC for any reason could limit or impair its ability to pay such distributions to us.\nAdditionally, to the extent that RMR Inc. requires funds and RMR LLC is restricted from making such distributions under applicable law or regulation or under the\nterms of financing or other arrangements, or is otherwise unable to provide such funds, our liquidity and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.\nItem 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments\nNone.\nItem 1C. Cybersecurity\nRisk management and strategy\nWe maintain a cybersecurity risk management program to identify, assess and manage material risks from cybersecurity threats, including by regularly\nassessing risks from cybersecurity threats and monitoring our information systems for potential vulnerabilities. Our cybersecurity program is designed to align with\nthe National Institute of Standards and Technology Cybersecurity Framework.\nWe take various actions designed to maintain and protect the operation and security of our information technology and systems, including the data maintained\nin those systems. We conduct data security education and testing for our employees, in addition to penetration testing and unannounced email phishing exercises.\nAdditionally, we have implemented a third-party risk management process for third party service providers and vendors. Extensive security questionnaires are\nissued to third party providers and vendors, the responses to which are weighted and reviewed by our security and compliance team. High risk vendors are reviewed\nat least biennially and new vendors that interact with our data are assessed as part of our vendor procurement process. In the event of a cybersecurity incident, we\nhave a detailed incident response plan in place for contacting authorities and informing key stakeholders. In addition, we have engaged a qualified third party who\nconducted an external assessment of our cybersecurity controls.\nTo date, we are not aware of risks from cybersecurity threats, including as a result of any previous cybersecurity incidents, that have materially affected or are\nreasonably likely to materially affect the Company, including its business strategy, results of operations or financial condition. For additional information on\ncybersecurity risks and potential related impacts on us, see Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors, “We rely on information technology and systems in our operations, and\nany material failure, inadequacy, interruption or security breach of that technology or those systems could materially harm our business.”\nGovernance\nOur Board of Directors holds oversight responsibility over our strategy and risk management, including material risks related to cybersecurity threats. Our\nAudit Committee takes a leading role in oversight of risk management, including risks related to cybersecurity, and receives reports from our management\nregarding cybersecurity risks and countermeasures being undertaken or considered by us, including updates on the internal and external cybersecurity landscape and\nrelevant technical developments and more frequent reports as it may direct or as warranted. Our cybersecurity program is led by our Chief Information Officer, or\nCIO, who has over two decades of relevant experience in information technology and cybersecurity and has primary responsibility for assessing and managing\nmaterial risks from cybersecurity threats and overseeing our cybersecurity team. Our CIO has previously held senior information technology and security roles,\nincluding as CIO of a global real estate firm and of a real estate investment trust. Our Director of Information Security and our cybersecurity team are responsible\nfor, among other things, information technology failure mitigation and business continuity, cybersecurity threat detection and incident response and continuous\nnetwork monitoring. Our cybersecurity team members have a broad array of relevant skills and expertise and have obtained, or are working to obtain, relevant\ninformation security certifications, including Certified Information Systems Security Professional, Certified Information Systems Auditor and Certified Risk and\nInformation Systems Control certifications. Our Director of Information Security assembles our incident response and investigative teams and informs our CIO if\nan incident occurs. Investigative findings are reported to our executive leadership and to the relevant\n27\nTable of Contents\nauthorities if warranted. Our CIO works closely with our senior management, including cross-functional leaders in our human resources, legal and corporate\ncommunications departments, to develop and advance our cybersecurity strategy and reports to our Audit Committee on cybersecurity matters.\nItem 2. Properties\nOur principal executive offices are located at Two Newton Place, 255 Washington Street, Newton, MA 02458-1634. These offices are leased from an affiliate\nof ABP Trust through 2030. A copy of the lease is incorporated by reference as an exhibit to this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nWe also lease other ancillary and local office space from ABP Trust, from certain Managed Equity REITs and from third parties. We consider these leased\npremises suitable and adequate for our business. For more information about our leased facilities, see Note 13, Leases, to our consolidated financial statements\nincluded in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nIn December 2023, as part of the MPC Acquisition, we acquired a 90.0% economic ownership interest in 260 Woodstock Investor, LLC, a mixed-use apartment\ncomplex located in Woodstock, GA, or the Woodstock Property. A mortgage loan with an acquisition date fair value of $4,726 and an aggregate principal amount\noutstanding of $5,429 is secured by the Woodstock Property and bears interest at a fixed rate of 3.71%. The mortgage loan requires monthly payments of interest\nonly until September 2025, at which time payments of principal and interest are due monthly until the loan matures in August 2029.\nIn July 2024, we acquired a 240 unit, garden style apartment community located in Denver, CO, or the Denver Property, for a purchase price of $70,000,\nexcluding acquisition costs. We financed this purchase with cash on hand and proceeds from a $46,500 mortgage loan with a 5.34% fixed interest rate. This\nmortgage loan requires monthly payments of interest only until maturity in July 2029.\nItem 3. Legal Proceedings\nFrom time to time, we may become involved in litigation matters incidental to the ordinary course of our business. Although we are unable to predict with\ncertainty the eventual outcome of any litigation, we are currently not a party to any litigation which we expect to have a material adverse effect on our business.\nItem 4.

[Reserved]\n29\nTable of Contents\nItem 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following information should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included in Part IV, Item 15 of\nthis Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOVERVIEW (dollars in thousands)\nRMR Inc. is a holding company and substantially all of its business is conducted by RMR LLC. RMR Inc. has no employees, and the personnel and various\nservices it requires to operate are provided by RMR LLC. RMR LLC manages a diverse portfolio of real estate and real estate related businesses.\nAcquisition of MPC Partnership Holdings LLC\nOn December 19, 2023, we completed our acquisition, or the Acquisition, of MPC (now doing business as RMR Residential), a vertically integrated residential\nplatform. This acquisition further advances our strategic focus on continuing to grow our private capital business, comprising approximately $5.1 billion in assets\nunder management as of September 30, 2024 and a number of new institutional relationships. This acquisition also allows us to further diversify our revenue\nsources, to enter the only major commercial real estate, or CRE, sector in which we did not have a significant presence, and brings infrastructure and digital\nmarketing capabilities that may be leveraged across our platform.\nBusiness Environment and Outlook\nThe continuation and growth of our business depends upon our ability to operate the Managed Equity REITs, our private capital clients and SEVN so as to\nmaintain, grow and increase the value of their businesses, to assist AlerisLife and Sonesta to grow their businesses and operate profitably, and to successfully\nexpand our business through the execution of new business ventures and additional investments. Our business and the businesses of our clients generally follow the\nbusiness cycle of the U.S. real estate industry, but with certain property type and regional geographic variations. Typically, as the general U.S. economy expands,\ncommercial real estate occupancies increase and new real estate development occurs; new development frequently leads to increased real estate supply and reduced\noccupancies; and then the cycle repeats. These general trends can be impacted by property type characteristics or regional factors; for example, demographic factors\nsuch as the aging U.S. population, the growth of e-commerce retail sales or net population migration across different geographic regions can slow, accelerate,\noverwhelm or otherwise impact general cyclical trends. Because of such multiple factors, we believe it is often possible to grow real estate based businesses in\nselected property types or geographic areas despite general national trends.\nBeyond general real estate industry trends, we also take into account general economic factors impacting our clients. Heading in to 2024, certain CRE investors\nseemed cautiously optimistic that inflation had peaked, that the U.S. economy was likely headed for a “soft-landing” and that the Federal Open Market Committee\nof the U.S. Federal Reserve, or the FOMC, would be poised to reduce the federal funds rate by 125 to 150 basis points as a result of five or six rate cuts in 2024.\nWith the anticipation of lower interest rates in the future, investors chose to delay sale or refinancing decisions and overall CRE investment and transaction volume\nremained tepid well into the third quarter of calendar 2024. In September 2024, citing progress toward its 2% inflation target, the FOMC lowered the targeted\nfederal funds rate by 50 basis points, to a range of 4.75% to 5.00%, the first reduction since March 2020. This rate cut provided CRE owners relief from the recent\nhigh borrowing costs and uncertainty regarding the timing and magnitude of future rate cuts. With this additional clarity on the intentions of the FOMC and the\ndirection of future interest rates, CRE owners are now better positioned to make sale or refinance decisions and opt between floating or fixed rate financing options.\nAlthough certain CRE investors feel that the risk of a prolonged period of elevated interest rates is largely over, other challenges remain. Special servicing rates\nfor commercial mortgage-backed securities, or CMBS, and CRE collateralized loan obligations continue to increase and lenders have become more willing to\nforeclose on borrowers unable to support underperforming properties. Furthermore, certain segments of the CRE industry continue to experience headwinds in\ntrying to improve operating fundamentals, whether it be the pandemic shift in work habits and weak demand for office space impacting the office sector or\noversupply in certain markets adversely impacting the industrial and residential sectors.\nBoth we and our clients consider industry and general economic factors and attempt to take advantage of opportunities when they arise. For example: (i) since\nMarch 2020, ILPT and DHC have completed several joint venture transactions with institutional investors and subsequently grown some of those ventures by\nacquiring additional properties; (ii) SVC transitioned over 200 hotels from other hotel operators to Sonesta, which on March 17, 2021, completed its acquisition of\nRLH Corporation, establishing it as one of the largest hotel companies in the U.S. and expanding its franchising capabilities; and (iii) on February 25, 2022, ILPT\ncompleted its acquisition of 126 new, Class A, single tenant, net leased, e-commerce focused industrial properties as a result of its acquisition of Monmouth Real\nEstate Investment Corporation, or MNR, in an all-cash transaction\n30\nTable of Contents\nvalued at approximately $4.0 billion. More recently, on December 19, 2023, we completed our previously announced agreement to acquire 100% of the equity\ninterest in MPC for total consideration of $99,021, which added residential capabilities to RMR LLC. In addition, we balance our pursuit of growth of our and our\nclients’ businesses by executing, on behalf of our clients, prudent capital recycling or business arrangement restructurings in an attempt to help our clients prudently\nmanage leverage and increased operating costs. We also look to reposition their portfolios and businesses when circumstances warrant such changes or when other\nmore desirable opportunities are identified.\nFor a discussion of some of the circumstances that may adversely affect us and our business, see elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including\n“Warning Concerning Forward-Looking Statements”, Part I, Item 1 “Business” and Part I, Item 1A “Risk Factors”.\nManaged Equity REITs\nThe base business management fees we earn from the Managed Equity REITs are calculated monthly in accordance with the applicable business management\nagreement and are based on a percentage of the lower of (i) the average historical cost of each REIT’s properties and (ii) each REIT’s average market capitalization.\nThe property management fees we earn from the Managed Equity REITs are principally based on a percentage of the gross rents collected at certain managed\nproperties owned by the Managed Equity REITs, excluding rents or other revenues from hotels, travel centers, senior living properties and wellness centers, which\nare separately managed by AlerisLife, Sonesta or a third party. Also under the terms of the property management agreements, we receive construction supervision\nfees in connection with certain construction activities undertaken at the properties owned by the Managed Equity REITs based on a percentage of the cost of such\nconstruction. For further information regarding the fees we earn, see Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, to our consolidated financial statements\nincluded in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nThe following table presents for each Managed Equity REIT a summary of its primary strategy and the lesser of the historical cost of its assets under\nmanagement and its market capitalization as of September 30, 2024 and 2023, as applicable:\nLesser of Historical Cost of Assets\nUnder Management or\nTotal Market Capitalization as of\nSeptember 30,\nREIT Primary Strategy 2024 2023\nDHC Medical office and life science properties, senior living communities and other healthcare related properties $ 4,122,133 $ 3,280,149\nILPT Industrial and logistics properties 4,627,266 4,520,662\nOPI Office properties primarily leased to single tenants and those with high credit quality characteristics 2,450,756 2,789,224\nSVC Hotels and service-focused retail net lease properties 6,442,016 7,083,845\n$ 17,642,171 $ 17,673,880\nA Managed Equity REIT’s historical cost of assets under management includes the real estate it owns and its consolidated assets invested directly or indirectly\nin equity interests in or loans secured by real estate and personal property owned in connection with such real estate (including acquisition related costs which may\nbe allocated to intangibles or are unallocated), all before reserves for depreciation, amortization, impairment charges or bad debts or other similar non-cash reserves.\nA Managed Equity REIT’s average market capitalization includes the average value of the Managed Equity REIT’s outstanding common equity value during the\nperiod, plus the daily weighted average of each of the aggregate liquidation preference of preferred shares and the principal amount of consolidated indebtedness\nduring the period.\nThe table above presents for each Managed Equity REIT, the lesser of the historical cost of its assets under management and its market capitalization as of the\nend of each period.

As of September 30, 2024, the market capitalization was lower than the historical cost of assets\nunder management for each of the Managed Equity REITs; the historical cost of assets under management for DHC, ILPT, OPI and SVC as of September 30, 2024,\nwere $7,651,487, $5,699,132, $5,806,052 and $11,425,389, respectively.\n31\nTable of Contents\nThe fee revenues we earned from the Managed Equity REITs for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 are set forth in the following table:\nFiscal Year Ended September 30,\n2024 2023\nBase Base Base Base\nBusiness Property Construction Business Property Construction\nManagement Management Supervision Management Management Supervision\nREIT Revenues Revenues Revenues Total Revenues Revenues Revenues Total\nDHC $ 16,498 $ 5,659 $ 2,359 $ 24,516 $ 14,388 $ 5,921 $ 3,366 $ 23,675\nILPT 23,590 12,683 431 36,704 23,428 12,690 716 36,834\nOPI 12,484 13,339 4,080 29,903 14,133 13,909 10,121 38,163\nSVC 31,610 5,397 6,752 43,759 33,654 3,794 3,095 40,543\n$ 84,182 $ 37,078 $ 13,622 $ 134,882 $ 85,603 $ 36,314 $ 17,298 $ 139,215\nOther Clients\nWe provide business management services to AlerisLife, Sonesta and until May 15, 2023, TA. AlerisLife operates senior living communities throughout the\nUnited States, many of which are owned by and managed for DHC. Sonesta manages and franchises hotels, resorts and cruise ships in the United States, Latin\nAmerica, the Caribbean and the Middle East; many of the U.S. hotels that Sonesta operates are owned by SVC. TA operates, leases and franchises travel centers\nalong the U.S. interstate highway system, many of which are owned by SVC, and standalone truck service facilities. Generally, our fees earned from business\nmanagement services to AlerisLife, Sonesta and until May 15, 2023, TA, are based on a percentage of certain revenues. In connection with BP’s acquisition of TA\non May 15, 2023, TA terminated its business management agreement with us and in accordance with its terms paid us the applicable termination fee of $45,282.\nIn addition, we also provide management services to certain other Private Capital clients, including high-quality institutional investors relationships we\nassumed as part of our MPC acquisition, and earn fees based on a percentage of average invested capital, as defined in the applicable agreements, property\nmanagement fees based on a percentage of rents collected from managed properties and construction supervision fees based on a percentage of the cost of\nconstruction activities. RMR Residential also provides us the potential to generate promote fees on any new co-investments in the future.\nOur management fee revenues from services to these clients for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, are set forth in the following table and\nexclude termination fee revenue earned from TA of $45,282 for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023:\nFiscal Year Ended September 30,\n2024 2023\nBase Base Base Base\nBusiness Property Construction Business Property Construction\nManagement Management Supervision Management Management Supervision\nRevenues Revenues Revenues Total Revenues Revenues Revenues Total\nAlerisLife\n$ 5,632 $ — $ — $ 5,632 $ 5,414 $ — $ — $ 5,414\nSonesta 9,362 — — 9,362 9,456 — 15 9,471\nRMR Residential 482 15,014 1,440 16,936 — — — —\nOther private entities 12,099 8,664 579 21,342 12,013 8,388 1,130 21,531\nSEVN — 47 — 47 — 8 — 8\nTA — — — — 9,932 — — 9,932\n$ 27,575 $ 23,725 $ 2,019 $ 53,319 $ 36,815 $ 8,396 $ 1,145 $ 46,356\n32\nTable of Contents\nAdvisory Business\nTremont provides advisory services to SEVN, a publicly traded mortgage REIT that focuses on originating and investing in first mortgage loans secured by\nmiddle market and transitional commercial real estate. Tremont is primarily compensated pursuant to its management agreement with SEVN based on a percentage\nof equity, as defined in the applicable agreement.\nFor the fiscal years ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, Tremont earned advisory services revenue of $4,506 and $4,520, respectively, and incentive fees of\n$1,213 and $660, respectively.\nReal Estate Lending Venture\nAs part of our strategic initiative to expand our private capital business, our plan is to amass a small portfolio of loans, financed, in part, through a bank\nrepurchase facility, in a Tremont managed vehicle and bring in third parties to invest in the vehicle. The vehicle would then continue growing by making additional\nloans.\nIn July 2024, we originated a floating rate first mortgage loan that is secured by a hotel property in Revere, MA for a total commitment of $40,000, which has\nbeen fully funded as of September 30, 2024. This loan requires the borrower to pay interest at a rate of the Secured Overnight Financing Rate, or SOFR, plus a\npremium of 395 basis points per annum and has an initial term of two years with three one year extensions. Also in July 2024, we originated a floating rate first\nmortgage loan that is secured by an industrial property in Wayne, PA for a total commitment of $27,000, of which $17,180 has been funded as of September 30,\n2024. This loan requires the borrower to pay interest at a rate of SOFR plus a premium of 425 basis points per annum and has an initial term of three years with two\none year extensions.\nIn September 2024, we entered into a master repurchase agreement with UBS AG, or UBS, or our UBS Master Repurchase Agreement, for a facility with an\naggregate maximum capacity of $200,000, or our UBS Master Repurchase Facility, pursuant to which we may sell to UBS, and later repurchase, commercial\nmortgage loans, which are referred to as purchased assets. Pursuant to the UBS Master Repurchase Agreement, we will pay UBS a non-refundable upfront fee that\nis equal to 0.60% of the applicable tranche amount on each purchase date.\nRMR Residential Acquisition\nIn July 2024, we acquired a 240 unit, garden style apartment community located in Denver, CO, or the Denver Property, for a purchase price of $70,000,\nexcluding acquisition costs. We financed this purchase with cash on hand and proceeds from a $46,500 mortgage loan with a 5.34% fixed interest rate. This\nmortgage loan requires monthly payments of interest only until maturity in July 2029.\nWe plan either to syndicate this acquisition or use it to seed a small portfolio of multifamily assets we would subsequently syndicate to third party investors.\n33\nTable of Contents\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS (dollars in thousands)\nThe following table presents the changes in our operating results for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2024 compared to the fiscal year ended September 30,\n2023:\nFiscal Year Ended September 30,\n2024 2023 $ Change % Change\nRevenues:\nManagement services $ 188,201 $ 185,702 $ 2,499 1.3%\nTermination and incentive fees 1,213 45,942 (44,729) (97.4)%\nAdvisory services 4,506 4,520 (14) (0.3)%\nTotal management, termination, incentive and advisory services revenues 193,920 236,164 (42,244) (17.9)%\nLoan investment interest income 1,400 — 1,400 n/m\nLoan investment interest expense (87) — (87) n/m\nIncome from loan investments, net 1,313 — 1,313 n/m\nRental property revenues 1,604 — 1,604 n/m\nReimbursable compensation and benefits 84,169 59,925 24,244 40.5%\nReimbursable equity based compensation 7,919 9,826 (1,907) (19.4)%\nOther reimbursable expenses 608,688 656,401 (47,713) (7.3)%\nTotal reimbursable costs 700,776 726,152 (25,376) (3.5)%\nTotal revenues 897,613 962,316 (64,703) (6.7)%\nExpenses:\nCompensation and benefits 170,357 136,355 34,002 24.9%\nEquity based compensation 10,624 12,488 (1,864) (14.9)%\nSeparation costs 6,297 2,002 4,295 n/m\nTotal compensation and benefits expense 187,278 150,845 36,433 24.2%\nGeneral and administrative 43,743 36,019 7,724 21.4%\nOther reimbursable expenses 608,688 656,401 (47,713) (7.3)%\nRental property expenses 462 — 462 n/m\nTransaction and acquisition related costs 7,750 4,221 3,529 83.6%\nDepreciation and amortization 4,713 1,102 3,611 n/m\nTotal expenses 852,634 848,588 4,046 0.5%\nOperating income 44,979 113,728 (68,749) (60.5)%\nChange in fair value of Earnout liability 2,589 — 2,589 n/m\nInterest income 10,403 10,574 (171) (1.6)%\nInterest expense (783) — (783) n/m\nGain on equity method investments 7,260 25,237 (17,977) (71.2)%\nIncome before income tax expense 64,448 149,539 (85,091) (56.9)%\nIncome tax expense (11,319) (21,768) 10,449 48.0%\nNet income 53,129 127,771 (74,642) (58.4)%\nNet income attributable to noncontrolling interest in The RMR Group LLC (30,039) (70,624) 40,585 57.5%\nNet loss attributable to noncontrolling interest in consolidated entity 40 — 40 n/m\nNet income attributable to The RMR Group Inc. $ 23,130 $ 57,147 $ (34,017) (59.5)%\nn/m - not meaningful\nReferences to changes in the income and expense categories below relate to the comparison of consolidated results for the fiscal year ended September 30,\n2024, compared to the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023.

Management services revenue increased $2,499 primarily due to growth in management services revenue of $16,936 related to\nour acquisition of MPC, partially offset by decreases in management fees earned from TA of $9,932 as a result of the termination of its business management\nagreement with us on May 15, 2023 and decreases in construction supervision fees earned, primarily from the Managed Equity REITs, of $4,242.\nTermination and incentive fees. Termination and incentive fees decreased $44,729 primarily due to the $45,282 termination fee received from TA during the\n2023 period. For further information about these fees, see Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, and Note 8, Related Person Transactions, to our\nconsolidated financial statements included in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nIncome from loan investments, net. Income from loan investments, net includes loan investment interest income of $1,400 for loans originated as part of the\nReal Estate Lending Venture that was launched this fiscal year.\nRental property revenues. Rental property revenues includes base rental income and non-cash straight line rent adjustments for our two owned properties, each\nof which was acquired in the current fiscal year.\nReimbursable compensation and benefits. Reimbursable compensation and benefits include reimbursements, at cost, that arise primarily from services our\nemployees provide pursuant to our property management agreements at the properties of our clients. A significant portion of these compensation and benefits are\ncharged or passed through to and paid by tenants of our clients. Reimbursable compensation and benefits increased $24,244 primarily due to the impact of our\nacquisition of MPC and annual merit increases effective October 1, 2023.\nReimbursable equity based compensation. Reimbursable equity based compensation includes awards of common shares by our clients directly to certain of our\nofficers and employees in connection with the provision of management services to those clients. We record an equal offsetting amount as equity based\ncompensation expense for the value of these awards. Reimbursable equity based compensation revenue decreased $1,907 primarily as a result of decreases in\ncertain of our clients’ respective share prices.\nOther reimbursable expenses. For further information about these reimbursements, see Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, to our consolidated\nfinancial statements included in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nCompensation and benefits. Compensation and benefits consist of employee salaries and other employment related costs, including health insurance expenses\nand contributions related to our employee retirement plan. Compensation and benefits expense increased $34,002 primarily due to the impact of our acquisition of\nMPC and annual merit and benefit increases, which was partially offset by cost containment measures that reduced headcount.\nEquity based compensation. Equity based compensation consists of the value of vested shares awarded to certain of our employees under our and our clients’\nequity compensation plans. We record an equal offsetting amount as reimbursable equity based compensation revenue for the value of awards under our clients’\nequity compensation plans to certain of our employees. Equity based compensation decreased $1,864 primarily as a result of decreases in certain of our clients’\nrespective share prices.\nSeparation costs. Separation costs consist of employment termination costs. For further information about these costs, see Note 8, Related Person\nTransactions, to our consolidated financial statements included in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nGeneral and administrative. General and administrative expenses consist of office related expenses, information technology related expenses, employee\ntraining, travel, professional services expenses, director compensation and other administrative expenses. General and administrative costs increased $7,724\nprimarily due to the impact of our acquisition of MPC and increases in third party costs related to our expanded role in construction oversight.\nRental property expenses. Rental property expenses includes property operating expenses, such as real estate taxes, repairs and maintenance and utility costs\nincurred at our two owned properties.\nTransaction and acquisition related costs. Transaction and acquisition related costs in the 2024 period primarily represent costs associated with our acquisition\nof MPC and related integration expenses.\nDepreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization increased $3,611 primarily due to the amortization of MPC acquisition related intangible assets\nand the acquisition of our two owned properties in the 2024 period.\n35\nTable of Contents\nChange in fair value of Earnout liability. For further information about the Earnout liability, see Note 4, Acquisitions and Note 7, Fair Value of Financial\nInstruments to our consolidated financial statements included in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nInterest income. Interest income decreased $171 due to a lower amount of investable cash during the 2024 period, partially offset by higher average interest\nrates as compared to the 2023 period.\nGain on equity method investments. Gain on equity method investments represents the unrealized and realized gains or losses on our investments in SEVN and\nTA common shares. For further information, see Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, to our consolidated financial statements included in Part IV,\nItem 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nIncome tax expense. The decrease in income tax expense of $10,449 is primarily attributable to lower taxable income during the 2024 period as compared to\nthe 2023 period.\n36\nTable of Contents\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES (dollars in thousands, except per share amounts)\nOur current assets have historically been comprised predominantly of cash, cash equivalents and receivables for business management, property management\nand advisory services fees. As of September 30, 2024 and 2023, we had cash and cash equivalents of $141,599 and $267,989, respectively, of which $23,189 and\n$26,802, respectively, was held by RMR Inc., with the remainder being held at RMR LLC and its subsidiaries. Cash and cash equivalents include all short term,\nhighly liquid investments that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash and have original maturities of three months or less from the date of purchase. As\nof September 30, 2024 and 2023, $92,326 and $265,800, respectively, of our cash and cash equivalents were invested in money market bank accounts.\nWe believe that our cash and cash equivalents leave us well positioned to pursue a range of capital allocation strategies, with a focus on the growth of our\nprivate capital business, to fund our operations and cash distributions and enhance our technology infrastructure, in the next twelve months. Our experienced\nplatform and existing relationships with institutional investors has provided us with significant opportunities to continue expanding our private capital business. We\nintend to diversify and further grow our private capital revenues by sponsoring and managing new real estate related investment funds that may invest in the equity\nof real estate or provide commercial mortgage loans secured by middle market and transitional real estate in the U.S. We anticipate that using our capital for\npossible formation costs and co-investment in these funds will diversify our revenues and generate management fees, incentive fees and potential promote income.\nOn December 19, 2023, we completed our acquisition of MPC for total cash consideration of $84,474. We are also obligated to pay the Earnout, if earned,\nwhich we currently estimate at $11,958 and which will be payable over the next three years, based on our current expectations for the deployment of capital\nremaining in investment funds managed by MPC prior to the end of such fund’s investment period. In addition to the Earnout, we agreed to pay retention payments\nto certain employees of MPC in an aggregate amount of $4,200 for their continued employment through December 31, 2025.\nOur liquidity is highly dependent upon our receipt of fees from the businesses we manage. Historically, we have funded our working capital needs with cash\ngenerated from our operating activities. We expect that our future working capital needs will relate largely to our operating expenses, primarily consisting of\nemployee compensation and benefits costs, our obligation to make quarterly tax distributions to the members of RMR LLC, our plan to make quarterly distributions\non our Class A Common Shares and Class B-1 Common Shares and our plan to pay quarterly distributions to the members of RMR LLC in connection with the\nquarterly dividends to RMR Inc. shareholders.\nDuring the fiscal year ended September 30, 2024, we paid cash distributions to the holders of our Class A Common Shares, Class B-1 Common Shares and to\nthe other owner of RMR LLC membership units in the aggregate amount of $47,623. On October 16, 2024, we declared a quarterly dividend on our Class A\nCommon Shares and Class B-1 Common Shares to our shareholders of record as of October 28, 2024 in the amount of $0.45 per Class A Common Share and Class\nB-1 Common Share, or $7,581. This dividend will be partially funded by a distribution from RMR LLC to holders of its membership units in the amount of $0.32\nper unit, or $10,191, of which $5,391 will be distributed to us based on our aggregate ownership of 16,846,025 membership units of RMR LLC and $4,800 will be\ndistributed to ABP Trust based on its ownership of 15,000,000 membership units of RMR LLC. The remainder of this dividend will be funded with cash\naccumulated at RMR Inc. We expect the total dividend will amount to approximately $12,381 and we expect to pay this dividend on or about November 14, 2024.\nSee Note 9, Shareholders’ Equity, to our consolidated financial statements included in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information\nregarding these distributions.\nFor the fiscal year ended September 30, 2024, pursuant to the RMR LLC operating agreement, RMR LLC made required quarterly tax distributions to its\nholders of its membership units totaling $27,796, of which $14,799 was distributed to us and $12,997 was distributed to ABP Trust, based on each membership unit\nholder’s then respective ownership percentage in RMR LLC. The $14,799 distributed to us was eliminated in our consolidated financial statements included in Part\nIV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, and the $12,997 distributed to ABP Trust was recorded as a reduction of their noncontrolling interest. We used a\nportion of these funds distributed to us to pay our tax liabilities and amounts due under the tax receivable agreement.\nCash Flows\nThe $47,840 decrease in net cash flows from operating activities for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2024 compared to the prior fiscal year reflects a\ndecrease in net income due to termination fee revenue from TA in the prior period. The $259,334 decrease in net cash flows from investing activities for the fiscal\nyear ended September 30, 2024 compared to the prior fiscal year was due to our acquisition of MPC and the Denver Property, as well as the origination of loans\nheld for investment in the current fiscal year compared to the proceeds received from the sale of TA’s common shares in the prior period. The $101,883 increase in\nnet cash flows from financing activities for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2024 compared to the prior fiscal\n37\nTable of Contents\nyear was primarily due to proceeds from our UBS Master Repurchase Facility and mortgage note payable in the current fiscal year, as well as higher tax\ndistributions in the prior period.\nAs of September 30, 2024, we had no off-balance sheet arrangements that have had or that we expect would be reasonably likely to have a material effect on\nour financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.\nTax Receivable Agreement\nWe are party to a tax receivable agreement which provides for the payment by RMR Inc. to ABP Trust of 85.0% of the amount of savings, if any, in U.S.\nfederal, state and local income tax or franchise tax that RMR Inc. realizes as a result of (a) the increases in tax basis attributable to RMR Inc.’s dealings with ABP\nTrust and (b) tax benefits related to imputed interest deemed to be paid by it as a result of the tax receivable agreement. See Note 8, Related Person Transactions, to\nour consolidated financial statements included in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. As of September 30, 2024, our consolidated balance sheet\nreflects a liability related to the tax receivable agreement of $20,863, of which we expect to pay $2,421 to ABP Trust during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2025.\nMarket Risk and Credit Risk\nWe have not invested in derivative instruments, borrowed through issuing debt securities or transacted in foreign currencies. Our floating rate debt consists of\nour purchased assets, which are governed by our UBS Master Repurchase Facility and directly relate to our underlying loans held for investment. We are required\nto pay interest on our floating rate debt at a rate of SOFR plus a premium and earn interest on our underlying loans held for investment at a rate of SOFR plus a\npremium that is in excess of the premium paid on our floating rate debt. Changes in market interest rates would not impact the fixed spread that we earn between\nour purchased assets and our loans held for investment. As a result, we are not subject to significant direct market risk related to interest rate changes, changes to the\nmarket standard for determining interest rates, or commodity price changes; however, if any of these risks were to negatively impact our clients’ businesses or\nmarket capitalization, our revenues would likely decline. We are subject to the credit risk of our borrowers in connection with our loans held for investment. We\nseek to mitigate this risk by utilizing a comprehensive underwriting, diligence and investment selection process and by ongoing monitoring of our investments.\nNevertheless, unanticipated credit losses could occur that may adversely impact our operating results. To the extent we change our approach on the foregoing\nactivities, or engage in other activities, our market and credit risks could change. See Part I, Item 1A “Risk Factors” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for the\nrisks to us and our clients.\nRisks Related to Cash and Short Term Investments\nOur cash and cash equivalents include short term, highly liquid investments readily convertible to known amounts of cash that have original maturities of three\nmonths or less from the date of purchase. We invest a substantial amount of our cash in money market bank accounts. The majority of our cash is maintained in\nU.S. bank accounts. Some U.S. bank account balances exceed the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation insurance limit. We believe our cash and short term\ninvestments are not subject to any material interest rate risk, equity price risk, credit risk or other market risk.\nRelated Person Transactions\nWe have relationships and historical and continuing transactions with Adam D. Portnoy, the Chair of our Board and one of our Managing Directors, as well as\nour clients. For further information about these and other such relationships and related person transactions, see Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\nand Note 8, Related Person Transactions, to our consolidated financial statements included in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, which is\nincorporated herein by reference, the section captioned “Business” above in Part I, Item 1 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, our other filings with the SEC and\nour definitive Proxy Statement for our 2025 Annual Meeting of Shareholders, or the 2025 Proxy Statement, to be filed within 120 days after the close of the fiscal\nyear ended September 30, 2024. In addition, for more information about these transactions and relationships and about the risks that may arise as a result of these\nand other related person transactions and relationships, see elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including “Warning Concerning Forward-Looking\nStatements” and Part I, Item 1A “Risk Factors.” We may engage in additional transactions with related persons, including businesses to which RMR LLC or its\nsubsidiaries provide management services.\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nAn understanding of our accounting policies is necessary for a complete analysis of our results, financial position, liquidity and trends. The preparation of our\nconsolidated financial statements requires our management to make certain critical accounting estimates and judgments that impact (i) the revenue recognized\nduring the reporting periods (ii) the estimation of\n38\nTable of Contents\nfair values and (iii) our principles of consolidation. These accounting estimates are based on our management’s judgment. We consider them to be critical because\nof their significance to our consolidated financial statements and the possibility that future events may cause differences from current judgments or because the use\nof different assumptions could result in materially different estimates. We review these estimates on a periodic basis to test their reasonableness. Although actual\namounts likely differ from such estimated amounts, we believe such differences are not likely to be material.\nRevenue Recognition. Our principal sources of revenue are:\n• business management fees, including base and incentive business management fees; and\n• property management fees, including construction supervision fees and reimbursement for certain compensation and benefits related expenses.\nWe recognize revenue from business management and property management fees as earned in accordance with our management agreements. We consider the\nincentive business management fees earned from the REITs that we manage to be contingent performance based fees, which we recognize as revenue when earned\nat the end of each measurement period. We also recognize as revenue certain compensation and benefits reimbursements in our capacity as property manager, at\ncost, when we incur the related reimbursable compensation and benefits and other costs on behalf of our clients. See the “Revenue Recognition” section of Note 2,\nSummary of Significant Accounting Policies, to our consolidated financial statements included in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a detailed\ndiscussion of our revenue recognition policies and our contractual arrangements.\nFair Value. The estimation of fair value involves a significant level of judgment and estimation uncertainty, and actual results could be materially different and\nhave a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations. We accounted for the Acquisition as a business combination. We used estimates and\nassumptions to assign fair values to assets acquired and liabilities assumed, including intangible assets. Determining the fair value of intangible assets requires us to\nuse estimates and assumptions including, but not limited to, expected future cash inflows and outflows, useful lives, discount rates and income tax rates. Fair values\nwere determined based on estimates and assumptions we believe to be reasonable, but that are unpredictable and inherently uncertain. Unanticipated events and\ncircumstances may occur that could materially affect the accuracy of such estimates, assumptions or actual results.\nThe fair value of our Earnout liability was determined using a Monte Carlo simulation model and is inherently uncertain. Inputs into the model require\nestimates and assumptions regarding the timing and deployment of future capital, the historical volatility of similar market transaction, and discount rates and credit\nratings for companies similar to ours. The Earnout liability is remeasured on a quarterly basis and changes to our estimates and assumptions are likely to have a\nsignificant impact on the fair value estimate of the Earnout liability. In addition, actual payments required under the Earnout may differ significantly from our\nestimates and could have a material impact to our results of operations and financial condition.\nConsolidation. Our consolidated financial statements included in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K include only the accounts of the entities\nwe control. We continually assess whether our existing contractual rights give us the ability to direct the activities of the entities we manage that most significantly\naffect the results of that entity. The activities and factors we consider include, but are not limited to:\n• our representation on the entity’s governing body;\n• the size of our investment in each entity compared to the size of the entity and the size of other investors’ interests; and\n• the ability and rights to participate in significant policy making decisions and to replace our manager of those entities.\nBased on our historical assessments, we have not consolidated the entities we manage. We will reassess these conclusions if and when facts and circumstances\nindicate that there are changes to the elements evidencing control.\nItem 7A.

Controls and Procedures\nAs of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K, our management carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the\nparticipation of our President and Chief Executive Officer and our Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer, of the effectiveness of our\ndisclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15 under the Exchange Act. Based upon that evaluation, our President and Chief Executive\nOfficer and our Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective.\nThere have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are\nreasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.\nManagement Report on Assessment of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nWe are responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Our internal control system is designed to provide\nreasonable assurance to our management and Board of Directors regarding the preparation and fair presentation of published financial statements. All internal\ncontrol systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable\nassurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation.\nOur management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2024. In making this assessment, it used the\ncriteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) in Internal Control—Integrated Framework.\nBased on this assessment, we believe that, as of September 30, 2024, our internal control over financial reporting is effective.\nOur assessment of, and conclusion on, the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting did not include the internal controls of MPC acquired on\nDecember 19, 2023, which is included in our consolidated financial statements since the date of acquisition and represented less than 4% of our total assets as of\nSeptember 30, 2024 after excluding goodwill and intangible assets acquired, and less than 5% of our total revenues for the year ended September 30, 2024. We will\ninclude MPC in our assessment of internal controls for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2025.\nDeloitte & Touche LLP, the independent registered public accounting firm that audited our 2024 Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part IV, Item 15\nof this Annual Report on Form 10-K, has issued an attestation report on our internal control over financial reporting. Its report appears elsewhere herein.\nItem 9B. Other Information\nWe have adopted comprehensive insider trading policies and procedures that apply to all directors, officers and employees. These policies are designed to\nprevent trading on the basis of material nonpublic information and to ensure compliance with applicable securities laws. The policies include provisions for pre-\nclearance of trades, blackout periods and the establishment of Rule 10b5-1 trading plans. A copy of our insider trading policy is filed as an exhibit to this Annual\nReport on Form 10-K.\nItem 9C.

Form 10-K Summary\nNone.\n45\nTable of Contents\nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\nTo the Shareholders and the Board of Directors of The RMR Group Inc.\nOpinion on the Financial Statements\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of The RMR Group Inc. (the “Company”) as of September 30, 2024 and 2023, the related\nconsolidated statements of income, shareholders’ equity, and cash flows, for each of the three years in the period ended September 30, 2024, and the related notes\n(collectively referred to as the “financial statements”). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the\nCompany as of September 30, 2024 and 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended September 30, 2024,\nin conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\nWe have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company’s internal\ncontrol over financial reporting as of September 30, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the\nCommittee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated November 12, 2024, expressed an unqualified opinion on the\nCompany’s internal control over financial reporting.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s financial statements\nbased on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance\nwith the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable\nassurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to\nassess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such\nprocedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the\naccounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that\nour audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matters\nThe critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be\ncommunicated to the audit committee and that (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially\nchallenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken\nas a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or\ndisclosures to which they relate.\nIdentification of related parties and related party transactions - Refer to Notes 1, 2 and 8 to the financial statements\nCritical Audit Matter Description\nAs discussed in Notes 1 and 2 to the financial statements, the Company generates its revenue by providing management services to four publicly traded equity real\nestate investment trusts, two real estate operating companies, and private capital vehicles, as well as providing advisory services to a publicly traded mortgage real\nestate investment trust, all of which are related parties. These entities are considered to be related parties for the reasons discussed in Note 8 to the financial\nstatements. In addition, the Company has also entered into a number of other arrangements with its related persons and related parties (collectively, “related\nparties”), as further discussed in Note 8.\nGiven the number of related parties and related party transactions, we determined the evaluation of the identification and disclosure of related parties and related\nparty transactions to be a critical audit matter. Auditor judgment and effort was involved in assessing the sufficiency of the procedures the Company performed to\nidentify and disclose related parties and related party transactions.\nF-1\nTable of Contents\nHow the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit\nOur audit procedures related to the identification and disclosure of related parties and related party transactions included the following, among others:\n• We tested the effectiveness of controls over the Company’s identification of related party relationships and transactions.\n• We evaluated the process used by management to identify related parties and related party transactions by:\n◦ Inspecting the Company’s minutes from meetings of the Board of Directors and related committees to determine whether there were any related\nparties or transactions not previously identified.\n◦ Inspecting questionnaires completed by the Company’s directors and officers to identify potential related party transactions.\n◦ Inquiring with executive officers, key members of management, and the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors regarding their knowledge of\nthe Company’s related party transactions.\n◦ Reading public filings made by the Company, in addition to external news sources for information related to transactions between the Company\nand related parties to compare to the Company’s detail of related party transactions.\n◦ Listening to the Company’s quarterly earnings investor calls to identify any undisclosed related parties, transactions, or agreements.\n◦ Inspecting new and amended agreements between the Company and related parties to ensure they were properly disclosed, along with existing\nrelated party relationships.\n◦ Inspecting the Company’s check register and accounts payable sub-ledger to determine whether there were any payments made or to be made to\nrelated parties for transactions not previously identified.\nAcquisition of MPC Partnership Holdings LLC - Refer to Note 4 to the financial statements\nCritical Audit Matter Description\nAs discussed in Note 4 to the financial statements, the Company completed the acquisition of MPC Partnership Holdings LLC (or “MPC”) on December 19, 2023\nwith a purchase price of $99 million. The Company accounted for the acquisition under the acquisition method of accounting for business combinations.\nAccordingly, the purchase price was allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their respective fair values, including intangible assets of\nproperty management and investment management agreements of $13.5 million, trade name of $5.2 million, and investor relationships of $1.8 million. The method\nfor determining relative fair value requires management to make estimates and assumptions related to the long-term growth rate and the selection of the discount\nrate.\nGiven the fair value determination of the intangible assets for MPC requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions related to the long-term\ngrowth rate and the selection of the discount rate, performing audit procedures to evaluate the reasonableness of these estimates and assumptions required a high\ndegree of auditor judgment and an increased extent of effort.\nHow the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit\nOur audit procedures related to the long-term growth rate and the selection of the discount rate for the intangible assets valuation included the following:\n• We tested the effectiveness of controls over the valuation of the intangible assets, including management’s controls over the long-term growth rate and\nselection of the discount rate.\n• We assessed the reasonableness of management’s estimated long-term growth rate by comparing the projections to historical results and in place contracts.\nF-2\nTable of Contents\n• With the assistance of our fair value specialists, we evaluated the reasonableness of the (1) valuation methodology and (2) discount rate by:\n◦ Testing the source information underlying the determination of the discount rate and testing the mathematical accuracy of the calculation.\n◦ Developing a range of independent estimates and comparing those to the discount rate selected by management.\n/s/ Deloitte & Touche LLP\nBoston, Massachusetts\nNovember 12, 2024\nWe have served as the Company’s auditor since 2020.\nF-3\nTable of Contents\nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\nTo the Shareholders and the Board of Directors of The RMR Group Inc.\nOpinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nWe have audited the internal control over financial reporting of The RMR Group Inc. (the “Company”) as of September 30, 2024, based on criteria established in\nInternal Control — Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). In our opinion, the\nCompany maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal\nControl — Integrated Framework (2013) issued by COSO.\nWe have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated financial\nstatements as of and for the year ended September 30, 2024, of the Company and our report dated November 12, 2024 expressed an unqualified opinion on those\nfinancial statements.\nAs described in Management Report on Assessment of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting, management excluded from its assessment the internal control\nover financial reporting at MPC Partnership Holdings LLC, which was acquired on December 19, 2023, and whose financial statements constitute less than 4% of\ntotal assets after excluding goodwill and intangible assets acquired, and less than 5% of total revenues of the consolidated financial statement amounts as of and for\nthe year ended September 30, 2024. Accordingly, our audit did not include the internal control over financial reporting at MPC Partnership Holdings LLC.\nBasis for Opinion\nThe Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal\ncontrol over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management Report on Assessment of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility\nis to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB\nand are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the\nSecurities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance\nabout whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal\ncontrol over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control\nbased on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable\nbasis for our opinion.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the\npreparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial\nreporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions\nand dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial\nstatements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with\nauthorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized\nacquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of\neffectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with\nthe policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n/s/ Deloitte & Touche LLP\nBoston, Massachusetts\nNovember 12, 2024\nF-4\nTable of Contents\nThe RMR Group Inc.\nConsolidated Balance Sheets\n(dollars in thousands, except per share amounts)\nSeptember 30,\n2024 2023\nAssets\nCash and cash equivalents held by The RMR Group Inc. $ 23,189 $ 26,802\nCash and cash equivalents held by The RMR Group LLC 118,410 241,187\nDue from related parties 134,030 111,323\nPrepaid and other current assets 9,789 6,997\nAssets held for sale 8,700 —\nTotal current assets 294,118 386,309\nLoans held for investment, net of allowance for credit losses of $343 and $0, respectively 56,221 —\nProperty and equipment, net of accumulated depreciation of $3,447 and $3,212, respectively 76,433 5,446\nDue from related parties, net of current portion 9,350 7,261\nEquity method investments 23,733 18,651\nGoodwill 71,761 1,859\nIntangible assets, net of accumulated amortization of $3,719 and $983, respectively 20,299 167\nOperating lease right of use assets 27,353 29,032\nDeferred tax asset 15,163 18,220\nOther assets, net of accumulated amortization of $87,740 and $78,324, respectively 106,063 115,479\nTotal assets $ 700,494 $ 582,424\nLiabilities and Equity\nReimbursable accounts payable and accrued expenses $ 90,444 $ 77,924\nAccounts payable and accrued expenses 31,599 22,578\nCurrent portion of Earnout liability 517 —\nOperating lease liabilities 5,906 5,068\nLiabilities held for sale 4,973 —\nTotal current liabilities 133,439 105,570\nOperating lease liabilities, net of current portion 22,147 25,044\nAmounts due pursuant to tax receivable agreement, net of current portion 18,442 20,886\nEmployer compensation liability, net of current portion 9,350 7,261\nEarnout liability, net of current portion 11,441 —\nSecured financing facility, net 41,109 —\nMortgage note payable 45,149 —\nTotal liabilities 281,077 158,761\nCommitments and contingencies\nEquity:\nClass A common stock, $0.001 par value;

Incentive business management fees are excluded from the transaction price until it becomes probable that there\nwill not be a significant reversal of cumulative revenue recognized.\nThe incentive business management fees are calculated for each Managed Equity REIT as 12.0% of the product of (a) the equity market capitalization of the\nManaged Equity REIT, as defined in the applicable business management agreement, on the last trading day of the year immediately prior to the relevant\nmeasurement period, and (b) the amount, expressed as a percentage, by which the Managed Equity REIT’s total return per share, as defined in the applicable\nbusiness management agreement, exceeded the applicable benchmark total return per share, as defined in the applicable business management agreement, of a\nspecified REIT index identified in the applicable business management agreement for the measurement period, as adjusted for net share issuances during the period\nand subject to caps on the values of the incentive fees. The measurement\nF-11\nThe RMR Group Inc.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\n(dollars in thousands, except per share amounts)\nperiod for the annual incentive business management fees is defined as the three year period ending on December 31 of the year for which such fee is being\ncalculated.\nWe did not earn incentive business management fees from the Managed Equity REITs for calendar years 2023, 2022 or 2021.\nTerm and Termination — Our management agreements with the Managed Equity REITs automatically extend on December 31st of each year and have terms\nthereafter that end on the 20th anniversary of the date of each extension. Each of the Managed Equity REITs has the right to terminate each management agreement:\n(i) at any time upon 60 days’ written notice for convenience, (ii) immediately upon written notice for cause, as defined in the agreements, (iii) upon written notice\ngiven within 60 days after the end of an applicable calendar year for a performance reason, as defined in the agreements, and (iv) by written notice during the 12\nmonths following a change of control of RMR LLC, as defined in the agreements. We have the right to terminate the management agreements for good reason, as\ndefined therein.\nUnder our management agreements with the Managed Equity REITs, if a Managed Equity REIT terminates our management agreements for convenience, or if\nwe terminate one or both of our management agreements with a Managed Equity REIT for good reason, the Managed Equity REIT is obligated to pay us a\ntermination fee in an amount equal to the sum of the present values of the Managed Equity REIT’s monthly future fees, as defined therein, for the terminated\nmanagement agreement(s) for the remaining term, assuming it had not been terminated. If a Managed Equity REIT terminates one or both of our management\nagreements for a performance reason, as defined therein, the Managed Equity REIT has agreed to pay to us the termination fee calculated as described above, but\nassuming a remaining term of 10 years. No termination fee is payable by a Managed Equity REIT if it terminates one or both of our management agreements for\ncause or as a result of a change of control of us, as defined in the applicable management agreement.\nOther Management Agreements\nWe earn management fees by providing continuous services pursuant to the management agreements with ABP Trust regarding AlerisLife; with Sonesta; and\nuntil May 15, 2023, with TA; equal to 0.6% of: (i) in the case of AlerisLife, AlerisLife’s revenues from all sources reportable under GAAP, less any revenues\nreportable by AlerisLife with respect to properties for which it provides management services, plus the gross revenues at those properties determined in accordance\nwith GAAP, payable in cash monthly in arrears; (ii) in the case of Sonesta, Sonesta’s estimated revenues from all sources reportable under GAAP, less any\nestimated revenues reportable by Sonesta with respect to hotels for which it provides management services, plus the estimated gross revenues at those hotels\ndetermined in accordance with GAAP, payable in cash monthly in advance; and (iii) in the case of TA, the sum of TA’s gross fuel margin, as defined in the\napplicable agreement, plus TA’s total nonfuel revenues, payable in cash monthly in advance.\nWe also earn management fees from certain other Private Capital clients based on a percentage of average invested capital, as defined in the applicable\nmanagement agreements. These management fees are payable in cash monthly in arrears.\nFor the fiscal years ended September 30, 2024, 2023 and 2022, we earned aggregate base business management fees from TA and the Private Capital clients of\n$27,575, $36,815 and $39,653, respectively. Additionally, in connection with BP’s acquisition of TA on May 15, 2023, TA terminated its business management\nagreement with us and paid us the applicable termination fee of $45,282 which was recognized in the fiscal year end September 30, 2023.\nProperty Management Agreements\nWe earn property management fees by providing continuous services pursuant to property management agreements with the Managed Equity REITs, SEVN,\nRMR Residential and certain Private Capital clients. We generally earn fees under these agreements between 2.5% to 3.5% of gross collected rents. Also, under the\nterms of the property management agreements, we receive additional fees for construction supervision services up to 5.0% of the cost of such construction. In\naddition, we earn fees under our RMR Residential property management agreements for providing certain marketing, information technology and other\nmanagement services, as defined in the applicable management agreements, and the related costs are included in general and administrative expenses in our\nconsolidated financial statements. These management fees are payable in cash monthly in arrears.\nFor the fiscal years ended September 30, 2024, 2023 and 2022, we earned aggregate property management fees of $76,444, $63,153 and $59,667, respectively,\nincluding construction supervision fees of $15,641, $18,443 and $16,743, respectively.\nF-12\nThe RMR Group Inc.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\n(dollars in thousands, except per share amounts)\nManagement Agreements with Advisory Clients\nTremont is primarily compensated pursuant to its management agreement with SEVN at an annual rate of 1.5% of equity, as defined in the applicable\nagreement. Tremont may also earn an incentive fee under its management agreement with SEVN equal to the difference between: (a) the product of (i) 20% and (ii)\nthe difference between (A) core earnings, as defined in the applicable agreements, for the most recent 12 month period (or such lesser number of completed\ncalendar quarters, if applicable), including the calendar quarter (or part thereof) for which the calculation of the incentive fee is being made, and (B) the product of\n(1) equity in the most recent 12 month period (or such lesser number of completed calendar quarters, if applicable), including the calendar quarter (or part thereof)\nfor which the calculation of the incentive fee is being made, and (2) 7% per year and (b) the sum of any incentive fees paid to Tremont with respect to the first three\ncalendar quarters of the most recent 12 month period (or such lesser number of completed calendar quarters preceding the applicable period, if applicable). No\nincentive fee shall be payable with respect to any calendar quarter unless core earnings for the 12 most recently completed calendar quarters in the aggregate is\ngreater than zero. The incentive fee may not be less than zero. For the fiscal years ended September 30, 2024, 2023 and 2022, Tremont earned incentive fees of\n$1,213, $660 and $0, respectively.\nFor the fiscal years ended September 30, 2024, 2023 and 2022, we earned advisory services revenue of $4,506, $4,520 and $4,530, respectively.\nReimbursable Costs\nWe determined we control the services provided by third parties for certain of our clients and therefore account for the cost of these services and the related\nreimbursement revenue on a gross basis.\nReimbursable Compensation and Benefits — Reimbursable compensation and benefits include reimbursements, at cost, that arise primarily from services our\nemployees provide pursuant to our property management agreements at the properties of our clients. A significant portion of these compensation and benefits are\ncharged or passed through to and paid by tenants of our clients. We recognize the revenue for reimbursements when we incur the related reimbursable compensation\nand benefits expense on behalf of our clients.\nReimbursable Equity Based Compensation — Reimbursable equity based compensation includes awards of common shares by our clients directly to certain of\nour officers and employees in connection with the provision of management services to those clients. The revenue in respect of each award is based on the fair\nvalue as of the award date for those shares that have vested, with subsequent changes in the fair value of the unvested awards being recognized in our consolidated\nstatements of income over the requisite service periods. We record an equal, offsetting amount as equity based compensation expense for the value of these awards.\nOther Reimbursable Expenses — Other reimbursable expenses include reimbursements that arise from services we provide pursuant to our property\nmanagement agreements, which include third party costs related to matters such as maintenance and repairs, development costs, security and cleaning services, a\nsignificant portion of which are charged or passed through to and paid by tenants of our clients.\nEquity Method Investments\nSeven Hills Realty Trust\nAs of September 30, 2024, Tremont owned 1,708,058, or approximately 11.5%, of SEVN’s outstanding common shares. We account for our investment in\nSEVN using the equity method of accounting because we are deemed to exert significant influence, but not control, over SEVN’s most significant activities. We\nelected the fair value option to account for our equity method investment in SEVN and determine fair value using the closing price of SEVN’s common shares as of\nthe end of the period, which is a Level 1 fair value input. The aggregate market value of our investment in SEVN as of September 30, 2024 and 2023, based on\nquoted market prices, was $23,520 and $18,651, respectively. The unrealized gain (loss) in our consolidated statements of income related to our investment in\nSEVN was $7,260, $5,295 and ($1,564) for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. During the fiscal years ended September 30,\n2024, 2023, and 2022, we received distributions from SEVN of $2,391, $2,221 and $841, respectively.\nF-13\nThe RMR Group Inc.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\n(dollars in thousands, except per share amounts)\nCarroll Multifamily Venture VII, LP\nIn July 2024, we funded a $213 capital call to CARROLL Multifamily Venture VII, LP, or Fund VII, a co-investment vehicle managed by RMR Residential.\nWe account for our investment in Fund VII using the equity method of accounting because we are deemed to exert significant influence, but not control, over Fund\nVII’s most significant activities. This investment is recorded in equity method investments in our consolidated balance sheets.\nTravelCenters of America Inc.\nUntil BP acquired TA on May 15, 2023, we owned 621,853, or approximately 4.1%, of TA’s outstanding common shares, that had a cost of $13,701. We\npreviously accounted for our investment in TA using the equity method of accounting because we were deemed to exert significant influence, but not control, over\nTA’s most significant activities. Under the fair value option, we determined fair value using the closing price of TA’s common shares as of the end of the period,\nwhich was a Level 1 fair value input, and recorded changes in fair value in earnings in our consolidated statements of income. We recorded net gains in our\nconsolidated statements of income related to our investment in TA of $19,942 and $2,574 for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nVariable Interest Entities\nWe regularly evaluate our relationships and investments to determine if they constitute variable interests. A variable interest is an investment or interest that\nwill absorb portions of an entity’s expected losses or receive portions of an entity’s expected returns. If we determine we have a variable interest in an entity, we\nevaluate whether such interest is in a variable interest entity, or VIE. Under the VIE model, we would be required to consolidate a VIE we manage if we are\ndetermined to be the primary beneficiary of the entity. We continuously assess whether we must consolidate any of the entities we manage. Consideration of factors\nincluded, but was not limited to, our representation on the entity’s governing body, the size of our investment in each entity compared to the size of the entity and\nthe size of other investors’ interests, the ability and rights to participate in significant policy making decisions and to replace the manager of those entities. Based on\nthis assessment, we concluded that we are not required to consolidate any of our clients.\nCash and Cash Equivalents\nWe consider highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less on the date of purchase to be cash equivalents, the majority of which is\nheld at major commercial banks. Certain cash account balances exceed Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation insurance limits of $250,000 per account and, as a\nresult, there is a concentration of credit risk related to amounts in excess of the insurance limits. We regularly monitor the financial stability of these financial\ninstitutions and believe that we are not exposed to any significant credit risk in cash and cash equivalents.\nAs of September 30, 2024, $553 in cash and cash equivalents consists of amounts escrowed for performance incentives, future real estate taxes, insurance and\ncapital expenditures, as required by certain of our debt agreements. These funds are held by our mortgage lenders and are segregated from our cash accounts.\nLoans Held for Investment, Net\nGenerally, our loans are classified as held for investment based upon our intent and ability to hold them until maturity. Loans that are held for investment are\ncarried at cost, net of allowance for credit losses, unamortized loan origination fees, accreted exit fees, unamortized premiums and unaccreted discounts, as\napplicable, that are required to be recognized in the carrying value of the loans in accordance with GAAP, unless the loans are determined to be collateral\ndependent. Loans that we have a plan to sell or liquidate are held at the lower of cost or fair value less cost to sell.\nLoan Deferred Fees — Loan origination and exit fees are fees charged to our borrowers and unamortized or unaccreted balances are reflected as a reduction in\nloans held for investment, net, in our consolidated balance sheets. These fees are recorded as a component of loan investment interest income in our consolidated\nstatements of income over the life of the related loans held for investment.\nAllowance for Credit Losses\nThe measurement of current expected credit losses, or CECL, is based upon historical experience, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts\nincorporating forward-looking information that affect the collectability of the reported\nF-14\nThe RMR Group Inc.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\n(dollars in thousands, except per share amounts)\namount. Accounting Standards Update, or ASU, No. 2016-13, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial\nInstruments prescribes a forward-looking “expected loss” model that generally will result in the earlier recognition of credit losses and is applicable to financial\nassets measured at amortized cost and off-balance sheet credit exposures, such as unfunded loan commitments.\nThe allowance for credit losses required under ASU No. 2016-13 is a valuation account that is deducted from the related loans’ amortized cost basis in our\nconsolidated balance sheets. Our loans typically include commitments to fund incremental proceeds to borrowers over the life of the loan; these future funding\ncommitments are also subject to the CECL model. The allowance for credit losses related to unfunded loan commitments is included in accounts payable and\naccrued expenses in our consolidated balance sheets.\nGiven the lack of historical loss data related to our loan portfolio, we estimate our expected losses using an analytical model that considers the likelihood of\ndefault and loss given default for each individual loan. This analytical model incorporates data from a third party database with historical loan loss information for\ncommercial mortgage-backed securities, or CMBS, and commercial real estate, or CRE, loans since 1998. We estimate the allowance for credit losses for our loan\nportfolio, including unfunded loan commitments, at the individual loan level. Significant inputs to the model include certain loan specific data, such as loan to\nvalue, or LTV, property type, geographic location, occupancy, vintage year, remaining loan term, net operating income, expected timing and amounts of future loan\nfundings, and macroeconomic forecast assumptions, including the performance of CRE assets, unemployment rates, interest rates and other factors. We utilize the\nmodel to estimate credit losses over a reasonable and supportable economic forecast period, followed by a straight-line reversion period to average historical losses.\nAverage historical losses are established using a population of third party historical loss data that approximates our portfolio as of the measurement date. We\nevaluate the estimated allowance for each of our loans individually and we consider our internal loan risk rating as the primary credit quality indicator underlying\nour assessment.\nAs of September 30, 2024, based on our loan portfolio, the then current economic environment and expectations for future conditions, we recorded an\nallowance for credit losses of $343 with respect to our then outstanding loans held for investment and increasing accounts payable and accrued expenses by $259\nwith respect to our then unfunded loan commitments.\nWe evaluate the credit quality of each of our loans at least quarterly by assessing a variety of risk factors in relation to each loan and assigning a risk rating to\neach loan based on those factors. Factors considered in these evaluations include, but are not limited to, property type, geographic and local market dynamics,\nphysical condition, leasing and tenant profile, projected cash flow, risk of loss, current LTV, debt yield, collateral performance, structure, exit plan and sponsorship.\nLoans are rated “1” (less risk) through “5” (greater risk) as defined below:\n“1” lower risk—Criteria reflects a sponsor having a strong financial condition and low credit risk and our evaluation of management's experience; collateral\nperformance exceeding performance metrics included in the business plan or credit underwriting; and the property demonstrating stabilized occupancy and/or\nmarket rates, resulting in strong current cash flow and net operating income and/or having a very low LTV.\n“2” average risk—Criteria reflects a sponsor having a stable financial condition and our evaluation of management's experience; collateral performance\nmeeting or exceeding substantially all performance metrics included in the business plan or credit underwriting; and the property demonstrating improved\noccupancy at market rents, resulting in sufficient current cash flow and/or having a low LTV.\n“3” acceptable risk—Criteria reflects a sponsor having a history of repaying loans at maturity and meeting its credit obligations and our evaluation of\nmanagement's experience; collateral performance expected to meet performance metrics included in the business plan or credit underwriting; and the property\nhaving a moderate LTV. New loans and loans with a limited history will typically be assigned this rating and will be adjusted to other levels from time to time as\nappropriate.\n“4” higher risk—Criteria reflects a sponsor having a history of unresolved missed or late payments, maturity extensions and difficulty timely fulfilling its credit\nobligations and our evaluation of management's experience; collateral performance failing to meet the business plan or credit underwriting; the existence of a risk\nof default possibly leading to a loss and/or potential weaknesses that deserve management’s attention; and/or the property having a high LTV.\n“5” loss likely—Criteria reflects a very high risk of realizing a principal loss or having incurred a principal loss; a sponsor having a history of default\npayments, trouble fulfilling its credit obligations, deeds in lieu of foreclosures, and/or bankruptcies; collateral performance is significantly worse than performance\nmetrics included in the business plan; loan covenants or\nF-15\nThe RMR Group Inc.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\n(dollars in thousands, except per share amounts)\nperformance milestones having been breached or not attained; timely exit via sale or refinancing being uncertain; and/or the property having a very high LTV.\nDeferred Financing Costs\nCosts incurred in connection with financings are capitalized and recorded as a reduction to the related liability in our consolidated balance sheets. Deferred\nfinancing costs are amortized over the term of the financing agreement and are recorded as a component of loan investment interest expense in our consolidated\nstatements of income.\nProperty and Equipment\nProperty and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation of building and furniture and equipment is computed using the straight line method over estimated\nuseful lives ranging from three to 30 years. Depreciation for leasehold improvements is computed using the straight line method over the term of the lesser of their\nuseful lives or related lease agreements. Capitalized software costs, information technology labor and other personnel costs, are depreciated using the straight line\nmethod over useful lives ranging between three and five years. We do not depreciate the allocated cost of land. We may engage independent real estate appraisal\nfirms to provide market information and evaluations which are relevant to our purchase price allocations and determinations of useful lives; however, we are\nultimately responsible for the purchase price allocations and determinations of useful lives.\nThe following is a summary of property and equipment presented in our consolidated balance sheets, excluding assets held for sale:\nSeptember 30,\n2024 2023\nLand $ 10,084 $ —\nBuilding 57,407 —\nFurniture and equipment 5,996 7,681\nLeasehold improvements 781 581\nCapitalized software costs 5,612 396\nTotal property and equipment 79,880 8,658\nAccumulated depreciation (3,447) (3,212)\nProperty and equipment, net $ 76,433 $ 5,446\nDepreciation expense related to property and equipment and capitalized software costs for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2024, 2023 and 2022, was\n$1,665, $1,071 and $956, respectively.\nWe allocate the purchase prices of our properties to land, buildings and improvements based on determinations of the relative fair values of these assets\nassuming the properties are vacant. We determine the fair value of each property using methods similar to those used by independent appraisers, which may involve\nestimated cash flows that are based on a number of factors, including capitalization rates and discount rates, among others. We allocate a portion of the purchase\nprice of our properties to above market and below market leases based on the present value (using an interest rate which reflects the risks associated with acquired\nin place leases at the time each property was acquired by us) of the difference, if any, between (i) the contractual amounts to be paid pursuant to the acquired in\nplace leases and (ii) our estimates of fair market lease rates for the corresponding leases, measured over a period equal to the terms of the respective leases. We\nallocate a portion of the purchase price to acquired in place leases and tenant relationships based upon market estimates to lease up the property based on the leases\nin place at the time of purchase. We allocate this aggregate value between acquired in place lease values and tenant relationships based on our evaluation of the\nspecific characteristics of each tenant’s lease. However, we have not separated the value of tenant relationships from the value of acquired in place leases because\nsuch value and related amortization expense is immaterial to the accompanying consolidated financial statements. In making these allocations, we consider factors\nsuch as estimated carrying costs during the expected lease up periods, including real estate taxes, insurance and other operating income and expenses and costs,\nsuch as leasing commissions, legal and other related expenses, to execute similar leases in current market conditions at the time a property was acquired by us. If\nthe value of tenant relationships becomes material in the future, we may separately allocate those amounts and amortize the allocated amounts over the estimated\nlife of the relationships. For\nF-16\nThe RMR Group Inc.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\n(dollars in thousands, except per share amounts)\ntransactions that qualify as business combinations, we allocate the excess, if any, of the consideration over the fair value of the assets acquired to goodwill.\nWe regularly evaluate whether events or changes in circumstances have occurred that could indicate an impairment in the value of long lived assets.\nImpairment indicators may include declining tenant occupancy, lack of progress releasing vacant space, low long term prospects for improvement in property\nperformance, cash flow or liquidity, our decision to dispose of an asset before the end of its estimated useful life and legislative, market or industry changes that\ncould permanently reduce the value of a property. If there is an indication that the carrying value of an asset is not recoverable, we estimate the projected\nundiscounted cash flows to determine if an impairment loss should be recognized. The future net undiscounted cash flows are subjective and are based in part on\nassumptions regarding hold periods, market rents and terminal capitalization rates. We determine the amount of any impairment loss by comparing the historical\ncarrying value to estimated fair value. We estimate fair value through an evaluation of recent financial performance and projected discounted cash flows using\nstandard industry valuation techniques. In addition to consideration of impairment upon the events or changes in circumstances described above, we regularly\nevaluate the remaining useful lives of our long lived assets. If we change our estimate of the remaining useful lives, we allocate the carrying value of the affected\nassets over their revised remaining useful lives.\nGoodwill and Intangible Assets\nGoodwill represents the costs of business acquisitions in excess of the fair value of identifiable net assets acquired. We evaluate the recoverability of goodwill\nannually, or more frequently, if events or changes in circumstances indicate that goodwill might be impaired. If our review indicates that the carrying amount of\ngoodwill exceeds its fair value, we would reduce the carrying amount of goodwill to fair value. During the fiscal year ended September 30, 2024, we recognized a\n$69,902 change in the carrying value of goodwill presented in our consolidated balance sheets as a result of the MPC acquisition.\nIntangible assets represent the fair value at acquisition of acquired leases, trade names, investor relationships, management agreements and other intangible\nassets. Amortization expense related to intangible assets for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2024, 2023 and 2022, was $3,048, $31, $37, respectively.\nAggregate future amortization to be recognized over the remaining useful lives of these intangible assets is estimated to be $4,675 in 2025, $3,607 in 2026, $3,076\nin 2027, $3,075 in 2028 and $691 in 2029 and thereafter.\nThe following is a summary of intangible assets, net presented in our consolidated balance sheets, excluding assets held for sale:\nAs of September 30, 2024 As of September 30, 2023\nGross Carrying Accumulated Gross Carrying Accumulated\nValue Amortization Value Amortization\nAmortized intangible assets\nManagement agreements $ 13,456 $ (2,145) $ — $ —\nAcquired leases 2,394 (270) — —\nInvestor relationships 1,843 (294) — —\nCustomer relationships and non-solicitation agreements 1,150 (1,010) 1,150 (983)\nTotal $ 18,843 $ (3,719) $ 1,150 $ (983)\nUnamortized intangible assets\nTrade name $ 5,175 $ — $ — $ —\nF-17\nThe RMR Group Inc.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\n(dollars in thousands, except per share amounts)\nOther Assets\nOn June 5, 2015, in connection with the formation of RMR Inc., each of DHC, OPI (then Government Properties Income Trust, or GOV, and Select Income\nREIT, or SIR) and SVC contributed cash and shares with a combined value of $167,764. The consideration received from such Managed Equity REITs for our\nClass A Common Shares represented a discount to the fair value of RMR Inc.’s Class A Common Shares in the amount of $193,806, which we recorded in other\nassets. The other assets are being amortized against revenue recognized related to the management agreements using the straight line method through the period\nended December 31, 2035. For the fiscal years ended September 30, 2024, 2023 and 2022, we reduced revenue by $9,416 each year, related to the amortization of\nthese other assets. As of September 30, 2024 and 2023, the remaining amount of these other assets to be amortized was $106,063 and 115,479, respectively.\nAssets and Liabilities Held for Sale\nAs of September 30, 2024, we had one property classified as held for sale in our consolidated balance sheets that is under agreement to sell for a sales price of\n$9,800, excluding closing costs. The following is a summary of assets held for sale and liabilities held for sale in our consolidated balance sheets:\nSeptember 30,\n2024 2023\nProperty and equipment, net $ 8,254 $ —\nIntangible assets, net 392 —\nOther current assets 54 —\nAssets held for sale $ 8,700 $ —\nMortgage note payable $ 4,817 $ —\nOther current liabilities 156 —\nLiabilities held for sale $ 4,973 $ —\nEquity-Based Compensation\nThe awards made under our share award plan to our Directors, officers and employees to date, have been shares of Class A common stock of RMR Inc., or\nClass A Common Shares. Shares issued to Directors vest immediately. Shares issued to our officers and employees vest in five equal, consecutive, annual\ninstallments, with the first installment vesting on the date of award. We recognize share forfeitures as they occur. Compensation expense related to share awards is\ndetermined based on the market value of our shares on the date of award, with the aggregate value of the awarded shares amortized to expense over the related\nvesting period. Expense recognized for shares awarded to Directors are included in general and administrative expenses and for shares awarded to employees are\nincluded in equity based compensation expenses in our consolidated statements of income.\nTransaction and Acquisition Related Costs\nTransaction and acquisition related costs include costs related to acquisitions and other strategic transactions. Such costs include legal, accounting, valuation,\nother professional or consulting fees. Transaction and acquisition related costs are expensed as incurred.\nSegment Reporting\nWe report our results in a single reportable segment, which reflects how our chief operating decision maker allocates resources and evaluates our financial\nresults. Because we have a single reportable segment, all required financial segment information can be found directly in our consolidated financial statements.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nSegments. On November 27, 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or the FASB, issued Accounting Standards Update, or ASU, No. 2023-07,\nSegment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures, or ASU No. 2023-07, which requires public entities to: i) provide disclosures of\nsignificant segment expenses and other segment items if\nF-18\nThe RMR Group Inc.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\n(dollars in thousands, except per share amounts)\nthey are regularly provided to the chief operating decision maker, or CODM, and included in each reported measure of segment profit or loss; ii) provide all annual\ndisclosures about a reportable segment’s profit or loss and assets currently required by Accounting Standards Codification, or ASC, 280, Segment Reporting, or\nASC 280, in interim periods; and iii) disclose the CODM’s title and position, as well as an explanation of how the CODM uses the reported measures and other\ndisclosures. Public entities with a single reportable segment must apply all the disclosure requirements of ASU No. 2023-07, as well as all the existing segment\ndisclosures under ASC 280. The amendments in ASU No. 2023-07 are incremental to the requirements in ASC 280 and do not change how a public entity identifies\nits operating segments, aggregates those operating segments, or applies the quantitative thresholds to determine its reportable segments. ASU No. 2023-07 should\nbe applied retrospectively to all prior periods presented in the financial statements and is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, and interim\nperiods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024. Early adoption is permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact ASU No. 2023-07 will have on\nour consolidated financial statements and disclosures.\nIncome Taxes. On December 14, 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-09, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures, or ASU No.\n2023-09, which requires public entities to enhance its annual income tax disclosures by requiring: i) consistent categories and greater disaggregation of information\nin the rate reconciliation, and ii) income taxes paid disaggregated by jurisdiction. ASU No. 2023-09 should be applied prospectively but entities have the option to\napply it retrospectively to all prior periods presented in the financial statements. ASU No. 2023-09 is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15,\n2024, with early adoption permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact ASU No. 2023-09 will have on our consolidated financial statements and disclosures.\nNote 3. Income Taxes\nWe are the sole managing member of RMR LLC. We are a corporation subject to U.S. federal and state income tax with respect to our allocable share of any\ntaxable income of RMR LLC and its tax consolidated subsidiaries. RMR LLC is treated as a partnership for U.S. federal and most applicable state and local income\ntax purposes. As a partnership, RMR LLC is generally not subject to U.S. federal and most state income taxes. Any taxable income or loss generated by RMR LLC\nis passed through to and included in the taxable income or loss of its members, including RMR Inc. and ABP Trust, based on each member’s respective ownership\npercentage. During the fiscal years ended September 30, 2024, 2023 and 2022, all of our income before taxes was derived solely from domestic operations.\nWe had a provision (benefit) for income taxes which consists of the following:\nFiscal Year Ended September 30,\n2024 2023 2022\nCurrent:\nFederal $ 4,912 $ 16,922 $ 8,553\nState 3,350 5,954 3,121\nDeferred:\nFederal 2,248 (940) 1,176\nState 809 (168) 383\nTotal $ 11,319 $ 21,768 $ 13,233\nA reconciliation of the statutory income tax rate to the effective tax rate is as follows:\nFiscal Year Ended September 30,\n2024 2023 2022\nIncome taxes computed at the federal statutory rate 21.0 % 21.0 % 21.0 %\nState taxes, net of federal benefit 3.4 % 3.0 % 3.0 %\nPermanent items 1.1 % 0.5 % 0.7 %\nUncertain tax position reserve, net of federal benefit 1.9 % — % — %\nNet income attributable to noncontrolling interest (9.8)% (9.9)% (10.1)%\nTotal 17.6 % 14.6 % 14.6 %\nThe components of the deferred tax assets as of September 30, 2024 and 2023 are entirely comprised of the outside basis difference in our partnership interest\nin RMR LLC.\nF-19\nThe RMR Group Inc.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\n(dollars in thousands, except per share amounts)\nASC 740, Income Taxes, provides a model for how a company should recognize, measure and present in its financial statements uncertain tax positions that\nhave been taken or are expected to be taken with respect to all open years and in all significant jurisdictions. Pursuant to this topic, we recognize a tax benefit only\nif it is “more likely than not” that a particular tax position will be sustained upon examination or audit. To the extent the “more likely than not” standard has been\nsatisfied, the benefit associated with a tax position is measured as the largest amount that is greater than 50.0% likely to be realized upon settlement.\nWe continue to be subject to federal, state, and local income tax audit examinations for open periods, which can lead to adjustments to our provision for income\ntaxes, the resolution of which may be highly uncertain. We received a proposed adjustment from a state jurisdiction with respect to the tax years ended September\n30, 2019 and 2020. As a result, we have accrued an uncertain tax position reserve for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2024 related to the adjustment for the\nfiscal years ending September 30, 2019 and thereafter. Our policy is to include interest expense related to unrecognized tax benefits within the provision for income\ntaxes in our consolidated statements of income.\nAs of September 30, 2024, our gross unrecognized tax benefit from uncertain tax positions, exclusive of interest expense, was $1,449, of which $107 is based\non positions related to the fiscal year ended September 30, 2024. As of September 30, 2024, we recognized $252 for interest expense related to unrecognized tax\nbenefits and had $1,701 of gross unrecognized tax benefits. As of September 30, 2023 and 2022, we had no uncertain tax positions. We do not reasonably expect\nany significant changes relating to our unrecognized tax benefits within the next twelve months.\nNote 4. Acquisitions\nMPC Partnership Holdings LLC\nOn the Acquisition Date, RMR LLC acquired all of the issued and outstanding equity interests of MPC, excluding certain assets (including co-investment\ninterests of legacy investment funds managed by MPC and the rights to future distributions and income allocations in respect of such interests) and liabilities\n(including liabilities related to such excluded assets), for $80,000 in cash, subject to customary adjustments for cash, debt, transaction expenses and working capital\nat closing, which are expected to be finalized during this fiscal year, plus up to an additional $20,000 subject to the deployment of remaining capital commitments\nin investment funds managed by MPC prior to the end of such funds’ investment period, or the Earnout. In addition to the Earnout, we agreed to pay retention\npayments to certain employees of MPC in an aggregate amount of $4,200 for their continued employment through December 31, 2025, or the Retention Payments.\nThe Retention Payments are recognized as transaction and acquisition related costs and are forfeitable upon termination of employment prior to the end of the\nservice period.\nThe Earnout represents contingent consideration of the Acquisition. The fair value of the Earnout was determined using a Monte Carlo simulation model based\non significant unobservable inputs (Level 3), including management’s estimates of the deployment of capital remaining in investment funds managed by MPC,\nadjusted for historical volatility of similar transactions, and a discount rate based on credit ratings of companies similar to RMR LLC. For additional information,\nsee Note 7, Fair Value of Financial Instruments.\nThe following table summarizes the consideration transferred as of the Acquisition Date, excluding transaction costs:\nCash consideration paid by RMR LLC $ 84,474\nEarnout 14,547\nTotal consideration $ 99,021\nThe Acquisition was accounted for as a business combination under the FASB ASC Topic 805, Business Combinations. The purchase price has been allocated\nto the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on estimates of fair values as of the Acquisition Date.\nGoodwill of $69,902 has been recognized based on the amount that the purchase price exceeds the fair value of the net identifiable assets acquired less the\namounts attributable to noncontrolling interests in consolidated entity. Goodwill is expected to be deductible for income tax purposes and is primarily attributable to\nthe workforce of the acquired business and synergies that can be achieved subsequent to the Acquisition.\nF-20\nThe RMR Group Inc.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\n(dollars in thousands, except per share amounts)\nAs of September 30, 2024, we finalized the purchase price allocation for the Acquisition from the preliminary amounts reported as of December 31, 2024. The\nadjustments made during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2024 to the fair value of acquired assets and liabilities did not have a significant impact on our\nconsolidated balance sheets or our consolidated statements of income.\nThe following table summarizes the fair value amounts recognized for the assets acquired and liabilities assumed and resulting goodwill as of the Acquisition\nDate:\nAssets acquired:\nCash and cash equivalents $ 5,703\nReal estate 8,460\nDue from related parties 6,788\nPrepaid and other current assets 1,373\nIntangible assets:\nProperty management and investment management agreements 13,456\nTrade name 5,175\nInvestor relationships 1,843\nAcquired leases 703\nTotal intangible assets 21,177\nTotal assets acquired 43,501\nLiabilities assumed:\nMortgage note payable 4,726\nOther liabilities 9,212\nTotal liabilities 13,938\nNet identifiable assets acquired 29,563\nNoncontrolling interests in consolidated entity (444)\nGoodwill 69,902\nTotal consideration $ 99,021\nReal estate, acquired leases and mortgage note payable\nWe acquired a 90.0% economic ownership interest in 260 Woodstock Investor, LLC, a mixed-use apartment complex located in Woodstock, GA, or the\nWoodstock Property. The allocation of the fair value of the Woodstock Property and related acquired leases as of the Acquisition Date is as follows:\nLand $ 1,400\nBuilding and improvements 7,060\nAcquired leases 703\nTotal real estate and acquired leases $ 9,163\nWe determined the fair value of the Woodstock Property and related acquired leases using Level 3 inputs and standard industry valuation methods, including\ndiscounted cash flow analyses and sales comparisons. Building and improvements had a remaining useful life of 25 years and the weighted average amortization\nperiod for acquired leases was 2.9 years as of the Acquisition Date.\nA mortgage note payable with an acquisition date fair value of $4,726 and an aggregate principal amount outstanding of $5,429 is secured by the Woodstock\nProperty, bears interest at a fixed rate of 3.71% per annum and matures in August 2029. Interest only payments are due on a monthly basis until September 2025, at\nwhich time payments of principal and interest are due monthly until the loan matures in August 2029. We determined the fair value of the mortgage note payable by\ndiscounting the expected cash flows at a rate comparable with interest rates for similar debt as of the Acquisition Date (Level 3 inputs). Principal payments due\nduring the next five fiscal years are: $8 in 2025, $98 in 2026, $102 in 2027, $105 in 2028 and $5,116 in 2029 and thereafter.\nF-21\nThe RMR Group Inc.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\n(dollars in thousands, except per share amounts)\nAs of September 30, 2024, we have entered into an agreement to sell the Woodstock Property for a sales price of $9,800, excluding closing costs. This pending\nsale is subject to conditions; accordingly, we cannot be sure that we will complete this sale or that this sale will not be delayed or the terms will not change. The\nWoodstock Property is presented in assets held for sale and the mortgage note payable is presented in liabilities held for sale in our consolidated balance sheets. As\nsuch, accumulated depreciation and accumulated amortization excludes $221 and $331, respectively, related to the Woodstock Property. Property and equipment,\nnet also excludes $15 in furniture and equipment related to the Woodstock Property that was purchased after the Acquisition Date. The Acquisition Date fair value\nof the noncontrolling interest in the Woodstock Property (10% ownership we did not acquire) of $444 is reflected in noncontrolling interest in consolidated entity in\nour consolidated balance sheets.\nProperty management and investment management agreements\nAs of the Acquisition Date, MPC managed 66 properties, including 14 in which MPC did not have an economic ownership interest in, or the Third Party\nManaged Properties, through its property management agreements and managed four funds through its investment management agreements. The property\nmanagement agreements may be terminated upon written notice and generally provide for property management fees ranging from 2.5% to 3.5% of gross collected\nrents, construction management fees of 5.0% of construction costs and reimbursement of costs incurred to manage the properties. The investment management\nagreements generally provide for fees that are based on the lesser of a percentage of invested capital and a fixed fee ranging from $100 to $200 annually. As of the\nAcquisition Date, the weighted average remaining useful life of these agreements was 5.6 years.\nTrade name\nMPC operates many of its residential properties under the trade name ARIUM. We concluded this asset has an indefinite life.\nInvestor relationships\nMPC has relationships with institutional investors that have invested in, and may continue to invest in, the funds managed by MPC. As of the Acquisition Date,\nthe weighted average remaining useful life of these relationships was 5.0 years.\nManaged funds\nAs of the Acquisition Date and pursuant to the Equity Purchase Agreement, dated as of July 29, 2023, by and among RMR LLC, MPC, and the sellers and\nseller owners set forth therein, we managed four funds that invest in residential real estate. Three of the four funds have no unfunded capital commitments\nremaining. As of the Acquisition Date, Fund VII had $208,026 in unfunded capital commitments remaining from total capital commitments of $342,825. In the\nfuture, we will be eligible to participate in distributions and profits interests on investments from capital commitments we provide to Fund VII, or Investment\nInterest; however, we had no Investment Interest in Fund VII as of the Acquisition Date, and as of the Acquisition Date, we had no obligations nor rights to any\ndistributions or profits interests from investments of capital contributed on or prior to the Acquisition Date.\nAs of September 30, 2024, we have funded capital of $213 to Fund VII and we have not contributed any capital to any of the other funds we manage. The\nresults of these funds are not reflected in our consolidated financial statements and we have accounted for the contribution to Fund VII as an equity method\ninvestment.\nPro Forma Financial Information\nUnaudited pro forma financial information for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 is presented below. Pro forma financial information\npresented does not include adjustments related to the Earnout or to reflect any potential synergies that may be achievable in connection with the Acquisition. The\nunaudited pro forma financial information is presented for informational purposes only and is not necessarily indicative of future operations or results had the\nAcquisition been completed as of October 1, 2022.\nF-22\nThe RMR Group Inc.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\n(dollars in thousands, except per share amounts)\nFiscal Years Ended September 30,\n2024 2023\nTotal revenues $ 909,231 $ 1,029,963\nNet income 50,489 101,324\nNet income attributable to The RMR Group Inc. 22,003 45,383\nThe amounts above reflect certain pro forma adjustments that were directly attributable to the Acquisition as follows:\n• adjustments to eliminate the revenues and expenses attributable to certain assets and liabilities of MPC excluded from the Acquisition, including co-\ninvestment interests of investment funds owned by MPC and the rights to future distributions and income allocations of those co-investment interests, and\nthe liabilities related to such assets;\n• adjustments to amortize the intangible assets recognized as a result of the Acquisition;\n• adjustments to the historical depreciation of MPC’s property and equipment to reflect the depreciation resulting from the fair value measurement of such\nproperty and equipment;\n• adjustments to interest expense resulting from the fair value measurement of the mortgage note payable; and\n• adjustments to reflect the related transaction costs of $7,302 as if they had occurred as of October 1, 2022.\nRental Property Acquisition\nIn July 2024, we acquired a 240 unit, garden style apartment community located in Denver, CO, or the Denver Property, for a purchase price of $70,000,\nexcluding $509 in capitalized acquisition costs. This transaction was accounted for as an asset acquisition. Our allocation of the purchase price of this acquisition is\nbased on the relative fair value of the acquired assets and is presented in the following table:\nLand $ 10,084\nBuilding and improvements 58,032\nAcquired leases 2,393\nTotal consideration $ 70,509\nNote 5. Loans Held for Investment, Net\nAs part of our strategic initiative to expand our private capital business, our plan is to amass a small portfolio of loans, financed, in part, through a bank\nrepurchase facility, in a Tremont managed vehicle and bring in third parties to invest in the vehicle. The vehicle would then continue growing by making additional\nloans.\nGenerally, these loans are classified as held for investment based upon our intent and ability to hold them until maturity. Loans that are held for investment are\ncarried at cost, net of unamortized loan origination fees, accreted exit fees, unamortized premiums and unaccreted discounts, as applicable, that are required to be\nrecognized in the carrying value of the loans in accordance with GAAP, unless the loans are determined to be collateral dependent.\nIn July 2024, we originated a floating rate first mortgage loan that is secured by a hotel property in Revere, MA for a total commitment of $40,000, which has\nbeen fully funded as of September 30, 2024. This loan requires the borrower to pay interest at a rate of the Secured Overnight Financing Rate, or SOFR, plus a\npremium of 395 basis points per annum and has an initial term of two years with three one year extensions.\nIn July 2024, we originated a floating rate first mortgage loan that is secured by an industrial property in Wayne, PA for a total commitment of $27,000, of\nwhich $17,180 has been funded as of September 30, 2024. This loan requires the borrower to pay interest at the rate of SOFR plus a premium of 425 basis points\nper annum and has an initial term of three years with two one year extensions.\nWe deferred origination fees totaling $700, of which $651 remains unamortized as of September 30, 2024. We have also accrued $35 in exit fee receivables\nwhich we include in loans held for investment in our consolidated balance sheets.\nF-23\nThe RMR Group Inc.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\n(dollars in thousands, except per share amounts)\nThe table below provides overall statistics for our loan portfolio as of September 30, 2024:\nNumber of loans 2\nTotal loan commitments $ 67,000\nUnfunded loan commitments (1) $ 9,820\nPrincipal balance $ 57,180\nWeighted average coupon rate 9.15 %\nWeighted average all in yield (2) 10.13 %\nWeighted average floor 4.34 %\nWeighted average maximum maturity (years) (3) 4.80\n(1) Unfunded loan commitments are primarily used to finance property improvements and leasing capital and are generally funded over the term of the loan.\n(2) All in yield represents the yield on a loan, including amortization of deferred fees over the initial term of the loan.\n(3) Maximum maturity assumes all borrower loan extension options have been exercised, which options are subject to the borrower meeting certain conditions.\nCredit Quality Information\nWe evaluate the credit quality of each of our loans at least quarterly by assessing a variety of risk factors in relation to each loan and assigning a risk rating to\neach loan based on those factors. The higher the number, the greater the risk level. As of September 30, 2024, our two loans had an internal risk rating of 3.\nWe estimate credit losses over a reasonable and supportable forecast period of 12 months, followed by a straight-line reversion period of 12 months back to\naverage historical losses. For the fiscal year ended September 30, 2024, we recorded an allowance for credit losses of $343 related to our then outstanding loans\nheld for investment and increased accounts payable and accrued expenses by $259 related to then unfunded loan commitments.\nWe have elected to exclude accrued interest receivable from amortized cost and not to measure an allowance for credit losses on accrued interest receivable.\nAccrued interest receivables are generally written off when payments are 120 days past due. Such amounts, if any, are reversed against interest income and no\nfurther interest will be recorded until it is collected. As of September 30, 2024, we recognized $454 in prepaid and other current assets on our consolidated balance\nsheets related to accrued interest receivable on our loans and no amounts were written off for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2024.\nAs of September 30, 2024 and November 5, 2024, our borrowers with outstanding loans had paid their debt service obligations owed and due to us.\nNote 6. Indebtedness\nSecured Financing Facility, Net\nIn September 2024, we, through our Tremont managed vehicle, entered into a master repurchase agreement with UBS AG, or UBS, or our UBS Master\nRepurchase Agreement, for a facility with an aggregate maximum capacity of $200,000, or our UBS Master Repurchase Facility, pursuant to which we may sell to\nUBS, and later repurchase, commercial mortgage loans, which are referred to as purchased assets. Pursuant to the UBS Master Repurchase Agreement, we will pay\nUBS a non-refundable upfront fee that is equal to 0.60% of the applicable tranche amount on each purchase date.\nLoans financed through our UBS Master Repurchase Facility are treated as collateralized financing transactions, unless they meet sales treatment under GAAP.\nPursuant to GAAP treatment of collateralized financing transactions, loans financed through our UBS Master Repurchase Facility remain on our consolidated\nbalance sheets as assets and cash received from UBS is recorded on our consolidated balance sheets as liabilities. Interest paid in accordance with our UBS Master\nRepurchase Facility is recorded as loan investment interest expense on our consolidated income statements.\nUnder our UBS Master Repurchase Facility, the initial purchase price paid by UBS for each purchased asset is up to 80% of the lesser of the market value of\nthe purchased asset and the unpaid principal balance of such purchased asset, subject to UBS’s approval. Upon the repurchase of a purchased asset, we are required\nto pay UBS the outstanding purchase price of the\nF-24\nThe RMR Group Inc.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\n(dollars in thousands, except per share amounts)\npurchased asset, accrued interest and all accrued and unpaid expenses of UBS relating to such purchased assets. The pricing rate (or interest rate) relating to a\npurchased asset is equal to one month SOFR, plus a premium within a fixed range, determined by the debt yield and property type of the purchased asset’s real\nestate collateral.\nIn connection with our UBS Master Repurchase Agreement, we entered into a guaranty, or the UBS Guaranty, which requires us to guarantee 25% of the\naggregate repurchase price, and 100% of losses in the event of certain bad acts as well as any costs and expenses of UBS related to our UBS Master Repurchase\nAgreement. The UBS Guaranty also contains financial covenants, which require us to maintain a minimum tangible net worth, a minimum liquidity and to satisfy a\ntotal indebtedness to stockholders' equity ratio. Upon our Tremont managed vehicle meeting certain requirements, including maintaining a minimum tangible net\nworth of $100,000, we will be released from our obligations under the UBS Guaranty and our Tremont managed vehicle shall be deemed the sole guarantor.\nOur UBS Master Repurchase Facility also contains margin maintenance provisions that provide UBS with the right, in certain circumstances related to a credit\nevent, as defined in the UBS Master Repurchase Agreement, to redetermine the value of purchased assets. Where a decline in the value of such purchased assets has\nresulted in a margin deficit, UBS may require us to eliminate any margin deficit through a combination of purchased asset repurchases and cash transfers to UBS\nsubject to UBS’s approval.\nIn September 2024, we sold a purchased asset to UBS for $28,770 with an interest rate equal to SOFR plus a premium of 290 basis points secured by a hotel\nproperty in Revere, MA. The initial term of the purchased asset is two years with no stated extension option and monthly payments of interest only are due until\nmaturity in July 2026. The carrying value of the underlying loan held for investment that is serving as collateral for this purchased asset is $39,373.\nIn September 2024, we sold a purchased asset to UBS for $12,885 with an interest rate equal to SOFR plus a premium of 285 basis points secured by an\nindustrial property in Wayne, PA. The initial term of the purchased asset is three years with no stated extension option and monthly payments of interest only are\ndue until maturity in July 2027. The carrying value of the underlying loan held for investment that is serving as collateral for this purchased asset is $16,848.\nIn connection with the UBS Master Repurchase Agreement, we recognized $561 of deferred financing fees, of which $546 remains unamortized as of\nSeptember 30, 2024.\nAs of September 30, 2024, we were in compliance with the covenants and other terms of the agreements that govern our UBS Master Repurchase Facility.\nMortgage Note Payable, Net\nIn July 2024, we acquired the Denver Property for a purchase price of $70,000, excluding acquisition costs. We financed this purchase with cash on hand and\nproceeds from a $46,500 mortgage loan with a 5.34% fixed interest rate. This mortgage loan requires monthly payments of interest only until maturity in July 2029.\nDeferred financing fees incurred in connection with this mortgage financing are amortized over the term of the mortgage agreement and are recorded as a\ncomponent of interest expense in our consolidated statements of income. Unamortized deferred financing fees totaled $1,351 as of September 30, 2024.\nNote 7. Fair Value of Financial Instruments\nWe determine the estimated fair value of financial assets and liabilities using the three-tier fair value hierarchy established by GAAP, which prioritizes\nobservable inputs in active markets when measuring fair value. The three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value in order of priority are as follows:\nLevel 1 — Inputs include quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that we have the ability to access.\nLevel 2 — Inputs include quoted prices in markets that are less active or inactive or for which all significant inputs are observable, either directly or indirectly.\nLevel 3 — Inputs include unobservable prices and are supported by little or no market activity and are significant to the overall fair value measurement.\nF-25\nThe RMR Group Inc.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\n(dollars in thousands, except per share amounts)\nAs of September 30, 2024 and 2023, the fair values of our financial instruments, which include cash and cash equivalents, amounts due from related parties,\naccounts payable and accrued expenses and reimbursable accounts payable and accrued expenses, were not materially different from their carrying values due to the\nshort term nature of these financial instruments.\nWe estimate the fair value of our fixed rate mortgage note payable, loans held for investment and outstanding principal balances under our UBS Master\nRepurchase Facility using significant observable inputs (Level 3), including discounted cash flow analyses and prevailing market interest rates.\nThe table below provides information regarding these financial instruments not carried at fair value in our consolidated balance sheet as of September 30, 2024:\nAs of September 30, 2024 As of September 30, 2023\nCarrying Value Fair Value Carrying Value Fair Value\nLoans held for investment $ 56,221 $ 57,365 $ — $ —\nSecured financing facility 41,109 41,793 — —\nMortgage note payable 45,149 46,520 — —\nOn a recurring basis, we measure certain financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value based upon quoted market prices. ASC 820, Fair Value\nMeasurements, establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value. The hierarchy gives the highest\npriority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities, or Level 1, the lowest priority to unobservable inputs, or Level 3, and\nsignificant other observable inputs, or Level 2. A financial asset’s or financial liability’s fair value measurement level within the fair value hierarchy is based on the\nlowest level of any input that is significant to the fair value measurement.\nThe following tables present our assets and liabilities that have been measured at fair value on a recurring basis:\nSeptember 30, 2024\nTotal Level 1 Level 2 Level 3\nDue from related parties related to share based payment awards $ 14,339 $ 14,339 $ — $ —\nEquity method investment in SEVN 23,520 23,520 — —\nEmployer compensation liability related to share based payment awards 14,339 14,339 — —\nEarnout liability 11,958 — — 11,958\nSeptember 30, 2023\nTotal Level 1 Level 2 Level 3\nDue from related parties related to share based payment awards $ 10,695 $ 10,695 $ — $ —\nEquity method investment in SEVN 18,651 18,651 — —\nEmployer compensation liability related to share based payment awards 10,695 10,695 — —\nThe following table presents additional information about the valuation techniques and significant unobservable inputs for financial assets and liabilities that\nare measured at fair value and categorized within Level 3 as of September 30, 2024:\nFair Value Valuation Technique Unobservable Input Range\nEarnout liability $ 11,958 Monte Carlo Capital deployment volatility 15.00%\nDiscount rate 5.53%\nF-26\nThe RMR Group Inc.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\n(dollars in thousands, except per share amounts)\nThe table below presents a summary of the changes in fair value for our Earnout liability measured on a recurring basis:\nFiscal Year Ended\nSeptember 30, 2024\nBeginning balance $ —\nAcquisition of MPC Partnership Holdings LLC 14,547\nChanges in fair value for our Earnout liability measured on a recurring basis (2,589)\nEnding balance $ 11,958\nNote 8.

Our related party leases have various termination dates and many have renewal options. Some of our related party leases are terminable on 30 days’\nnotice and many allow us to terminate early if our management agreements for the buildings in which we lease space are terminated. For additional information\nregarding these leases, see Note 13, Leases.\nTax-Related Payments\nPursuant to our tax receivable agreement with ABP Trust, RMR Inc. pays to ABP Trust 85.0% of the amount of cash savings, if any, in U.S. federal, state and\nlocal income tax or franchise tax that RMR Inc. realizes as a result of (a) the increases in tax basis attributable to RMR Inc.’s dealings with ABP Trust and (b) tax\nbenefits related to imputed interest deemed to be paid by RMR Inc. as a result of the tax receivable agreement. Accordingly, we made payments of $2,366, $2,355\nand $2,209 to ABP Trust during the fiscal years ended September 30, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. As of September 30, 2024, our consolidated balance sheet\nreflects a liability related to the tax receivable agreement of $20,863, including $2,421 classified as a current liability in accounts payable and accrued expenses that\nwe expect to pay to ABP Trust during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2025.\nPursuant to the RMR LLC operating agreement, for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2024, 2023 and 2022, RMR LLC made required quarterly tax\ndistributions to holders of its membership units totaling $27,796, $65,486 and $30,281, respectively, of which $14,799, $34,541 and $15,940, respectively, was\ndistributed to us and $12,997, $30,945 and $14,341, respectively, was distributed to ABP Trust, based on each membership unit holder’s respective ownership\npercentage at the time of distribution. The amounts distributed to us were eliminated in our consolidated financial statements, and the amounts distributed to ABP\nTrust were recorded as a reduction of its noncontrolling interest. We use funds from these distributions to pay certain of our U.S. federal and state income tax\nliabilities and to pay part of our obligations under the tax receivable agreement.\nF-31\nThe RMR Group Inc.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\n(dollars in thousands, except per share amounts)\nRegistration and Lock-up Agreements\nThe following registration rights and lock-up agreements are in effect:\n• ABP Trust Registration Rights Agreement. RMR Inc. is party to a registration rights agreement with ABP Trust pursuant to which RMR Inc. has granted\nABP Trust demand and piggyback registration rights, subject to certain limitations, covering the Class A Common Shares ABP Trust owns, including the\nshares received on conversion of Class B-1 Common Shares or redemption of the paired Class B-2 Common Shares and Class A Units of RMR LLC.\n• Founders Registration Rights and Lock-Up Agreements. Adam D. Portnoy and ABP Trust are parties to a registration rights and lock-up agreement with\neach of DHC, OPI and SVC with respect to each such Managed Equity REITs’ common shares. Pursuant to that agreement, ABP Trust and Adam D.\nPortnoy agreed not to transfer the Managed Equity REITs’ common shares they acquired in connection with RMR LLC’s reorganization in June 2015 for a\nperiod of ten years, subject to certain exceptions, and each of those Managed Equity REITs has granted ABP Trust and Adam D. Portnoy demand and\npiggyback registration rights, subject to certain limitations.\nSeparation Arrangements\nWe enter into retirement agreements with certain of our former executive officers. Pursuant to these agreements, we make various cash payments and accelerate\nthe vesting of unvested shares of RMR Inc. previously awarded to these retiring officers. We also enter into separation arrangements from time to time with\nexecutive and non-executive officers and employees of ours. All costs associated with separation arrangements, for which there remain no substantive performance\nobligations, are recorded in our consolidated statements of income as separation costs.\nFor the fiscal year ended September 30, 2024, 2023 and 2022, we recognized separation costs of $6,297, $2,002, and $1,315 respectively, including equity\nbased separation costs of $632, $482 and $163, respectively, and cash separation costs of $5,665, $1,520, and $1,152, respectively.\nNote 9. Shareholders’ Equity\nCommon Shares\nClass A Common Shares—Class A Common Shares entitle holders to one vote for each share held of record on all matters submitted to a vote of shareholders.\nClass B-1 Common Shares—ABP Trust owns 1,000,000 Class B-1 Common Shares that entitle the holder to ten votes for each share on all matters submitted\nto a vote of shareholders. Each Class B-1 Common Share may, at the option of its holder, be converted into a Class A Common Share, on a one for one basis.\nClass B-2 Common Shares—ABP Trust owns 15,000,000 Class B-2 Common Shares, which are paired with the 15,000,000 RMR LLC Class A Units and have\nno independent economic interest in RMR Inc. The Class A Units may, at the option of the holder, be redeemed for Class A Common Shares on a one to one basis\nand, upon such redemption, our Class B-2 Common Shares that are paired with the Class A Units are automatically canceled. RMR Inc. has the option to settle the\nredemption in cash. Each Class B-2 Common Share entitles the holder to ten votes per share, and, accordingly, the issuance of additional Class B-2 Common Shares\nwould have a significant dilutive effect on the voting power of the then current holders of our Class A Common Shares.\nExcept as otherwise required in the charter or by applicable law, all holders of Class A Common Shares, Class B-1 Common Shares, and Class B-2 Common\nShares shall vote together as a single class on all matters on which shareholders are generally entitled to vote. The holders of a class of common shares shall each be\nentitled to vote separately as a single class with respect to (and only with respect to) amendments to the charter that alter or change the powers or rights of the\nshares of such class of common shares so as to affect them materially and adversely; provided, however, if such amendments affect all holders of common shares\nmaterially and adversely in the same manner, the separate voting requirement shall not be applicable and all holders of common shares shall vote together as a\nsingle class.\nF-32\nThe RMR Group Inc.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\n(dollars in thousands, except per share amounts)\nIssuances and Repurchases\nWe award our Class A Common Shares to our officers and employees under the Amended and Restated 2016 Omnibus Equity Plan, or the 2016 Plan.

The repurchase price is based on the closing\nprice of our Class A Common Shares on The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC, or Nasdaq.

This dividend will be partially funded by a\ndistribution from RMR LLC to holders of its membership units in the amount of $0.32 per unit, or $10,191, of which $5,391 will be distributed to us based on our\naggregate ownership of 16,846,025 membership units of RMR LLC and $4,800 will be distributed to ABP Trust based on its ownership of 15,000,000 membership\nunits of RMR LLC. The remainder of this dividend will be funded with cash accumulated at RMR Inc. We expect to pay this dividend on or about November 14,\n2024.\nNote 10. Per Common Share Amounts\nWe calculate basic earnings per share using the two-class method. Unvested Class A Common Shares awarded to our employees are deemed participating\nsecurities for purposes of calculating basic earnings per common share because they have dividend rights. Under the two-class method, we allocate earnings\nproportionately to vested Class A Common Shares and Class B-1 Common Shares outstanding and unvested Class A Common Shares outstanding for the period.\nAccordingly, earnings attributable to unvested Class A Common Shares are excluded from basic earnings per share under the two-class method. Our Class B-2\nCommon Shares, which are paired with ABP Trust’s Class A Units, have no independent economic interest in RMR Inc. and thus are not included as common\nshares outstanding for purposes of calculating basic earnings per common share.\nDiluted earnings per share is calculated using the treasury stock method for unvested Class A Common Shares and the if-converted method for Class B-2\nCommon Shares. The 15,000,000 Class A Units that we do not own may be redeemed for our Class A Common Shares on a one-for-one basis or, upon such\nredemption, we may elect to pay cash instead of issuing Class A Common Shares. Upon redemption of a Class A Unit, the Class B-2 Common Share “paired” with\nsuch unit is canceled for no additional consideration. In computing the dilutive effect, if any, the assumed redemption would have on earnings per share, we\nconsidered net income available to holders of our Class A Common Shares would increase due to elimination of the noncontrolling interest offset by any tax effect,\nwhich may be dilutive. For the fiscal years ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, such redemption is not reflected in diluted earnings per share as the assumed\nredemption would be anti-dilutive. For the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022, the assumed redemption is dilutive to earnings per share.\nF-35\nThe RMR Group Inc.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\n(dollars in thousands, except per share amounts)\nThe calculation of basic and diluted earnings per share for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2024, 2023 and 2022, is as follows (amounts\nin thousands, except per share amounts):\nFiscal Year Ended September 30,\n2024 2023 2022\nNumerators:\nNet income attributable to The RMR Group Inc. $ 23,130 $ 57,147 $ 34,004\nLess: income attributable to unvested participating securities (323) (651) (329)\nNet income attributable to The RMR Group Inc. used in calculating basic EPS 22,807 56,496 33,675\nEffect of dilutive securities:\nAdd back: income attributable to unvested participating securities — — 329\nAdd back: net income attributable to noncontrolling interest — — 43,464\nAdd back: income tax expense — — 13,233\nLess: income tax expense assuming redemption of noncontrolling interest’s Class A Units for Class\nA Common Shares (1) — — (26,732)\nNet income used in calculating diluted EPS $ 22,807 $ 56,496 $ 63,969\nDenominators:\nCommon shares outstanding 16,846 16,712 16,606\nLess: unvested participating securities and incremental impact of weighted average (314) (286) (268)\nWeighted average common shares outstanding - basic 16,532 16,426 16,338\nEffect of dilutive securities:\nAdd: assumed redemption of noncontrolling interest’s Class A Units for Class A Common Shares — — 15,000\nAdd: incremental unvested shares — — 10\nWeighted average common shares outstanding - diluted 16,532 16,426 31,348\nNet income attributable to The RMR Group Inc. per common share - basic $ 1.38 $ 3.44 $ 2.06\nNet income attributable to The RMR Group Inc. per common share - diluted $ 1.38 $ 3.44 $ 2.04\n(1) Income tax expense assumes the hypothetical conversion of the noncontrolling interest, which results in an estimated tax rate of 29.5% for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022.\nNote 11.

Employee Benefits\nWe have established a defined contribution savings plan for eligible employees under the provisions of U.S. Internal Revenue Code Section 401(k) whereby we\ncontribute 100.0% of the first 3.0% and 50.0% of the next 2.0% of an employee’s cash compensation contributed to the plan up to stated maximums. All employees\nare eligible to participate in the plan and are entitled, upon termination or retirement, to receive their vested portion of the plan assets. Employees’ contributions and\nour related matching contributions are fully vested when made. Our plan contributions and expenses for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2024, 2023 and 2022,\nwere $3,390, $2,992 and $2,726, respectively.\nNote 13. Leases\nWe enter into operating leases, as the lessee, for office space and vehicles and determine if an arrangement is a lease at inception of the arrangement. Operating\nlease liabilities and right of use assets are recognized on our consolidated balance sheet for leases with an initial term greater than 12 months based on the present\nvalue of the future minimum lease payments over the lease term using our estimated incremental borrowing rate. Operating lease expense associated with minimum\nlease payments is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. When additional payments are based on usage or vary based on other factors, they are\nexpensed when incurred as variable lease expense. Certain leases include lease and non-lease components, which we account for as a single lease component.\nMinimum lease payments for leases with an initial term of 12 months or less are not recorded on our consolidated balance sheet. As of September 30, 2024, we had\n60 leases that expire at various dates through 2031, with a weighted average remaining lease term of 5.0 years and a weighted average discount rate of 3.9%.\nFor the fiscal years ended September 30, 2024, 2023 and 2022, the components of operating lease costs were as follows:\nFiscal Year Ended September 30,\n2024 2023 2022\nFixed rent expense (1) $ 6,636 $ 6,272 $ 6,144\nVariable lease payments 1,158 907 1,001\nTotal cash portion of rent expense 7,794 7,179 7,145\nNon-cash straight line rent expense (380) (345) (352)\nTotal operating lease costs $ 7,414 $ 6,834 $ 6,793\n(1) Includes expense for leases with an initial term of 12 months or less of $5, $76 and $83 for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nThe following table presents the undiscounted cash flows on an annual fiscal year basis for our operating lease liabilities as of September 30, 2024:\nFiscal Year Amount\n2025 $ 6,907\n2026 6,293\n2027 5,866\n2028 4,943\n2029 4,111\nThereafter 2,716\nTotal lease payments (1) 30,836\nLess: imputed interest (1) (2,783)\nPresent value of operating lease liabilities 28,053\nLess: current portion of operating lease liabilities (5,906)\nOperating lease liabilities, net of current portion $ 22,147\n(1) Excludes $291 of lease payments for signed leases that have not yet commenced.\nAs of September 30, 2024, $21,283 of total lease payments and $1,841 of imputed interest are for our principal executive offices, which are leased from an\naffiliate of ABP Trust pursuant to a lease agreement that expires in 2030.\nF-37\nTable of Contents\nSIGNATURES\nPursuant to the requirements of Section 13 and 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its\nbehalf by the undersigned, thereunto duly authorized.\nTHE RMR GROUP INC.\nBy: /s/ Adam D.

Watkins, Jr.\nExhibit 19.1\nThe RMR Group Inc.\nInsider Trading Policies and Procedures\nTo promote compliance with applicable insider trading laws and to protect our reputation for integrity and ethical conduct, we have adopted these\ninsider trading policies and procedures, which we refer to as our “insider trading policy.”\nWhen we refer to “RMR Inc.” we are referring to The RMR Group Inc. When we refer to “RMR” we are referring to RMR Inc., The RMR Group\nLLC (“RMR LLC”), and RMR LLC’s subsidiaries.\nRMR LLC, directly and through its subsidiaries, provides management and other services to certain public companies and may provide services to\nadditional public companies in the future, and we refer to each of these public companies as a “Covered Public Company.”\nOur insider trading policy applies to directors, officers and employees of RMR Inc., RMR LLC, and RMR LLC’s subsidiaries, who we refer to as\n“Covered Persons” or “you”. All Covered Persons are expected to comply with the specific provisions of our insider trading policy that are\napplicable to them as well as those applicable to their family members. It is also our policy that RMR Inc. will not engage in transactions in\nsecurities of RMR Inc. or of a Covered Public Company while aware of material, non-public information relating to such company.\nA. General Prohibition on Insider Trading.\nYou may not directly or indirectly engage in any transaction involving the purchase or sale of securities of RMR Inc. (“RMR Securities”) or of any\nCovered Public Company (“Covered Public Company Securities”) while aware of material, non-public information concerning such company.\nSecurities are broadly defined to include common shares, any other equity and debt securities, as well as any related derivative securities.\nWhat is Material Information? Information is considered “material” if a reasonable investor would consider that information important in\nmaking a decision to buy, hold or sell securities. Any information that could be expected to affect a company’s stock price, whether it is\npositive or negative, should be considered material. There is no bright-line standard for assessing materiality; rather, materiality is based on\nan assessment of all of the facts and circumstances, and is often evaluated by enforcement authorities with the benefit of hindsight. While it\nis not possible to define all categories of material information, some examples of information that ordinarily would be regarded as material\nare: earnings projections; a proposed material acquisition, divestiture or joint venture; a restructuring; a change in dividend policy; material\nfinancings; a change in management or the Board; pending or threatened material litigation; or a material cybersecurity incident.\nWhen is Information Considered Public? Information is considered “public” once it has been widely disseminated, for example through\nnewswire services, a news website or public disclosure documents filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) that\nare available on the SEC’s website. Even after information is widely disseminated, it is still considered “non-public” until the investing\npublic has had sufficient time to absorb the information. As a general rule, information should not be considered fully absorbed by the\nmarketplace until the opening of business on the second trading day after the day on which the information is released. If, for example, RMR\nInc. were to make an announcement after the market closes on a Monday, you should not trade RMR Securities until the opening of business\non Wednesday.\nTipping. The prohibition against insider trading applies to (i) tipping, i.e., disclosing material, non-public information to another person\nwithin RMR whose job does not require that person to have that information or another person outside of RMR, including, but not limited to,\nfamily, friends, business associates, investors and others, unless the disclosure is made in accordance with RMR Inc.’s or the Covered Public\nCompany’s policies, as applicable, regarding the protection or authorized external disclosure of information regarding RMR or the Covered\nPublic Company and (ii) making recommendations to purchase or sell any RMR Securities or Covered Public Company Securities on the\nbasis of material, non-public information.\nTransactions by Entities that You Influence or Control. Our insider trading policy applies to any entities that you influence or control,\nincluding any corporations, limited liability companies, partnerships or trusts. Transactions in RMR Securities or Covered Public Company\nSecurities by a controlled entity should be treated for the purposes of our insider trading policy and applicable securities laws as if they were\nfor your own account.\nTransactions by Family Members and Others. Our insider trading policy applies to: (i) your family members who reside with you (including\na spouse, a child, a child away at college, stepchildren, grandchildren, parents, stepparents, grandparents, siblings and in-laws); (ii) anyone\nelse who lives in your household; and (iii) any family members who do not live in your household but whose transactions in RMR Securities\nor Covered Public Company Securities are directed by you or are subject to your influence or control. You are responsible for the\ntransactions of these other persons and therefore should make them aware of the need to confer with you before they trade in RMR\nSecurities or Covered Public Company Securities, and you should treat all such transactions for the purposes of our insider trading policy\nand applicable securities laws as if the transactions were for your own account. Our insider trading policy does not, however, apply to\npersonal securities transactions of a family member who resides with you where the purchase or sale decision is made by a third party not\ncontrolled by, influenced by or related to you or such family member.\nOther Public Companies. The prohibition against insider trading also applies to trading in the securities of publicly traded companies other\nthan RMR Inc. and the Covered Public Companies if you have material, non -public information with respect to such company, including\ninformation you may have learned in the course of performing your duties for RMR.\nRestricted Stock Awards. Our insider trading policy does not apply to the vesting of restricted common shares of RMR or a Covered Public\nCompany, or the exercise of a tax withholding right pursuant to which you elect to have RMR or a Covered Public Company withhold\ncommon shares to satisfy tax withholding requirements upon the vesting of any restricted common shares of RMR or a Covered Public\nCompany, as applicable. Our insider trading policy does apply, however, to any sale in the open market of common shares of RMR or a\nCovered Public Company, as applicable, including to satisfy tax withholding requirements.\nDividend Reinvestment Plan. Our insider trading policy does not apply to regular reinvestment of dividends in RMR Securities or Covered\nPublic Company Securities you make pursuant to a dividend reinvestment plan offered by RMR or a Covered Public Company or by your\nbank or brokerage firm at which you hold your applicable RMR Securities or Covered Public Company Securities. Our insider trading policy\ndoes apply, however, to your election to participate in a dividend reinvestment plan and to any additional voluntary purchases of RMR\nSecurities or Covered Public Company Securities resulting from additional contributions you choose to make to a dividend reinvestment\nplan in excess of the cash dividends you receive. Our insider trading policy also applies to your sale of RMR Securities or Covered Public\nCompany Securities purchased pursuant to the dividend reinvestment plan.\nPurchases from or Sales to RMR Inc. or Covered Public Companies. Our insider trading policy does not apply to any other purchase of RMR\nSecurities or Covered Public Company Securities from the issuer of such securities or sales of RMR Securities or Covered Public Company\nSecurities to the issuer of such securities.\nTermination of Service. Our insider trading policy continues to apply to transactions in RMR Securities and Covered Public Company\nSecurities even after termination of (i) RMR’s services to a Covered Public Company or (ii) your service to RMR. If a Covered Person is in\npossession of material, non-public information when such service is terminated, that Covered Person may not trade in RMR Securities or\nCovered Public Company Securities, if applicable, until that information has become pubic or is no longer material. Individuals subject to a\nblackout period under Section C below at the time of termination of service may not trade in RMR Securities and Covered Public Company\nSecurities until after the end of the blackout period. The pre-clearance procedures in Section B below, however, will cease to apply upon\ntermination of your service to RMR.\nGifts. All gifts of RMR Securities or Covered Public Company Securities are transactions subject to our insider trading policy and may not\nbe made while the person making the gift is aware of material, non-public information, and you are required to obtain pre-clearance of the\ngift if you are subject to the pre-clearance procedures in Section B below.\nB. Pre-clearance Procedures.\nTo promote compliance with the general prohibition on insider trading, we have adopted the following procedures:\nApproval for Transactions in RMR Securities. Directors and any senior level officer of RMR (including the head of investor relations and\nany officer of the level of Senior Vice President or above of RMR) must obtain authorization to buy or sell RMR Securities, from at least\ntwo individuals designated for that purpose by the Managing Directors of RMR Inc., using our “Authorization to Trade” form (or such other\nmanner of providing the information called for by our “Authorization to Trade” form). The individuals currently designated with this\napproval authority are any Managing Director, the Chief Executive Officer, the President, the General Counsel and the Chief Financial\nOfficer of RMR Inc., which list may be updated from time to time. No designated individual may act to authorize his or her own trades,\nagreements or trading plans.\nYou may obtain an “Authorization to Trade” form on RMR LLC’s SharePoint website. You should submit for approval any request for an\nauthorization to trade at least two business days in advance of when you wish to receive approval.\nApproval for Transactions in Covered Public Company Securities. Covered Persons may not buy or sell Covered Public Company Securities\nexcept in accordance with the procedures established by the applicable Covered Public Company for such transactions and this insider\ntrading policy. Copies of the applicable Covered Public Company procedures may be obtained from our General Counsel.\nAny authorization granted under this Section B, (i) will be limited to a specified dollar or share amount, (ii) will either expire at a specified date or, if\nno date is specified, will expire automatically after four calendar days, and (iii) may be revoked at any earlier time by notice to you. If a request for\nauthorization is denied, the fact of such denial must be kept confidential by you.\nThe procedures described above have been adopted for the benefit of RMR Inc. to promote compliance with securities laws. The granting of any\nsuch authorization under this Section B does not relieve you of your legal responsibilities not to purchase or sell shares or other securities while in\npossession of material, non-public information and otherwise to comply with applicable securities and other laws in connection with trading in\nsecurities.\nC. Prohibited Transactions.\nCertain types of transactions may increase exposure to legal risks for RMR, the Covered Public Companies and you and may create the appearance\nof impropriety or inappropriate conduct. Therefore, Covered Persons may not engage in the following transactions, except as noted below:\nShort sales. You may not, directly or indirectly through your family members or others, engage in any short sale of any RMR Securities or\nCovered Public Company Securities. Short sales of shares of a company are transactions where you borrow shares, sell the borrowed shares\nand then buy shares at a later date to replace the borrowed shares. Short sales may evidence an expectation on your part that the shares\nwill decline in value and therefore have the potential to signal to the market that you lack confidence in the company. They may also reduce\nyour incentive to seek to improve the company’s performance.\nPublicly traded options. You may not engage in any transaction in any publicly traded option related to any RMR Securities or Covered\nPublic Company Securities. Given the short term of publicly traded options, transactions in these options may create the appearance that\nyour trading is based on material, non-public information and may focus you on short term performance at the expense of the company’s\nlong term objectives.\nHedging transactions. You may not engage in any hedging transaction related to any RMR Securities or Covered Public Company\nSecurities. Certain forms of hedging transactions with respect to a company would allow you to own securities without the full risk and\nreward of ownership which may result in you no longer having the same objectives as the company’s other shareholders.\nMargin accounts and pledges. You may not hold any RMR Securities or Covered Public Company Securities in a margin account or pledge\nany such securities as collateral for a loan without the approval of our Managing Directors. Securities held in a margin account may be sold\nby the broker without your consent if you fail to meet a margin call. Similarly, securities pledged as collateral for a loan may be sold if you\ndefault on the loan. These sales may occur at a time when you are aware of material, non-public information or otherwise not permitted to\ntrade such securities.\nStanding and Limit Orders. You may not place standing or limit orders on RMR Securities or Public Company Securities without the\napproval of our Managing Directors. Standing and limit orders create heightened risks for insider trading violations because there is no\ncontrol over the timing of purchases or sales that result from standing instructions to a broker, and as a result, the broker could execute a\ntransaction when you possess material nonpublic information.\nD. Blackout Periods.\nAll members of the Board of Directors of RMR Inc., all executive officers of RMR Inc., and RMR LLC and its subsidiaries and certain other\nindividuals designated from time to time by (i) a Managing Director or (ii) the Secretary (such members of the Board of Directors, executive\nofficers and designated individuals, collectively, the “Company Insiders”) are subject to the following blackout periods, during which they may not\nbuy or sell, or otherwise trade in, or agree to buy, sell or otherwise trade in, including by entering into a share trading plan such as a 10b5-1 trading\nplan with respect to, any RMR Securities or Covered Public Company Securities:\nQuarterly Blackout. The period surrounding RMR Inc.’s or a Covered Public Company’s announcement of its quarterly financial results is a\nparticularly sensitive period of time for transactions in RMR Securities or Covered Public Company Securities, as applicable, from the\nperspective of compliance with applicable securities laws. During these periods, Company Insiders may possess or be presumed to possess\nmaterial, non-public information about RMR Inc.’s or a Covered Public Company’s financial results. Accordingly, Company Insiders are\nsubject to quarterly blackout periods beginning 15 days prior to the end of each fiscal quarter and ending as of the opening of trading of the\nprincipal securities exchange on which RMR Inc.’s or a Covered Public Company’s common shares, as applicable, are listed for trading on\nthe second trading day following the public release of RMR Inc.’s earning or a Covered Public Company’s earnings, as applicable for that\nquarter. During a quarterly blackout period, Company Insiders may not, directly or indirectly through a family member or others, buy or sell,\nor otherwise trade in, or agree to buy, sell or otherwise trade in, RMR Securities or Covered Public Company Securities, as applicable, in\nopen market transactions or through a broker, including by entering into a share trading plan such as a 10b5-1 trading plan with respect to\nRMR Securities or Covered Public Company Securities, as applicable.\nOther Blackout Periods. From time to time, you may become aware of other types of material, non-public information regarding RMR Inc.\nor a Covered Public Company. Prior to public disclosure of such information, RMR Inc. or a Covered Public Company, as applicable, may\nimpose a special blackout period during which Company Insiders may not, directly or indirectly through a family member or others, buy or\nsell, or otherwise trade in, or agree to buy, sell or otherwise trade in, RMR Securities of Covered Public Company Securities, as applicable,\nin open market transactions or through a broker, including by entering into a share trading plan such as a 10b5-1 trading plan with respect to\nRMR Securities or Covered Public Company Securities, as applicable. If RMR Inc. or a Covered Public Company imposes a special\nblackout period, it will notify the applicable Company Insiders. Company Insiders subject to a special blackout period may not disclose the\nexistence of the blackout period to any other person. In addition, you may be informed from time to time by RMR or a Covered Public\nCompany of certain companies that are on a restricted trading list, and you must comply with those restrictions as well.\nTrading Window. Company Insiders may only conduct transactions in RMR Securities or Covered Public Company Securities, as applicable,\nduring the trading window beginning as of the opening of trading of the principal securities exchange on which RMR’s common shares or a\nCovered Public Company’s common shares, as applicable, are listed for trading on the second business day following the public release of\nRMR Inc.’s or a Covered Public Company’s, as applicable, quarterly earnings and ending 30 days prior to the close of the then current fiscal\nquarter, and then only upon receipt of prior written authorization in accordance with the procedures set forth in Section B of our insider\ntrading policy and subject to any special blackout period and the restrictions in Section C of our insider trading policy.\nTrading in RMR Securities or Covered Public Company Securities, as applicable, during the trading window should not be considered a “safe\nharbor,” and Company Insiders should use good judgment at all times. Even during a trading window, Company Insiders must obtain prior\napproval for all purchases, sales and other trades in accordance with Section B of our insider trading policy and may not purchase, sell or\notherwise trade RMR Securities or Covered Public Company Securities, as applicable, while in possession of material, non-public\ninformation.\nThe quarterly trading restrictions and, except as otherwise determined by RMR, event-driven trading restrictions do not apply to:\n• transactions conducted pursuant to an approved Rule 10b5-1 trading plan entered into during a trading window, described below under the\nheading “Rule 10b5-1 trading plans”; and\n• regular reinvestment in RMR Securities or Covered Public Company Securities you make pursuant to a dividend reinvestment plan offered\nby RMR Inc. or a Covered Public Company or by your bank or brokerage firm at which you hold your applicable RMR Securities or\nCovered Public Company Securities, as applicable, (provided, however, that the restrictions do apply to voluntary purchases of RMR\nSecurities or Covered Public Company Securities, as applicable, resulting from additional contributions you choose to make to a dividend\nreinvestment plan, and to your election to participate in a dividend reinvestment plan or increase your level of participation in a dividend\nreinvestment plan).\nExceptions to the quarterly trading restriction may be permitted in individual cases at the discretion of the persons authorized to pre-clear\ntransactions in accordance with Section B of our insider trading policy.\nE. Rule 10b5-1 Trading Plans.\nCompany Securities. Rule 10b5-1 promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, (the “Exchange Act”) provides an\naffirmative defense from insider trading liability under Rule 10b-5. In order to rely on this defense, a trade must be made pursuant to a pre-arranged,\nwritten trading plan that was entered into when you were not aware of material, non-public information and that complies with the requirements of\nRule 10b5-1. If you wish to enter into a 10b5-1 trading plan to buy or sell RMR Securities, you must obtain prior approval in accordance with\nSection B of our insider trading policy prior to the adoption of the plan. You may not enter into or amend a Rule 10b5-1 trading plan during a period\nwhen you are subject to any blackout period trading restrictions that RMR Inc. may impose or you are otherwise in possession of material, non-\npublic information. Directors and officers of RMR Inc. subject to Section 16 of the Exchange Act (collectively, “Section 16 Insiders”) should be\naware that RMR Inc. will be required to make quarterly disclosures regarding all Rule 10b5-1 trading\nplans entered into, amended or terminated by Section 16 Insiders and to include the material terms of such plans, other than pricing information.\nAdditionally, a Rule 10b5-1 trading plan must comply with the requirements of Rule 10b5-1 (including specified waiting periods and limitations on\nmultiple overlapping plans and single trade plans). Once such plan is adopted, you must not exercise any influence over the amount of RMR\nSecurities to be traded, the price at which they are to be traded or the date of the trade; and you may not amend, modify or terminate a 10b-1 trading\nplan unless you obtain prior approval in accordance with Section B of our insider trading policy.\nIn addition, the following considerations apply to individuals who may be deemed “affiliates” of RMR Inc. within the meaning of Rule 144\npromulgated under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. For these purposes, “affiliates” include the members of the Board of Directors of RMR\nInc. and our executive officers. Under Rule 144, an affiliate of RMR Inc. is subject to a limitation on the amount of securities that may be sold for his\nor her account during any three-month period. If an affiliate of RMR Inc. with an outstanding 10b5-1 trading plan sells securities outside of the plan\nand the sales reduce the applicable volume limits under Rule 144, the 10b5-1 trading plan may be deemed modified to the extent that the broker\nadministering the plan is forced to sell fewer securities than would have otherwise been the case. To avoid this situation, RMR affiliates must take\ncare to not sell designated plan securities outside of the plan, and further ensure that any sales of securities outside of the 10b5-1 trading plan do not\nadversely affect the volume limits under Rule 144 to the detriment of plan sales.\nYou agree to cooperate with us in reporting any trading plan you adopt, as may be required under the securities laws or as we may request.\nCovered Public Company Securities. Covered Persons may not enter into a 10b5-1 trading plan with respect to Covered Public Company Securities,\nexcept in accordance with the procedures established by the applicable Covered Public Company for such 10b5-1 trading plans. Copies of the\nCovered Public Companies’ procedures for 10b5-1 trading plans may be obtained from our General Counsel.\nF. Consequences of Violations\nThe purchase or sale of RMR Securities or Covered Public Company Securities while you are aware of material, non-public information, or the\ndisclosure of material, non-public information to others who then trade in RMR Securities or Covered Public Company Securities, is prohibited by\nthe federal and state laws. Insider trading violations are pursued vigorously by the SEC, U.S. Attorneys and state enforcement authorities.\nPunishment for insider trading violations is severe, and could include significant fines and imprisonment.\nIn addition, your failure to comply with our insider trading policy may subject you to disciplinary action, including termination, whether or not your\nfailure to comply with our insider trading policy results in a violation of law.\nSeptember 10, 2024\nExhibit 21.1\nSUBSIDIARIES OF THE RMR GROUP INC.\nName State of Formation, Organization or Incorporation\nThe RMR Group LLC Maryland\nRMR Licenses Inc.

The GAAP financial measure that is most directly comparable to Adjusted Net Income Attributable to The RMR Group Inc. is net\nincome attributable to The RMR Group Inc. The GAAP financial measure that is most directly comparable to Adjusted Net Income Attributable to The RMR\nGroup Inc. per diluted share is net income attributable to The RMR Group Inc. per diluted share. The GAAP financial measure that is most directly\ncomparable to EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Distributable Earnings is net income and the GAAP financial measure that is most directly comparable to\nAdjusted EBITDA Margin is net income margin, which represents net income divided by total revenues, excluding reimbursable costs.\nThese non-GAAP financial measures do not represent net income, net income attributable to The RMR Group Inc., net income attributable to The RMR\nGroup Inc. per diluted share or cash generated by operating activities determined in accordance with GAAP, and should not be considered alternatives to\nnet income, net income attributable to The RMR Group Inc., net income attributable to The RMR Group Inc. per diluted share or net income margin\ndetermined in accordance with GAAP, as indicators of RMR’s financial performance or as measures of its liquidity. Other asset management businesses may\ncalculate these non-GAAP measures differently than RMR does.\n• Adjusted Net Income Attributable to The RMR Group Inc. RMR calculates Adjusted Net Income Attributable to The RMR Group Inc. and Adjusted Net\nIncome Attributable to The RMR Group Inc. per diluted share as net income attributable to The RMR Group Inc. and net income attributable to The RMR\nGroup Inc. per diluted share, respectively, excluding the effects of certain individually significant items occurring or impacting its financial results during\nthe quarter that are not expected to be regularly occurring, relate to a special project or initiatives or relate to gains or losses. RMR provides Adjusted Net\nIncome Attributable to The RMR Group Inc. and Adjusted Net Income Attributable to The RMR Group Inc. per diluted share for supplemental\ninformational purposes in order to enhance the understanding of RMR’s condensed consolidated statements of income and to facilitate a comparison of\nRMR’s current operating performance with its historical operating performance.\n• Distributable Earnings is calculated as Adjusted EBITDA less tax distributions to members and is considered to be an appropriate measure of RMR’s\noperating performance, along with net income attributable to The RMR Group Inc. RMR believes that Distributable Earnings provides useful information\nto investors because by excluding amounts payable for tax obligations, it increases comparability between periods and more accurately reflects earnings\nthat may be available for distribution to shareholders. Distributable Earnings is among the factors RMR’s Board of Directors considers when determining\nshareholder dividends.\n• Distributable Earnings per Share calculations are based on end of period shares outstanding and includes 15,000,000 Redeemable Class A Units of\nThe RMR Group LLC which are paired with RMR Inc's. Class B-2 common shares outstanding; actual dividends are paid to shareholders as of the\napplicable record date.\n• Distribution Payout Ratio is calculated as distributions to shareholders from The RMR Group LLC divided by Distributable Earnings attributable to The\nRMR Group LLC.\n• EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin are supplemental measures used to assess operating performance, along with net income, net\nincome attributable to The RMR Group Inc. and net income margin. RMR believes that EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin provide\nuseful information to investors because by excluding the effects of certain amounts, such as non-cash items or non-recurring gains and losses, EBITDA,\nAdjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin may facilitate a comparison of current operating performance with RMR’s historical operating\nperformance and with the performance of other asset management businesses. RMR also believes that providing Adjusted EBITDA Margin may help\ninvestors assess RMR’s performance of its business by providing the margin that Adjusted EBITDA represents to its contractual management and advisory\nfees (excluding incentive fees, if any).\n23\nNotes\n& Definitions\n24\nNOTES\nNotes to page 10 – MANAGEMENT AND ADVISORY SERVICES REVENUES BY SOURCE\nThe following tables present revenues by client and exclude incentive fees earned from SEVN of $484, $370 and $468 during the three months\nended September 30, 2024, June 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023.\n($ in thousands) 4Q'24 3Q'24 4Q'23\nBASE BUSINESS MANAGEMENT & ADVISORY REVENUES\nDHC $ 4,436 $ 4,101 $ 3,842\nILPT 5,983 5,854 5,991\nOPI 2,800 3,057 3,411\nSVC 7,563 7,592 8,465\nSEVN 1,128 1,127 1,149\nTotal Perpetual Capital 21,910 21,731 22,858\nAlerisLife 1,357 1,442 1,400\nSonesta 2,515 2,624 2,517\nRMR Residential 154 153 —\nOther private entities 3,028 3,007 3,103\nTotal Private Capital 7,054 7,226 7,020\nTotal Base Business Management & Advisory Revenues $ 28,964 $ 28,957 $ 29,878\nBASE PROPERTY MANAGEMENT & OTHER REVENUES\nDHC $ 1,373 $ 1,413 $ 1,435\nILPT 3,199 3,104 3,295\nOPI 3,090 3,172 3,396\nSVC 1,513 1,504 923\nSEVN 15 14 8\nTotal Perpetual Capital 9,190 9,207 9,057\nRMR Residential 4,501 4,985 —\nOther private entities 2,159 2,180 2,103\nTotal Private Capital 6,660 7,165 2,103\nTotal Base Property Management & Other Revenues $ 15,850 $ 16,372 $ 11,160\n25\nNOTES (CONTINUED)\nNotes to page 10 – MANAGEMENT AND ADVISORY SERVICES REVENUES BY SOURCE (CONTINUED)\n($ in thousands) 4Q'24 3Q'24 4Q'23\nCONSTRUCTION SUPERVISION REVENUES\nDHC $ 450 $ 333 $ 805\nILPT 119 115 171\nOPI 519 1,078 1,908\nSVC 1,540 1,334 1,109\nTotal Perpetual Capital 2,628 2,860 3,993\nRMR Residential 417 550 —\nOther private entities 147 157 330\nTotal Private Capital 564 707 330\nTotal Construction Supervision Fees $ 3,192 $ 3,567 $ 4,323\nTOTAL MANAGEMENT & ADVISORY SERVICES REVENUES\nDHC $ 6,259 $ 5,847 $ 6,082\nILPT 9,301 9,073 9,457\nOPI 6,409 7,307 8,715\nSVC 10,616 10,430 10,497\nSEVN 1,143 1,141 1,157\nTotal Perpetual Capital 33,728 33,798 35,908\nAlerisLife 1,357 1,442 1,400\nSonesta 2,515 2,624 2,517\nRMR Residential 5,072 5,688 —\nOther private entities 5,334 5,344 5,536\nTotal Private Capital 14,278 15,098 9,453\nTotal Management & Advisory Services Revenues $ 48,006 $ 48,896 $ 45,361\n26\nNOTES (CONTINUED)\nNotes to page 12 and 13 – GAAP RESULTS: CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME\n(1) Management services revenues include base business management fees earned from the Managed Equity REITs that are calculated monthly based upon\nthe lower of (i) the average historical cost of each REIT’s properties, and (ii) each REIT’s average market capitalization.

As such, earnings attributable to unvested participating shares are excluded\nfrom earnings before calculating per share amounts. In addition, if dilutive, diluted EPS includes the assumed issuance of Class A common shares\npursuant to RMR’s equity compensation plan using the treasury stock method and the issuance of Class A common shares related to the assumed\nredemption of the noncontrolling interest in The RMR Group LLC’s 15,000,000 Class A Units using the if-converted method. In computing the\ndilutive effect that the assumed redemption would have on EPS, net income available to holders of Class A common shares would increase due to\nthe elimination of the noncontrolling interest, offset by any tax effect. The assumed redemption of the 15,000,000 Class A Units was anti-dilutive to\nearnings per share for the three months ended September 30, 2024, June 30, 2024 and June 30, 2023.\nNotes to page 20 – RECONCILIATION OF EBITDA AND ADJUSTED EBITDA FROM NET INCOME\n(1) Interest expense excludes amounts related to private capital initiatives.\nNotes to page 21 – CALCULATION OF NET INCOME MARGIN, ADJUSTED EBITDA MARGIN, DISTRIBUTABLE EARNINGS AND DISTRIBUTABLE\nEARNINGS PER SHARE\n(1) Contractual management and advisory fees are the base business management fees, property management fees and advisory fees RMR or its\nsubsidiaries earns pursuant to its management agreements.
