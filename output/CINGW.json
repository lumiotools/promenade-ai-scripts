(NASDAQ: CING), a biopharmaceutical company utilizing its proprietary Precision Timed Release™ (PTR™) drug delivery platform technology to build and advance a pipeline of next-generation pharmaceutical products, today announced its financial results for the three months ended September 30, 2024, and provided a clinical and business update.\n\n“The capital raised this quarter has allowed us to focus on advancing the remaining activities required for NDA submission of our lead ADHD asset, CTx-1301, targeted for mid 2025,” said Cingulate Chairman and CEO Shane J. Schaffer. “The granting of European patents for CTx-1301 in up to 30 territories, including the United Kingdom, helps Cingulate expand its reach beyond the United States and makes a positive impact on the growing ADHD markets abroad. Overall, Cingulate finds itself in a stronger position financially and looks forward to filing its first NDA next year.”\n\n**Cingulate Initiates Final Study for Lead ADHD Asset CTx-1301**\n\nIn September, Cingulate commenced its final FDA-required study, which is a food effect study, for CTx-1301. A data readout from the study is expected by the end of 2024.\n\n**European Patent Granted for Lead Asset CTx-1301 for the Treatment of ADHD**\n\nCingulate was issued a European patent for its lead asset CTx-1301 for the treatment of ADHD during the third quarter of 2024. This patent will include up to 30 European territories, including the United Kingdom. In addition to the European patent, Cingulate has patents in Australia, Canada and Israel, as well as pending patents in Hong Kong, the Republic of Korea, and the United States.\n\n**Nasdaq Listing Update**\n\nOn September 9, 2024, the Nasdaq Hearings Panel notified Cingulate that it had regained compliance with the $1.00 minimum bid price requirement set forth in Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(a)(2).\n\n**Over $12 Million of Capital Raised in the Third Quarter**\n\nCingulate raised approximately $12.5 million of capital in the third quarter of 2024. The capital raised provides the Company the cash runway to fund the clinical, manufacturing, and regulatory activities, as well as operating activities, into the third quarter of 2025, based on planned expenditures. Cingulate is targeting mid-2025 for the NDA submission of CTx-1301 (dexmethylphenidate) for the treatment of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD).\n\n**Third Quarter Results**\n\n**Cash Position:** As of September 30, 2024, Cingulate had approximately $10 million in cash and cash equivalents, a significant increase from December 31, 2023, providing the Company with an extended cash runway into the third quarter of 2025, as noted above.\n\n**Working Capital:** As of September 30, 2024, Cingulate had approximately $9.8 million in working capital, an increase of $19.5 million from December 31, 2023. This increase in working capital is reflective of a significant strengthening of the Company’s balance sheet resulting from capital raised in 2024.\n\n**Liabilities:** As of September 30, 2024, total liabilities were $1.5 million, a decrease from December 31, 2023 of $8.8 million, including the conversion of the related party note payable in the amount of $3.3 million which occurred in the first quarter of 2024.\n\n**Stockholders’ Equity** : As of September 30, 2024, total stockholders’ equity was $12.0 million, an increase of $18.9 million from the end of 2023.\n\n**R &D Expenses:** R&D expenses were $1.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, a decrease of $2.5 million from the three months ended September 30, 2023. This change was primarily the result of decreased clinical activity in the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same period in 2023. During the third quarter of 2023, we incurred significant costs relating to two Phase 3 studies for CTx-1301, the fixed dose pediatric and adolescent safety and efficacy study and the pediatric dose optimization and duration study. Enrollment in these two studies was completed in early 2024 and we are progressing with the remaining close-out and analytical activities required for an NDA submission. Manufacturing costs also decreased as the activity in 2023 was more significant for the manufacture of clinical supply for the Phase 3 studies. In 2024, manufacturing activity included the completion of registration batches of CTx-1301.\n\n**G &A Expenses:** Total G&A expenses were $1.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, which was relatively consistent to the three months ended September 30, 2023.\n\n**Net Loss:** Net loss was $3.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to $6.0 million for the same period in 2023. The decrease in the net loss primarily related to a decrease in R&D and G&A expenses described above.\n\n**Cingulate Inc.**  \n---  \n**Consolidated Balance Sheet Data**  \n**September 30,**| **December 31,**  \n**2024**| **2023**  \nCash and cash equivalents| $| 10,040,149| $| 52,416  \nTotal assets| $| 13,580,104| $| 3,491,436  \nWorking Capital| $| 9,801,070| $| (9,647,172| )  \nTotal liabilities| $| 1,542,541| $| 10,360,865  \nAccumulated deficit| $| (102,357,201| )| $| (92,943,443| )  \nTotal stockholders' equity| $| 12,037,563| $| (6,869,429| )  \n  \n**Cingulate Inc.**  \n---  \n**Consolidated Statements of Operations**  \n**Three Months Ended September 30,**| **Six Months Ended September 30,**  \n**2024**| **2023**| **2024**| **2023**  \nOperating expenses:  \nResearch and development| $| 1,428,504| $| 3,923,852| $| 5,116,582| $| 10,508,395  \nGeneral and administrative| 1,853,583| 1,825,822| 4,319,902| 5,453,643  \n**Operating loss**| **(3,282,087**| **)**| **(5,749,674**| **)**| **(9,436,484**| **)**| **(15,962,038**| **)**  \nInterest and other income (expense), net| 50,483| (229,380| )| 22,726| (638,212| )  \nLoss before income taxes| (3,231,604| )| (5,979,054| )| (9,413,758| )| (16,600,250| )  \nIncome tax benefit (expense)| -| -| -| -  \n**Net loss**| **(3,231,604**| **)**| **(5,979,054**| **)**| **(9,413,758**| **)**| **(16,600,250**| **)**  \n  \n**About Cingulate ®** Cingulate Inc. is a biopharmaceutical company utilizing its proprietary Precision Timed Release™ (PTR™) drug delivery platform technology to build and advance a pipeline of next-generation pharmaceutical products, designed to improve the lives of patients suffering from frequently diagnosed conditions characterized by burdensome daily dosing regimens and suboptimal treatment outcomes.

A data readout from the study is expected by the end of 2024.\n\nAdditionally, Cingulate has raised over $10 million in additional capital since the middle of August 2024, 58% of this amount from its at the market facility, and has received notification from Nasdaq that Cingulate is now in compliance with Nasdaq listing requirements.\n\n“We are pleased to have raised additional substantial capital, which allows us to focus on advancing the final activities required for NDA submission of our lead asset, CTx-1301, which is targeted for mid 2025. Initiating the final study for CTx-1301 is a key milestone moving us one step closer to NDA submission,” said Cingulate Chairman and CEO Shane J. Schaffer.\n\n**About the Fast Fed Study** The study is an assessment of the effect of food on the absorption of the highest dose of CTx-1301. An open-label, randomized, single-dose, two-period, two-treatment (Fed vs. Fasted), two-sequence, crossover study In Healthy adult subjects to assess the effect of food on the bioavailability of CTx-1301 (dexmethylphenidate) of the highest dose.\n\n**About Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD)** ADHD is a chronic neurobiological and developmental disorder that affects millions of children and often continues into adulthood. The condition is marked by an ongoing pattern of inattention and/or hyperactivity-impulsivity that interferes with functioning or development. In the U.S., approximately 6.4 million children and adolescents (11 percent) aged under the age of 18 have been diagnosed with ADHD. Among this group, approximately 80 percent receive treatment, with 65-90 percent demonstrating clinical ADHD symptoms that persist into adulthood. Adult ADHD prevalence is estimated at approximately 11 million patients (4.4 percent), almost double the size of the child and adolescent segment combined. However, only an estimated 20 percent receive treatment.\n\n**About CTx-1301** Cingulate’s lead candidate, CTx-1301, utilizes Cingulate’s proprietary PTR drug delivery platform to create a breakthrough, multi-core formulation of the active pharmaceutical ingredient dexmethylphenidate, a compound approved by the FDA for the treatment of ADHD. Dexmethylphenidate is part of the stimulant class of medicines and increases norepinephrine and dopamine activity in the brain to affect attention and behavior. While stimulants are the gold standard of ADHD treatment due to their efficacy and safety, the long-standing challenge continues to be providing patients with an entire active-day duration of action. CTx-1301 is designed to precisely deliver three releases of medication at the predefined time, ratio, and style of release to optimize patient care in one tablet. The result is a rapid onset and entire active-day efficacy, with the third dose being released around the time when other extended-release stimulant products begin to wear off.\n\n**About Precision Timed Release™ (PTR™) Platform Technology** Cingulate is developing ADHD and anxiety disorder product candidates capable of achieving true once-daily dosing using Cingulate’s innovative PTR drug delivery platform technology. It incorporates a proprietary Erosion Barrier Layer (EBL) providing control of drug release at precise, pre-defined times with no release of drug prior to the intended release. The EBL technology is enrobed around a drug-containing core to give a tablet-in-tablet dose form. It is designed to erode at a controlled rate until eventually the drug is released from the core tablet. The EBL formulation, Oralogik™, is licensed from BDD Pharma. Cingulate intends to utilize its PTR technology to expand and augment its clinical-stage pipeline by identifying and developing additional product candidates in other therapeutic areas in addition to Anxiety and ADHD where one or more active pharmaceutical ingredients need to be delivered several times a day at specific, predefined time intervals and released in a manner that would offer significant improvement over existing therapies.
