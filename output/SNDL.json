(NASDAQ: SNDL) (\"**SNDL** \" or the \"**Company** \") reported its financial and operational results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2024. All financial information in this press release is reported in millions of Canadian dollars unless otherwise indicated.\n\n[ ![SNDL Inc. \\(CNW Group/SNDL Inc.\\)](https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/2548873/SNDL_Inc__SNDL_Reports_Third_Quarter_2024_Financial_and_Operatio.jpg) ](https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/2548873/SNDL_Inc__SNDL_Reports_Third_Quarter_2024_Financial_and_Operatio.html)\n\nSNDL has also posted a supplemental investor presentation on its website, found at [https://sndl.com](https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&l=en&o=4294905-1&h=741994910&u=https%3A%2F%2Fsndl.com%2Fhomepage%2Fdefault.aspx&a=https%3A%2F%2Fsndl.com).\n\nThe Company will hold a **conference call and webcast presentation at 10:00 a.m. EST (8:00 a.m. MST) on Tuesday, November 5, 2024.** The conference call details can be found below.\n\n**THIRD QUARTER 2024 FINANCIAL AND OPERATIONAL HIGHLIGHTS**\n\n  * Net revenue for the third quarter of 2024 was $236.9 million, compared to $237.6 million in the third quarter of 2023, a decrease of 0.3%. This decrease was driven by market softness in the Liquor Retail segment, while both Cannabis Retail and Cannabis Operations segments posted strong growth. This represents an increase of 3.8% in net revenue quarter on quarter, as compared to net revenue of $228.1 million in the second quarter of 2024.\n  * Achieved a gross profit of $63.0 million, representing a record gross margin of 26.6% of sales in the third quarter of 2024, up from 20.5% in the third quarter of 2023. The 30% improvement in gross profit year-over-year, or 8.3% improvement quarter-on-quarter, highlights the continuous success of the Company's margin improvement initiatives, including data licensing programs, mix optimization and supply chain productivity initiatives.\n  * Operating loss was $18.5 million for the third quarter of 2024, driven by a negative valuation adjustment of equity-accounted investees (SunStream portfolio) of $13.4 million and restructuring charges of $1.9 million. This compares to a loss of $16.4 million in the third quarter of 2023, which included a favorable equity-accounted investees valuation adjustment of $6.6 million. Excluding the volatility of these non-cash valuation adjustments, we continue to see material improvements in profitability.\n  * Cash flow was positive by $80.0 million in the third quarter of 2024, compared to $16.5 million in the third quarter of 2023, as a result of profitability improvements and the repayment of loan investments. Year-to-date cash flow is positive by $67.9 million.\n  * Free cash flow in the third quarter of 2024 was positive $9.2 million, compared to $16.3 million in the third quarter of 2023. This result brings year-to-date free cash flow to negative $2.8 million, compared to negative $62.3 million in the first nine months of 2023. SNDL is on pace to deliver positive free cash flow for the 2024 calendar year, in line or ahead of guidance.\n  * Third quarter results reflect dynamic 8% net revenue growth from our combined Cannabis businesses, while reaching a new record high gross margin, despite continued softness in Liquor sales. In addition to continued operational improvements, the following examples highlight strategic initiatives driving SNDL towards sustained profitable growth:\n    * Completed the acquisition of the principal indebtedness of Delta 9 for a purchase price of $28.1 million in early July, becoming its senior secured creditor with a first-priority security interest in all assets of Delta 9 and certain of its subsidiaries.\n    * By mid-July we announced a restructuring program aimed at reducing corporate overheads, improving organizational efficiency, and delivering ongoing annualized savings of over $20 million. The program is on track with more than $2 million savings delivered in the third quarter ($10.3 million annualized).\n    * SNDL collected US$73 million in early August from SunStream, following the loan repayment to SunStream representing a majority of Ascend's outstanding balance and the full outstanding balance of Jushi.\n    * SNDL's stalking horse bid was chosen as the successful bid in the acquisition of the Indiva Group's business and assets, as announced on August 29. This acquisition has closed and positions SNDL as the market leader in the Canadian edibles category.\n    * On October 21, SNDL announced the closing of the plan of arrangement pursuant to which SNDL has privatized Nova Cannabis Inc. through the acquisition of the remaining minority equity interest.\n  * The Company had $763.8 million of unrestricted cash, marketable securities and investments and no outstanding debt, with $263.0 million of unrestricted cash as of September 30, 2024. Subsequent to the end of the quarter, $37.3 million was used to pay the cash consideration portion of the acquisition of Nova's minority equity interest. SNDL has not raised cash through share offerings since June 2021.\n\n\n\n\"We are pleased with the substantial progress reflected in our results for the third quarter of 2024 as we advance towards sustainable profitability. Our team delivered a record gross margin, positive cash flow and free cash flow, and closed the quarter with over a quarter billion dollars in unrestricted cash and zero debt. We are materially improving our operational performance while executing multiple strategic initiatives that we believe will solidify our foundation and drive sustained, profitable growth,\" said Zach George, Chief Executive Officer of SNDL. \"Our strong balance sheet serves as a beacon for future opportunities, allowing us to thoughtfully deploy capital into organic and inorganic investments with attractive, risk-adjusted returns. I am more confident than ever that our team – setting new records with each quarter – has the expertise and drive to unlock SNDL's significant potential.\"\n\n**THIRD QUARTER 2024****KEY FINANCIAL METRICS**\n\n**OPERATING SEGMENTS**  \n---  \n**($000s)** | **Liquor** **Retail** | **Cannabis** **Retail** | **Cannabis** **Operations** | **Investments** | **Corporate** | **Total**  \nThree months ended September 30, 2024  \nNet revenue | 144,565 | 81,144 | 25,007 | — | (13,824) | 236,892  \nGross profit | 36,951 | 20,710 | 5,307 | — | — | 62,968  \nOperating income (loss) | 11,795 | 4,395 | (703) | (7,824) | (26,174) | (18,511)  \nAdjusted operating income (loss) (1) | 11,795 | 4,395 | (578) | (7,824) | (24,381) | (16,593)  \nThree months ended September 30, 2023  \nNet revenue | 151,801 | 75,539 | 20,954 | — | (10,699) | 237,595  \nGross profit | 37,263 | 20,046 | (8,704) | — | — | 48,605  \nOperating income (loss) | 8,278 | 3,432 | (13,957) | 9,886 | (24,023) | (16,384)  \nAdjusted operating income (loss) (1) | 8,278 | 3,432 | (14,153) | 9,886 | (22,992) | (15,549)  \n  \n(1) | Adjusted operating income (loss) is a specified financial measure that does not have a standardized meaning prescribed by IFRS and therefore may not be comparable to similar measures reported by other companies.

The 4.8% reduction year-over-year was driven by overall market slow-down in customer traffic.\n  * Same-store sales decreased by 5.0% for stores operating in the third quarters of 2023 and 2024. Same-store sales refer to the revenue generated by the Company's existing retail liquor locations, which operated during the current and comparative periods.\n  * Gross profit for Liquor Retail was $37.0 million, or 25.6% of sales, in the third quarter of 2024, compared to $37.3 million, or 24.5% of sales, in the third quarter of 2023. The Company achieved record gross margin for its Liquor Retail segment in August of 2024, with margins reaching 26.5%, mainly driven by productivity in procurement, mix management and pricing optimization initiatives. \n  * Operating income for Liquor Retail was $11.8 million in the third quarter of 2024, compared to $8.3 million in the third quarter of 2023, an impressive 42.5% improvement despite lower revenue.\n  * SNDL's proprietary data licensing program for Liquor Retail which launched in the first quarter of 2024, saw a 23% increase in revenue compared to the prior quarter.\n\n\n\nAs of November 4, 2024, the Ace Liquor store count was 134, the Liquor Depot store count was 19, and the Wine and Beyond store count was 13. \n\nCannabis Retail\n\nSNDL is Canada's largest private-sector cannabis retailer by number of stores, operating 187 locations under its three retail banners: \"_Value Buds_ \", \"_Spiritleaf_ \", and \"_Superette_ \". The Company's Cannabis Retail strategy is based on several pillars, including the quality of its store locations, its range of products, and the unique experiences provided to customers. Using data and insights from a large volume of monthly transactions enables SNDL to leverage technology and analytics to inform and improve its retail strategy. \n\n  * Net revenue for Cannabis Retail in the third quarter of 2024 was $81.1 million, compared to $75.5 million in the third quarter of 2023. The 7.4% increase year-over-year was driven by productivity improvements and new stores opened throughout the year.\n  * Same-store sales increased 2.3% for stores operating in the third quarters of 2023 and 2024, in line with the first half of the year. Same-store sales refer to the revenue generated by the Company's existing retail cannabis locations, which operated during the current and comparative periods.\n  * Gross profit for Cannabis Retail was $20.7 million, or 25.5% of sales, in the third quarter of 2024, compared to $20.0 million, or 26.5% of sales, in the third quarter of 2023, a 3.3% increase year-over-year. \n  * Operating income for Cannabis Retail was $4.4 million in the third quarter of 2024, compared to $3.4 million in the third quarter of 2023, an increase of 28.1% year-over-year.\n  * SNDL's proprietary data licensing program generated revenue of $4.0 million for the third quarter of 2024, in line with the same period in the year prior.\n\n\n\nAs of November 4, 2024, the Spiritleaf store count was 81 (20 corporate stores and 61 franchise stores), the Superette store count was 4 corporate stores, and the Value Buds store count was 102 corporate stores.\n\nCannabis Operations\n\nSNDL has a diverse brand portfolio from value to premium, emphasizing premium inhalable formats and a full suite of 2.0 products. With enhanced procurement capabilities and plans to continue evolving toward a cost-effective cultivation and manufacturing operation, the Cannabis Operations segment is a key enabler of SNDL's vertical integration strategy.\n\n  * Net revenue for Cannabis Operations for the third quarter of 2024 was $25.0 million, up 19.3% from $21.0 million in the third quarter of 2023, mainly as a result of increasing provincial board and Business-to-Business distribution and a continued focus on consumer innovation, quality and operational efficiencies.\n  * We are encouraged by the strong demand for our products, as evidenced by the opening of 71 new distribution points during the third quarter and the increase in international orders for the fourth quarter.\n  * Gross profit for the segment in the third quarter of 2024 of $5.3 million, an increase of $14.0 million from negative $8.7 million in the third quarter of 2023. The record gross margin of 21.2% for the segment is supported by a strong productivity program.\n  * Operating income for the third quarter of 2024 improved by $13.3 million over the same period in the prior year, going from negative $14.0 million to negative $0.7 million. The substantial increase in operating income results from margin expansion, reduced overhead spending, and operational efficiencies.\n\n\n\nInvestments\n\n  * As of September 30, 2024, the Company has deployed capital to a portfolio of cannabis-related investments with a carrying value of $500.4 million, including $451.1 million to SunStream Bancorp Inc. (\"**SunStream** \"). This carrying value was reduced by $100.1 million during the third quarter of 2024, mainly driven by the cash collections on outstanding loan balances to SunStream from Ascend Wellness Holdings, Inc. (\"**Ascend** \") and Jushi Holdings Inc. (\"**Jushi** \").\n  * In July 2024, Ascend repaid approximately 80% of their outstanding loan balance with SunStream, amounting to US$12 million. On July 31, 2024, Jushi repaid their full outstanding balance of US$53 million with SunStream. Both repayments occurred several months ahead of the maturity date, increasing SNDL's cash liquidity and enabling the deployment of additional capital to support our growth agenda.\n  * In the third quarter of 2024, the investment portfolio generated negative operating income of $7.8 million, including a $13.4 million negative valuation adjustment of equity-accounted investees (SunStream portfolio). This compares to a positive operating income of $9.9 million in the third quarter of 2023, which included a favorable $6.6 million valuation adjustment of equity-accounted investees.\n  * SunStream is a joint venture sponsored by SNDL. During 2023, SunStream directed the formation of the SunStream USA group of companies (\"**SunStream USA Group** \") in connection with the restructuring of certain loans provided by SunStream. SunStream USA Group is anticipated to be a U.S. platform with one or more independent third-party investors, which will be independently managed and governed.\n  * During the third quarter of 2024, the credit portfolio controlled by SunStream comprised five investments: Jushi, SKYMINT Brands (\"**Skymint** \"), Ascend, Surterra Holdings, Inc. d/b/a Parallel (\"**Parallel** \"), and Columbia Care Inc.\n  * The previously announced transactions to acquire certain operations and assets of Parallel and Skymint continue to be subject to certain conditions and regulatory approvals. \n  * SNDL continues to monitor local and international regulatory changes, including the potential reclassification of marijuana from a Schedule I drug to Schedule III drug under the U.S. Controlled Substances Act, or the outcome of amendment 3 vote to legalize recreational marijuana for adults aged 21 and older in Florida. These decisions do not directly affect SNDL's operations, which are located solely in Canada, though they would have a favorable effect on the SunStream joint venture investments in the United States.\n\n\n\n**Equity Position**\n\n  * $763.8 million of unrestricted cash, marketable securities and investments, including investments in equity-accounted investees, and no outstanding debt at September 30, 2024, resulting in a net book value of $1.2 billion.\n  * Subsequent to the three months ended September 30, 2024, SNDL issued 159,792 shares as the share consideration for the acquisition of Nova's minority equity interest, in addition to the $37.7 million in cash consideration mentioned above.\n  * On November 13, 2023, the Company announced that its board of directors had approved a renewal of the share repurchase program upon its expiry on November 20, 2023. The Company's share repurchase program continues to be available to lower the outstanding share float. SNDL will continue to assess opportunities to utilize the program to the extent that management believes it is in the best interest of SNDL's shareholders. Subsequent to the quarter end, in October 2024 the Company repurchased 59,417 common shares for cancellation under the share repurchase program at a price of US$1.90 per share.\n\n\n\nThis press release is intended to be read in conjunction with the Company's condensed consolidated interim financial statements and the notes thereto for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, and the accompanying Management's Discussion and Analysis.

release are non-IFRS measures. These terms are not defined by IFRS and, therefore, may not be comparable to similar measures reported by other companies. These non-IFRS financial measures should not be considered in isolation or as an alternative for or superior to measures of performance prepared in accordance with IFRS. These measures are presented and described in order to provide shareholders and potential investors with additional measures in understanding the Company's operating results in the same manner as the management team. \n\n**ADJUSTED OPERATING INCOME (LOSS)** Adjusted operating income (loss) is a non-IFRS financial measure which the Company uses to evaluate its operating performance. Adjusted operating income (loss) provides information to investors, analysts, and others to aid in understanding and evaluating the Company's operating results in a similar manner to its management team. The Company defines adjusted operating income (loss) as operating income (loss) less restructuring costs (recovery), goodwill and intangible asset impairments and asset impairments triggered by restructuring activities.\n\nThe following tables reconcile adjusted to un-adjusted operating income (loss) for the periods noted.\n\n**($000s)** | **Liquor** **Retail** | **Cannabis** **Retail** | **Cannabis** **Operations** | **Investments** | **Corporate** | **Total**  \n---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \n**Three months ended September 30, 2024**  \nOperating income (loss) | 11,795 | 4,395 | (703) | (7,824) | (26,174) | (18,511)  \nAdjustments:  \nRestructuring costs | — | — | 125 | — | 1,793 | 1,918  \nAdjusted operating income (loss) | **11,795** | **4,395** | **(578)** | **(7,824)** | **(24,381)** | **(16,593)**  \n  \n**($000s)** | **Liquor** **Retail** | **Cannabis** **Retail** | **Cannabis** **Operations** | **Investments** | **Corporate** | **Total**  \n---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \n**Three months ended September 30, 2023**  \nOperating income (loss) | 8,278 | 3,432 | (13,957) | 9,886 | (24,023) | (16,384)  \nAdjustments:  \nRestructuring costs (recovery) | — | — | (323) | — | 1,031 | 708  \nIntangible asset impairments | — | — | 127 | — | — | 127  \nAdjusted operating income (loss) | **8,278** | **3,432** | **(14,153)** | **9,886** | **(22,992)** | **(15,549)**  \n  \n**FREE CASH FLOW** Free cash flow is a non-IFRS financial measure which the Company uses to evaluate its financial performance. Free cash flow provides information which management believes to be useful to investors, analysts and others in understanding and evaluating the Company's ability to generate positive cash flows as it removes cash used for non-operational items. The Company defines free cash flow as the total change in cash and cash equivalents less cash used for common share repurchases, dividends (if any), changes to debt instruments, changes to long-term investments, net cash used for acquisitions plus cash provided by dispositions (if any).\n\nThe following table reconciles free cash flow to change in cash and cash equivalents for the periods noted.\n\n**Three months ended September 30** | **Nine months endedSeptember 30**  \n---|---  \n**($000s)** | **2024** | 2023 | **2024** | 2023  \nChange in cash and cash equivalents (Cash Flow) | **80,042** | 16,528 | **67,935** | (77,603)  \nAdjustments  \nRepurchase of common shares | **—** | — | **—** | 1,536  \nChanges to long-term investments | **(70,806)** | (195) | **(72,342)** | 17,496  \nAcquisitions, net of cash acquired | **—** | — | **1,654** | (3,695)  \nFree cash flow | **9,236** | 16,333 | **(2,753)** | (62,266)  \n  \nSOURCE SNDL Inc.\n\n[View All News](https://sndl.com/news/default.aspx)\n\n### Quick Links\n\n  * [News](https://sndl.com/news/default.aspx)\n  * [Our Brands](https://sndl.com/Our-Brands/Liquor-Retail-Banners/default.aspx)\n  * [Investor FAQs](https://sndl.com/financials/investor-faqs/default.aspx)\n\n\n\n### IR Contact\n\ninvestors@sndl.com [1-844-879-8337](tel:1-844-879-8337)\n\n### Investor Email Alerts\n\nTo opt-in for investor email alerts, please enter your email address in the field below and select at least one alert option.

Please go ahead.\nZach George^ Welcome to SNDL's Q3 2024 Financial and Operational Results\nConference Call.\nWe are pleased to report robust revenue growth in our Cannabis segments, a record-\nbreaking gross margins and positive free cash flow for the third quarter of 2024.\nOur Cannabis segments continued to show strong momentum, achieving steady revenue\ngains for the 11th consecutive quarter. Despite weaker demand in our Liquor segment, we\ndelivered higher year-over-year margins and substantial growth in operating income for\nthe segment.\nWe achieved an all-time high gross margin of 26.6%, propelled by further margin\nexpansion in Liquor retail and significant improvement within our Cannabis operations.\nFree cash flow was positive this quarter, supported by ongoing operational gains in gross\nmargin and efficient working capital management.\nWe remain on track to deliver positive free cash flow for the 2024 calendar year, meeting\nor even exceeding our guidance. This quarter and in recent days, we launched several\nstrategic initiatives that we expect to drive SNDL towards long-term sustainable\nprofitability.\nThese include a restructuring program aimed at reducing corporate overheads, enhancing\norganizational efficiency and realizing annualized savings of more than $20 million.\nAdditionally, we moved to privatize Nova through the acquisition of the remaining\noutstanding minority equity interest and just yesterday closed the acquisition of Indiva,\nenabling us to emerge as the leader in the Canadian infused edibles category.\nTogether, these actions are strengthening our foundation and expanding our potential for\nfuture growth.\nOur leadership team is working on a number of additional initiatives and investment\nopportunities that we are excited to share as they come to fruition in future periods.\nOur solid balance sheet serves as a beacon for future opportunities, enabling us to\nallocate capital thoughtfully across both organic and inorganic investments.\nIn the third quarter, we increased our cash balances from $183 million on June 30 to $263\nmillion on September 30, 2024, and continue to have 0 outstanding debt.\nWe have not raised cash through the issuance of shares since 2021, and our share\nrepurchase program became active subsequent to the end of the quarter.\nI will now turn the call over to Alberto.\nAlberto Paredero^ Thank you, Zach.\nI want to remind you all that amounts discussed today are denominated in Canadian\ndollars, unless otherwise stated. Certain amounts referred to on this call are non-GAAP\nand non-IFRS measures.\nFor definitions of these measures, please refer to SNDL's management discussion and\nanalysis document.\nLooking at our Q3 2024 financial highlights, we continue to see significant\nimprovements in gross profit, gross margin and free cash flow. Net revenue in the third\nquarter of 2024 reached $236.9 million, a marginal decline compared to the prior year.\nThis decline was driven by our Liquor retail segment, while our combined Cannabis\nsegment posted a healthy 8% growth. Gross profit of $63 million represents a $14.4\nmillion increase or 30% growth year-over-year with a substantial 610 basis points\nimprovement in gross margin. This translates into another quarter of record gross margin,\nreaching 26.6%.\nDespite the significant improvements in margin and continued optimization of operating\nexpenses, adjusted operating income was negative $16.6 million, a slight decrease\ncompared to the prior year. This was mainly driven by an unfavorable $13.4 million fair\nvalue adjustment from our equity accounted investees in the quarter compared to a $6.6\nmillion revaluation in the same quarter of the prior year.\nIt is important to note that we only adjust operating income for restructuring charges and\nintangible impairments, which in the third quarter were limited to a $1.9 million\nrestructuring charge.\nIf we were to exclude the volatility created by quarterly fair value adjustment to our\nequity accounted investees, the improvement in adjusted operating income compared to\nthe same third quarter of the prior year would have been $19 million.\nFree cash flow was positive in the quarter at $9.2 million, bringing the year-to-date free\ncash flow to a negative $2.8 million.\nWe're on pace to deliver positive free cash flow for the 2024 calendar year, in line with or\nahead of guidance.\nFree cash flow in the quarter was lower than in the same period of prior year, driven by\ndifferent management of phasing of retail inventory buildup throughout the year, as we\nwill discuss in a few minutes.\nWhen examining the historical quarterly financial performance evolution, we clearly\nobserve a few patterns. Net revenue in 2024 is relatively flat compared to 2023 as the\nstrong growth in our Cannabis segment is being offset by market softness in the larger\nLiquor segment.\nWe also see a clear trend of profitability improvement, both in gross profit and adjusted\noperating income.\nThe same applies to free cash flow, where there is a noticeable upward trend compared to\nprevious years.\nAdditionally, we observed a more muted seasonality effect, thanks to our disciplined\napproach to working capital management.\nAs we look at the contributions from each segment, we can see how the net revenue\ndecline in Liquor is impacting the overall consolidated results despite the strong\nperformance from Cannabis. When we add the $5.6 million net revenue growth from\nCannabis retail, the $4.1 million from Cannabis operations and the negative $3.1 million\nin the Corporate segment related to the revenue elimination from Cannabis operations\nsales into our own retail, we arrived at a total of $6.5 million or 8% growth in Cannabis.\nIn terms of gross profit, Liquor Retail shows a small decline of $0.3 million despite the\nlarger revenue shortfall.\nCannabis Retail contributes to an improvement of $0.7 million, while Cannabis\noperations is driving most of the growth with an impressive $14 million improvement.\nThe aggregate of all the segment adds up to $14.4 million or 30% growth in gross profit.\nWhen looking at adjusted operating income, we can clearly see the significant step-up in\nprofitability driven by our operating segments, offset by the volatility of the fair value\nadjustment in our Investment segment.\nOur Corporate segment shows a small unfavorable variance of $1.4 million, driven by\ninflation and the different phasing of onetime expenses, partly offset by restructuring\nproductivity savings.\nFree cash flow is positive at $9.2 million in the third quarter of 2024, although it is a\nreduction compared to the same quarter in the previous year, this reduction is driven by a\ndifferent phasing of inventory buildup between the quarters.\nWe can see this more clearly on the next page.\nAs we examine the drivers of free cash flow in the third quarter of 2024, we first noticed\nthe negative $19.3 million in net income, primarily driven by the fair value adjustment in\nour Investment segment.\nSince this is a noncash item in our P&L, it is offset by noncash add-backs, which are\nhigher in the third quarter compared to the previous two quarters for this reason. A benefit\nwe saw in the third quarter was a collection of $10.7 million of accrued interest related to\nthe repayment of the majority of Ascend and Jushi loans from SunStream. This interest\nwas previously recorded in our P&L as part of the net asset value of the Investment\nsegment.\nAs the interest was collected, we see a positive impact on free cash flow. The repayment\nof the principal balance was associated with these two loans, while reported as an\nincrease in cash is excluded from free cash flow calculation.\nThe net change in inventory and other working capital is slightly positive at $0.9 million\nin the third quarter of 2024, with relatively small fluctuations between quarters.\nAs we can see in the bar chart on the right of Page 7, in 2024, we have significantly less\nvolatility in terms of inventory seasonality buildup.\nIn previous years, we had a large increase in the first quarter, a moderate increase in the\nsecond and reductions in the second half of the year.\nIn 2024, the buildup in the first half was much smaller. And as a result, the reduction in\nthe second half will also be smaller.\nLet's now look at each of the three operating segments, starting with Liquor Retail. Net\nrevenue in the third quarter of 2024 for this segment was $144.6 million, a decline of\n$7.2 million or 4.8% compared to the prior year.\nWhile the decline is smaller than what we saw in the second quarter and revenue is\ngrowing quarter-over-quarter by $4 million, what is still impacted by the softness seen\nacross North America.\nWe continue to believe this is not a concern in terms of long-term growth potential for\nthis segment.\nDespite these macro headwinds, we continue to expand gross margin, reaching 25.6% in\nthe third quarter, an improvement of 100 basis points compared to last year.\nAs a result of this margin expansion and efficiencies in the management of operating\nexpenses, this segment's operating income delivered significant growth of $3.5 million or\n42.5% compared to the same quarter of 2023.\nMoving into Cannabis Retail.\nWe saw net revenue in Q3 2024 of $81.1 million, a 7.4% increase compared to Q3 of\n2023. This growth was mainly driven by same-store sales growth of 2.3%, new store\nopenings and incremental revenue from our Dutch Love stores acquired earlier in the\nyear. The gross margin of 25.5% represented a reduction of 100 basis points compared to\nthe same period of last year due to several strategic pricing decisions aimed at increasing\nthe store traffic.\nAdjusted operating income increased by $1 million or 28.1% compared to the prior year,\ndriven by the gross profit improvement.\nFinally, our Cannabis Operations segment is once again showing the largest\nimprovement, both in terms of growth and profitability.\nIn the third quarter of 2024, this segment delivered net revenue growth of 19% year-over-\nyear, reaching $25 million. All of this growth is organic and driven by increased\nprovincial board and B2B distribution.\nBy accelerating gross margin improvements through several productivity initiatives, the\nsegment reached a new record of 21.2%, translated to $5.3 million in gross profit. This is\na significant step-up compared to last year and previous quarters. Adjusted operating\nincome was negative $0.6 million, marking an improvement of close to $14 million\ncompared to the same period last year.\nIn summary, our Cannabis business is experiencing strong growth, and we're driving\nsignificant improvements in profitability and cash flow generation.\nWe're on pace to deliver our guidance of positive free cash flow for the full year, marking\nan important step in contributing to raise the bar and realize our full potential.\nI would now like to pass the call back to Zach to share a few more operational highlights\nfor the quarter.\nZach George^ Thank you, Alberto. Beyond our financial performance, I would also like\nto highlight our core priorities: growth, profitability and people as each are fundamental\nto our long-term success.\nStarting with growth, our Cannabis segments have led with a combined net revenue\nincrease of 7.4% year-over-year in Q3 and an impressive 90 basis point share gain in\nCanadian retail. Key drivers include quality execution, stabilization from 2023 store\nopenings and the recent expansion into British Columbia.\nOur Cannabis Operations segment showed dynamic growth of 19%, driven by quality\nand innovation with 71 distribution points added this quarter and 491 year-to-date.\nThrough M&A, we strengthened our portfolio with two very recent acquisitions, Indiva,\nmaking us a leader in Canadian edibles and the privatization of Nova, allowing SNDL\nshareholders to fully benefit from retail segment growth.\nIn Liquor retail, despite this year's market contraction, our private label offerings are\ngrowing to meet consumer demand for quality and affordability while driving margin\naccretion.\nShifting to profitability.\nWe are pleased to see continued strong momentum, leading to the record gross margin\nand $9 million of positive free cash flow in the quarter.\nOur positive free cash flow was enabled by efficiency improvements and interest income\nand not impacted by the noncash fair value adjustment of our investment portfolio.\nProductivity improvements totaled $15 million in Q3, largely from our Cannabis\nOperations segment through procurement, manufacturing and cultivation efficiencies.\nData licensing in our Cannabis and Liquor Retail segments reached $4 million this\nquarter, a 6% increase from the second quarter.\nWe also achieved $5 million in overhead savings, more than offsetting inflation and\ngrowth investments driven by efficiency gains across all segments as well as restructuring\nactions initiated in July.\nAs you can see on the following page, summarizing the restructuring program progress,\nthis program delivered more than $2 million in savings in the quarter, equivalent to an\nannualized run rate of $10 million or about 50% of our planned target.\nFinally, we remain committed to our people as a top strategic priority.\nIn the second quarter, we launched a strategic talent review to identify key roles as well\nas development and succession plans.\nWe continued deploying several community engagement initiatives, offering all of our\nteam members the possibility to participate in sessions around mental and physical well-\nbeing and also rolled out an employee recognition program with over 40 awards being\npresented across our organization, celebrating the amazing contributions from our team\nmembers.\nLast but not least, we continue the development of a total reward structure that aligns our\ncompensation philosophy with both individual and company performance. My conviction\nand confidence in our team that is setting new records with each quarter are at all-time\nhighs.\nOur dedicated leaders have the expertise and drive to unlock SNDL's significant\npotential.\nI'd like to thank our entire team for their contributions and our shareholders for their\ncontinued trust.\nI will now pass the call back to the operator for analyst Q&A. Thank you.\nQUESTIONS AND ANSWERS\nOperator^ (Operator Instructions) The first question comes from the line of Frederico\nGomes from ATB Capital Markets.\nFrederico Gomes^ First question on the Nova acquisition.\nCould you talk about, I mean why you decided to acquire that remaining stake? And\nstrategically, I guess, just what sort of advantages do you see in owning -- fully owning\nNova as opposed to a majority stake?\nZach George^ Frederico, thank you very much for the question.\nSo as you know this is a very competitive space with excess taxation and reasonably low\nmargins.\nSo the acquisition of that minority stake in Nova is going to ensure that SNDL\nshareholders can get the full benefit of the cash flow and earnings potential of that retail\nbusiness.\nFrederico Gomes^ On your Cannabis operations, quite a significant improvement in\nmargins there.\nCan you talk a little bit about the key drivers behind that margin improvement? And in\nterms of your expectations going forward, do you expect to continue to see margin\nexpanding? And if so, where is that going to come from?\nAlberto Paredero^ Yes. Fred, this is Alberto.\nSo yes, actually, most of the -- or all of the improvements are driven by an end-to-end\nholistic productivity program that the management team of the segment has put in place\nalready since the end of last year.\nAs you remember, in the fourth quarter of 2023, we decided to exit or close the Olds\nfacilities that created already a bump in the gross margin and the profitability of the\nsegment in the first couple of quarters.\nSince then, we have been driving efficiencies in labor and automation in our\nmanufacturing facilities.\nWe're seeing a ramp-up in our cultivation assets as well.\nSo as we were already anticipating in the previous quarters, we were expecting to be over\n20% by the end of this year.\nSo we're happy to see that already happening in the second -- in the third quarter. And we\nhave a long list of additional initiatives including the additional capacity utilization from\nthe growth that the business has seen and more automation and efficiency improvements\nthat will continue to push that gross margin further up.\nZach George^ Yes.\nFrederico, you've been following our story for quite some time, and you're well aware\nthat in the earlier days several years ago, Olds was sitting with exposure to a power\njurisdiction that really challenged its competitiveness. And so as we've built the business,\nleaned more into procurement and broadened out our manufacturing capabilities, we have\nbeen able to eliminate exposure to high-cost biomass, which would really impair COGS.\nAnd so that was a meaningful first step that's been showing up through the numbers in\nthe last year. And our President of Cannabis, Tyler Robson, has been leading for a\nnumber of initiatives that are being very impactful in today's environment including\nmanaging mix, SKU creep, automation. And so there's a number of efficiencies that are\nstill in play. And we're very confident in the team being in a position where they actually\nunderstand the drivers here and can action against the economic outcomes that we're\nseeking.\nSo when we think about room for expansion, do we think that we can take gross margins\nto a zone where they have a three handle, the answer is absolutely.\nSo a lot more to come here.\nFrederico Gomes^ Perfect. And then just one more for me.\nIn regards to capital allocation, I know that you mentioned a bit of this, but how are you\nlooking at, I guess, different growth options and investments in Canada, the U.S. or other\ngeographies internationally? And the second part of the question also in regards to your\nbuyback, you obviously repurchased some shares recently.\nSo can you comment on those repurchases? Is it something that you intend to continue to\ndo tap that buyback? And in terms of the valuation here, you bought it at $1.90.\nSo how do you view your valuation right now at over $2.20?\nZach George^ So there's a few questions in there. Just starting with capital allocation.\nIt's going to be a very similar answer consistent with what we spoke about last quarter,\nFrederico.\nSo two real key priorities in terms of capital allocation are going to be continued growth\nin Canadian retail and also investment in -- potential investment in assets in the U.S. Both\nof those pillars are part of our core multiyear strategic plan.\nAnd when you think about the repurchase of shares, we absolutely want to take\nadvantage of repurchasing shares at levels that we think reflect a discounted valuation.\nThe transactions that you referenced were part of a nondiscretionary trading plan, which\nwe were able to execute through a blackout period. And this is something that will be\nregularly reviewed by our Board in terms of scale and levels at which to purchase.\nSo we expect to be in a position to acquire shares on an ongoing basis.\nI think there's a misconception out there that somehow a share repurchase plan is best\nused to prop up a security. And that's just something we will never do.\nIt's really for the benefit of long-term holders as we're reflecting really strongly into\npositive free cash flow and ultimately net income.\nOperator^ Our next question comes from the line of Yewon Kang from Canaccord\nGenuity.\nYewon Kang^ So my first question is regarding the recently completed Indiva\nacquisition. Through that transaction, SNDL obtained a facility in London. And my\nunderstanding is now that the company has two edibles-focused facility including the\nLYF facility in Kelowna. Just wanted to ask about if you guys have any plans to\nconsolidate these facilities in the future. And I know it's only been a few weeks since the\nacquisition closed, but could you guys give us a color on the upside you're seeing from\nintegrating C brands onto your distribution channel?\nZach George^ It's a great question. And I'll let Alberto talk a little bit about our broader\nplanning. The acquisition actually closed yesterday, so well inside of a few weeks. And\nwe're very excited about the addition of the Indiva team and product mix to our broader\nbusiness. You will see an impact in Q4 from almost two months’ worth of performance\nthere.\nAnd given the margin profile that's available in the edibles category, we see that this\nacquisition being margin accretive to our upstream manufacturing portfolio.\nSo it's something we're very excited about.\nI would answer the question on real estate more broadly. There are a number of\nopportunities we have for facility consolidation that will result in noncore real estate\nbeing available for monetization, which should further bolster cash balances and enable\nus to recycle capital into accretive opportunities.\nWe're going to be working on a longer-term prudent and thoughtful integration plan with\nIndiva, and we'll be able to provide more details on that in the coming months.\nAlberto Paredero^ Yes. Just to add the -- both our teams, the existing of SNDL and the\nteam from Indiva now joining our family, they are already collaborating and exploring\nthe different synergy opportunities that we have across revenue, supply chain and\noperating expenses.\nWe do have a long list of ideas that are being analyzed to make sure we make the right\nchoices and the right decisions.\nBut certainly we do see a lot of synergies.\nWe'll be able to share where those opportunities are as we complete the analysis in the\nnext several weeks.\nYewon Kang^ And just a second question on the retail environment for Cannabis\ndispensaries.\nSo a couple of your peers have called out some of the pressures that they're seeing in\nOntario, specifically in relation to the illicit stores popping up all around the province.\nJust wanted to ask if you have been seeing similar pressures on your retail stores as a\nresult of this illicit market that's popping up again and what your thoughts are going\nforward in terms of the provincial regulators coming in to regulate these illegal stores?\nZach George^ It's a great question. It's also a very difficult question. The impact of the\nillicit market in the Canadian -- within the Canadian landscape has been constant.\nI wouldn't say that there's some new emergence of headwinds. They've been there in\ndifferent forms in most provinces.\nWhat we do know is that there is some degree of enforcement happening, and we've seen\npockets and incidents that are encouraging in terms of our provincial government's\nwillingness to stamp out the illicit market.\nWe still need broader regulatory change to help support that. And we believe that you're\ngoing to see additional rational reform come through in 2025. Even something as small as\nchanging the limits on edibles from 10 milligrams to 100 would have a material impact\non illicit market trade. Again, no one's coming to save us here.\nSo what we do know is that convenience and value are winning with the consumer at the\nend of the day, and we're able to offer a very competitive selection that is delighting\nconsumers.\nAnd so we're going to continue to focus on being strong competitors in the legal market.\nOperator^ (Operator Instructions) This concludes the question and answer session. I\nwould like to turn the conference back over to Zach George for any closing remarks.\nZach George^ Thank you, Operator. And thank you to everyone for joining us for the call.\nWe look forward to updating you in the coming months. Have a great day.\nOperator^ This concludes today's conference call. You may disconnect your lines. Thank\nyou for participating, and have a pleasant day."

DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS\nSNDL Inc. (“SNDL” or the “Company”) was incorporated under the Business Corporations Act (Alberta) on August 19,\n2006. On July 25, 2022, the Company’s shareholders approved a special resolution amending the articles of SNDL to\nchange the name of the Company from “Sundial Growers Inc.” to “SNDL Inc.”.\nThe Company’s head office is located at 300, 919 11th Avenue SW, Calgary, Alberta, Canada.\nThe principal activities of the Company are the retailing of wines, beers and spirits, the operation and support of\ncorporate-owned and franchise retail cannabis stores in Canadian jurisdictions where the private sale of recreational\ncannabis is permitted, the manufacturing of cannabis products providing proprietary cannabis processing services,\nthe production, distribution and sale of cannabis domestically and for export pursuant to the Cannabis Act (Canada)\n(the “Cannabis Act”), and the deployment of capital to investment opportunities. The Cannabis Act regulates the\nproduction, distribution, and possession of cannabis for both medical and adult recreational access in Canada. As at\nSeptember 30, 2024, the Company also owned approximately 65% of Nova Cannabis Inc. (“Nova”), whose principal\nactivities are the retail sale of cannabis (note 25).\nSNDL and its subsidiaries operate solely in Canada. Through its joint venture, SunStream Bancorp Inc. (“SunStream”)\n(note 13), the Company provides growth capital that pursues indirect investment and financial services opportunities\nin the cannabis sector, as well as other investment opportunities. The Company also makes strategic portfolio\ninvestments in debt and equity securities.\nThe Company’s liquor retail operations are seasonal in nature. Accordingly, sales will vary by quarter based on\nconsumer spending behaviour. The Company is able to adjust certain variable costs in response to seasonal revenue\npatterns; however, costs such as occupancy are fixed, causing the Company to report a higher level of earnings in the\nthird and fourth quarters. This business seasonality results in quarterly performance that is not necessarily indicative\nof the year’s performance. The cannabis retail industry is a growing industry for which seasonality cannot be reliably\npredicted.\nThe Company’s common shares trade on the Nasdaq Capital Market under the ticker symbol “SNDL”.\n2. BASIS OF PRESENTATION\nSTATEMENT OF COMPLIANCE\nThese condensed consolidated interim financial statements (“financial statements”) have been prepared in\naccordance with International Accounting Standard 34 – Interim Financial Reporting as issued by the International\nAccounting Standards Board and interpretations of the International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee.\nThese financial statements were prepared using the same accounting policies and methods as those disclosed in the\nannual consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2023. These financial statements should\nbe read in conjunction with the annual consolidated financial statements for the Company for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2023.\nCertain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to current year presentation. Specifically, cost of\nsales, inventory impairment and obsolescence, change in fair value of biological assets and change in fair value\nrealized through inventory have been combined as cost of sales. Interest and fee revenue and investment income\n(loss) have been combined as investment income (loss). Finance costs (income), change in fair value of derivative\nwarrants, transaction costs and foreign exchange gain (loss) have been combined as other income (expenses).\nThese financial statements were approved and authorized for issue by the board of directors of the Company (the\n“Board”) on November 4, 2024.\n6\nSNDL Inc.\nNotes to the Condensed Consolidated Interim Financial Statements\nFor the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024\n(Unaudited, expressed in thousands of Canadian dollars, except where otherwise noted)\n3. BUSINESS ACQUISITIONS\nOn March 28, 2023, the Company announced that it had entered into an agreement with Lightbox Enterprises Ltd.\n(“Lightbox”) pursuant to which, in connection with Lightbox’s proceedings under the Companies’ Creditors\nArrangement Act (Canada), the Company (or its designee) would acquire the assets comprising four cannabis retail\nstores operating under the Dutch Love cannabis retail banner (the “Lightbox Transaction”). The Lightbox Transaction\nconsideration was comprised of (i) approximately $1.7 million in cash, (ii) the cancellation of $3.0 million in debt owing\nby Lightbox to the Company, and (iii) the issuance of 1.1 million SNDL common shares valued at approximately $3.7\nmillion.\nOn April 1, 2024, the Company announced that it had agreed to assign its rights to own or operate the four cannabis\nretail stores to Nova. On May 8, 2024, the Company completed the Lightbox Transaction and the assignment of its\nrights to own or operate the four cannabis retail stores to Nova.\nThe Company has engaged independent valuation experts to assist in determining the fair value of certain assets\nacquired and liabilities assumed and related deferred income tax impacts. The purchase price allocation is not final\nas the Company is continuing to obtain and verify information required to determine the fair value of certain assets\nand liabilities and the amount of deferred income taxes, if any, arising on their recognition.\nDue to the inherent complexity associated with valuations and the timing of the acquisition, the amounts below are\nprovisional and subject to adjustment. The fair value of consideration paid was as follows:\nProvisional Adjustments Provisional\nCash 1,654 — 1,654\nIssuance of common shares 3,693 — 3,693\nExtinguishment of convertible debenture 3,000 — 3,000\n8,347 — 8,347\nThe preliminary fair value of the assets and liabilities acquired was as follows:\nProvisional Adjustments Provisional\nInventory 154 — 154\nPrepaid expenses and deposits — 120 120\nRight of use assets 2,828 (111) 2,717\nProperty, plant and equipment 964 73 1,037\nIntangible assets 1,959 546 2,505\nLease liabilities (2,828) — (2,828 )\nTotal identifiable net assets acquired 3,077 628 3,705\nGoodwill 5,270 (628) 4,642\n8,347 — 8,347\nGoodwill is mainly attributable to the expansion of the store network and the Value Buds brand growth in British\nColumbia.\nAs new information is obtained within one year of the date of acquisition, about facts and circumstances that existed\nat the date of acquisition, the accounting for the acquisition will be revised.\nThe financial statements incorporate the operations of Lightbox commencing May 9, 2024. During the period May 9,\n2024 to September 30, 2024 the Company recorded revenues of $3.9 million and net loss of $0.2 million from the\nLightbox operations. Had the Lightbox Transaction closed on January 1, 2024, management estimates that for the\nperiod January 1, 2024, to May 8, 2024, revenue would have increased by $3.1 million and net earnings would have\nincreased by $0.2 million. In determining these amounts, management assumes the fair values on the date of\nacquisition would have been the same as if the acquisition had occurred on January 1, 2024.\nThe Company incurred costs related to the Lightbox Transaction of $0.7 million which have been included in\ntransaction costs.\n7\nSNDL Inc.\nNotes to the Condensed Consolidated Interim Financial Statements\nFor the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024\n(Unaudited, expressed in thousands of Canadian dollars, except where otherwise noted)\n4. SEGMENT INFORMATION\nThe Company’s reportable segments are organized by business line and are comprised of four reportable segments:\nliquor retail, cannabis retail, cannabis operations, and investments.\nLiquor retail includes the sale of wines, beers and spirits through owned liquor stores. Cannabis retail includes the\nprivate sale of adult-use cannabis through owned and franchise retail cannabis stores. Cannabis operations include\nthe cultivation, distribution and sale of cannabis for the adult-use and medical markets domestically and for export,\nand providing proprietary cannabis processing services, in addition to product development, manufacturing, and\ncommercialization of cannabis consumer packaged goods.

For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, share of profit\nof equity-accounted investees related to operations in the United States was a gain of $1.0 million (nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2023 – gain of $15.2 million). All other non-current assets relate to operations in Canada and revenues\nfrom external customers relate to operations in Canada.\n5. BIOLOGICAL ASSETS\nThe Company’s biological assets consist of cannabis plants in various stages of vegetation, including plants which have\nnot been harvested. The change in carrying value of biological assets is as follows:\nAs at September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023\nBalance, beginning of year 429 3,477\nIncrease in biological assets due to capitalized costs 4,076 21,501\nNet change in fair value of biological assets (401) (7,936)\nTransferred to inventory upon harvest (3,203) (16,613)\nBalance, end of period 901 429\nBiological assets are valued in accordance with International Accounting Standard 41 – Agriculture and are presented\nat their fair value less costs to sell up to the point of harvest. This is determined using a model which estimates the\nexpected harvest yield in grams for plants currently being cultivated, and then adjusts that amount for the expected\nselling price less costs to produce and sell per gram.\nThe fair value measurements for biological assets have been categorized as Level 3 fair values based on the inputs to\nthe valuation technique used. The Company’s method of accounting for biological assets attributes value accretion\non a straight-line basis throughout the life of the biological asset from initial cloning to the point of harvest.\nThe Company estimates the harvest yields for cannabis at various stages of growth.

For impairment testing of retail property, plant and equipment and right of use assets, the Company\ndetermined that a cash generating unit (“CGU”) was defined as each individual retail store. The Company completed\nimpairment tests for each CGU determined to have an indicator of potential impairment or impairment reversal using\na discounted cash flow model. The recoverable amounts for each CGU were based on the higher of its estimated value\nin use and fair value less costs of disposal using Level 3 inputs. The significant assumptions applied in the impairment\ntest are described below:\n• Cash flows: Projected future sales and earnings for cash flows are based on actual operating results and operating\nforecasts. Management determined forecasted growth rates of sales based on past performance, expectations\nof future performance for each location and industry averages. Expenditures were based upon a combination of\nhistorical percentages of revenue, sales growth rates, forecasted inflation rates and contractual lease payments.\nThe duration of the cash flow projections for individual CGUs is 5 years or based on the remaining lease term of\nthe CGU.\n• Discount rate: A pre-tax discount rate range of 12.5% – 13.8% was estimated and is based on market assessments\nof the time value of money and CGU specific risks. To determine a pre-tax discount rate, a weighted average cost\nof capital was used as a reference point which is based on market capital structure of debt, risk-free rate, equity\nrisk premium, beta adjustment to the equity risk premium based on a review of betas of comparable publicly\ntraded companies, the Company’s historical data, an unsystematic risk premium and after-tax cost of debt based\non corporate bond yields.\nFor the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company recorded impairment losses of property, plant and\nequipment of $1.4 million which consists of net $0.77 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024, a reversal\nof net $0.21 million for the three months ended June 30, 2024 and impairment of net $0.89 million for the three\nmonths ended September 30, 2024 (September 30, 2023 – $0.5 million) in the cannabis retail reporting segment and\n11\nSNDL Inc.\nNotes to the Condensed Consolidated Interim Financial Statements\nFor the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024\n(Unaudited, expressed in thousands of Canadian dollars, except where otherwise noted)\nan impairment reversal of $1.6 million, $0.76 million reversal for the three months ended March 31, 2024, impairment\nof $0.22 million for the three months ended June 30, 2024 and a reversal of $1.1 million for the three months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024 (September 30, 2023 – $0.4 million) in the liquor retail reporting segment.

The increase of $1.8 million was mainly due to an increase\n3\nin salaries and wages, partially offset by decreases in consulting fees and other expenses. The decrease in other expenses\nwas mainly due to decreases in expected credit losses.\nGeneral and administrative expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were $142.7 million compared to\n$149.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease of $6.8 million was mainly due to decreases\nin office and general, professional fees and other expenses, partially offset by an increase in salaries and wages. The\ndecrease in other expenses was mainly due to decreases in expected credit losses.\nSHARE-BASED COMPENSATION\nThree months ended Nine months ended\nSeptember 30 September 30\n($000s) 2024 2023 2024 2023\nEquity-settled expense\nSimple warrants — 3 — (332 )\nStock options — — 1 (2 )\nRestricted share units 4,503 3,602 11,254 9,711\nCash-settled expense\nDeferred share units 1,199 1,768 4,173 2,098\n5,702 5,373 15,428 11,475\nShare-based compensation expense includes the expense related to the Company’s issuance of simple and performance\nwarrants, stock options, restricted share units (“RSUs”) and deferred share units (“DSUs”) to employees, directors, and\nothers at the discretion of the Board. DSUs are accounted for as a liability instrument and measured at fair value based\non the market value of the Company’s common shares at each period end. Share-based compensation also includes the\nexpense related to Nova’s issuance of RSUs and DSUs during the applicable period (which pre-dated the completion of\nthe Nova Transaction).\nShare-based compensation expense for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was $5.7 million compared to $5.4\nmillion for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase of $0.3 million was due to an increase in RSU\nexpense, partially offset by a decrease in DSU expense. The increase in RSU expense was due to the issuance of new RSUs,\npartially offset by the vesting of RSUs granted in prior years. The decrease in DSU expense was caused by the change in\nfair value. Both the current and comparative periods experienced increases in fair value resulting from an increase in the\nCompany’s share price, however, the current period increase was less than the comparative period.\nShare-based compensation expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was $15.4 million compared to $11.5\nmillion for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase of $3.9 million was due to an increase in DSU\nexpense and RSU expense. The increase in DSU expense was caused by the change in fair value. The current period had\nan increase in fair value resulting from an increase in the Company’s share price compared to the prior period which had\na minimal increase in fair value. The increase in RSU expense was due to the issuance of new RSUs, partially offset by the\nvesting of RSUs granted in prior years.\n4\nFINANCE COSTS\nThree months ended Nine months ended\nSeptember 30 September 30\n($000s) 2024 2023 2024 2023\nCash finance expense\nOther finance costs — 2 93 47\n— 2 93 47\nNon-cash finance expense\nChange in fair value of investments at fair value\nthrough profit or loss — 52 575 3,677\nAccretion on lease liabilities 1,901 1,676 5,788 5,915\nFinancial guarantee liability recovery (15 ) — (34 ) (139 )\nOther 48 625 (320 ) 921\n1,934 2,353 6,009 10,374\nInterest income (194 ) (213 ) (580 ) (648 )\n1,740 2,142 5,522 9,773\nFinance costs include accretion expense related to lease liabilities, finance income related to net investment in subleases,\nchange in fair value of investments at fair value through profit or loss (“FVTPL”) and certain other expenses.\nFinance costs for the three months ended September 30, 2024 were $1.7 million compared to $2.1 million for the three\nmonths ended September 30, 2023. The decrease of $0.4 million was due to a decrease in other expenses caused by lease\nremeasurements in the comparative period, partially offset by an increase in accretion on lease liabilities.\nFinance costs for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were $5.5 million compared to $9.8 million for the nine\nmonths ended September 30, 2023. The decrease of $4.3 million was due to the comparative period change in fair value\nof investments at FVTPL, caused by a decrease in the value of the Superette promissory note, and a decrease in other\nexpenses caused by lease remeasurements in the comparative period.\nCHANGE IN ESTIMATE OF FAIR VALUE OF DERIVATIVE WARRANTS\nThree months ended Nine months ended\nSeptember 30 September 30\n($000s) 2024 2023 2024 2023\nChange in estimate of fair value of derivative warrants (3,848 ) 2,840 (4,348 ) (4,202 )\nChange in estimate of fair value of derivative warrants for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was a recovery of\n$3.8 million compared to an expense of $2.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The recovery in the\ncurrent period relates to the expiration of the 9.8 million new warrants that were issued in 2021 and a minimal decrease\nin fair value of the remaining warrants. The expense in the prior period relates to an increase in fair value, mainly due to\nan increase in the Company’s share price from US$1.37 on June 30, 2023, to US$1.90 on September 30, 2023.\nChange in estimate of fair value of derivative warrants for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was a recovery of\n$4.3 million compared to a recovery of $4.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The recovery in the\ncurrent period relates to the expiration of the 9.8 million new warrants that were issued in 2021 and a minimal decrease\nin fair value of the remaining warrants.

The Company manages its capital structure and adjusts it, based on the funds available to\nthe Company, in order to support the Company’s activities. The Company may adjust capital spending, issue new equity\nor issue new debt, subject to the availability of such debt or equity financing on commercial terms.\nThe Company’s primary need for liquidity is to fund investment opportunities, capital expenditures, working capital\nrequirements and for general corporate purposes. The Company’s primary source of liquidity historically has been from\nfunds received from the proceeds of common share issuances and debt financing. The Company’s ability to fund\noperations and investments and make planned capital expenditures depends on future operating performance and cash\nflows, as well as the availability of future financing–all of which is subject to prevailing economic conditions and financial,\nbusiness and other factors.\nManagement believes its current capital resources will be sufficient to satisfy cash requirements associated with funding\nthe Company’s operating expenses and future development activities for at least the next 12 months.

The decrease of $4.7\nmillion was due to proceeds received in the comparative period for the disposition of marketable securities and the\nchange in non-cash working capital, partially offset by a decrease in net loss adjusted for non-cash items and an increase\nin income distributions from equity-accounted investees. The change in non-cash working capital is comprised of changes\nin inventory, accounts receivable, prepaid expenses and deposits and accounts payable.\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $30.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to\n$30.1 million used in operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2023.

The increase of $79.9 million was\nprimarily due to capital distributions from equity-accounted investees and lower additions to equity-accounted investees,\npartially offset by an increase in additions to investments and acquisitions, net of cash acquired.\n13\nCASH FLOW – FINANCING ACTIVITIES\nNet cash used in financing activities was $9.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to $10.0\nmillion used in financing activities for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease of $0.8 million was\nlargely due to the change in non-cash working capital.\nNet cash used in financing activities was $26.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to $31.1\nmillion used in financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease of $4.8 million was largely\ndue to decreased payments on lease liabilities and no repurchases of common shares in the current period.\nFREE CASH FLOW\nThree months ended Nine months ended\nSeptember 30 September 30\n($000s) 2024 2023 2024 2023\nFree cash flow 9,236 16,333 (2,753 ) (62,266 )\nFree cash flow is a specified financial measure that does not have standardized meaning prescribed by IFRS Accounting\nStandards and therefore may not be comparable to similar measures used by other companies. Refer to the “Non-IFRS\nFinancial Measures and Other Measures” section of this MD&A for further information. The Company defines free cash\nflow as the total change in cash and cash equivalents less cash used for common share repurchases, dividends (if any),\nchanges to debt instruments, changes to long-term investments, net cash used for acquisitions plus cash provided by\ndispositions (if any).\nFree cash flow was $9.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to $16.3 million for the three\nmonths ended September 30, 2023. The decrease of $7.1 million was mainly due to an increase in non-cash working\ncapital ($15.3 million), a decrease in proceeds received in the comparative period for the disposition of marketable\nsecurities ($3.2 million) and additions to intangible assets ($3.2 million), partially offset by a decrease in net loss adjusted\nfor non-cash items ($2.9 million) and income distributions from equity-accounted investees ($10.7 million).\nFree cash flow was negative $2.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to negative $62.3\nmillion for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase of $59.5 million was mainly due to a decrease in net\nloss adjusted for non-cash items ($30.4 million), a decrease in non-cash working capital ($31.1 million), income\ndistributions from equity-accounted investees ($10.7 million) and a decrease in payments on lease liabilities ($2.4 million),\npartially offset by a decrease in proceeds received in the comparative period for the disposition of marketable securities\n($6.7 million) and additions to intangible assets ($3.2 million).\nFINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS\nRefer to note 22 in the Interim Financial Statements for additional information on the Company’s financial instruments\nand the related fair value estimates and disclosures.\nLIQUIDITY RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS\nCREDIT RISK\nCredit risk is the risk of financial loss if the counterparty to a financial transaction fails to meet its obligations. The\nmaximum amount of the Company’s credit risk exposure is the carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents, accounts\nreceivable, and investments. The Company attempts to mitigate such exposure to its cash and cash equivalents by\ninvesting only in financial institutions with investment grade credit ratings or secured investments. The Company manages\nrisk over its accounts receivable by issuing credit only to creditworthy counterparties. The Company limits its exposure to\ncredit risk over its investments by ensuring the agreements governing the investments are secured in the event of\ncounterparty default. The Company considers financial instruments to have low credit risk when its credit risk rating is\nequivalent to investment grade. The Company assumes that the credit risk on a financial asset has increased significantly\nif it is outstanding past the contractual payment terms. The Company considers a financial asset to be in default when the\ndebtor is unlikely to pay its credit obligations to the Company.\n14\nThe Company applies the simplified approach under IFRS 9 for its trade receivables and has calculated expected credit\nlosses based on lifetime expected credit losses, taking into consideration historical credit loss experience and financial\nfactors specific to the debtors and general economic conditions.\nLIQUIDITY RISK\nLiquidity risk is the risk that the Company cannot meet its financial obligations when due. The Company manages liquidity\nrisk by monitoring operating and growth requirements. The Company prepares forecasts to ensure sufficient liquidity to\nfulfil obligations and operating plans. Management believes its current capital resources will be sufficient to satisfy cash\nrequirements associated with funding the Company’s operating expenses and future development activities for at least\nthe next 12 months. However, no assurance can be given that this will be the case or that future sources of capital will not\nbe necessary.\nMARKET RISK\nMarket risk is the risk that changes in market prices will affect the Company’s income or value of its holdings of financial\ninstruments. The Company is exposed to market risk in that changes in market prices will cause fluctuations in the fair\nvalue of its marketable securities. The fair value of marketable securities is based on quoted market prices as the\nCompany’s marketable securities are shares of publicly traded entities.\nREGULATORY RISK\nRegulatory risk pertains to the risk that the Company’s business objectives are contingent, in part, upon compliance with\nregulatory requirements. Due to the nature of the industries in which the Company operates, the Company recognizes\nthat regulatory requirements are more stringent and punitive in nature than most other sectors of the economy. Any\ndelays in obtaining, or failure to obtain, regulatory approvals could significantly delay operational and/or product\ndevelopment and could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, results of operations, and financial\ncondition. The Company is cognizant of the advent of regulatory changes in these industries on the city, provincial, and\nnational levels in Canada and is aware of the effect that unforeseen regulatory changes in these industries could have on\nthe goals and operations of the business as a whole.\nCONTRACTUAL COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES\nA) COMMITMENTS\nThe information presented in the table below reflects management’s estimate of the contractual maturities of the\nCompany’s obligations at September 30, 2024.\nLess than One to three Three to five\n($000s) one year years years Thereafter Total\nAccounts payable and accrued liabilities 54,038 — — — 54,038\nLease liabilities 42,101 69,605 45,761 30,073 187,540\nFinancial guarantee liability — 234 — — 234\nTotal 96,139 69,839 45,761 30,073 241,812\nThe Company has entered into certain supply agreements to provide dried cannabis and cannabis products to third\nparties. The contracts require the provision of various amounts of dried cannabis on or before certain dates. Should the\nCompany not deliver the product in the agreed timeframe, financial penalties apply which may be paid either in product\nin-kind or cash. The Company has settled the existing $2.5 million financial penalty previously accrued and amended its\npre-existing data arrangement with the customer.\nB) CONTINGENCIES\nFrom time to time, the Company and its subsidiaries are or may become involved in various legal claims and actions which\narise in the ordinary course of their business and operations. While the outcome of any such claim or action is inherently\nuncertain, the Company believes that the losses that may result, if any, will not be material to the financial statements.\n15\nNON-IFRS FINANCIAL MEASURES AND OTHER MEASURES\nCertain specified financial measures in this MD&A including adjusted operating income (loss) and free cash flow are non-\nIFRS measures. These terms are not defined by IFRS Accounting Standards and, therefore, may not be comparable to\nsimilar measures reported by other companies. These non-IFRS financial measures should not be considered in isolation\nor as an alternative for measures of performance prepared in accordance with IFRS Accounting Standards.\nGROSS PROFIT %\nGross profit % is a supplementary financial measure calculated by dividing gross profit by net revenue for the periods\nnoted.\nADJUSTED OPERATING INCOME (LOSS)\nAdjusted operating income (loss) is a non-IFRS financial measure which the Company uses to evaluate its operating\nperformance.

Free cash\nflow provides information which management believes to be useful to investors, analysts and others in understanding\nand evaluating the Company’s ability to generate positive cash flows as it removes cash used for non-operational items.\nThe Company defines free cash flow as the total change in cash and cash equivalents less cash used for common share\nrepurchases, dividends (if any), changes to debt instruments, changes to long-term investments, net cash used for\nacquisitions plus cash provided by dispositions (if any).\nThe following table reconciles free cash flow to change in cash and cash equivalents for the periods noted.\nThree months ended Nine months ended\nSeptember 30 September 30\n($000s) 2024 2023 2024 2023\nChange in cash and cash equivalents 80,042 16,528 67,935 (77,603 )\nAdjustments\nRepurchase of common shares — — — 1,536\nChanges to long-term investments (70,806 ) (195 ) (72,342 ) 17,496\nAcquisitions, net of cash acquired — — 1,654 (3,695 )\nFree cash flow 9,236 16,333 (2,753 ) (62,266 )\nRELATED PARTIES\nSunStream is a joint venture in which the Company has a 50% ownership interest and is a related party due to it being\nclassified as a joint venture of the Company. SunStream is a private company, incorporated under the Business\nCorporations Act (Alberta), which provides growth capital that pursues indirect investment and financial services\nopportunities in the cannabis sector, as well as other investment opportunities. Capital contributions to the joint venture\nand distributions received from the joint venture are classified as related party transactions.\nA former member of key management personnel (Tank Vander – former President, Liquor Retail; retired from SNDL on\nSeptember 10, 2024) jointly controls a company that owns property leased to SNDL for one of its retail liquor stores.

Critical accounting estimates\ninclude the classification and recoverable amounts of cash generating units, value of inventory, estimating potential future\nreturns on revenue, convertible instruments, value of investments, value of equity-accounted investees, value of leases,\nacquisitions and fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination. Critical accounting\nestimates are based on variable inputs including but not limited to:\n• Demand for cannabis for recreational and medical purposes;\n• Price of cannabis;\n• Expected cannabis sales volumes;\n• Demand for liquor;\n17\n• Price of liquor;\n• Expected liquor sales volumes;\n• Changes in market interest and discount rates;\n• Future development and operating costs;\n• Costs to convert harvested cannabis to finished goods;\n• Expected yields from cannabis plants;\n• Potential returns and pricing adjustments; and\n• Market prices, volatility and discount rates used to determine fair value of equity-accounted investees.\nChanges in critical accounting estimates can have a significant effect on profit or loss as a result of their impact on revenue,\ncosts of sales, provisions and impairments. Changes in critical accounting estimates can have a significant effect on the\nvaluation of biological assets, inventory, property, plant and equipment, provisions and derivative financial instruments.\nFor a detailed discussion regarding the Company’s critical accounting policies and estimates, refer to the notes to the\nAudited Financial Statements.\nNEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS\nThe International Accounting Standards Board and the IFRS Interpretations Committee regularly issue new and revised\naccounting pronouncements which have future effective dates and therefore are not reflected in the Company’s\nconsolidated financial statements. Once adopted, these new and amended pronouncements may have an impact on the\nCompany’s consolidated financial statements. The Company’s analysis of recent accounting pronouncements is included\nin the notes to the Audited Financial Statements.\nRISK FACTORS\nIn addition to the risks described elsewhere in this document, for a detailed discussion regarding the Company’s risk\nfactors, refer to the “Risk Factors” section of the AIF.\nDISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES\nThe Company has designed disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in National Instrument 52-109 – Certification\nof Disclosure in Issuers’ Annual and Interim Filings (“NI 52-109”) and Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the U.S. Securities\nExchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”)) to provide reasonable assurance that: (i) material information\nrelating to the Company is made known to the Company’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer by others,\nparticularly during the period in which the annual and interim filings are being prepared; and (ii) information required to\nbe disclosed by the Company in its annual filings, interim filings or other reports filed or submitted by it under securities\nlegislation is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time period specified in such securities legislation.\nOur management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has evaluated the\neffectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2024. Based upon evaluation of the\nCompany’s disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2024, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial\nOfficer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as September 30, 2024, due to a\nmaterial weakness described in our MD&A for the year ended December 31, 2023.\nINTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as\ndefined in NI 52-109 and Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act). Refer to our MD&A for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2023, for a discussion regarding our internal control over financial reporting and the material weakness\nidentified.\n18\nREMEDIATION\nManagement has implemented and continues to implement measures designed to ensure that control deficiencies are\nremediated, such that these controls are designed, implemented, and operating effectively. The remediation actions\ninclude:\n• continuing to strengthen procedures and controls related to the provisioning of and periodic review of user access\nto IT systems;\n• enhancing the timeliness and precision of executing user access reviews;\n• working with our advisors to continue to assist with process improvements and strengthening of controls over\nfinancial systems; and\n• augmentation of our internal audit staff with the hiring of 3 qualified personnel to leverage co-sourcing with\nexternal advisors to enhance the effectiveness and scope of our internal audit function.\nAt November 4, 2024 the above remediation measures are in progress but will not be considered remediated until the\nupdated controls operate for a sufficient period of time, and management has concluded through testing, that these\ncontrols are operating effectively.\nThe Company is pursuing remediation of the above material weakness during the 2024 fiscal year.\nCHANGES IN INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING\nExcept for the remediation activities described above, as of September 30, 2024, there have been no other changes in our\ninternal control over financial reporting (as defined in NI 52-109 and Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange\nAct) that occurred during the quarter ended September 30, 2024, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to\nmaterially affect, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.\nABBREVIATIONS\nThe following provides a summary of common abbreviations used in this document:\nFinancial and Business Environment\n$ or C$ Canadian dollars\nU.S. United States\nUS$ United States dollars\nFORWARD-LOOKING INFORMATION\nThis MD&A may contain forward-looking information concerning the Company’s business, operations and financial\nperformance and condition, as well as the Company’s plans, objectives and expectations for its business operations and\nfinancial performance and condition.
