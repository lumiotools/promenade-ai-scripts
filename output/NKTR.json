Reduced clearance enables sustained PD activity from a single dose, unlike historical multiple dose per day necessary regimens of recombinant human CSF-1 administration. This CSF-1R agonist, NKTR-422, demonstrated inflammation resolution and tissue repair markers induction in tissue resident macrophages without induction of monocytosis and enhanced the efficacy of inflammatory cytokine blockade in rodent models.\n\n\"These early data demonstrate that NKTR-422 has the potential to accelerate treatment efficacy and may improve disease remission, especially in combination treatments with standard of care inflammatory cytokine blockade drugs,\" said Jonathan Zalevsky, Ph.D., Senior Vice President and Chief Research & Development Officer at Nektar. \"We're excited to see how this program progresses given its wide potential applications in a number of therapeutic indications including acute and chronic inflammation.\"\n\nDetails of the presentation can be found on Nektar's website at [www.nektar.com](https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&l=en&o=4303670-1&h=206298894&u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.nektar.com%2F&a=www.nektar.com) under Scientific Posters, Presentations and Publications.\n\n**2024 American College of Rheumatology (ACR) Convergence **\n\nAbstract 1866120: _\"A Novel Therapeutically Active CSF-1R Agonist Promotes Tissue Macrophages Inflammation Resolution and Induces Tissue Repair Pathways\"_ , Kivimae, S.

Nektar's cash and marketable securities are expected to support strategic development activities and operations into the fourth quarter of 2026.\n\n\"We made excellent progress this quarter advancing our I&I pipeline, including the ongoing Phase 2b studies of rezpegaldesleukin in atopic dermatitis and alopecia areata,\" said Howard W. Robin, President and CEO of Nektar. \"We see rapid enrollment in the 400-patient atopic dermatitis study for rezpegaldesleukin, and we remain on track for topline data in the first half of 2025. Our Phase 2 study in alopecia areata is also enrolling nicely with topline data expected in the second half of 2025.\"\n\n\"Beyond rezpegaldesleukin, we are focused on advancing our earlier stage TNFR2 antibody and bispecific programs, NKTR-0165 and NKTR-0166, with at least one of these slated to enter the clinic next year,\" continued Robin. \"Next week, we are looking forward to presenting highly promising data at the 2024 ACR Convergence Meeting for our preclinical PEG-CSF program, NKTR-422. Finally, we recently published important data for our IL-15 agonist, NKTR-255, highlighting its potential as a validated mechanism in oncology.\"\n\n**Summary of Financial Results**\n\nRevenue in the third quarter of 2024 was $24.1 million compared to the same $24.1 million in the third quarter of 2023. Revenue for the first nine months of 2024 was $69.3 million compared to $66.2 million in the first nine months of 2023.\n\nTotal operating costs and expenses in the third quarter of 2024 were $58.5 million compared to $69.0 million in the third quarter of 2023. Total operating costs and expenses in the first nine months of 2024 were $188.8 million compared to $296.4 million in the first nine months of 2023. Operating costs and expenses for the first nine months of 2024 decreased primarily due to decreases in restructuring, impairment and costs of terminated programs and a one-time $76.5 million non-cash goodwill impairment recognized in the first quarter of 2023.\n\nR&D expense in the third quarter of 2024 was $35.0 million compared to $24.1 million for the third quarter of 2023. For the first nine months of 2024, R&D expense was $92.2 million compared to $84.2 million in the first nine months of 2023. R&D expense increased for both the third quarter and the first nine months of 2024 primarily due to increases in development expenses for rezpegaldesleukin and NKTR-0165, partially offset by decreases in employee and related facilities costs, as well as development expenses for NKTR-255.\n\nG&A expense was $19.0 million in the third quarter of 2024 compared to $21.1 million in the third quarter of 2023. G&A expense was $59.6 million for the first nine months of 2024 compared to $60.1 million in the first nine months of 2023. G&A expense decreased for both the third quarter and the first nine months of 2024 primarily due to decreases in employee costs, partially offset by the reduction of facilities costs allocated to research and development expenses.\n\nNon-cash restructuring and impairment charges were less than $0.1 million in the third quarter of 2024 and $14.3 million in the first nine months of 2024. These non-cash charges are related to the declining San Francisco commercial real estate market and real estate lease obligations held by Nektar.\n\nNet loss for the third quarter of 2024 was $37.1 million or $0.18 basic and diluted loss per share compared to a net loss of $45.8 million or $0.24 basic and diluted loss per share in the third quarter of 2023. Net loss in the first nine months of 2024 was $126.2 million or $0.62 basic and diluted loss per share compared to a net loss of $234.0 million or $1.23 basic and diluted loss per share in the first nine months of 2023. Excluding the $14.3 million in non-cash restructuring and real estate impairment charges, net loss, on a non-GAAP basis, for the first nine months of 2024 was $111.9 million, or $0.55 basic and diluted loss per share.\n\n**Third Quarter 2024 and Recent Business Highlights**\n\n  * In September 2024, Nektar presented several posters for rezpegaldesleukin (REZPEG) at the 2024 European Academy of Dermatology and Venereology (EADV) Congress. In addition to two trial-in-progress posters, new proteomic analyses were also presented, which showed that rezpegaldesleukin increased the protein levels of immune-regulating pathways and reduced specific serum proteins known to be elevated in patients with atopic dermatitis.\n  * In October 2024, Nektar and collaborators announced the publication of data from a Phase 1 trial evaluating NKTR-255 in combination with CD19/22 CAR-T cell therapy in patients with relapsed or refractory B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) in _Blood_ , an open-access journal of the American Society of Hematology. The data show that eight out of nine patients (89%) achieved complete remission, all without detectable measurable residual disease (MRD).\n  * In October 2024, Nature Communications published results from Phase 1b studies of rezpegaldesleukin in two inflammatory skin diseases, demonstrating durable dose-dependent improvements in physician-assessed disease activity and patient-reported outcomes for both studies. Rezpegaldesleukin was evaluated in patients with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis (AD) (NCT04081350) or chronic plaque psoriasis (PsO) (NCT04119557). AD patients receiving high dose rezpegaldesleukin demonstrate an 83% improvement in EASI score after 12 weeks of treatment. EASI improvement of ≥ 75% (EASI-75) and vIGA-AD responses were maintained for 36 weeks after treatment discontinuation in 71% and 80% of week 12 responders, respectively. Results validate the role of IL-2-induced Treg proliferation and activation in the AD treatment paradigm, and support the advancement of rezpegaldesleukin in the Phase 2b study in AD.\n  * In November, Nektar announced a definitive agreement with Ampersand Capital Partners to sell its commercial PEGylation manufacturing business in Huntsville, Alabama for $90 million in enterprise value, which is comprised of $70 million in cash and $20 million in equity ownership in the new portfolio company. The Huntsville-based facility will be spun out as a standalone Ampersand portfolio company and Ampersand has committed to invest additional growth equity capital into the new company. All of Nektar's employees at the Huntsville facility will be offered employment at the new portfolio company, ensuring continuity in the high-quality manufacturing and PEGylation expertise that longstanding customers trust and rely on. Nektar and the new Ampersand portfolio company will also enter into manufacturing supply agreements to meet Nektar's PEG reagent needs for rezpegaldesleukin and certain pipeline programs. The transaction will be subject to customary closing conditions and costs and is expected to close by December 2, 2024. Following the closing, Nektar will retain all rights to current and future royalty streams and milestones related to existing PEGylated product license agreements. Nektar will also be entitled to appoint a representative to the board of the new Ampersand portfolio company.\n  * Enrollment remains on track for the two Phase 2b studies of REZPEG, one in patients with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis and one in patients with severe to very severe alopecia areata. Nektar expects topline data from these studies in the first half and in the second half of 2025, respectively.\n\n\n\nNektar also announced presentations at the following medical meetings:\n\n**2024 Society for Immunotherapy of Cancer (SITC) Annual Meeting**\n\nLate-breaking Abstract (LBA) 1489: _\"_  _REStoring lymphoCytes Using NKTR-255 after chemoradiothErapy in solid tumors (RESCUE): Preplanned Interim Safety and Efficacy Analysis\"_ , Lin, S.Presentation Type: PosterePoster will be on display on the SITC 2024 virtual meeting platform on Thursday, November 7, 2024, at 9:00 a.m. CST\n\n**2024 American College of Rheumatology (ACR) Convergence **\n\nAbstract 1866120: _\"A Novel Therapeutically Active CSF-1R Agonist Promotes Tissue Macrophages Inflammation Resolution and Induces Tissue Repair Pathways\"_ , Kivimae, S.

NKTR-255 is currently being evaluated in combination with cellular therapies and immune checkpoint inhibitors. Previous pre-clinical and clinical studies have shown that NKTR-255 can proliferate a range of immune cells and augment lymphocyte trafficking.1,2,3\n\nThe results from the preplanned interim analysis from the REStoring lymphoCytes Using NKTR-255 after chemoradiothErapy in solid tumors (RESCUE) trial suggest that NKTR-255 effectively reversed radiation induced lymphopenia in patients with locally advanced NSCLC receiving consolidation therapy with durvalumab. Interim pharmacodynamic data demonstrated statistically significant superiority of the eight-week absolute lymphocyte count (ALC) with NKTR-255 post chemoradiation and in combination with durvalumab versus non-contemporaneous control groups who received either chemoradiation alone or chemoradiation in combination with durvalumab.\n\n\"Radiation induced lymphopenia is common after chemoradiation therapy and is associated with worse overall survival in multiple solid tumors including lung cancer.\" said Steven H. Lin, MD, PhD, Professor of Radiation Oncology at MD Anderson. \"These interim results showing that NKTR-255 can rapidly restore absolute lymphocyte counts post chemoradiation suggest that NKTR-255 has the potential to confer prognostic benefits and enhanced survival in patients with locally advanced NSCLC.\"\n\n\"These results, combined with the body of evidence previously reported with NKTR-255 in combination with cell therapy, highlight NKTR-255's potential to enhance clinical benefit in both hematologic malignancies and solid tumors\" said Mary Tagliaferri, MD, Senior Vice President and Chief Medical Officer at Nektar. \n\nThe Phase 2 single-arm study conducted by MD Anderson is evaluating NKTR-255 (3µg/kg IV) following concurrent chemoradiation and in combination with consolidation therapy with durvalumab. NKTR-255 3µg/kg is administered intravenously every 4 weeks in combination with durvalumab (1500mg IV) for up to 1 year ([NCT05632809](https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&l=en&o=4295426-1&h=3791912229&u=https%3A%2F%2Fclinicaltrials.gov%2Fstudy%2FNCT05632809%3Fintr%3DNCT05632809%26rank%3D1&a=NCT05632809)). The primary objectives of the study are safety and ALC normalization at Week 8 after initiation of NKTR-255 and durvalumab post chemoradiation. Secondary endpoints include progression-free survival and overall survival. The trial is currently ongoing at MD Anderson.\n\n**Key details and takeaways from the presentation are as follows:**\n\n**Late-breaking Abstract (LBA) 1489:**  _\"_  _REStoring lymphoCytes Using NKTR-255 after chemoradiothErapy in solid tumors (RESCUE): Preplanned Interim Safety and Efficacy Analysis\"_ , Lin, S., et al.\n\n  * The combination of NKTR-255 and durvalumab post chemoradiation was shown to be safe and tolerable with an AE profile consistent with previously reported clinical trials.\n  * Interim pharmacodynamic data demonstrated statistically significant superiority of the eight-week absolute lymphocyte count with NKTR-255 post chemoradiation and in combination with durvalumab versus non-contemporaneous control groups who received either chemoradiation alone or chemoradiation in combination with durvalumab. Additional pharmacodynamic findings following NKTR-255 administration show increased markers of NK cell proliferation and activation.\n\n\n\n**About NKTR-255**\n\nNKTR-255 is a biologic that targets the IL-15 pathway in order to activate the body's innate and adaptive immunity. Through optimal engagement of the IL-15 receptor complex, NKTR-255 is designed to enhance functional NK cell populations and formation of long-term immunological memory to improve the anti-tumor immune response.\n\nIn addition to studies in combination with CAR T cell therapies, NKTR-255 is being studied in a Phase 1 clinical trial sponsored by AbelZeta which is evaluating C-TIL051, a tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte therapy, in anti-PD1 resistant metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NCT05676749). The JAVELIN Bladder Medley study (NCT05327530), sponsored by Merck KGaA, is also ongoing to evaluate NKTR-255 in combination with avelumab as a maintenance treatment in patients with locally advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma (NCT05327530).\n\n**About Nektar Therapeutics**\n\nNektar Therapeutics is a clinical-stage biotechnology company focused on developing treatments that address the underlying immunological dysfunction in autoimmune and chronic inflammatory diseases. Nektar's lead product candidate, rezpegaldesleukin (REZPEG, or NKTR-358), is a novel, first-in-class regulatory T cell stimulator being evaluated in two Phase 2b clinical trials, one in atopic dermatitis and one in alopecia areata. Our pipeline also includes a preclinical candidate NKTR-0165, which is a bivalent tumor necrosis factor receptor type II agonist antibody. Nektar, together with various partners, is also evaluating NKTR-255, an investigational IL-15 receptor agonist designed to boost the immune system's natural ability to fight cancer, in several ongoing clinical trials. Nektar is headquartered in San Francisco, California.
