However, management uses certain non-GAAP financial measures, including Adjusted EBITDA, internally to evaluate the Company's performance and to set performance goals. Adjusted EBITDA is calculated as net income (or loss) attributable to PRA Group, Inc. plus income tax expense (or less income tax benefit); plus foreign exchange loss (or less foreign exchange gain); plus interest expense, net; plus other expense (or less other income); plus depreciation and amortization; plus impairment of real estate; plus net income attributable to noncontrolling interests; and plus recoveries applied to negative allowance less changes in expected recoveries. Adjusted EBITDA is a supplemental measure of performance that is not required by, or presented in accordance with, GAAP. The Company presents Adjusted EBITDA because the Company considers it an important supplemental measure of its operational and financial performance. Management believes Adjusted EBITDA helps provide enhanced period-to-period comparability of the Company's operational and financial performance and is useful to investors as other companies in the industry report similar financial measures. Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered as an alternative to net income determined in accordance with GAAP. Set forth below is a reconciliation of net income, the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and reported in accordance with GAAP, to Adjusted EBITDA for the last twelve months (LTM) ended September 30, 2024 and for the year ended December 31, 2023. The calculation of Adjusted EBITDA below may not be comparable to the calculation of similarly titled measures reported by other companies.\n\nView News Release Full Screen**Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures**  \n---  \n**LTM** | **For the Year Ended**  \n**Adjusted EBITDA for PRA Group ($ in millions)** | **September 30, 2024** | **December 31, 2023**  \nNet income/(loss) attributable to PRA Group, Inc. | $ 43 | $ (83)  \n_Adjustments:_  \nIncome tax expense/(benefit) | 10 | (16)  \nForeign exchange loss | 1 | —  \nInterest expense, net | 220 | 181  \nOther expense | 1 | 2  \nDepreciation and amortization | 11 | 13  \nImpairment of real estate | — | 5  \nNet income attributable to noncontrolling interests | 17 | 17  \nRecoveries applied to negative allowance less changes in expected recoveries | 797 | 888  \nAdjusted EBITDA | $ 1,100 | $ 1,007  \n  \nIn addition, the Company uses return on average tangible equity (ROATE), which is a supplemental measure of performance that is not required by, or presented in accordance with, GAAP, to monitor and evaluate operating performance relative to the Company's equity. Management believes ROATE is a useful financial measure for investors in evaluating the effective use of equity, and is an important component of its long-term shareholder return. Average tangible equity (ATE) is defined as average Total stockholders' equity - PRA Group, Inc. less average goodwill and average other intangible assets. ROATE is calculated by dividing annualized Net income/(loss) attributable to PRA Group, Inc. by ATE.\n\nThe following table displays the Company's ROATE and provides a reconciliation of Total stockholders' equity - PRA Group, Inc. as reported in accordance with GAAP to ATE for the periods indicated (amounts in thousands, except for ratio data):\n\nView News Release Full Screen**Average Balance**  \n---  \n**Balance as of Period End** | **Third Quarter** | **Year-to-Date**  \n**September 30, 2024** | **September 30, 2023** | **2024** | **2023** | **2024** | **2023**  \nTotal stockholders' equity - PRA Group, Inc. | $ 1,218,882 | $ 1,115,590 | $ 1,182,173 | $ 1,140,558 | $ 1,165,196 | $ 1,166,780  \nLess: Goodwill | 423,011 | 412,513 | 419,329 | 413,709 | 420,517 | 420,997  \nLess: Other intangible assets | 1,620 | 1,670 | 1,609 | 1,753 | 1,656 | 1,797  \nAverage tangible equity | $ 761,235 | $ 725,096 | $ 743,023 | $ 743,986  \nNet income/(loss) attributable to PRA Group, Inc. | $ 27,154 | $ (12,262) | $ 52,145 | $ (74,695)  \nReturn on average tangible equity (1) | 14.3 % | (6.8) % | 9.4 % | (13.4) %  \n  \n**Investor Contact:** Najim Mostamand, CFAVice President, Investor Relations757-431-7913 _IR@PRAGroup.com _\n\n**News Media Contact:** Elizabeth KerseySenior Vice President, Communications and Public Policy(757) 641-0558 _Elizabeth.Kersey@PRAGroup.com_\n\nSOURCE PRA Group, Inc.\n"

However, management uses certain non-GAAP financial measures,\nincluding Adjusted EBITDA, internally to evaluate the Company’s performance and to set performance goals. Adjusted EBITDA is calculated as net income (or loss) attributable to PRA\nGroup, Inc. plus income tax expense (or less income tax benefit); plus foreign exchange loss (or less foreign exchange gain);plus interest expense, net; plus other expense (or less other\nincome); plus depreciation and amortization; plus impairment of real estate; plus net income attributable to noncontrolling interests; and plus recoveries applied to negative allowance less\nchanges in expected recoveries. Adjusted EBITDA is a supplemental measure of performance that is not required by, or presented in accordance with, GAAP. The Company presents\nAdjusted EBITDA because the Company considers it an important supplemental measure of operational and financial performance. Management believes Adjusted EBITDA helps provide\nenhanced period-to-period comparability of the Company’s operational and financial performance and is useful to investors as other companies in the industry report similar financial\nmeasures. Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered as an alternative to net income determined in accordance with GAAP. Set forthbelow is a reconciliation of net income, the most\ndirectly comparable financial measure calculated and reported in accordance with GAAP, to Adjusted EBITDA for the last twelvemonths (LTM) as of March 31, 2021 through the LTM as of\nSeptember 30, 2024. The calculation of Adjusted EBITDA below may not be comparable to the calculation of similarly titled measures reported by other companies. Additionally, the\nCompany evaluates its business using certain ratios that use Adjusted EBITDA. Debt to Adjusted EBITDA is calculated by dividing borrowings by Adjusted EBITDA. The following table also\nreflects the Company's Debt to Adjusted EBITDA for the LTM as of March 31, 2021 through the LTM as of September 30, 2024.\n18 Nasdaq: PRAA\nReconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures to GAAP\n(Cont.)\nUseofNon-GAAPFinancialMeasures(Cont.)\nIn addition, the Company uses return on average tangible equity (ROATE), which is a supplemental measure of performance that is not required by, or presented in accordance with, GAAP,\nto monitor and evaluate operating performance relative to the Company's equity. Management believes ROATE is a useful financial measure for investors in evaluating the effective use of\nequity, and is an important component of its long-term shareholder return. Average tangible equity (ATE) is defined as average Total stockholders' equity -PRA Group, Inc. less average\ngoodwill and average other intangible assets. ROATE is calculated by dividing annualized Net income/(loss) attributable to PRA Group, Inc. by ATE. The following table displays the\nCompany's ROATE and provides a reconciliation of Total stockholders' equity -PRA Group, Inc. as reported in accordance with GAAP to ATE for the periods indicated (amounts in thousands,\nexcept for ratio data):\n19 Nasdaq: PRAA 1.Based on annualized Net income/(loss) attributable to PRA Group, Inc.\nNajim Mostamand, CFA\nVP, Investor Relations\n(757) 431-7913\nIR@pragroup.com\nIR.P RA G ROUP .C OM"
