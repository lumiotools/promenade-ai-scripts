The transaction is subject to closing conditions under the BCA, including completion of certain due diligence review and regulatory approvals, including required Nasdaq approval. The combined company will have an estimated post-transaction enterprise value of $523 million. \n\n“This is an exciting moment for CFI. We expect our merger with Iron Horse will bring significant opportunities for CFI to grow its promise of green and healthy food products as we continue expanding. We know Iron Horse set out to find a company who want to better the world in some way, and CFI’s focus on health holds the potential to do just that,” said Mr. Sean Jiang, Chairman of CFI. \n\n“We are incredibly excited to announce our first deal for what we hope to grow into the Iron Horse family of SPACs,” said Jose A. Bengochea, CEO of Iron Horse Acquisitions. \n\nLucosky Brookman LLP is serving as legal counsel to Iron Horse. \n\n**About Iron Horse Acquisitions Corp.**\n\nIron Horse Acquisitions Corp.

Most of these factors are outside Iron Horse’s and CFI’s control and are difficult to predict. Factors that may cause such differences include, but are not limited to: (1) the occurrence of any event, change, or other circumstances that could prevent the closing of the proposed Business Combination; (2) the outcome of any legal proceedings that may be instituted against Iron Horse and CFI following this announcement of the signing of the BCA; (3) the inability to complete the proposed Business Combination, including due to failure to obtain approval of the stockholders of Iron Horse or certain regulatory approvals, or to satisfy other conditions to closing; (4) the effect of the announcement or pendency of the proposed Business Combination on CFI’s business relationships, operating results and business generally; (5) risks that the proposed Business Combination disrupts CFI’s current plans and operations; (6) changes in applicable laws or regulations; (7) the possibility that Iron Horse or CFI may be adversely affected by other economic, business, and/or competitive factors; (8) risks related to the organic and inorganic growth of CFI’s business and the timing of expected business milestones; and (9) other risks and uncertainties indicated in the final prospectus of Iron Horse for its initial public offering and the Proxy Statement, including those under “Risk Factors” therein, and in Iron Horse’s other filings with the SEC.

A current version of these Guidelines will be posted on\nthe Company’s website.\nBOARD COMPOSITION AND DIRECTOR QUALIFICATIONS\nBoard Membership Criteria\nThe Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee (the “NCG Committee”) is responsible\nfor reviewing the background and qualifications of individuals being considered as director\ncandidates and recommending any proposed changes to the Board.\nThe NCG Committee will consider various qualifications relating to management and leadership\nexperience, background and integrity and professionalism in evaluating a person’s candidacy for\nmembership on the board of directors, with consideration given to, among other things:\nexperience, skills, expertise, diversity, personal and professional integrity, character, business\njudgment, time availability in light of other commitments, dedication and conflicts of interest. It\nis expected that any candidate selected should have demonstrated notable or significant\nachievements in business, education or public service, should possess the requisite intelligence,\neducation and experience to make a significant contribution to the Board and bring a range of\nskills, diverse perspectives and backgrounds to its deliberations, and should have the highest\nethical standards, a strong sense of professionalism and dedication to serving the interests of the\nCompany’s stockholders.\nIndependent Directors\nThe Company defines an “independent” director in accordance with the rules of Nasdaq. The\nBoard will be composed of a majority of independent directors. Whether directors are\nindependent will be reviewed annually by the Board. The Board will review commercial and\nother relationships between directors and the Company and make a determination regarding the\nindependence of each director.\nDirectors Who Cease to be Independent\nAn independent director who ceases to qualify as such after election to the Board will be\nrequired to tender a resignation as a director promptly to the NCG Committee. The NCG\nCommittee will consider the tendered resignation and recommend to the Board whether to accept\nor reject it, taking into consideration the effect of such change on the interests of the Company.\nDirectors Who Change Their Job Responsibility\nWhen a director’s principal occupation or business association changes substantially from that\nwhich he or she held when originally invited to join the Board (whether via job change,\nresignation, retirement or otherwise), he or she will promptly notify the NCG Committee and the\nNCG Committee will evaluate whether the change in circumstances is consistent with the\nBoard’s original intent for selecting that director and the current guidelines for membership on\nthe Board. Following its evaluation, the NCG Committee will recommend to the entire Board\nwhether to nominate the director for re-election at the next annual meeting of stockholders at\nwhich such director will be up for election. While the Board does not believe that a director\npresenting such changes should necessarily leave the Board, there should be an opportunity for\nthe Board to review the appropriateness of the director’s re-election to the Board.\nDirectors Who Serve on Additional Boards\nDirectors will advise the Chairman of the Board (the “Chairman”) and the Chair of the NGC\nCommittee in advance of accepting an invitation to serve on another public company board\n(including another special purpose acquisition company, whether or not it is yet public at the\ntime of such acceptance). Service on boards and committees of other organizations should be\nconsistent with the Company’s Code of Ethics. If a member of the Company’s Audit Committee\nserves on more than three public company audit committees, the Board will determine whether\nsuch simultaneous service impairs the director’s ability to serve effectively on the Company’s\nAudit Committee. The Board does not feel that it is appropriate to impose a formal limit on the\nnumber of public company boards on which directors may serve.\nAge and Tenure Limits\nThere are no established term limits or age limits for service on the Board.\n2\nCompliance with Applicable Laws\nEach member of the Board is expected to fully comply with all applicable laws for the entire\nduration of his or her service on the Board, whether acting in his or her capacity as a director or\notherwise (with the understanding that the activities of members of the Board, even if not acting\ndirectly on behalf of the Company, can impact the Company’s reputation), both as such laws are\nin effect as of the date of the adoption of these Guidelines and as such laws may from time to\ntime be amended hereafter, including, but not limited to, the following:\n• All applicable rules and regulations of Nasdaq.\n• All applicable rules and regulations of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.\n• The Securities Act of 1933 (15 U.S.C. §§ 77a et seq.).\n• The Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (15 U.S.C. §§ 78a et seq.).\n• The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (Pub. L. 107-204).\n• The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform & Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (Pub. L. 111-203).\n• The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977 (15 U.S.C. §§ 78dd-1 et seq.).\n• The Controlled Substances Act (21 U.S.C. §§ 801 et seq.).\n• The Delaware General Corporation Law.\nBOARD RESPONSIBILITIES\nThe business affairs of the Company are managed under the direction of the Board. The Board\nbelieves that the primary responsibilities of directors are to exercise their business judgment in\ngood faith and to act in what they reasonably believe is in the best interests of the Company and\nits stockholders. Directors must fulfill their responsibilities consistent with their fiduciary duty to\nstockholders. In forming his or her judgment, each director is entitled to rely in good faith on the\naccuracy of the records of the Company and the information, opinions, reports or statements\npresented by the Company’s officers, employees, Board committees, outside advisors and\nauditors. In discharging that obligation, directors are entitled to rely on the honesty and integrity\nof the Company’s officers, outside advisors and auditors.\nThe Board recognizes that certain of the Company’s officers and directors presently have, and in\nthe future may have, additional fiduciary or contractual obligations to other entities pursuant to\nwhich such officer or director is or will be required to present a business combination\nopportunity to such entity. Accordingly, the Board recognizes that if any of the Company’s\nofficers or directors becomes aware of a business combination opportunity that is suitable for an\nentity to which he or she has then-current fiduciary or contractual obligations, he or she may\nneed to honor those fiduciary or contractual obligations to present such business combination\nopportunity to such entity, subject to applicable fiduciary duties under Delaware law.\n3\nBOARD MEETINGS AND PROCEDURES\nMeeting Frequency\nFollowing the Company’s initial business combination, the Board will hold at least one regularly\nscheduled meeting each quarter.\nChairman of the Board\nThe Chairman will preside over all meetings of the directors and meetings of stockholders. The\nChairman will convey recommendations of the independent directors to the Board of Directors\nand will be the liaison between the Board and the management of the Company. The Chairman\nwill preview information sent to the Board as necessary.\nAgenda Items\nEach director is free to suggest agenda items to the Chairman and to raise at any meeting topics\nnot on the agenda.\nAttendance\nAll directors are expected to make reasonable best efforts to attend all meetings of the Board,\nmeetings of the committees of which they are members and any annual meeting of stockholders.\nMembers may attend Board meetings and meetings of committees of which they are members in\nperson (if applicable), by telephone or via video conference software.\nMeeting Materials and Preparation\nInformation and materials important to the Board’s understanding of topics expected to be\ndiscussed at meetings should, to the extent practical, be distributed sufficiently in advance to\npermit prior review. In the event of a meeting on short notice, or if materials would contain\nhighly confidential or sensitive information, it is recognized that written materials might not be\navailable in advance.\nEach director should be sufficiently familiar with the business of the Company, including its\nfinancial statements, and the risks and competition it faces, to facilitate active and effective\nparticipation in the deliberations of the Board and of each committee on which he or she serves.\nManagement will make appropriate personnel available to answer any questions a director may\nhave about any aspect of the Company’s business. Directors should also review the materials\nprovided by management and advisors in advance of the meetings of the Board and its\ncommittees and should arrive prepared to discuss the issues presented.\n4\nSeparate Sessions of Non-Management Directors\nNon-management directors will meet regularly, in executive session, without management. If not\na member of management, the Chairman will preside in executive session. If the Chairman is\nabsent or disqualified, the Chair of the Audit Committee will preside. If the Chair of the Audit\nCommittee is absent, an independent director designated by the other independent directors will\npreside.\nIn the event that the non-management directors include directors who are not independent, the\nCompany will, at least once a year, schedule an executive session including only independent\ndirectors.\nCOMMITTEES OF THE BOARD\nNumber, Structure and Appointment of Committee Members\nThe Board shall have at four (4) standing committees: an Audit Committee, a Compensation\nCommittee, a Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee and an Executive Committee.\nAll members of these committees, other than the Executive Committee, shall be independent\ndirectors. The Board may, from time to time, establish or maintain additional committees as\nnecessary or appropriate.\nCommittee Charters\nEach committee shall discharge its responsibilities in accordance with its own charter. Each\ncommittee charter shall set forth: the purposes, goals and responsibilities of the committee;\nqualifications for membership on the committee; and committee structure and operations. Each\ncommittee charter shall also specify procedures for committee member appointment and\nremoval, as well as require that the committee annually evaluate its performance and report its\nassessment to the NCG Committee.\nCommittee Meetings\nThe Chair of each committee shall determine the frequency and length of committee meetings.\nThe Chair of the committee, in consultation with committee members and appropriate members\nof management, shall establish the committee’s meeting agenda. Each committee member may\nrecommend items for inclusion on the committee’s meeting agenda.\nDIRECTOR ORIENTATION AND CONTINUING EDUCATION\nThe Company will provide each new director who joins the Board after the consummation of the\nCompany’s initial public offering with an orientation packet to familiarize him or her with,\namong other things, the Company’s (i) acquisition plan or, following its initial business\n5\ncombination, its business and strategic plans, (ii) significant financial, accounting and risk\nmanagement issues, (iii) compliance programs, (iv) Code of Ethics, (v) Insider Trading Policy,\n(vi) these Guidelines, (vii) principal officers and other directors and (viii) independent auditors.\nEach director is expected to be involved in continuing director education from time to time to\nenable him or her to better perform his or her duties and to recognize and deal appropriately with\nissues that arise, if prior to the Company’s initial business combination, in light of the\nCompany’s goal of finding an acquisition target and completing an initial business combination.\nDIRECTOR COMMUNICATIONS\nBoard Communication with Management and Outside Advisors\nIt is management’s job to formulate, propose and implement strategic choices and the Board’s\nrole to approve and evaluate strategic direction and results. However, the Board and management\nare better able to perform their responsibilities if there is an ongoing dialogue among the Chief\nExecutive Officer, other senior managers and Board members. To facilitate these discussions,\ndirectors will have access to the Company’s senior management team.\nBoard Communication with Stockholders\nStockholders are invited to communicate with the Board or its committees by writing to the\nSecretary of Iron Horse Acquisitions Corp. at P.O. 2506, Toluca Lake, California 91610.\nBoard Communication with Analysts, Press, Customers and Vendors\nGenerally, management should speak for the Company. Each director should refer all inquiries\nfrom institutional investors, analysts, the press, customers or vendors to the Chief Executive\nOfficer or his or her designee.\nEVALUATION AND SUCCESSION OF MANAGEMENT\nEvaluation of the Chief Executive Officer\nIn accordance with the terms of its charter, the Compensation Committee will conduct an annual\nreview of the Chief Executive Officer’s performance and report its conclusions to the\nindependent directors of the Board. The evaluation should be based on objective criteria\nincluding, but not limited to, the performance of the Company’s business, accomplishment of the\nCompany’s goal of completing an initial business combination and, thereafter, its long-term and\nshort-term strategic objectives and management development.\n6\nSuccession Planning\nFrom and after the completion of the Company’s initial business combination, the Compensation\nCommittee, in consultation with the Chief Executive Officer, shall annually report to the Board\non succession planning, which shall include protocols for emergency Chief Executive Officer\nsuccession, succession in the ordinary course and succession for other members of senior\nmanagement. The Chief Executive Officer should at all times make available his or her\nrecommendations and evaluations of any potential successors, along with a review of any\ndevelopment plans recommended for such individuals. Prior to the completion of the Company’s\ninitial business combination, any hiring or firing decisions with respect to officers of the\nCompany shall be made in consultation with and the approval of the Company’s sponsor entity,\nBengochea SPAC Sponsors I LLC.\nEVALUATION OF THE BOARD\nThe Board will conduct an annual self-evaluation to determine whether it and its committees are\nfunctioning effectively. The NCG Committee shall be responsible for overseeing this evaluation.\nIn performing its review, the committee shall solicit and consider the input of all of the directors\nthrough an evaluation process in which each director is asked to critically evaluate the\nperformance of the Board and each committee on which he or she serves. At the discretion of the\ncommittee, this review may, from time to time, include input from each director on the\nperformance of each other director. Candor shall be encouraged by ensuring that evaluations are\nand remain anonymous. This responsibility is in addition to, and shall be coordinated with, the\ncommittee’s responsibility to annually assess whether the appropriate balance of skills and\ncharacteristics are represented on the Board.\n7"

We do not have any specific business combination under consideration and we have not (nor has anyone on our behalf), directly or indirectly, contacted any prospective target business or had any substantive discussions, formal or otherwise, with respect to such a transaction. If we are unable to consummate an initial business combination within 12 months (or up to 18 months, if we extend the time to complete a business combination as described in this prospectus) from the closing of this offering, we will redeem 100% of the public shares for a pro rata portion of the trust account, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account including interest earned on the funds held in the trust account and not previously released to us for our tax obligations (less up to $100,000 for our liquidation expenses), divided by the number of then outstanding public shares, subject to applicable law and as further described herein.\n\nThis is an initial public offering of our securities. We are offering 6,000,000 units. Each unit that we are offering has a price of $10.00 and consists of one share of common stock, one warrant, and one right entitling the holder to receive one-fifth (1/5) of one share of common stock upon consummation of our initial business combination, subject to adjustment as described in this prospectus. Each warrant entitles the holder to purchase one share of common stock at a price of $11.50 per share. Each warrant will become exercisable 30 days after the completion of an initial business combination and will expire on the fifth anniversary of our completion of an initial business combination, or earlier upon redemption or liquidation. We have granted the underwriters a 45-day option to purchase up to an additional 900,000 units to cover over-allotments, if any.\n\nOur sponsor, Bengochea SPAC Sponsors I LLC (“Sponsor”), has committed that it and/or its designees will purchase from us an aggregate of 2,457,000 warrants, or “private warrants,” at $1.00 per warrant for a total purchase price of $2,457,000 in a private placement that will occur simultaneously with the consummation of this offering. It has also agreed that if the over-allotment option is exercised by the underwriters in full or in part, it and/or its designees will purchase from us additional private warrants on a pro rata basis (up to a maximum of 76,500 private warrants) at a price of $1.00 per private warrant so that at least $10.00 per share sold to the public in this offering is held in trust. These additional private warrants will be purchased in a private placement that will occur simultaneously with the purchase of units resulting from the exercise of the over-allotment option. The private warrants are identical to the warrants included in the units sold in this offering.\n\nThere is presently no public market for our units, shares of common stock, warrants or rights. We have applied to have our units listed on the Nasdaq Global Market, or NASDAQ, under the symbol “IROH” on or promptly after the date of this prospectus. The common stock, warrants and rights comprising the units will begin separate trading on the 52nd day following the date of this prospectus unless EF Hutton, division of Benchmark Investments, LLC, the representative of the underwriters, informs us of its decision to allow earlier separate trading, subject to our filing a Current Report on Form 8-K with the SEC containing an audited balance sheet reflecting our receipt of the gross proceeds of this offering and issuing a press release announcing when such separate trading will begin. We cannot guarantee that our securities will be approved for listing. Once the securities comprising the units begin separate trading, the common stock, warrants and rights will be traded on NASDAQ under the symbols “IROH,” “IROHW,” and “IROHR,” respectively.\n\nWe are an “emerging growth company” as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act and will therefore be subject to reduced public company reporting requirements.\n\n**Investing in our securities involves a high degree of risk. See “Risk Factors” beginning on page 22 of this prospectus for a discussion of information that should be considered in connection with an investment in our securities.**\n\n**Neither the Securities and Exchange Commission nor any state securities commission has approved or disapproved of these securities or determined if this prospectus is truthful or complete.

The deferred commissions will be released to EF Hutton only upon completion of an initial business combination, as described in this prospectus. The underwriters will receive compensation in addition to the underwriting discount, including 35,000 shares of common stock to be issued upon consummation of this offering, which we refer to herein as the “Representative Shares.” See “Underwriting” for further information relating to the underwriting compensation we will pay in this offering.  \n---|---  \n  \nUpon consummation of the offering, $10.00 per unit sold to the public in this offering (whether or not the underwriters’ over-allotment option has been exercised in full or in part) will be deposited into a U.S.-based trust account maintained by Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, acting as trustee. Such amount includes $2,190,000, or $0.365 per unit (or $2,518,500 if the underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised in full), payable to EF Hutton as deferred underwriting discounts and commissions. Except as described in this prospectus, these funds will not be released to us until the earlier of the completion of a business combination and our redemption of our public shares.\n\nThe underwriters are offering the units on a firm commitment basis.

As this is a summary, it does not contain all of the information that you should consider in making an investment decision. You should read this entire prospectus carefully, including the information under “Risk Factors” and our financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this prospectus, before investing. References in this prospectus to “we,” “us” or “our company” refer to Iron Horse Acquisitions Corp. References in this prospectus to our “public shares” are to shares of our common stock sold as part of the units in this offering (whether they are purchased in this offering or thereafter in the open market) and references to “public stockholders” refer to the holders of our public shares, including our officers and directors to the extent they purchase public shares, provided that their status as “public stockholders” shall only exist with respect to such public shares. References in this prospectus to our “management” or our “management team” refer to our officers and directors and references to our “initial stockholders” are to our sole stockholder prior to this offering (excluding EF Hutton), Bengochea SPAC Sponsors I LLC. The term “equity-linked securities” refers to any debt or equity securities issued in a transaction, including but not limited to a private placement of equity or debt, that are convertible, exercisable or exchangeable for shares of common stock. Unless we tell you otherwise, the information in this prospectus assumes that the underwriters will not exercise their over-allotment option._\n\n**General**\n\nWe are a blank check company incorporated as a Delaware corporation whose business purpose is to effect a merger, capital stock exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses. We have not selected any specific business combination target and we have not, nor has anyone on our behalf, engaged in any substantive discussions, directly or indirectly, with any business combination target with respect to an initial business combination with us. While we may pursue an initial business combination target in any business, industry or geographic location, we intend to search globally for target companies within the media & entertainment (“M&E”) industry with a primary focus on the United States, and in particular, on identifying attractive targets among content studios and film production, family entertainment, animation, music, gaming, e-sports, talent management, and talent-facing brands and businesses. To date, our efforts have been limited to organizational activities as well as activities related to this offering. None of our officers, directors, promoters or other affiliates has engaged in any substantive discussions on our behalf with representatives of other companies regarding the possibility of a potential business combination with us.\n\n**Overview**\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic catalyzed immense and dramatic power shifts in the vast, interconnected M&E industry, which surged to $2.2 trillion in global revenues in 2021 and is expected to reach $2.9 trillion by 2026 according to a 2022 report by PricewaterhouseCoopers. A clear driver of change in this space has been the evolution of digital consumption, especially as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, as a sustained revenue driver existing alongside traditional media consumption channels. Consumers’ embrace of the new ecosystem, as well as the recent proliferation of AI-based technologies, have helped offset revenue declines due to pandemic-related closures and has created heightened growth opportunities for media & entertainment companies.\n\nAs a result, our management team believes a number of strong and growing M&E businesses are now in a position where capital and expertise are needed to achieve their full growth potential. While some M&E business have turned to consolidation, such as MGM and Amazon, others are seeking capital and scale through alternative means that maintain independence from larger conglomerates. This includes, for instance, celebrity-owned studios and production houses with robust content pipelines seeking enhanced scale; new media entities (e.g., podcast, music rights and IP aggregators, e-Sports) looking for capital to continue their growth trajectory; undervalued talent-facing companies with solid business fundamentals, such as large agencies and PR firms; and non-traditional business divisions, such as virtual reality or animated digital production houses, trapped within traditional media companies.\n\n1  \n---  \n  \n**Business Strategy**\n\nWe believe that our team has desirable attributes that potential targets in the M&E space are seeking. Our team is a multi-cultural, multi-ethnic mixture of seasoned public-company executives, Hollywood insiders, media operators, media investors, and public markets specialists. Our team has demonstrated an extensive track record of successful acquisitions, value creation, and value enhancement, both in and outside the M&E industry, and has access to proprietary opportunities globally that can be leveraged to drive value. Our team’s proprietary connections include touchpoints to, for example, celebrity-owned studios and brands, family entertainment media, animation, talent management, and music, including direct relationships with many celebrities.\n\nOur team’s track record extends to successful experiences negotiating deals with numerous studios, franchises, agencies, distributors and streamers, as well as experience working directly with talent and production studios, navigating M&E companies through acquisition transactions (as both acquiror and acquiree), expanding product ranges for existing businesses, and providing strategic guidance to develop revenue and commercial opportunities.\n\nFurthermore, we believe our team’s diversity is especially attractive to prospective M&E targets and a key competitive advantage to achieving higher value. The U.S. M&E sector is one of the least diverse of all industries, with 92% of film executives, for instance, being white, according to a 2021 McKinsey & Company report. The same report found this has translated into substantial losses for the industry, with an estimated $10 in billion in revenue lost due to a lack of black representation alone.1\n\nWe believe our diverse management team represents a core advantage for our company and will make us more attractive to M&E targets, both in terms of addressing diversity gaps and in terms of helping prospective targets achieve higher returns once public.\n\n**Management Team**\n\nOur management team has a long history of value creation in the private and public markets, with a strong track record of creating value for stockholders including through acquiring and operating successful businesses within our target sectors. In particular, many of the companies our team has invested in or operated have been affiliated with celebrity partners. Several members of our team have unique networks of M&E relationships and extensive experience sourcing and executing transactions that will enhance our ability to identify, negotiate and complete a successful business combination and accelerate the growth trajectory and profitability of the acquired business post-business combination.\n\nWe believe that we are well positioned to identify attractive acquisition opportunities in the M&E industry, in particular because our team expects to utilize their access to industry contacts and proprietary deal flow to generate business combination opportunities. We believe that our team’s networks in particular will broaden our access to potential transaction opportunities outside typical competitive deal sourcing intermediaries. Our team is well-connected in our target sectors and, as such, we have the opportunity to be potential targets’ preferred partner for opportunities that they might think are appropriate for a SPAC acquisition.\n\nOur Chief Executive Officer, Jose Antonio Bengochea has extensive media experience.

(NASDAQ: MVIS), a public company in the lidar space, and is currently the company’s Audit Committee chairman. He has served on numerous public and private companies boards of directors as well. Mr. Turner was the Chief Financial Officer of Coinstar Inc. from 2003 until June 2009 and was CFO when the company acquired Redbox. He also previously served as Senior Vice President of Operations, Chief Financial Officer, and Treasurer of Real Networks, Inc., a digital media and technology company.\n\nKen Hertz, who is an independent director on our Board and chair of our Executive Committee, is currently a director for JUST GOODS, an advisor for the William and Jada Smith family’s (which we refer to as the Smith Family) marquee media and branded products company, Westbrook Inc, and works closely with the Smith Family Circle which is the family office of the Smith Family. Mr. Hertz is also a Senior Partner in the Los Angeles law firm of Hertz Lichtenstein Young & Polk LLP where his firm’s clients include some of the most prominent stars in pop, country, and Latin music as well as in film, TV, and sports.\n\nKosaku Yada and Miguel Melendez, who serve as our strategic advisors, are also deeply integrated with several media companies and celebrity circles. Mr. Yada is the CEO and a co-founder of Westbrook Inc., as well as a director for the Smith Family Circle, Founding CEO of the Smith Family Circle, a Board Member of JUST Goods, Inc, and Managing Partner at Dreamers VC.

Mr. Melendez’s creative partnerships have resulted in the productions of a variety of successful content in both television and film, including the Emmy Award winning Facebook Watch series, Red Table Talk, the critically acclaimed TNT series _Hawthorne_ , and the Queen Latifah Talk Show for CBS.\n\nThe past performance of our management team is not a guarantee that we will be able to identify a suitable candidate for our initial business combination or of success with respect to any business combination we may consummate. Our management team may have had acquisitions or investments that were not successful. You should not rely on the historical record of our management’s performance as indicative of our future performance.\n\n**Commitment to Diversity**\n\nAs a first generation American and native Spanish speaker, Mr. Bengochea is a passionate advocate of greater diversity in entertainment, media, and in the public markets, as well as an advocate of promoting more people of color to the executive leadership level. \n\nSeveral members of our team also champion diversity of leadership and investment. Diversity is a statistical rarity in both the public markets and in the SPAC space, and a gap in the market which the team feels they can uniquely help fill as there is demand to remedy these disparities in both the public markets and in the media and entertainment industry. Additionally, we believe our diversity at the management level further augments our team’s attractiveness to potential targets, and is another key differentiator in the SPAC marketplace. \n\n3  \n---  \n  \n**Acquisition Strategy**\n\nOur team intends to leverage its skills, expertise and network within Hollywood and other international M&E hubs to identify attractive target companies and provide guidance on the benefits of being a publicly-traded entity, including broader access to capital, increased liquidity for potential acquisitions, expanded branding opportunities in the marketplace, reputational and consumer confidence gains, and on the process of transitioning from a private company to a public registrant. We also expect to be able to source potential targets from our team’s contacts within private equity, with celebrities, with M&E investors, and with various industry leaders. Upon completion of this offering, each of our team members will communicate our acquisition criteria to their respective networks and immediately begin screening opportunities.\n\nConsistent with this strategy, we have identified parameters and criteria that we think are important and relevant in evaluating prospective target businesses. We intend to apply these parameters in evaluating prospects, although we may ultimately decide to execute our initial business combination with a company that may not match all of our initial parameters:\n\n• | **Growth Prospects** : We intend to seek companies with high growth trajectories within the M&E industry that are driven by competitive advantages that can be accelerated or magnified through a partnership with us and access to the public markets.  \n---|---  \n• | **Earnings Potential** : We intend to acquire one or more businesses that have multiple and diverse potential drivers of revenue and earnings growth and that have the potential to generate strong and stable free cash flow.  \n• | **M &E Focus**: We intend to prioritize entities within our team’s core spheres of expertise and from among our team’s networks, such as celebrity content producers and brands, family entertainment, animation, gaming, and businesses which we believe have benefited from the global pandemic and subsequent evolution of media.  \n• | **Diversity** : We intend to seek targets that can benefit from our team’s diversity and relationships in the M&E sector.This includes prospective targets who can enhance their existing business and generate value by working with individual members of our team or becoming part of our team’s network; targets who are minority owned-or-operated; and targets who wish to increase or highlight their executive diversity.  \n• | **Public Advantages** : We intend to seek target companies that are public market ready and whose leadership teams have the vision to take advantage of and appreciate the benefits of becoming a publicly-traded entity.  \n• | **Evolving Circumstance** : We intend to seek companies which are capitalizing on M&E industry shifts and trends created by various factors such as the COVID-19 pandemic, the migration from cable television to streaming services, and the proliferation of AI-based technologies.  \n• | **Valuations** : We consider ourselves to be rigorous, disciplined and valuation-centric investors, with a keen understanding of market value and successful track record. We intend to seek companies with a respectable market share and growth potential in the segments in which they operate. We expect that the COVID-19 pandemic and ongoing turbulence in the market, most notably the recent SAG-AFTRA strike and the proliferation of AI-based technologies, have continued to disrupt a number of companies within the M&E industry that may also be available at a discount.  \n  \nThese criteria are not intended to be exhaustive. Any evaluation relating to the merits of a particular initial business combination may be based, to the extent relevant, on these general guidelines, as well as other considerations, factors and criteria deemed relevant by our management in effecting our initial business combination consistent with our business objectives. In evaluating a prospective target business, we expect to conduct a due diligence review which may encompass, among other things, meetings with incumbent management and employees, document reviews, interviews of customers and suppliers, inspections of facilities, as well as reviewing financial and other information which will be made available to us.\n\nWe are not prohibited from pursuing a business combination with a company that is affiliated with our sponsor, officers or directors. In the event that we seek to complete a business combination with a business that is affiliated with our sponsor, officers or directors, we, or a committee of independent directors, will obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm or another independent entity that commonly renders valuation opinions that our business combination is fair to our stockholders from a financial point of view. In the event that we seek such a business combination, the independent members of our Board of Directors would be required to approve the transaction.\n\n4  \n---  \n  \n**Effecting a Business Combination**\n\nWe will either (1) seek stockholder approval of our initial business combination at a meeting called for such purpose at which stockholders may seek to convert their shares, regardless of whether they vote for or against the proposed business combination or don’t vote at all, into their pro rata share of the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account (net of taxes payable), or (2) provide our stockholders with the opportunity to sell their shares to us by means of a tender offer (and thereby avoid the need for a stockholder vote) for an amount equal to their pro rata share of the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account (net of taxes payable), in each case subject to the limitations described herein and in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation. The decision as to whether we will seek stockholder approval of our proposed business combination or allow stockholders to sell their shares to us in a tender offer will be made by us, solely in our discretion, and will be based on a variety of factors such as the timing of the transaction and whether the terms of the transaction would otherwise require us to seek stockholder approval. If we decide to allow stockholders to sell their shares to us in a tender offer, we will file tender offer documents with the SEC which will contain substantially the same financial and other information about the initial business combination as is required under the SEC’s proxy rules. If we seek stockholder approval, we will complete our initial business combination only if a majority of the outstanding shares of common stock voted are voted in favor of the initial business combination. We have no specified maximum percentage threshold for conversions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and even those public stockholders who vote in favor of our initial business combination have the right to convert their public shares. As a result, this may make it easier for us to consummate our initial business combination.\n\nWe will have up to 12 months from the closing of this offering to consummate an initial business combination. In addition, if we anticipate that we may not be able to consummate our initial business combination within 12 months, our Sponsor may, but are not obligated to, extend the period of time to consummate a business combination two times by an additional three months each time (for a total of up to 18 months to complete a business combination), provided that, pursuant to the terms of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and the trust agreement to be entered into between us and Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company on the date of this prospectus, the only way to extend the time available for us to consummate our initial business combination in the absence of a charter amendment, is for our insiders or their affiliates or designees, upon at least five days’ advance notice prior to the applicable deadline, to deposit into the trust account $199,800, or $229,770 if the underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised in full ($0.0333 per unit in either case), or an aggregate of $399,600, or $459,540 if the over-allotment option is exercised in full, for each three-month extension, on or prior to the date of the applicable deadline. In the event that they elected to extend the time to complete a business combination and deposited the applicable amount of money into trust, the insiders would receive a non-interest bearing, unsecured promissory note equal to the amount of any such deposit that will not be repaid in the event that we are unable to close a business combination unless there are funds available outside the trust account to do so. Such notes would either be paid upon consummation of our initial business combination, or, at the lender’s discretion, at closing of this offering. Our stockholders have approved the issuance of the private warrants upon conversion of such notes, to the extent the holder wishes to so convert such notes at the time of the consummation of our initial business combination. In the event that we receive notice from our insiders five days prior to the applicable deadline of their intent to effect an extension, we intend to issue a press release announcing such intention at least three days prior to the applicable deadline. In addition, we intend to issue a press release the day after the applicable deadline announcing whether or not the funds had been timely deposited. Our insiders and their affiliates or designees are not obligated to fund the trust account to extend the time for us to complete our initial business combination. To the extent that some, but not all, of our insiders, decide to extend the period of time to consummate our initial business combination, such insiders (or their affiliates or designees) may deposit the entire amount required. If we are unable to consummate an initial business combination within such time period, we will redeem 100% of our outstanding public shares for a pro rata portion of the funds held in the trust account, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account including interest earned on the funds held in the trust account and not previously released to us for taxes as described herein (and less up to $100,000 of interest which can be used for liquidation expenses), divided by the number of then outstanding public shares, subject to applicable law and as further described herein, and then seek to dissolve and liquidate. We expect the pro rata redemption price to be approximately $10.00 per share of common stock (regardless of whether or not the underwriters exercise their over-allotment option), without taking into account any interest earned on such funds or any increase as a result of our extending the time to consummate a business combination as described herein. However, we cannot assure you that we will in fact be able to distribute such amounts as a result of claims of creditors which may take priority over the claims of our public stockholders.\n\n5  \n---  \n  \nNASDAQ listing rules require that our initial business combination must occur with one or more target businesses that together have a fair market value of at least 80% of the assets held in the trust account at the time of the agreement to enter into the initial business combination (excluding deferred underwriting commissions and taxes payable). The fair market value of the target or targets will be determined by our Board of Directors based upon one or more standards generally accepted by the financial community (such as actual and potential sales, earnings, cash flow and/or book value). Although our Board of Directors will rely on generally accepted standards, our Board of Directors will have discretion to select the standards employed. In addition, the application of the standards generally involves a substantial degree of judgment. Accordingly, investors will be relying on the business judgment of the Board of Directors in evaluating the fair market value of the target or targets. The proxy solicitation materials or tender offer documents used by us in connection with any proposed transaction will provide public stockholders with our analysis of the fair market value of the target business, as well as the basis for our determinations. If our board is not able independently to determine the fair market value of the target business or businesses, we will obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm, or another independent entity that commonly renders valuation opinions, with respect to the satisfaction of such criteria. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if we are not then listed on NASDAQ for whatever reason, we would no longer be required to meet the foregoing 80% fair market value test.\n\nWe currently anticipate structuring a business combination to acquire 100% of the equity interests or assets of the target business or businesses. We may, however, structure our initial business combination where we merge directly with the target business or a newly formed subsidiary or where we acquire less than 100% of such interests or assets of the target business in order to meet certain objectives of the target management team or stockholders or for other reasons, but we intend to only complete such business combination if the post-transaction company owns or acquires 50% or more of the outstanding voting securities of the target or otherwise acquires a controlling interest in the target sufficient for it not to be required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended. Even if the post-transaction company owns or acquires 50% or more of the voting securities of the target, our stockholders prior to the business combination may collectively own a minority interest in the post-transaction company, depending on valuations ascribed to the target and us in the business combination transaction. For example, we could pursue a transaction in which we issue a substantial number of new shares in exchange for all of the outstanding capital stock of a target. In this case, we could acquire a 100% controlling interest in the target; however, as a result of the issuance of a substantial number of new shares, our stockholders immediately prior to our initial business combination could own less than a majority of our outstanding shares subsequent to our initial business combination. If less than 100% of the equity interests or assets of a target business or businesses are owned or acquired by the post-transaction company, the portion of such business or businesses that is owned or acquired is what will be valued for purposes of the 80% fair market value test.\n\n**Potential Conflicts**\n\nMembers of our management team will directly or indirectly own shares of our common stock, or other instruments, such as warrants, linked to our common stock, following this offering and, accordingly, may have a conflict of interest in determining whether a particular target business is an appropriate business with which to effectuate our initial business combination. Further, each of our officers and directors may have a conflict of interest with respect to evaluating a particular business combination if the retention or resignation of any such officers and directors was included by a target business as a condition to any agreement with respect to our initial business combination.\n\nOur officers and directors have agreed to present to us all target business opportunities that have a fair market value of at least 80% of the assets held in the trust account, subject to any fiduciary or contractual obligations they may have. As more fully discussed in “ _Management — Conflicts of Interest_ ,” if any of our officers or directors becomes aware of an initial business combination opportunity that might be attractive to any entity to which he has fiduciary or contractual obligations, he may be required to present such initial business combination opportunity to such entity prior to presenting such initial business combination opportunity to us. For more information on the relevant pre-existing fiduciary duties or contractual obligations of our management team, see the section titled “ _Management — Conflicts of Interest_.”\n\n6  \n---  \n  \n**Private Placements**\n\nIn November 2021, we issued an aggregate of 5,750,000 shares of our common stock, which we refer to throughout this prospectus as the “Founder’s Shares,” for an aggregate purchase price of $25,000, or approximately $0.00435 per share, to our initial stockholders (i.e., Bengochea SPAC Sponsors I LLC). In September 2022, the initial stockholders surrendered 2,875,000 shares of common stock resulting in there being an aggregate of 2,875,000 Founder’s Shares outstanding. In September 2023, the initial stockholders surrendered 943,000 shares of common stock for no consideration, resulting in there being an aggregate of 1,932,000 Founder’s Shares outstanding.\n\nThe Founder’s Shares held by our initial stockholders include an aggregate of up to 252,000 shares subject to forfeiture to the extent that the underwriters’ over-allotment option is not exercised in full or in part, so that our initial stockholders will continue to own approximately 22% of our issued and outstanding shares of common stock after this offering (assuming they do not purchase any units in this offering).\n\nWe have also agreed to issue an aggregate of 35,000 shares of common stock to EF Hutton and/or its designees upon the consummation of this offering, which we refer to throughout this prospectus as the “Representative Shares”. The Representative Shares are deemed to be underwriters’ compensation by FINRA pursuant to Rule 5110 of the FINRA Manual.\n\nIn addition, our sponsor, Bengochea SPAC Sponsors I LLC, has agreed that it will purchase from us an aggregate of 2,457,000 warrants at a price of $1.00 per warrant, for an aggregate purchase price of $2,457,000 in a private placement that will occur simultaneously with the closing of this offering. Our sponsor has also agreed that if the over-allotment option is exercised by the underwriters in full or in part, they and/or their designees will purchase from us an additional number of private warrants (up to a maximum of 76,500 additional private warrants at $1.00 per private warrant in order to maintain in the trust account at least $10.00 per unit sold to the public in this offering, without taking into account any interest earned on such funds or any increase as a result of our extending the time to consummate a business combination as described herein. These additional private warrants will be purchased in a private placement that will occur simultaneously with the purchase of units resulting from the exercise of the over-allotment option. The private warrants are identical to the warrants included in the units sold in this offering. The proceeds from the private placement of the private warrants will be added to the proceeds of this offering and placed in a U.S.-based trust account with Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company acting as trustee. If we do not complete an initial business combination within 12 months (or up to 18 months, if we extend the time to complete a business combination as described in this prospectus) from the closing of this offering, the proceeds from the sale of the private warrants will be included in the liquidating distribution to our public stockholders and the private warrants will be worthless.\n\n**Corporate Information**\n\nOur executive offices are located at P.O. Box 2506, Toluca Lake, California 91610 and our telephone number is (310) 290-5383.\n\nWe are an “emerging growth company,” as defined in Section 2(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Securities Act, as modified by the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012, or the JOBS Act. As such, we are eligible to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not “emerging growth companies” including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, or the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a non-binding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. If some investors find our securities less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our securities and the prices of our securities may be more volatile.\n\nIn addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an “emerging growth company” can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. In other words, an “emerging growth company” can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We intend to take advantage of the benefits of this extended transition period.\n\nWe will remain an emerging growth company until the earlier of (1) the last day of the fiscal year (a) following the fifth anniversary of the completion of this offering, (b) in which we have total annual gross revenue of at least $1.235 billion, or (c) in which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer, which means the market value of our common stock that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the end of that year’s second fiscal quarter; and (2) the date on which we have issued more than $1.00 billion in non-convertible debt securities during the prior three-year period. References herein to “emerging growth company” shall have the meaning associated with it in the JOBS Act.\n\nAdditionally, we are a “smaller reporting company” as defined in Item 10(f)(1) of Regulation S-K. Smaller reporting companies may take advantage of certain reduced disclosure obligations, including, among other things, providing only two years of audited financial statements. We will remain a smaller reporting company until the last day of the fiscal year in which (1) the market value of our common stock held by non-affiliates exceeds $250 million as of the end of that year’s second fiscal quarter, or (2) our annual revenues exceeded $100 million during such completed fiscal year and the market value of our common stock held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the end of that year’s second fiscal quarter.\n\n7  \n---  \n  \n**THE OFFERING**\n\nSecurities offered | 6,000,000 units (or 6,900,000 units if the underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised in full), at $10.00 per unit, each unit consisting of one share of common stock, one warrant, and one right to one-fifth (1/5) of one share of common stock.  \n---|---  \nListing of our securities and proposed symbols | We anticipate that the units, and the shares of common stock, warrants and rights once they begin separate trading, will be listed on NASDAQ under the symbols “IROHU,” “IROH,” “IROHW” and “IROHR,” respectively  \nTrading commencement and separation of common stock, warrants and rights | The units will begin trading on or promptly after the date of this prospectus. The common stock, warrants and rights comprising the units will begin separate trading on the 52nd day following the date of this prospectus unless EF Hutton informs us of its decision to allow earlier separate trading, subject to our having filed the Current Report on Form 8-K described below and having issued a press release and filed a Current Report on Form 8-K announcing when such separate trading will begin.  \nOnce the shares of common stock, warrants and rights commence separate trading, holders will have the option to continue to hold units or separate their units into the component pieces. Holders will need to have their brokers contact our transfer agent in order to separate the units into shares of common stock, warrants and rights.  \nIn no event will the common stock, warrants and rights be traded separately until we have filed a Current Report on Form 8-K with the SEC containing an audited balance sheet reflecting our receipt of the gross proceeds at the closing of this offering. We will file the Current Report on Form 8-K promptly after the closing of this offering, which is anticipated to take place three business days from the date of this prospectus. If the underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised following the initial filing of such Current Report on Form 8-K, a second or amended Current Report on Form 8-K will be filed to provide updated financial information to reflect the exercise of the underwriters’ over-allotment option. We will also include the Form 8-K, or amendment thereto, or in a subsequent Form 8-K, information indicating if EF Hutton has allowed separate trading of the common stock, warrants and rights prior to the 52nd day after the date of this prospectus.  \n  \n8  \n---  \n  \nUnits:  \n---  \nNumber outstanding before this offering | 0 units  \nNumber outstanding after this offering | 6,000,000 units(2)  \nShares of common stock:  \nNumber outstanding before this offering | 1,932,000(1)  \nNumber to be outstanding after this offering and private placement | 7,715,000(2)  \nWarrants:  \nNumber outstanding before this offering | 0 warrants  \nNumber to be sold in private placement | 2,457,000 warrants(2)  \nNumber to be outstanding after this offering and private placement | 8,457,000 warrants(2)  \nExercisability | Each warrant is exercisable for one share of common stock at a price of $11.50 per share.

The 1,932,000 Founder’s Shares includes an aggregate of up to 252,000 Founder’s Shares that are subject to forfeiture if the over-allotment option is not exercised by the underwriters in full.  \n---|---  \n(2) | Assumes the over-allotment option has not been exercised and an aggregate of 252,000 Founder’s Shares have been forfeited.  \n  \n9  \n---  \n  \nExercise price | $11.50 per share, subject to adjustment as described herein. In addition, if (x) we issue additional shares of common stock or equity-linked securities for capital raising purposes in connection with the closing of our initial business combination at an issue price or effective issue price of less than $9.20 per share of common stock (with such issue price or effective issue price to be determined in good faith by our Board of Directors, and in the case of any such issuance to our initial stockholders or their affiliates, without taking into account any Founder’s Shares held by them prior to such issuance), (y) the aggregate gross proceeds from such issuances represent more than 60% of the total equity proceeds, and interest thereon, available for the funding of our initial business combination on the date of the consummation of our initial business combination (net of redemptions), and (z) the volume weighted average trading price of our common stock during the 20 trading day period starting on the trading day prior to the day on which we consummate our initial business combination (such price, the “Market Value”) is below $9.20 per share, the exercise price of the warrants will be adjusted (to the nearest cent) to be equal to 115% of the greater of (i) the Market Value or (ii) the price at which we issue the additional shares of common stock or equity-linked securities.  \n---|---  \nNo warrants will be exercisable for cash unless we have an effective and current registration statement covering the shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of the warrants and a current prospectus relating to such shares of common stock. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if a registration statement covering the shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of the warrants is not effective within a specified period following the consummation of our initial business combination, warrant holders may, until such time as there is an effective registration statement and during any period when we shall have failed to maintain an effective registration statement, exercise warrants on a cashless basis pursuant to the exemption provided by Section 3(a)(9) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Securities Act, provided that such exemption is available. If that exemption, or another exemption, is not available, holders will not be able to exercise their warrants on a cashless basis.  \nRedemption | We may redeem the outstanding warrants in whole and not in part, at a price of $0.01 per warrant at any time after the warrants become exercisable, upon a minimum of 30 days’ prior written notice of redemption, if, and only if, the last sales price of our shares of common stock equals or exceeds $18.00 per share (as adjusted for stock splits, stock dividends, reorganizations and recapitalizations) for any 20 trading days within a 30 trading day period commencing at any time after the shares underlying the warrants have become exercisable and ending three business days before we send the notice of redemption; and if, and only if, there is a current registration statement in effect with respect to the shares of common stock underlying such warrants.  \nIf the foregoing conditions are satisfied and we issue a notice of redemption, each warrant holder can exercise his, her or its warrant prior to the scheduled redemption date. However, the price of the shares of common stock may fall below the $18.00 trigger price as well as the $11.50 warrant exercise price after the redemption notice is issued.  \nIf we call the warrants for redemption as described above, our management will have the option to require all holders that wish to exercise warrants to do so on a “cashless basis.” In such event, each holder would pay the exercise price by surrendering the warrants for that number of shares of common stock equal to the quotient obtained by dividing (x) the product of the number of shares of common stock underlying the warrants, multiplied by the difference between the exercise price of the warrants and the “fair market value” (defined below) by (y) the fair market value. The “fair market value” for this purpose shall mean the average reported last sale price of the shares of common stock for the five trading days ending on the third trading day prior to the date on which the notice of redemption is sent to the holders of warrants.  \nTerms of rights |  Each holder of a right will receive one-fifth (1/5) of one share of common stock upon consummation of our initial business combination. Except in cases where we are not the surviving company in a business combination, each holder of a public right will automatically receive one-fifth (1/5) of one share of common stock upon consummation of our initial business combination. In the event we will not be the surviving company upon completion of our initial business combination, each holder of a right will be required to affirmatively convert his, her or its rights in order to receive the one-fifth (1/5) of one share underlying each right upon consummation of the business combination. We will not issue fractional shares in connection with an exchange of rights. Fractional shares will either be rounded down to the nearest whole share or otherwise addressed in accordance with applicable law. As a result, you must hold rights in multiples of 5 in order to receive shares for all of your rights upon closing of a business combination. If we are unable to complete an initial business combination within the required time period, and we redeem the public shares for the funds held in the trust account, holders of rights will not receive any of such funds for their rights and the rights will expire worthless.  \n  \n10  \n---  \n  \nSecurities purchased, or being purchased, by insiders in connection with this offering | Our initial stockholders initially purchased an aggregate of 5,750,000 Founder’s Shares for an aggregate purchase price of $25,000. In September 2022, the initial stockholders surrendered 2,875,000 shares of common stock resulting in there being an aggregate of 2,875,000 Founder’s Shares outstanding. In September 2023, the initial stockholders surrendered 943,000 shares of common stock for no consideration, resulting in there being an aggregate of 1,932,000 Founder’s Shares outstanding. The 1,932,000 Founder’s Shares held by our initial stockholders includes an aggregate of up to 252,000 shares of common stock subject to forfeiture to the extent that the over-allotment option is not exercised by the underwriters in full or in part. Our initial stockholders will be required to forfeit only a number of Founder’s Shares necessary to continue to maintain the approximately 22% ownership interest in our shares of common stock after giving effect to the offering and exercise, if any, of the underwriters’ over-allotment option (assuming they do not purchase any units in this offering). The Founder’s Shares are identical to the shares of common stock included in the units being sold in this offering. However, our initial stockholders and officers and directors have agreed (A) to vote any shares owned by them in favor of any proposed business combination, (B) not to convert any shares in connection with a stockholder vote to approve a proposed initial business combination or sell any shares to us in a tender offer in connection with a proposed initial business combination, and (C) that the Founder’s Shares will not participate in any liquidating distributions from our trust account upon winding up if a business combination is not consummated.  \n---|---  \nOur sponsor, Bengochea SPAC Sponsors I LLC, and/or its designees will purchase simultaneously with the consummation of this offering an aggregate of 2,457,000 private warrants at $1.00 per private warrant for a total purchase price of $2,457,000 pursuant to subscription agreements with us. It has also agreed that if the over-allotment option is exercised by the underwriters in full or in part, it will purchase from us, on a pro rata basis, an additional number of private warrants (up to a maximum of 76,500 additional private warrants) at a price of $1.00 per warrant in an amount necessary to maintain in the trust account $10.00 per unit sold to the public in this offering, without taking into account any interest earned on such funds or any increase as a result of our extending the time to consummate a business combination as described herein. These additional private warrants will be purchased in a private placement that will occur simultaneously with the purchase of units resulting from the exercise of the over-allotment option. The private warrants are identical to the warrants sold in this offering.   \nAs a result, if we sought stockholder approval of a proposed transaction we could need as little as 2,142,501 of our 6,000,000 public shares (or approximately 35.7% of our public shares) to be voted in favor of the transaction in order to have such transaction approved (assuming all shares are voted, the over-allotment option is not exercised, that the initial stockholders do not purchase any units in this offering or units or shares in the after-market and that the 35,000 Representative Shares are voted in favor of the transaction). If only a minimum number of shares are voted to reach a quorum for the meeting, we could need as little as 213,751 of our 6,000,000 public shares (or approximately 3.56% of our public shares) to be voted in favor of the transaction in order to have such transaction approved (assuming the over-allotment option is not exercised, that the initial stockholders do not purchase any units in this offering or units or shares in the after-market and that the 35,000 Representative Shares are voted in favor of the transaction).  \n  \n11  \n---  \n  \nRestrictions on transfer of Founder’s Shares and private warrants | Our initial stockholders have agreed that the Founder’s Shares will be placed into an escrow account maintained in New York, New York by Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, acting as escrow agent. Subject to certain limited exceptions, these shares will not be transferred, assigned, sold or released from escrow (subject to certain limited exceptions set forth below) for a period ending on the 180-day anniversary of the date of the consummation of our initial business combination, or earlier if, subsequent to our initial business combination, we consummate a liquidation, merger, stock exchange or other similar transaction which results in all of our stockholders having the right to exchange their shares of common stock for cash, securities or other property. The limited exceptions include transfers, assignments or sales (i) to our or our initial stockholders’ officers, directors, consultants or their affiliates, (ii) to an entity’s members upon its liquidation, (iii) to relatives and trusts for estate planning purposes, (iv) by virtue of the laws of descent and distribution upon death, (v) pursuant to a qualified domestic relations order, (vi) to us for no value for cancellation in connection with the consummation of our initial business combination, or (vii) in connection with the consummation of a business combination at prices no greater than the price at which the shares were originally purchased, in each case (except for clause (vi) or with our prior consent) where the transferee agrees to the terms of the escrow agreement and to be bound by these transfer restrictions.  \n---|---  \nThe purchasers of the private warrants have also agreed not to transfer, assign or sell any of the private warrants, including the underlying shares of common stock (except in connection with the same limited exceptions that the Founder’s Shares may be transferred as described above), until after the completion of our initial business combination.  \nRepresentative Shares | At the date of the consummation of this offering, we will issue 35,000 Representative Shares to EF Hutton, the representative of the underwriters in this offering. EF Hutton has agreed not to transfer, assign or sell any such shares without our prior consent until the completion of our initial business combination. In addition, EF Hutton has agreed (i) to waive its conversion rights (or right to participate in any tender offer) with respect to such shares in connection with the completion of our initial business combination and (ii) to waive its rights to liquidating distributions from the trust account with respect to such shares if we fail to complete our initial business combination within 12 months (or up to 18 months, if we extend the time to complete a business combination as described in this prospectus) from the closing of this offering, or such longer time as approved by the majority of our stockholders.  \n  \n12  \n---  \n  \nOffering proceeds to be held in trust | $60,000,000 (or $69,000,000 if the over-allotment option is exercised in full) of the net proceeds of this offering and the proceeds we will receive from the sale of the private warrants, or $10.00 per unit sold to the public in this offering, will be placed in a U.S.-based trust account with Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company acting as trustee pursuant to an agreement to be signed on the date of this prospectus. These proceeds include $2,190,000 (or $2,518,500 if the underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised in full) in deferred underwriting commissions. Except as set forth below, the proceeds held in the trust account will not be released until the earlier of the completion of an initial business combination and our redemption of 100% of the outstanding public shares if we have not completed a business combination in the required time period. Therefore, except as set forth below, unless and until an initial business combination is consummated, the proceeds held in the trust account will not be available for our use for any expenses related to this offering or expenses which we may incur related to the investigation and selection of a target business and the negotiation of an agreement to acquire a target business.  \n---|---  \nNotwithstanding the foregoing, there can be released to us from the trust account any interest earned on the funds in the trust account that we need to pay our income or other tax obligations (excluding any excise taxes or any other similar taxes that may be imposed on the company pursuant to any current, pending or future rules or laws, including without limitation any excise tax imposed under the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 on any redemptions or stock buybacks by our company). With this exception, expenses incurred by us may be paid prior to a business combination only from the net proceeds of this offering not held in the trust account (initially estimated to be $624,000). Additionally, in order to meet our working capital needs following the consummation of this offering if the funds available to us are insufficient, our officers, directors, initial stockholders or their affiliates may, but are not obligated to, loan us funds, from time to time or at any time, on a non-interest bearing basis, in whatever amount they deem reasonable in their sole discretion. Each loan would be evidenced by a promissory note. The notes would either be paid upon consummation of our initial business combination, without interest, or, at the holder’s discretion, if there are excess proceeds, upon closing of this offering. In the event that the initial business combination does not close, we may use a portion of the working capital held outside the trust account to repay such loaned amounts, but no other proceeds from our trust account would be used for such repayment. Prior to the closing of this offering, our sponsor has agreed to loan us up to $1,500,000 to be used for a portion of the expenses of this offering. As of September 30, 2023, we had borrowed $1,203,216 (of up to $1,500,000) available to us) under the promissory note with our sponsor, of which $876,216 will be repaid in connection with the closing of the private placement warrant purchase that will occur simultaneously with the closing of this offering, leaving $327,000 to be repayable either on (a) the date on which the SPAC consummates its initial business combination or, at the holder’s discretion, if funds allow, or (b) the date on which the Company concludes the initial public offering of its securities. This loan is non-interest bearing, unsecured and will be repaid with proceeds not held in the trust account.  \nNone of the warrants may be exercised until 30 days after the consummation of a business combination and, thus, after the proceeds of the trust account have been disbursed. Accordingly, the warrant exercise price will be paid directly to us and not placed in the trust account.  \n  \n13  \n---  \n  \nLimited payments to insiders | There will be no fees, reimbursements or other cash payments paid to our officers, directors, initial stockholders or their affiliates for any services they render prior to, or in order to effectuate the consummation of, an initial business combination (regardless of the type of transaction that it is) other than the following payments, none of which will be made from the proceeds of this offering held in the trust account prior to the completion of our initial business combination:  \n---|---  \n• | Repayment of up to an aggregate of up to $1,500,000 in loans made to us by our sponsor to cover offering-related and organizational expenses;  \n• | payment of a total of $12,000 per month to our sponsor in exchange for management support, administrative, office space, and other services. We will cease paying these monthly fees 12 months from the date of the closing of this offering;  \n• | reimbursement of out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with certain activities on our behalf, such as identifying and investigating possible business targets and business combinations;   \n• | repayment of non-interest-bearing extension loans which may be made by our sponsor or an affiliate of our sponsor or certain of our officers and directors to extend the time we have to consummate an intended initial business combination. Up to $250,000 of such loans may be convertible into warrants, at a price of $1.00 per warrant, at the option of the lender. The warrants would be identical to the private placement warrants, including as to exercise price, exercisability and exercise period; and  \n• | repayment of non-interest-bearing loans which may be made by our sponsor or an affiliate of our sponsor or certain of our officers and directors to finance transaction costs in connection with an intended initial business combination. Except as set forth above, the terms of such working capital loans by our sponsor or its affiliates, or our officers and directors, if any, have not been determined and no written agreements exist with respect to such loans.  \nOur audit committee will review and approve all reimbursements and payments made to our officers, directors, initial stockholders or our or their respective affiliates, with any interested director abstaining from such review and approval.  \n  \n14  \n---  \n  \nStockholder approval of, or tender offer in connection with, initial business combination | In connection with any proposed initial business combination, we will either (1) seek stockholder approval of such initial business combination at a meeting called for such purpose at which stockholders may seek to convert their shares, regardless of whether they vote for or against the proposed business combination or don’t vote at all, into their pro rata share of the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account (net of taxes payable), or (2) provide our stockholders with the opportunity to sell their shares to us by means of a tender offer (and thereby avoid the need for a stockholder vote) for an amount equal to their pro rata share of the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account (net of taxes payable), in each case subject to the limitations described herein and in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation. If we determine to engage in a tender offer, such tender offer will be structured so that each stockholder may tender all of his, her or its shares rather than some pro rata portion of his, her or its shares. The decision as to whether we will seek stockholder approval of a proposed business combination or will allow stockholders to sell their shares to us in a tender offer will be made by us, solely in our discretion, and will be based on a variety of factors such as the timing of the transaction and whether the terms of the transaction would otherwise require us to seek stockholder approval. If we determine to allow stockholders to sell their shares to us in a tender offer, we will file tender offer documents with the SEC which will contain substantially the same financial and other information about the initial business combination as is required under the SEC’s proxy rules. If we seek stockholder approval, we will complete our initial business combination only if a majority of the outstanding shares of common stock voted are voted in favor of the initial business combination. We have no specified maximum percentage threshold for conversions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and even those public stockholders who vote in favor of our initial business combination have the right to convert their public shares. As a result, this may make it easier for us to consummate our initial business combination.  \n---|---  \nIf we seek to consummate an initial business combination with a target business that imposes any type of working capital closing condition or requires us to have a minimum amount of funds available from the trust account upon consummation of such initial business combination, this may force us to seek third party financing which may not be available on terms acceptable to us or at all. As a result, we may not be able to consummate such initial business combination and we may not be able to locate another suitable target within the applicable time period, if at all.  \nOur initial stockholders and officers and directors and their affiliates have agreed (i) to vote any shares owned by them in favor of any proposed business combination, (ii) not to convert any shares in connection with a stockholder vote to approve a proposed initial business combination and (iii) not to sell any shares to us in a tender offer in connection with any proposed business combination.  \nNone of our initial stockholders, officers, directors or their affiliates has indicated any intention to purchase units in this offering or any units or shares of common stock from persons in the open market or in private transactions. However, if we hold a meeting to approve a proposed business combination and a significant number of stockholders vote, or indicate an intention to vote, against a proposed business combination, our initial stockholders, officers, directors or their affiliates could make such purchases in the open market or in private transactions in order to reduce the number of shares being submitted for redemption in connection with such vote. Notwithstanding the foregoing, our officers, directors, initial stockholders and their affiliates will not make purchases of shares of common stock if the purchases would violate Section 9(a)(2) or Rule 10b-5 of the Exchange Act, which are rules designed to prevent potential manipulation of a company’s stock.  \n  \n15  \n---  \n  \nConversion rights | In connection with any stockholder meeting called to approve a proposed initial business combination, each public stockholder will have the right, regardless of whether he is voting for or against such proposed business combination or does not vote at all, to demand that we convert his shares into a pro rata share of the trust account. The per-share amount we will distribute to investors who properly convert their shares will not be reduced by the deferred underwriting commissions we will pay to EF Hutton.  \n---|---  \nWe may require public stockholders, whether they are a record holder or hold their shares in “street name,” to either (i) physically tender their certificates to our transfer agent or (ii) deliver their shares to the transfer agent electronically using Depository Trust Company’s DWAC (Deposit/Withdrawal At Custodian) System, at the holder’s option, in each case prior to a date set forth in the tender offer documents or proxy materials sent in connection with the proposal to approve the business combination. There is a nominal cost associated with this tendering process and the act of certificating the shares or delivering them through the DWAC system. The transfer agent will typically charge the tendering broker a nominal amount and it would be up to the broker whether or not to pass this cost on to the converting holder.  \nLiquidation if no business combination | We will have up to 12 months from the closing of this offering to consummate an initial business combination. However, if we anticipate that we may not be able to consummate our initial business combination within 12 months, our Sponsor may, but are not obligated to, extend the period of time to consummate a business combination two times by an additional three months each time (for a total of up to 18 months to complete a business combination), provided that, pursuant to the terms of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and the trust agreement to be entered into between us and Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company on the date of this prospectus, the only way to extend the time available for us to consummate our initial business combination in the absence of a charter amendment is for our insiders or their affiliates or designees, upon not less than five days’ advance notice prior to the applicable deadline, to deposit into the trust account $199,800, or $229,770 if the underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised in full ($0.0333 per unit in either case), or an aggregate of $399,600, or $459,540 if the over-allotment option is exercised in full, for each three-month extension, on or prior to the date of the applicable deadline. In the event that they elected to extend the time to complete a business combination and deposited the applicable amount of money into trust, the insiders would receive a non-interest bearing, unsecured promissory note equal to the amount of any such deposit that will not be repaid in the event that we are unable to close a business combination unless there are funds available outside the trust account to do so. Such notes would either be paid upon consummation of our initial business combination, or, at the lender’s discretion, repaid upon consummation of our initial public offering. Our stockholders have approved the issuance of the private warrants upon conversion of such notes, to the extent the holder wishes to so convert such notes at the time of the consummation of our initial business combination. In the event that we receive notice from our insiders five days prior to the applicable deadline of their intent to effect an extension, we intend to issue a press release announcing such intention at least three days prior to the applicable deadline. In addition, we intend to issue a press release the day after the applicable deadline announcing whether or not the funds had been timely deposited. Our insiders and their affiliates or designees are not obligated to fund the trust account to extend the time for us to complete our initial business combination. To the extent that some, but not all, of our insiders, decide to extend the period of time to consummate our initial business combination, such insiders (or their affiliates or designees) may deposit the entire amount required.  \n  \n16  \n---  \n  \nIf we are unable to complete an initial business combination by 12 months (or up to 18 months, if we extend the time to complete a business combination as described above) from the closing of this offering, we will (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up, (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten business days thereafter, redeem 100% of the outstanding public shares, at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account, including any interest not previously released to us (net of taxes payable and up to $100,000 of interest that may be released to us to pay liquidation expenses), divided by the number of then outstanding public shares, which redemption will completely extinguish public stockholders’ rights as stockholders (including the right to receive further liquidation distributions, if any), subject to applicable law, and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of our remaining stockholders and our Board of Directors, dissolve and liquidate, subject (in the case of (ii) and (iii) above) to our obligations under Delaware law to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable law. We cannot assure you that we will have funds sufficient to pay or provide for all creditors’ claims. Although we are required to have all third parties (including any vendors or other entities we engage after this offering) and any prospective target businesses enter into agreements with us waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to any monies held in the trust account, there is no guarantee that they will execute such agreements. There is also no guarantee that the third parties would not challenge the enforceability of these waivers and bring claims against the trust account for monies owed them. Bengochea SPAC Sponsors I LLC, an entity affiliated with Jose A. Bengochea, our Chief Executive Officer, has agreed that it will be liable to ensure that the proceeds in the trust account are not reduced below $10.00 per share (or any increased amount as a result of our extending the time to consummate a business combination as described herein) by the claims of target businesses or claims of vendors or other entities that are owed money by us for services rendered or contracted for or products sold to us. The agreement entered into by Bengochea SPAC Sponsors I LLC specifically provides for two exceptions to the indemnity given: Bengochea SPAC Sponsors I LLC will have no liability (1) as to any claimed amounts owed to a target business or vendor or other entity who has executed an agreement with us waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind they may have in or to any monies held in the trust account, or (2) as to any claims for indemnification by the underwriters of this offering against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act. MaloneBailey, LLP, our independent registered public accounting firm, and the underwriters of the offering, will not execute agreements with us waiving such claims to the monies held in the trust account. We have not independently verified whether Bengochea SPAC Sponsors I LLC has sufficient funds to satisfy its indemnity obligations, we have not asked it to reserve for such obligations and we do not believe it has any significant liquid assets. Accordingly, we believe it is unlikely that it will be able to satisfy its indemnification obligations if it is required to do so.  \n---  \nThe holders of the Founder’s Shares and Representative Shares will not participate in any redemption distribution from our trust account with respect to such shares.  \n  \n17  \n---  \n  \nIf we are unable to consummate an initial business combination and we expend all of the net proceeds of this offering not deposited in the trust account, we expect that the initial per-share redemption price will be approximately $10.00 (which is equal to the anticipated aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account excluding interest earned on the funds held in the trust account without taking into account any interest earned on such funds or any increase as a result of our extending the time to consummate a business combination as described herein). The proceeds deposited in the trust account could, however, become subject to claims of our creditors that are in preference to the claims of our stockholders. In addition, if we are forced to file a bankruptcy case or an involuntary bankruptcy case is filed against us that is not dismissed, the proceeds held in the trust account could be subject to applicable bankruptcy law, and may be included in our bankruptcy estate and subject to the claims of third parties with priority over the claims of our stockholders. Therefore, the actual per-share redemption price may be less than $10.00 without taking into account any interest earned on such funds or any increase as a result of our extending the time to consummate a business combination as described herein.  \n---  \nEF Hutton has agreed to waive its rights to the deferred underwriting commission held in the trust account in the event we do not complete our initial business combination and subsequently liquidate and, in such event, such amounts will be included with the funds held in the trust account that will be available to fund the redemption of our public shares.  \nWe will pay the costs of any liquidation from the net proceeds from this offering and the private placement held out of trust and the up to $100,000 of interest income available to us from the trust account to pay for our liquidation expenses.  \n  \n18  \n---  \n  \n**Summary of Risk Factors**\n\nAn investment in our securities involves a high degree of risk. The occurrence of one or more of the events or circumstances described in the section titled “ _Risk Factors_ ,” alone or in combination with other events or circumstances, may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results. In that event, the trading price of our securities could decline, and you could lose all or part of your investment. Such risks include, but are not limited to:\n\n• | We may not be able to complete our initial business combination within 12 months (or up to 18 months, if we extend the time to complete a business combination as described in this prospectus) after the closing of this offering, in which case we would cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up, and we would redeem our public shares for a pro rata portion of the funds in the trust account, and we would liquidate. In such event, our rights and warrants would expire worthless.  \n---|---  \n• | Your only opportunity to affect the investment decision regarding a potential business combination may be limited to the exercise of your right to convert your shares to cash.  \n---|---  \n• | Our initial stockholders will control a substantial interest in us and thus may influence certain actions requiring a stockholder vote.  \n---|---  \n• | The ability of our public stockholders to exercise their conversion rights or sell their shares to us in a tender offer may not allow us to effectuate the most desirable business combination or optimize our capital structure.  \n---|---  \n• | We may require stockholders who wish to convert their shares in connection with a proposed business combination to comply with specific requirements for conversion that may make it more difficult for them to exercise their conversion rights.  \n---|---  \n• | We may issue additional shares of capital stock or debt securities to complete a business combination, which would reduce the equity interest of our stockholders and likely cause a change in control of our ownership.  \n---|---  \n• | We may be unable to obtain additional financing, if required, to complete a business combination or to fund the operations and growth of the target business.  \n---|---  \n• | We may not obtain a fairness opinion with respect to the target business that we seek to acquire and therefore you may be relying solely on the judgment of our Board of Directors in approving a proposed business combination.  \n---|---  \n• | Resources could be wasted in researching acquisitions that are not completed, which could materially adversely affect subsequent attempts to locate and acquire or merge with another business.  \n---|---  \n• | Our search for a business combination, and any target business with which we ultimately consummate a business combination, may be materially adversely affected by public health concerns, rising interest rates, and other current or future events, including the status of debt and equity markets.  \n---|---  \n• | We may have a limited ability to assess the management of a prospective target business and, as a result, may affect our initial business combination with a target business whose management may not have the skills, qualifications or abilities to manage a public company.  \n---|---  \n• | If we consummate a business combination with a target company with assets located outside of the United States, our results of operations and prospects could be subject to the economic, political, and legal policies, developments, and conditions in the country in which we operate. Further, exchange rate fluctuations and currency policies may cause our ability to succeed in the international markets to be diminished.  \n---|---  \n• | Our officers and directors presently have fiduciary or contractual obligations to other entities and, accordingly, may have conflicts of interest in determining to which entity a particular business opportunity should be presented.  \n---|---  \n  \n19  \n---  \n  \n• | Our officers and directors may have interests in a potential business combination that are different than yours, which may create conflicts of interest.  \n---|---  \n• | The determination of the offering price of our units and the size of this offering is more arbitrary than the pricing of securities and size of an offering of an operating company in a particular industry.  \n---|---  \n• | You will experience immediate and substantial dilution from the purchase of our common stock.  \n---|---  \n• | We may amend the terms of the warrants in a manner that may be adverse to holders of public warrants with the approval by a majority of the then outstanding warrants.  \n---|---  \n• | We may redeem your unexpired warrants prior to their exercise at a time that is disadvantageous to you, thereby making your warrants worthless.  \n---|---  \n• | There is currently no market for our securities and a market for our securities may not develop, which would adversely affect the liquidity and price of our securities.  \n---|---  \n• | NASDAQ may delist our securities from trading on its exchange, which could limit investors’ ability to make transactions in our securities and subject us to additional trading restrictions.  \n---|---  \n• | If third parties bring claims against us, and if our directors decide not to enforce the indemnification obligations of Bengochea SPAC Sponsors I LLC, or if Bengochea SPAC Sponsors I LLC does not have the funds to indemnify us, the proceeds held in the trust account could be reduced and the per-share redemption amount received by stockholders may be less than $10.00 per share without taking into account any interest earned on such funds or any increase as a result of our extending the time to consummate a business combination as described herein.  \n---|---  \n• | Provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws and Delaware law may inhibit a takeover of us, which could limit the price investors might be willing to pay in the future for our common stock and could entrench management.  \n---|---  \n• | Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation will provide, subject to limited exceptions, that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware will be the sole and exclusive forum for certain stockholder litigation matters, which could limit our stockholders’ ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers, employees or stockholders.  \n---|---  \n• | Our stockholders may be held liable for claims by third parties against us to the extent of distributions received by them upon redemption of their shares.  \n---|---  \n• | We have no operating history, and, accordingly, you have no basis on which to evaluate our ability to achieve our business objective.  \n---|---  \n• | If we are deemed to be an investment company under the Investment Company Act, we may be required to institute burdensome compliance requirements and our activities may be restricted, which may make it difficult for us to complete our initial business combination.  \n---|---  \n• | We are an emerging growth company and smaller reporting company within the meaning of the Securities Act, and if we take advantage of certain exemptions from disclosure requirements available to emerging growth companies, this could make our securities less attractive to investors and may make it more difficult to compare our performance with other public companies.  \n---|---  \n• | Cyber incidents or attacks directed at us could result in information theft, data corruption, operational disruption and/or financial loss.  \n---|---  \n• | This offering is not being conducted in compliance with Rule 419 promulgated under the Securities Act. Accordingly, you will not be entitled to protections normally afforded to investors in Rule 419 blank check offerings. For additional information concerning how Rule 419 blank check offerings differ from this offering, please see “Proposed Business — Comparison of This Offering to Those of Blank Check Companies Subject to Rule 419.”  \n---|---  \n  \n20  \n---  \n  \n**SUMMARY FINANCIAL DATA**\n\nThe following table summarizes the relevant financial data for our business and should be read with our financial statements, which are included in this prospectus. We have not had any significant operations to date, and accordingly only balance sheet data is presented.\n\n**September 30, 2023**  \n---  \n**Actual** | **As Adjusted(1)**  \nWorking capital (deficiency) | $ | (1,419,166  | ) | $ | 146,640  \nTotal assets | $ | 941,806 | $ | 60,146,640  \nTotal liabilities | $ | 1,419,166 | $ | 2,276,417  \nValue of common stock subject to possible conversion/tender | $ | — | $ | 60,000,000  \nStockholders’ (deficit) | $ | (477,360 | ) | $ | (2,129,777 | )  \n(1) | The “as adjusted” information gives effect to the sale of the units we are offering and the sale of the private warrants including the application of the related gross proceeds and the payment of the estimated remaining costs from such sale and the repayment of the accrued and other liabilities required to be repaid, and assumes no exercise of the underwriters’ over-allotment option in the aggregate of 252,000 Founder’s Shares that have been forfeited as a result thereof.  \n---|---  \n  \nThe “as adjusted” total assets amount includes $60,000,000 to be held in the trust account, plus $624,000 in cash to be held outside the trust account (after giving effect to estimated offering costs) less $477,360 of actual stockholders equity as of September 30, 2023.\n\n21  \n---  \n  \n**RISK FACTORS**\n\n**_An investment in our securities involves a high degree of risk. You should consider carefully the risks described below, which we believe represent the material risks related to the offering, together with the other information contained in this prospectus, before making a decision to invest in our units. This prospectus also contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in the forward-looking statements as a result of specific factors, including the risks described below._**\n\n**Risks Relating to Searching for and Consummating a Business Combination**\n\n**_If we are unable to consummate a business combination, our public stockholders may be forced to wait more than 12 months before receiving distributions from the trust account, and our rights will expire worthless._**\n\nWe have 12 months (or up to 18 months, if we extend the time to complete a business combination as described in this prospectus) from the closing of this offering in which to complete a business combination. We have no obligation to return funds to investors prior to such date unless we consummate a business combination prior thereto and only then in cases where investors have sought to convert or sell their shares to us. Only after the expiration of this full time period will public security holders be entitled to distributions from the trust account if we are unable to complete a business combination. Accordingly, investors’ funds may be unavailable to them until after such date and to liquidate your investment, public security holders may be forced to sell their public shares or warrants, potentially at a loss.\n\nAdditionally, if we are unable to complete an initial business combination within the required timeframe and therefore are forced to dissolve and liquidate, the holders of our rights to receive one-fifth (1/5) of one share of common stock upon consummation of our initial business combination will not receive any of such funds with respect to their rights, nor will they receive any distribution from our assets held outside of the trust account with respect to such rights, and their rights will expire worthless.\n\n**_The requirement that we complete an initial business combination within 12 months from the closing of this offering may give potential target businesses leverage over us in negotiating a business combination._**\n\nWe have 12 months (or up to 18 months, if we extend the time to complete a business combination as described in this prospectus) from the closing of this offering to complete an initial business combination. Any potential target business with which we enter into negotiations concerning a business combination will be aware of this requirement. Consequently, such target business may obtain leverage over us in negotiating a business combination, knowing that if we do not complete a business combination with that particular target business, we may be unable to complete a business combination with any other target business. This risk will increase as we get closer to the time limit referenced above.\n\n**_Our public stockholders may not be afforded an opportunity to vote on our proposed business combination._**\n\nWe will either (1) seek stockholder approval of our initial business combination at a meeting called for such purpose at which public stockholders may seek to convert their shares, regardless of whether they vote for or against the proposed business combination or don’t vote at all, into their pro rata share of the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account (net of taxes payable), or (2) provide our public stockholders with the opportunity to sell their shares to us by means of a tender offer (and thereby avoid the need for a stockholder vote) for an amount equal to their pro rata share of the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account (net of taxes payable), in each case subject to the limitations described elsewhere in this prospectus. Accordingly, it is possible that we will consummate our initial business combination even if holders of a majority of our public shares do not approve of the business combination we consummate. The decision as to whether we will seek stockholder approval of a proposed business combination or will allow stockholders to sell their shares to us in a tender offer will be made by us, solely in our discretion, and will be based on a variety of factors such as the timing of the transaction and whether the terms of the transaction would otherwise require us to seek stockholder approval. For instance, NASDAQ rules currently allow us to engage in a tender offer in lieu of a stockholder meeting but would still require us to obtain stockholder approval if we were seeking to issue more than 22% of our outstanding shares to a target business as consideration in any business combination. Therefore, if we were structuring a business combination that required us to issue more than 22% of our outstanding shares, we would seek stockholder approval of such business combination instead of conducting a tender offer.\n\n22  \n---  \n  \n**_Our initial stockholders will control a substantial interest in us and thus may influence certain actions requiring a stockholder vote._**\n\nUpon consummation of our offering, our initial stockholders will own approximately 22% of our issued and outstanding shares of common stock (assuming they do not purchase any units in this offering). None of our officers, directors, initial stockholders or their affiliates has indicated any intention to purchase units in this offering or any units or shares of common stock from persons in the open market or in private transactions. However, our officers, directors, initial stockholders or their affiliates could determine in the future to make such purchases in the open market or in private transactions, to the extent permitted by law, in order to reduce the number of stockholders seeking to tender their shares to us. In connection with any vote for a proposed business combination, our initial stockholders, as well as all of our officers and directors, have agreed to vote the shares of common stock owned by them immediately before this offering as well as any shares of common stock acquired in this offering or in the aftermarket in favor of such proposed business combination. As a result, if we sought stockholder approval of a proposed transaction we could need as little as 2,142,501 of our 6,000,000 public shares (or approximately 35.7% of our public shares) to be voted in favor of the transaction in order to have such transaction approved (assuming all shares are voted, the over-allotment option is not exercised, that the initial stockholders do not purchase any units in this offering or units or shares in the after-market and that the 35,000 Representative Shares are voted in favor of the transaction). If only a minimum number of shares are voted to reach a quorum for the meeting, we could need as little as 213,751 of our 6,000,000 public shares (or approximately 3.56% of our public shares) to be voted in favor of the transaction in order to have such transaction approved (assuming the over-allotment option is not exercised, that the initial stockholders do not purchase any units in this offering or units or shares in the after-market and that the 35,000 Representative Shares are voted in favor of the transaction).\n\nOur Board of Directors is and will be divided into three classes, each of which will generally serve for a term of three years with only one class of directors being elected in each year. It is unlikely that there will be an annual meeting of stockholders to elect new directors prior to the consummation of a business combination, in which case all of the current directors will continue in office until at least the consummation of the business combination. Accordingly, you may not be able to exercise your voting rights under corporate law for up to 12 months (or up to 18 months, if we extend the time to complete a business combination as described in this prospectus). If there is an annual meeting, as a consequence of our “staggered” board of directors, only a minority of the board of directors will be considered for election and our initial stockholders, because of their ownership position, will have considerable influence regarding the outcome. Accordingly, our initial stockholders will continue to exert control at least until the consummation of a business combination.\n\n**_If we determine to change our acquisition criteria or guidelines, many of the disclosures contained in this prospectus would not be applicable and you would be investing in our company without any basis on which to evaluate the potential target business we may acquire._**\n\nWe could seek to deviate from the acquisition criteria or guidelines disclosed in this prospectus although we have no current intention to do so. Accordingly, investors may be making an investment in our company without any basis on which to evaluate the potential target business we may acquire. Regardless of whether or not we deviate from the acquisition criteria or guidelines in connection with any proposed business combination, investors will always be given the opportunity to convert their shares or sell them to us in a tender offer in connection with any proposed business combination as described in this prospectus.\n\n**_Review of any proposed business combination with a U.S. target by a U.S. government entity such as the Committee on Foreign Investment could delay or restrict our ability to complete our initial business combination._**\n\nOur sponsor, our officers, all but one of our directors, and a majority of the holders of the equity interests in our sponsor are U.S. persons, and we and our sponsor are organized under U.S. state law and have principal places of business in the United States. Accordingly, in our view, neither we nor our sponsor should be deemed to have substantial ties with a non-U.S. person at the time of this offering. However, it is possible that one or more U.S. regulatory authorities could take a different view, particularly if the composition of our sponsor’s equity base or the makeup of our management team changes between now and the time of our initial business combination. If any proposed business combination becomes subject to review by a U.S. regulatory authority, such as the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) or pursuant to the Hart–Scott–Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended, the review and approval process could delay our ability to consummate our initial business combination by the deadline set forth in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and, accordingly, require us to liquidate.\n\n**_Since we have not yet selected a particular industry or target business with which to complete a business combination, we are unable to currently ascertain the merits or risks of the industry or business in which we may ultimately operate._**\n\nWhile we may pursue an initial business combination target in any business, industry or geographic location, we intend to search globally for target companies within the M&E industry with a primary focus on the United States, and in particular on identifying attractive targets among content studios and film production, family entertainment, animation, music, gaming, e-sports, talent management, talent-facing brands and businesses. Accordingly, there is no current basis for you to evaluate the possible merits or risks of the particular industry in which we may ultimately operate or the target business which we may ultimately acquire. To the extent we complete a business combination with a financially unstable company or an entity in its development stage, we may be affected by numerous risks inherent in the business operations of those entities. If we complete a business combination with an entity in an industry characterized by a high level of risk, we may be affected by the currently unascertainable risks of that industry. Although our management will endeavor to evaluate the risks inherent in a particular industry or target business, we cannot assure you that we will properly ascertain or assess all of the significant risk factors. We also cannot assure you that an investment in our units will not ultimately prove to be less favorable to investors in this offering than a direct investment, if an opportunity were available, in a target business.\n\n23  \n---  \n  \n**_The ability of our stockholders to exercise their conversion rights or sell their shares to us in a tender offer may not allow us to effectuate the most desirable business combination or optimize our capital structure._**\n\nIf our business combination requires us to use substantially all of our cash to pay the purchase price, because we will not know how many stockholders may exercise conversion rights or seek to sell their shares to us in a tender offer, we may either need to reserve part of the trust account for possible payment upon such conversion, or we may need to arrange third party financing to help fund our business combination. In the event that the acquisition involves the issuance of our stock as consideration, we may be required to issue a higher percentage of our stock to make up for a shortfall in funds. Raising additional funds to cover any shortfall may involve dilutive equity financing or incurring indebtedness at higher than desirable levels. This may limit our ability to effectuate the most attractive business combination available to us. The amount of the deferred underwriting commissions payable to EF Hutton will not be adjusted for any shares that are converted in connection with an initial business combination. The per-share amount we will distribute to stockholders who properly exercise their conversion rights will not be reduced by the deferred underwriting commission and after such conversion, the per-share value of shares held by non-converting stockholders will reflect our obligation to pay the deferred underwriting commissions.\n\n**_In connection with any vote to approve a business combination, we will offer each public stockholder the option to vote in favor of a proposed business combination and still seek conversion of his, her or its shares._**\n\nIn connection with any vote to approve a business combination, we will offer each public stockholder (but not our initial stockholders, officers and directors) the right to have his, her or its shares of common stock converted to cash (subject to the limitations described elsewhere in this prospectus) regardless of whether such stockholder votes for or against such proposed business combination or does not vote at all. The ability to seek conversion while voting in favor of our proposed business combination may make it more likely that we will consummate a business combination.\n\n**_We do not have a specified maximum conversion threshold. The absence of such a conversion threshold may make it easier for us to consummate a business combination even where a substantial number of public stockholders seek to convert their shares to cash in connection with the vote on the business combination._**\n\nWe have no specified percentage threshold for conversion in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation. As a result, we may be able to consummate a business combination even though a substantial number of our public stockholders do not agree with the transaction and have converted their shares.\n\n**_In connection with any stockholder meeting called to approve a proposed initial business combination, we may require stockholders who wish to convert their shares in connection with a proposed business combination to comply with specific requirements for conversion that may make it more difficult for them to exercise their conversion rights prior to the deadline for exercising their rights._**\n\nIn connection with any stockholder meeting called to approve a proposed initial business combination, each public stockholder will have the right, regardless of whether he is voting for or against such proposed business combination or does not vote at all, to demand that we convert his shares into a pro rata share of the trust account as of two business days prior to the consummation of the initial business combination. We may require public stockholders who wish to convert their shares in connection with a proposed business combination to either (i) tender their certificates to our transfer agent or (ii) deliver their shares to the transfer agent electronically using the Depository Trust Company’s DWAC (Deposit/Withdrawal At Custodian) System, at the holders’ option, in each case prior to a date set forth in the tender offer documents or proxy materials sent in connection with the proposal to approve the business combination. In order to obtain a physical stock certificate, a stockholder’s broker and/or clearing broker, DTC and our transfer agent will need to act to facilitate this request. It is our understanding that stockholders should generally allot at least two weeks to obtain physical certificates from the transfer agent. However, because we do not have any control over this process or over the brokers or DTC, it may take significantly longer than two weeks to obtain a physical stock certificate. While we have been advised that it takes a short time to deliver shares through the DWAC System, we cannot assure you of this fact. Accordingly, if it takes longer than we anticipate for stockholders to deliver their shares, stockholders who wish to convert may be unable to meet the deadline for exercising their conversion rights and thus may be unable to convert their shares.\n\n24  \n---  \n  \n**_If, in connection with any stockholder meeting called to approve a proposed business combination, we require public stockholders who wish to convert their shares to comply with specific requirements for conversion, such converting stockholders may be unable to sell their securities when they wish to in the event that the proposed business combination is not approved._**\n\nIf we require public stockholders who wish to convert their shares to comply with specific requirements for conversion and such proposed business combination is not consummated, we will promptly return such certificates to the tendering public stockholders. Accordingly, investors who attempted to convert their shares in such a circumstance will be unable to sell their securities after the failed acquisition until we have returned their securities to them. The market price for our shares of common stock may decline during this time and you may not be able to sell your securities when you wish to, even while other stockholders that did not seek conversion may be able to sell their securities.\n\n**_Because of our structure, other companies may have a competitive advantage and we may not be able to consummate an attractive business combination._**\n\nWe expect to encounter intense competition from entities other than blank check companies having a business objective similar to ours, including venture capital funds, leveraged buyout funds and operating businesses competing for acquisitions. Many of these entities are well established and have extensive experience in identifying and effecting business combinations directly or through affiliates. Many of these competitors possess greater technical, human and other resources than we do and our financial resources will be relatively limited when contrasted with those of many of these competitors. While we believe that there are numerous potential target businesses that we could acquire with the net proceeds of this offering, our ability to compete in acquiring certain sizable target businesses will be limited by our available financial resources. This inherent competitive limitation gives others an advantage in pursuing the acquisition of certain target businesses. Furthermore, seeking stockholder approval or engaging in a tender offer in connection with any proposed business combination may delay the consummation of such a transaction. Additionally, our outstanding warrants, as well as the rights to one-fifth (1/5) of one share of common stock upon consummation of our initial business combination included within our units, and the future dilution they potentially represent, may not be viewed favorably by certain target businesses. Any of the foregoing may place us at a competitive disadvantage in successfully negotiating a business combination.\n\n**_Because we must furnish our stockholders with target business financial statements prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles or international financial reporting standards, we will not be able to complete a business combination with prospective target businesses unless their financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles or international financial reporting standards._**\n\nThe federal proxy rules require that a proxy statement with respect to a vote on a business combination meeting certain financial significance tests include historical and/or pro forma financial statement disclosure in periodic reports. These financial statements may be required to be prepared in accordance with, or be reconciled to, accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, or GAAP, or international financial reporting standards, or IFRS, depending on the circumstances, and the historical financial statements may be required to be audited in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), or PCAOB. We will include the same financial statement disclosure in connection with any tender offer documents we use, whether or not they are required under the tender offer rules. Additionally, to the extent we furnish our stockholders with financial statements prepared in accordance with IFRS, such financial statements will likely need to be audited in accordance with U.S. GAAP at the time of the consummation of the business combination. These financial statement requirements may limit the pool of potential target businesses we may acquire.\n\n**_A provision of our warrant agreement may make it more difficult for use to consummate an initial business combination._**\n\nUnder the terms of our warrants, if (x) we issue additional shares of common stock or equity-linked securities for capital raising purposes in connection with the closing of our initial business combination at an issue price or effective issue price of less than $9.20 per share of common stock (with such issue price or effective issue price to be determined in good faith by our Board of Directors, and in the case of any such issuance to our initial stockholders or their affiliates, without taking into account any Founder’s Shares held by them prior to such issuance) (the “Newly Issued Price”), (y) the aggregate gross proceeds from such issuances represent more than 60% of the total equity proceeds, and interest thereon, available for the funding of our initial business combination on the date of the consummation of our initial business combination (net of redemptions), and (z) the volume weighted average trading price of our shares of common stock during the 20 trading day period starting on the trading day prior to the day on which we consummate our initial business combination (such price, the “Market Value”) is below $9.20 per share, the exercise price of the warrants will be adjusted (to the nearest cent) to be equal to 115% of the higher of the Market Value and the Newly Issued Price, the corresponding $18.00 per share redemption trigger price will be adjusted (to the nearest cent) to be equal to 180% of the higher of the Market Value and the Newly Issued Price. This warrant provision may make it more difficult for us to consummate an initial business combination with a target business.\n\n25  \n---  \n  \n**_We may issue shares of our capital stock or debt securities to complete a business combination, which would reduce the equity interest of our stockholders and likely cause a change in control of our ownership._**\n\nAs of the date of this prospectus, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation will authorize the issuance of up to 50,000,000 shares of common stock, par value $0.0001 per share, and 1,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par value $0.0001 per share. Although we have no commitment as of the date of this offering, we may issue a substantial number of additional shares of common stock or shares of preferred stock, or a combination of common stock and preferred stock, to complete a business combination. The issuance of additional shares of common stock will not reduce the per-share conversion amount in the trust account. The issuance of additional shares of common stock or preferred stock:\n\n• | may significantly reduce the equity interest of investors in this offering;  \n---|---  \n• | may subordinate the rights of holders of shares of common stock if we issue shares of preferred stock with rights senior to those afforded to our shares of common stock;  \n• | may cause a change in control if a substantial number of shares of common stock are issued, which may affect, among other things, our ability to use our net operating loss carry forwards, if any, and could result in the resignation or removal of our present officers and directors; and  \n• | may adversely affect prevailing market prices for our shares of common stock.  \n---|---  \n  \nSimilarly, if we issue debt securities, it could result in:\n\n• | default and foreclosure on our assets if our operating revenues after a business combination are insufficient to repay our debt obligations;  \n---|---  \n• | acceleration of our obligations to repay the indebtedness even if we make all principal and interest payments when due if we breach certain covenants that require the maintenance of certain financial ratios or reserves without a waiver or renegotiation of that covenant;  \n• | our immediate payment of all principal and accrued interest, if any, if the debt security is payable on demand; and  \n• | our inability to obtain necessary additional financing if the debt security contains covenants restricting our ability to obtain such financing while the debt security is outstanding.  \n  \nIf we incur indebtedness, our lenders will not have a claim on the cash in the trust account and such indebtedness will not decrease the per-share conversion amount in the trust account.\n\n**_We may be unable to obtain additional financing, if required, to complete a business combination or to fund the operations and growth of the target business, which could compel us to restructure or abandon a particular business combination._**\n\nAlthough we believe that the net proceeds of this offering will be sufficient to allow us to consummate a business combination, because we have not yet identified any prospective target business, we cannot ascertain the capital requirements for any particular transaction. If the net proceeds of this offering prove to be insufficient, either because of the size of the business combination, the depletion of the available net proceeds in search of a target business, or the obligation to convert into cash a significant number of shares from stockholders, we will be required to seek additional financing. Such financing may not be available on acceptable terms, if at all. To the extent that additional financing proves to be unavailable when needed to consummate a particular business combination, we would be compelled to either restructure the transaction or abandon that particular business combination and seek an alternative target business candidate. In addition, if we consummate a business combination, we may require additional financing to fund the operations or growth of the target business. The failure to secure additional financing could have a material adverse effect on the continued development or growth of the target business. None of our officers, directors or stockholders is required to provide any financing to us in connection with or after a business combination.\n\n26  \n---  \n  \n**_If the net proceeds of this offering not being held in trust are insufficient to allow us to operate for at least the next 12 months, we may be unable to complete a business combination._**\n\nOf the net proceeds of this offering, only approximately $624,000 will be available to us initially outside the trust account to fund our working capital requirements. We will also have access to certain interest earned on the funds held in the trust account for working capital purposes. We believe that, upon closing of this offering, such funds will be sufficient to allow us to operate for at least the next 12 months; however, we cannot assure you that our estimate is accurate. Accordingly, if we use all of the funds held outside of the trust account and all interest available to us, we may not have sufficient funds available with which to structure, negotiate or close an initial business combination. In such event, we would need to borrow funds from our initial stockholders, officers or directors or their affiliates to operate or may be forced to liquidate. Our initial stockholders, officers, directors and their affiliates may, but are not obligated to, loan us funds, from time to time or at any time, in whatever amount that they deem reasonable in their sole discretion for our working capital needs. Each loan would be evidenced by a promissory note. The notes would be paid upon consummation of our initial business combination, without interest.\n\n**_We may not obtain a fairness opinion with respect to the target business that we seek to acquire and therefore you may be relying solely on the judgment of our Board of Directors in approving a proposed business combination._**\n\nWe will only be required to obtain a fairness opinion with respect to the target business that we seek to acquire if it is an entity that is affiliated with any of our initial stockholders, officers, directors or their affiliates. In all other instances, we will have no obligation to obtain an opinion. Accordingly, investors may be relying solely on the judgment of our Board of Directors in approving a proposed business combination.\n\n**_Resources could be spent researching acquisitions that are not consummated, which could materially adversely affect subsequent attempts to locate and acquire or merge with another business._**\n\nIt is anticipated that the investigation of each specific target business and the negotiation, drafting, and execution of relevant agreements, disclosure documents, and other instruments will require substantial management time and attention and substantial costs for accountants, attorneys and others. If a decision is made not to complete a specific business combination, the costs incurred up to that point for the proposed transaction likely would not be recoverable. Furthermore, even if an agreement is reached relating to a specific target business, we may fail to consummate the business combination for any number of reasons including those beyond our control. Any such event will result in a loss to us of the related costs incurred which could materially adversely affect subsequent attempts to locate and acquire or merge with another business.\n\n**_We may only be able to complete one business combination with the proceeds of this offering, which will cause us to be solely dependent on a single business which may have a limited number of products or services._**\n\nIt is likely we will consummate a business combination with a single target business, although we have the ability to simultaneously acquire several target businesses. By consummating a business combination with only a single entity, our lack of diversification may subject us to numerous economic, competitive and regulatory developments. Further, we would not be able to diversify our operations or benefit from the possible spreading of risks or offsetting of losses, unlike other entities which may have the resources to complete several business combinations in different industries or different areas of a single industry. Accordingly, the prospects for our success may be:\n\n• | solely dependent upon the performance of a single business, or  \n---|---  \n• | dependent upon the development or market acceptance of a single or limited number of products, processes or services.  \n  \n27  \n---  \n  \nThis lack of diversification may subject us to numerous economic, competitive and regulatory developments, any or all of which may have a substantial adverse impact upon the particular industry in which we may operate subsequent to a business combination.\n\nAlternatively, if we determine to simultaneously acquire several businesses and such businesses are owned by different sellers, we will need for each of such sellers to agree that our purchase of its business is contingent on the simultaneous closings of the other business combinations, which may make it more difficult for us, and delay our ability, to complete the business combination. With multiple business combinations, we could also face additional risks, including additional burdens and costs with respect to possible multiple negotiations and due diligence investigations (if there are multiple sellers) and the additional risks associated with the subsequent assimilation of the operations and services or products of the acquired companies in a single operating business. If we are unable to adequately address these risks, it could negatively impact our profitability and results of operations.\n\n**_Our search for an initial business combination, and any target business with which we ultimately consummate an initial business combination, may be materially adversely affected by significant current and future events, such as public health concerns, the war in Ukraine, rising interest rates, ongoing market turbulence and the status of debt and equity markets._**\n\nPublic health concerns (pandemics or epidemics), terrorist attacks, natural disasters, acts of war (including the war in Ukraine), civil unrest, economic downturns or recessions and rising interest rates could adversely affect the economies and financial markets worldwide, and the business of any potential target business with which we consummate an initial business combination could be materially and adversely affected. Furthermore, we may be unable to complete an initial business combination if concerns relating to any such situations restrict travel, limit the ability to have meetings with potential investors or the target company’s personnel or service providers, or otherwise cause the target company to be unavailable to negotiate and consummate a transaction in a timely manner. The extent to which current or future events impact our search for an initial business combination will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including new information which may emerge concerning, for example, the severity of any public health concerns, the status of efforts to contain COVID-19 or treat its impact, among others. If the disruptions posed by any current or future events continue for an extensive period of time, our ability to consummate an initial business combination, or the operations of a target business with which we ultimately consummate an initial business combination, may be materially adversely affected.\n\nIn addition, our ability to consummate a transaction may be dependent on the ability to raise equity and debt financing which may be impacted by rising interest rates, ongoing market turbulence or other current or future events, including as a result of increased market volatility, decreased market liquidity in third-party financing being unavailable on terms acceptable to us or at all.\n\n**_As the number of special purpose acquisition companies evaluating targets increases, attractive targets may become scarcer and there may be more competition for attractive targets. This could increase the cost of our initial business combination and could even result in our inability to find a target or to consummate an initial business combination._**\n\nSince the fourth quarter of 2020, the number of special purpose acquisition companies that have been formed has increased substantially. Many potential targets for special purpose acquisition companies have already entered into an initial business combination, and there are still many special purpose acquisition companies seeking targets for their initial business combination, as well as many such companies currently in registration. As a result, at times, fewer attractive targets may be available, and it may require more time, more effort and more resources to identify a suitable target and to consummate an initial business combination.\n\n28  \n---  \n  \nIn addition, because there are more special purpose acquisition companies seeking to enter into an initial business combination with available targets, the competition for available targets with attractive fundamentals or business models may increase, which could cause targets companies to demand improved financial terms. Attractive deals could also become scarcer for other reasons, such as economic or industry sector downturns, geopolitical tensions, or increases in the cost of additional capital needed to close business combinations or operate targets post-business combination. This could increase the cost of, delay or otherwise complicate or frustrate our ability to find and consummate an initial business combination, and may result in our inability to consummate an initial business combination on terms favorable to our investors altogether.\n\n**_Changes in the market for directors and officers liability insurance could make it more difficult and more expensive for us to negotiate and complete an initial business combination._**\n\nIn recent months, the market for directors and officers liability insurance for special purpose acquisition companies has changed. The premiums charged for such policies have generally increased and the terms of such policies have generally become less favorable. There can be no assurance that these trends will not continue.\n\nThe increased cost and decreased availability of directors and officers liability insurance could make it more difficult and more expensive for us to negotiate an initial business combination. In order to obtain directors and officers liability insurance or modify its coverage as a result of becoming a public company, the post-business combination entity might need to incur greater expense, accept less favorable terms or both. However, any failure to obtain adequate directors and officers liability insurance could have an adverse impact on the post-business combination’s ability to attract and retain qualified officers and directors.\n\nIn addition, even after we were to complete an initial business combination, our directors and officers could still be subject to potential liability from claims arising from conduct alleged to have occurred prior to the initial business combination. As a result, in order to protect our directors and officers, the post-business combination entity will likely need to purchase additional insurance with respect to any such claims (“run-off insurance”). The need for run-off insurance would be an added expense for the post-business combination entity, and could interfere with or frustrate our ability to consummate an initial business combination on terms favorable to our investors.\n\nFurthermore, because our management team utilizes strategic advisors in addition to conventional directors and officers, we may choose to seek liability insurance coverage which extends to our strategic advisors, which could further increase our insurance costs.\n\n**_The Company may become subject to a legal dispute if its prior underwriters, whose engagement by the Company has been terminated well before the time of this filing, seek to enforce their now-terminated right to purchase 200,000 shares and 750,000 private warrants in connection with the consummation of this offering under the terms of their also now long-terminated engagement letters with the Company. The Company intends to vigorously dispute any such claims as the Company and its legal advisors firmly believe such claims lack any merit, which could result in the distraction of the management team’s attention and in additional legal costs to the Company. The Company could also ultimately be unsuccessful in disputing any such claims, which would have a dilutive effect on the Company’s capitalization._**\n\nThe Company’s previous underwriters, BTIG, LLC, and EarlyBirdCapital, LLC (the “Prior Underwriters”), had entered into engagement letters with the Company under which, in connection with the consummation of this offering, the Prior Underwriters had a right to make a purchase for cash consideration of 750,000 private warrants alongside our sponsor and, in exchange, to receive the right to receive up to 200,000 Founder’s Shares. Due to the Prior Underwriters’ inability to satisfy certain obligations to the Company agreed upon in their respective engagement letters, the Company ultimately determined to terminate its relationship with each of the Prior Underwriters and, accordingly, to terminate, or to allow to expire in accordance with their terms, its contractual arrangements with each of the Prior Underwriters. At the time of termination, neither Prior Underwriter had made any investment in or payment for any equity securities of the Company, and neither did the Company issue any equity securities to the Prior Underwriters as the expectation had been that, similar to the Representative Shares given to the current underwriters under this Prospectus, the applicable Founder’s Shares – and, in the case of Prior Underwriters, private warrants – would be issued to the Prior Underwriters only in connection with the consummation of the offering and the simultaneous private placement of the private warrants, respectively, with the Prior Underwriters serving as underwriters for said offering. As such, the Company, upon the advice of its advisors and legal counselors, is of the view that neither Prior Underwriter currently owns or is owed any equity securities of the Company. The Prior Underwriters may, however, nevertheless try to assert a claim with respect to the Founder’s Shares and private warrants, at which point the Company will evaluate all potential responses to and methods of resolving such a claim, including and not limited to litigation or arbitration. Any such legal proceedings could divert the attention of the Company’s management away from the Company’s search for a target company for its initial business combination and could result in the Company incurring additional legal and other costs. Additionally, if the Company were to prove unsuccessful in defending any such claim from the Prior Underwriters, the Company could be required to sell private warrants or Founder’s Shares to the Prior Underwriters, which could adversely affect the capitalization of the Company.\n\n**Risks Relating to the Post-Business Combination Company**\n\n**_Our ability to successfully effect a business combination and to be successful thereafter will be totally dependent upon the efforts of our key personnel, some of whom may join us following a business combination. While we intend to closely scrutinize any individuals we engage after a business combination, we cannot assure you that our assessment of these individuals will prove to be correct._**\n\nOur ability to successfully effect a business combination is dependent upon the efforts of our key personnel. We believe that our success depends on the continued service of our key personnel, at least until we have consummated our initial business combination. We cannot assure you that any of our key personnel will remain with us for the immediate or foreseeable future. In addition, none of our officers is required to commit any specified amount of time to our affairs and, accordingly, our officers will have conflicts of interest in allocating management time among various business activities, including identifying potential business combinations and monitoring the related due diligence. We do not have employment agreements with, or key-man insurance on the life of, any of our officers. The unexpected loss of the services of our key personnel could have a detrimental effect on us.\n\nThe role of our key personnel after a business combination, however, cannot presently be ascertained. Although some of our key personnel may serve in senior management or advisory positions following a business combination, it is likely that most, if not all, of the management of the target business will remain in place. While we intend to closely scrutinize any individuals we engage after a business combination, we cannot assure you that our assessment of these individuals will prove to be correct. These individuals may be unfamiliar with the requirements of operating a public company which could cause us to have to expend time and resources helping them become familiar with such requirements. This could be expensive and time-consuming and could lead to various regulatory issues which may adversely affect our operations.\n\n29  \n---  \n  \n**_Our officers and directors may not have significant experience or knowledge regarding the jurisdiction or industry of the target business we may seek to acquire._**\n\nWe may consummate a business combination with a target business in any geographic location or industry we choose. We cannot assure you that our officers and directors will have enough experience or have sufficient knowledge relating to the jurisdiction of the target or its industry to make an informed decision regarding a business combination.\n\n**_If we do not conduct an adequate due diligence investigation of a target business, we may be required to subsequently take write-downs or write-offs, restructuring, and impairment or other charges that could have a significant negative effect on our financial condition, results of operations and our stock price, which could cause you to lose some or all of your investment._**\n\nWe must conduct a due diligence investigation of the target businesses we intend to acquire. Intensive due diligence is time consuming and expensive due to the operations, accounting, finance and legal professionals who must be involved in the due diligence process. Even if we conduct extensive due diligence on a target business, this diligence may not reveal all material issues that may affect a particular target business, and factors outside the control of the target business and outside of our control may later arise. If our diligence fails to identify issues specific to a target business, industry or the environment in which the target business operates, we may be forced to later write-down or write-off assets, restructure our operations, or incur impairment or other charges that could result in our reporting losses. Even though these charges may be non-cash items and not have an immediate impact on our liquidity, the fact that we report charges of this nature could contribute to negative market perceptions about us or our common stock. In addition, charges of this nature may cause us to violate net worth or other covenants to which we may be subject as a result of assuming pre-existing debt held by a target business or by virtue of our obtaining post-combination debt financing.\n\n**_If we effect a business combination with a company located in a foreign jurisdiction, we would be subject to a variety of additional risks that may negatively impact our operations._**\n\nIf we consummate a business combination with a target business in a foreign country, we would be subject to any special considerations or risks associated with companies operating in the target business’ home jurisdiction, including any of the following:\n\n• | rules and regulations or currency conversion or corporate withholding taxes on individuals;  \n---|---  \n• | tariffs and trade barriers;  \n• | regulations related to customs and import/export matters;  \n• | longer payment cycles;  \n• | tax issues, such as tax law changes and variations in tax laws as compared to the United States;  \n• | currency fluctuations and exchange controls;  \n• | challenges in collecting accounts receivable;  \n• | cultural and language differences;  \n• | employment regulations;  \n• | crime, strikes, riots, civil disturbances, terrorist attacks and wars; and  \n• | deterioration of political relations with the United States.  \n  \nWe cannot assure you that we would be able to adequately address these additional risks. If we were unable to do so, our operations might suffer.\n\n30  \n---  \n  \n**_If we effect a business combination with a company located outside of the United States, the laws applicable to such company may govern some or all our material agreements and we may not be able to enforce our legal rights._**\n\nIf we effect a business combination with a company located outside of the United States, the laws of the country in which such company operates may govern some or all of the material agreements relating to its operations. We cannot assure you that the target business will be able to enforce any of its material agreements or that remedies will be available in this new jurisdiction. The system of laws and the enforcement of existing laws in such jurisdiction may not be as certain in implementation and interpretation as in the United States. The inability to enforce or obtain a remedy under any of our future agreements could result in a significant loss of business, business opportunities or capital. Additionally, if we acquire a company located outside of the United States, it is likely that substantially all of our assets would be located outside of the United States and some of our officers and directors might reside outside of the United States. As a result, it may not be possible for investors in the United States to enforce their legal rights, to effect service of process upon our directors or officers or to enforce judgments of United States courts predicated upon civil liabilities and criminal penalties of our directors and officers under federal securities laws.\n\n**_If we acquire a company operating in the M &E industry, our future operations may be subject to risks associated with this sector._**\n\nWhile we may pursue an initial business combination target in any business, industry or geographic location, we intend to search globally for target companies within the M&E industry with a primary focus on the United States, and in particular on identifying attractive targets among content studios and film production, family entertainment, animation, music, gaming, e-sports, talent management, talent-facing brands and businesses. Because we have not yet identified or approached any specific target business, we cannot provide specific risks of any business combination. However, risks inherent in investments in these industries may include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\n• | adverse changes in international, national, regional or local economic, demographic and market conditions;  \n---|---  \n• | competition from other companies and businesses in the M&E industry;  \n• | the ability to develop successful new products or improve existing ones;  \n• | changes in technology rendering our products or services obsolete following a business combination;  \n• | the disruption or failure of our networks, systems, platform or technology that frustrate or thwart our users’ ability to access our products and services, which may cause our users, advertisers, and partners to cut back on or stop using our products and services altogether, which could harm our business;  \n• | fluctuations in interest rates, which could adversely affect the ability of buyers and tenants of properties to obtain financing on favorable terms or at all;  \n• | mobile malware, viruses, ransomware, hacking and phishing attacks, spamming, and improper or illegal use of our products, which could harm our business and reputation;  \n• | litigation and other legal proceedings;  \n• | challenges associated with perfecting, registering, maintaining, licensing, enforcing and defending our intellectual property rights;  \n• | complexities in properly measuring the value of intangible or cutting-edge business assets, such as a celebrity’s brand recognition or the advertising potential of a streaming service;  \n• | risks arising out of the interconnectedness of the value and goodwill of our business and brands with the marketability, popularity, and public perception of certain celebrities;  \n• | the ability to attract and retain highly skilled employees;  \n• | environmental risks;  \n• | civil unrest, labor strikes (such as the recent SAG-AFTRA strike), acts of God, including earthquakes, floods and other natural disasters and acts of war or terrorism, which may result in uninsured losses;  \n• | increasing governmental regulation; and  \n• | failure to comply with governmental regulations resulting in the imposition of penalties, fines or restrictions on operations and remedial liabilities.  \n  \n31  \n---  \n  \nAny of the foregoing could have an adverse impact on our operations following a business combination. However, our efforts in identifying prospective target businesses will not be limited to companies in the M&E industry. Accordingly, if we acquire a target business in another industry, these risks we will be subject to risks attendant with the specific industry in which we operate or target business which we acquire, which may or may not be different than those risks listed above.\n\n**_There may be tax consequences to our business combinations that may adversely affect us._**\n\nWhile we expect to undertake any merger or acquisition so as to minimize taxes both to the acquired business and/or asset and us, such business combination might not meet the statutory requirements of a tax-free reorganization, or the parties might not obtain the intended tax-free treatment upon a transfer of shares or assets. A non-qualifying reorganization could result in the imposition of substantial taxes.\n\nWe will likely be subject to taxes in the U.S. and in the foreign jurisdictions where we do business. Due to economic and political conditions, tax rates in the U.S. and various foreign jurisdictions have been and may be subject to significant change. Changes in the mix of our earnings between countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities related to changes in tax rates, changes in tax laws, including how existing tax laws are interpreted or enforced, or contemplated changes in long-standing tax principles, if finalized and adopted, could adversely impact our future effective tax rate and business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. For example, long-standing international tax norms that determine each country’s jurisdiction to tax cross-border international trade are evolving as a result of a multilateral project, the Base Erosion and Profit Shifting Project (the “BEPS Project”), that has established new principles and reporting requirements recommended by the member countries of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (the “OECD”). In connection with the BEPS Project, companies are required to disclose more information to tax authorities on operations around the world, which may lead to greater audit scrutiny of profits earned in countries outside of the U.S. Many jurisdictions have already enacted legislation and adopted policies resulting from the BEPS Project. The OECD, is also addressing the challenges of the digitization of the global economy with plans to redefine jurisdictional taxation rights in market countries and establish a global minimum tax.\n\n**_The SEC has issued proposed rules relating to certain activities of special purpose acquisition companies (“SPACs”). Certain of the procedures that we, a potential business combination target, or others may determine to undertake in connection with such proposals may increase our costs and the time needed to complete our initial business combination and may constrain the circumstances under which we could complete an initial business combination. The need for compliance with the SPAC rule proposals may cause us to liquidate the funds in the trust account or liquidate our company at an earlier time than we might otherwise choose._**\n\nOn March 30, 2022, the SEC issued proposed rules (the “SPAC Rule Proposals”) relating, among other items, to disclosures in business combination transactions between SPACS such as us and private operating companies; the condensed financial statement requirements applicable to transactions involving shell companies; the use of projections by SPACs in SEC filings in connection with proposed business combination transactions; the potential liability of certain participants in proposed business combination transactions; and the extent to which SPACs could become subject to regulation under the Investment Company Act, including a proposed rule that would provide SPACs a safe harbor from treatment as an investment company if they satisfy certain conditions that limit a SPAC’s duration, asset composition, business purpose and activities. The SPAC Rule Proposals have not yet been adopted, and may be adopted in the proposed form or in a different form that could impose additional regulatory requirements on SPACs. Certain of the procedures that we, a potential business combination target, or others may determine to undertake in connection with the SPAC Rule Proposals, or pursuant to the SEC’s views expressed in the SPAC Rule Proposals, may increase the costs and time of negotiating and completing an initial business combination, and may constrain the circumstances under which we could complete an initial business combination. The need for compliance with the SPAC Rule Proposals may cause us to liquidate the funds in the trust account or liquidate our company at an earlier time than we might otherwise choose.\n\n**_The excise tax included in the U.S. Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 may decrease the value of our securities following our initial business combination, hinder our ability to consummate an initial business combination, and decrease the amount of funds available for distribution in connection with a liquidation._**\n\nPursuant to the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (the “IR Act”), commencing in 2023, a 1% U.S. federal excise tax is imposed on certain repurchases (including redemptions) of stock by “covered corporations” occurring on or after January 1, 2023. Because we are a Delaware corporation and our securities are trading on the NASDAQ, we are a “covered corporation” for this purpose. The excise tax is imposed on the covered corporation itself, not its stockholders from which shares are repurchased. The amount of the excise tax is generally 1% of the fair market value of the shares repurchased at the time of the repurchase. However, for purposes of calculating the excise tax, repurchasing corporations are permitted to net the fair market value of certain new stock issuances against the fair market value of stock repurchases during the same taxable year. In addition, certain exceptions apply to the excise tax. The U.S. Department of the Treasury (the “Treasury”) has been given authority to provide regulations and other guidance to carry out and prevent the abuse or avoidance of the excise tax. The Treasury recently issued interim guidance that redemptions in connection with a SPAC liquidation would not be subject to the excise tax under certain circumstances. In additional interim guidance issued by Treasury, IRS Announcement 2023-18 released on June 29, 2023, provides that taxpayers will not be required to report or pay the new excise tax on corporate stock repurchases before the time specified in forthcoming regulations. Treasury has publicly stated that the issuance of Proposed Regulations regarding the excise tax under the IR Act are in the final stages of the regulatory clearance process and will be released in the near term. Redemptions that occur in the same taxable year as a liquidation is completed will also be exempt from such tax. Any share redemption or other share repurchase that occurs after December 31, 2022, in connection with a business combination, extension vote or otherwise, may be subject to the excise tax. Whether and to what extent we would be subject to the excise tax in connection with an initial business combination, extension vote or otherwise in the future will depend on a number of factors, including (i) the fair market value of the redemptions and repurchases in connection with the business combination, extension vote or otherwise, (ii) the nature and amount of any “PIPE” or other equity issuances in connection with the business combination (or otherwise issued not in connection with the business combination but issued within the same taxable year of the business combination) and (iii) the content of regulations and other guidance from the Treasury. In addition, because the excise tax would be payable by us and not by the redeeming holder, the mechanics of any required payment of the excise tax have not been determined. The foregoing could cause a reduction in the cash available on hand to complete our initial business combination and in our ability to complete the business combination. Notwithstanding the foregoing, we have agreed that the per share price payable to stockholders exercising their redemption rights in connection with an initial business combination, extension vote or otherwise (including upon our liquidation) will not be reduced by payments required to be made by us under the IR Act.\n\n**Risks Relating to Potential Conflicts of Interest of our Management, Directors, and Others**\n\n**_Our officers and directors will allocate their time to other businesses thereby causing conflicts of interest in their determination as to how much time to devote to our affairs. This could have a negative impact on our ability to consummate a business combination._**\n\nOur officers and directors will not commit their full time to our affairs. We presently expect each of our officers and directors to devote such amount of time as they reasonably believe is necessary to our business. We do not intend to have any full-time employees prior to the consummation of our initial business combination. The foregoing could have a negative impact on our ability to consummate our initial business combination.\n\n**_Our officers and directors may have a conflict of interest in determining whether a particular target business is appropriate for a business combination._**\n\nOur initial stockholders have waived their right to convert the Founder’s Shares or any other shares purchased in this offering or thereafter, or to receive distributions from the trust account with respect to the Founder’s Shares upon our liquidation if we are unable to consummate a business combination. Accordingly, the shares and rights acquired prior to this offering, as well as the private warrants and any warrants purchased by our officers or directors in the aftermarket, will be worthless if we do not consummate a business combination. The personal and financial interests of our directors and officers may influence their motivation in timely identifying and selecting a target business and completing a business combination and in determining whether the terms, conditions and timing of a particular business combination are appropriate and in our stockholders’ best interest.\n\n32  \n---  \n  \n**_Our officers and directors or their affiliates have pre-existing fiduciary and contractual obligations and may in the future become affiliated with other entities engaged in business activities similar to those intended to be conducted by us. Accordingly, they may have conflicts of interest in determining to which entity a particular business opportunity should be presented._**\n\nOur officers and directors or their affiliates have pre-existing fiduciary and contractual obligations to other companies. Specifically, Lisa Hatton Harrington is a director of Slam Corp., a SPAC seeking to consummate an initial business combination. Accordingly, they may participate in transactions and have obligations that may be in conflict or competition with our consummation of our initial business combination. As a result, a potential target business may be presented by our management team to another entity prior to its presentation to us and we may not be afforded the opportunity to engage in a transaction with such target business. Additionally, our officers and directors may in the future become affiliated with entities that are engaged in a similar business, including another blank check company that may have acquisition objectives that are similar to ours. Accordingly, they may have conflicts of interest in determining to which entity a particular business opportunity should be presented. These conflicts may not be resolved in our favor and a potential target business may be presented to other entities prior to its presentation to us, subject to our officers’ and directors’ fiduciary duties under Delaware law. For a more detailed description of our officers’ and directors’ business affiliations and the potential conflicts of interest that you should be aware of, see the sections titled “ _Management — Directors and Executive Officers” and “Management — Conflicts of Interest._ ”\n\n**_Our key personnel may negotiate employment or consulting agreements with a target business in connection with a particular business combination. These agreements may provide for them to receive compensation following a business combination and as a result, may cause them to have conflicts of interest in determining whether a particular business combination is the most advantageous._**\n\nOur key personnel will be able to remain with the company after the consummation of a business combination only if they are able to negotiate employment or consulting agreements or other appropriate arrangements in connection with the business combination. Such negotiations would take place simultaneously with the negotiation of the business combination and could provide for such individuals to receive compensation in the form of cash payments and/or our securities for services they would render to the company after the consummation of the business combination. The personal and financial interests of such individuals may influence their motivation in identifying and selecting a target business.\n\n**Risks Relating to our Securities**\n\n**_If we do not file and maintain a current and effective prospectus relating to the common stock issuable upon exercise of the warrants, holders will only be able to exercise such warrants on a “cashless basis.”_**\n\nIf we do not file and maintain a current and effective prospectus relating to the common stock issuable upon exercise of the warrants at the time that holders wish to exercise such warrants, they will only be able to exercise them on a “cashless basis” provided that an exemption from registration is available. As a result, the number of shares of common stock that holders will receive upon exercise of the warrants will be fewer than it would have been had such holder exercised his warrant for cash. Further, if an exemption from registration is not available, holders would not be able to exercise on a cashless basis and would only be able to exercise their warrants for cash if a current and effective prospectus relating to the common stock issuable upon exercise of the warrants is available. Under the terms of the warrant agreement, we have agreed to use our best efforts to meet these conditions and to file and maintain a current and effective prospectus relating to the common stock issuable upon exercise of the warrants until the expiration of the warrants. However, we cannot assure you that we will be able to do so. If we are unable to do so, the potential “upside” of the holder’s investment in our company may be reduced or the warrants may expire worthless.\n\n33  \n---  \n  \n**_An investor will only be able to exercise a warrant if the issuance of shares of common stock upon such exercise has been registered or qualified or is deemed exempt under the securities laws of the state of residence of the holder of the warrants._**\n\nNo warrants will be exercisable and we will not be obligated to issue shares of common stock unless the shares of common stock issuable upon such exercise has been registered or qualified or deemed to be exempt under the securities laws of the state of residence of the holder of the warrants. If the shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of the warrants are not qualified or exempt from qualification in the jurisdictions in which the holders of the warrants reside, the warrants may be deprived of any value, the market for the warrants may be limited and they may expire worthless if they cannot be sold.\n\n**_We may amend the terms of the warrants in a manner that may be adverse to holders with the approval by the holders of at least a majority of the then outstanding warrants._**\n\nOur warrants will be issued in registered form under a warrant agreement between Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, as warrant agent, and us. The warrant agreement provides that the terms of the warrants may be amended without the consent of any holder to cure any ambiguity or correct any defective provision. The warrant agreement requires the approval by the holders of at least a majority of the then outstanding warrants in order to make any change that adversely affects the interests of the registered holders.\n\n**_If third parties bring claims against us, the proceeds held in trust could be reduced and the per-share redemption price received by stockholders may be less than $10.00._**\n\nOur placing of funds in trust may not protect those funds from third party claims against us. Although we will seek to have all vendors and service providers we engage and prospective target businesses we negotiate with execute agreements with us waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to any monies held in the trust account for the benefit of our public stockholders, they may not execute such agreements. Furthermore, even if such entities execute such agreements with us, they may seek recourse against the trust account. A court may not uphold the validity of such agreements. Accordingly, the proceeds held in trust could be subject to claims which could take priority over those of our public stockholders. If we are unable to complete a business combination and distribute the proceeds held in trust to our public stockholders, Bengochea SPAC Sponsors I LLC, an entity affiliated with Mr. Bengochea, has agreed (subject to certain exceptions described elsewhere in this prospectus) that it will be liable to ensure that the proceeds in the trust account are not reduced below $10.00 per share by the claims of target businesses or claims of vendors or other entities that are owed money by us for services rendered or contracted for or products sold to us. However, we have not independently verified whether Bengochea SPAC Sponsors I LLC has sufficient funds to satisfy its indemnity obligations, we have not asked it to reserve for such obligations and we do not believe it has any significant liquid assets. Accordingly, we believe it is unlikely that it will be able to satisfy its indemnification obligations if it is required to do so. As a result, the per-share distribution from the trust account may be less than $10.00, plus interest, due to such claims.\n\nAdditionally, if we are forced to file a bankruptcy case or an involuntary bankruptcy case is filed against us which is not dismissed, the proceeds held in the trust account could be subject to applicable bankruptcy law, and may be included in our bankruptcy estate and subject to the claims of third parties with priority over the claims of our stockholders. To the extent any bankruptcy claims deplete the trust account, we may not be able to return to our public stockholders at least $10.00.\n\n**_Our stockholders may be held liable for claims by third parties against us to the extent of distributions received by them._**\n\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that we will continue in existence only until 12 months (or up to 18 months, if we extend the time to complete a business combination as described in this prospectus) from the closing of this offering. If we have not completed a business combination by such date, we will (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up, (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten business days thereafter, redeem 100% of the outstanding public shares, at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account, including any interest not previously released to us but net of franchise and income taxes payable (less up to $100,000 for our liquidation\n\n34  \n---  \n  \nexpenses), divided by the number of then outstanding public shares, which redemption will completely extinguish public stockholders’ rights as stockholders (including the right to receive further liquidation distributions, if any), subject to applicable law, and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of our remaining stockholders and our Board of Directors, dissolve and liquidate, subject (in the case of (ii) and (iii) above) to our obligations under Delaware law to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable law. We cannot assure you that we will properly assess all claims that may be potentially brought against us. As such, our stockholders could potentially be liable for any claims to the extent of distributions received by them (but no more) and any liability of our stockholders may extend well beyond the third anniversary of the date of distribution. Accordingly, we cannot assure you that third parties will not seek to recover from our stockholders amounts owed to them by us.\n\nIf we are forced to file a bankruptcy case or an involuntary bankruptcy case is filed against us which is not dismissed, any distributions received by stockholders could be viewed under applicable debtor/creditor and/or bankruptcy laws as either a “preferential transfer” or a “fraudulent conveyance.” As a result, a bankruptcy court could seek to recover all amounts received by our stockholders. Furthermore, because we intend to distribute the proceeds held in the trust account to our public stockholders promptly after expiration of the time we have to complete an initial business combination, this may be viewed or interpreted as giving preference to our public stockholders over any potential creditors with respect to access to or distributions from our assets. Furthermore, our Board may be viewed as having breached their fiduciary duties to our creditors and/or may have acted in bad faith, and thereby exposing itself and our company to claims of punitive damages, by paying public stockholders from the trust account prior to addressing the claims of creditors. We cannot assure you that claims will not be brought against us for these reasons.\n\n**_Our directors may decide not to enforce_** **_Bengochea SPAC Sponsors I LLC’s indemnification obligations, resulting in a reduction in the amount of funds in the trust account available for distribution to our public stockholders._**\n\nIn the event that the proceeds in the trust account are reduced below $10.00 per public share and Bengochea SPAC Sponsors I LLC asserts that it is unable to satisfy its obligations or that it has no indemnification obligations related to a particular claim, our independent directors would determine whether to take legal action against it to enforce such indemnification obligations. It is possible that our independent directors in exercising their business judgment may choose not to do so in any particular instance. If our independent directors choose not to enforce these indemnification obligations, the amount of funds in the trust account available for distribution to our public stockholders may be reduced below $10.00 per share.\n\n**_The securities in which we may invest the funds held in the trust account could bear a negative rate of interest, which could reduce the value of the assets held in trust such that the per-share redemption amount received by public stockholders may be less than $10.00 per share._**\n\nThe proceeds held in the trust account will be held as cash or cash items (including in demand deposit accounts) or invested only in U.S. government treasury obligations with a maturity of 185 days or less, money market funds meeting certain conditions under Rule 2a-7 under the Investment Company Act, which invest only in direct U.S. government treasury obligations, although we may determine to hold such proceeds as cash rather than investing them for any reason including but not limited to interest rate fluctuations or the need for such funds in connection with an impending closing of an initial business combination. While short-term U.S. government treasury obligations currently yield a positive rate of interest, they have briefly yielded negative interest rates in recent years. Central banks in Europe and Japan pursued interest rates below zero in recent years, and the Open Market Committee of the Federal Reserve has not ruled out the possibility that it may in the future adopt similar policies in the United States. In the event that we are unable to complete our initial business combination or make certain amendments to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, our public stockholders are entitled to receive their pro-rata share of the proceeds held in the trust account, plus any interest income not previously released to us, net of taxes payable. Negative interest rates could reduce the value of the assets held in trust such that the per-share redemption amount received by public stockholders may be less than $10.00 per share.\n\n35  \n---  \n  \n**_There is currently no market for our securities and a market for our securities may not develop, which would adversely affect the liquidity and price of our securities._**\n\nThere is currently no market for our securities. Stockholders therefore have no access to information about prior market history on which to base their investment decision. Following this offering, the price of our securities may vary significantly due to one or more potential business combinations and general market or economic conditions. Furthermore, an active trading market for our securities may never develop or, if developed, it may not be sustained. You may be unable to sell your securities unless a market can be established and sustained.\n\n**_We may issue our shares to investors in connection with our initial business combination at a price that is less than the prevailing market price of our shares at that time._**\n\nIn connection with our initial business combination, we may issue shares to investors in private placement transactions (so-called PIPE transactions) at a price of $10.00 per share or which approximates the per-share amounts in our trust account at such time, which is generally approximately $10.00, without taking into account any interest earned on such funds or any increase as a result of our extending the time to consummate a business combination as described herein. The purpose of such issuances will be to enable us to provide sufficient liquidity to the post-business combination entity. The price of the shares we issue may therefore be less, and potentially significantly less, than the market price for our shares at such time.\n\n**_NASDAQ_**** _may delist our securities from quotation on its exchange which could limit investors’ ability to make transactions in our securities and subject us to additional trading restrictions._**\n\nWe anticipate that our securities will be listed on NASDAQ, a national securities exchange, upon consummation of this offering. Although, after giving effect to this offering, we expect to meet NASDAQ’s minimum initial listing standards for the Nasdaq Global Market, which generally only requires that we meet certain requirements relating to market capitalization, aggregate market value of publicly held shares and distribution requirements, we cannot assure you that our securities will continue to be listed on NASDAQ in the future prior to an initial business combination. Additionally, in connection with our initial business combination, it is possible that NASDAQ will require us to file a new initial listing application and meet its initial listing requirements as opposed to its more lenient continued listing requirements. We cannot assure you that we will be able to meet those initial listing requirements at that time. NASDAQ will also have discretionary authority to not approve our listing if NASDAQ determines that the listing of the company to be acquired is against public policy at that time.\n\nIf NASDAQ delists our securities from trading on its exchange, or we are not listed in connection with our initial business combination, we could face significant material adverse consequences, including:\n\n• | a limited availability of market quotations for our securities;  \n---|---  \n• | reduced liquidity with respect to our securities;  \n• | a determination that our shares of common stock are “penny stock” which will require brokers trading in our shares of common stock to adhere to more stringent rules, possibly resulting in a reduced level of trading activity in the secondary trading market for our shares of common stock;  \n• | a limited amount of news and analyst coverage for our company; and  \n• | a decreased ability to issue additional securities or obtain additional financing in the future.  \n  \nThe National Securities Markets Improvement Act of 1996, which is a federal statute, prevents or preempts the states from regulating the sale of certain securities, which are referred to as “covered securities.” Because we expect that our units and common stock, warrants and rights will be listed on NASDAQ, our units, common stock, warrants and rights will be covered securities. Although the states are preempted from regulating the sale of our securities, the federal statute does allow the states to investigate companies if there is a suspicion of fraud, and, if there is a finding of fraudulent activity, then the states can regulate or bar the sale of covered securities in a particular case. If we were no longer listed on NASDAQ, our securities would not be covered securities and we would be subject to regulation in each state in which we offer our securities.\n\n36  \n---  \n  \n**_Our initial stockholders paid a nominal price for the Founder’s Shares and Representative Shares and, accordingly, you will experience immediate and substantial dilution from the purchase of our shares of common stock._**\n\nThe difference between the public offering price per share and the pro forma net tangible book value per share of common stock after this offering constitutes the dilution to the investors in this offering. Our initial stockholders acquired the Founder’s Shares at a nominal price, significantly contributing to this dilution. Upon consummation of this offering, you and the other new investors will incur an immediate and substantial dilution of approximately 108.76% or $9.06 per share (the difference between the pro forma net tangible book value per share $(0.73), and the initial offering price of $8.33 per unit). This is because investors in this offering will be contributing approximately 99.96% of the total amount paid to us for our outstanding securities after this offering but will only own approximately 80.76% of our outstanding securities and this becomes exacerbated to the extent that public stockholders seek to convert their shares into a pro rata share of the trust proceeds. Accordingly, the per-share purchase price you will be paying substantially exceeds our per share net tangible book value.\n\n**_Our initial stockholders paid an aggregate of $25,000 for the Founder’s Shares, or approximately $0.0129 per share. As a result, our initial stockholders stand to make a substantial profit even if an initial business combination subsequently declines in value or is unprofitable for our public stockholders, and may have an incentive to recommend such an initial business combination to our stockholders._**\n\nAs a result of the low acquisition cost of our Founder’s Shares, our initial stockholders could make a substantial profit even if we select and consummate an initial business combination with an acquisition target that subsequently declines in value or is unprofitable for our public stockholders. Thus, they may have more of an economic incentive for us to enter into an initial business combination with a riskier, weaker-performing or financially unstable business, or an entity lacking an established record of revenues or earnings, than would be the case if such parties had paid the full offering price for their Founder’s Shares.\n\n**_Our outstanding warrants may have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock and make it more difficult to effect a business combination._**\n\nWe will be issuing warrants to purchase 6,000,000 shares of common stock as part of the units offered by this prospectus, along with private warrants to purchase 2,457,000 shares of common stock which are to be purchased in a private placement that will occur simultaneously with the consummation of this offering (in each case, assuming the underwriters do not exercise all or a portion of the over-allotment option). We may also issue other units to our initial stockholders, officers, directors or their affiliates in payment of working capital loans made to us as described in this prospectus. To the extent we issue shares of common stock to effect a business combination, the potential for the issuance of a substantial number of additional shares upon exercise of these warrants could make us a less attractive acquisition vehicle in the eyes of a target business. Such securities, when exercised, will increase the number of issued and outstanding shares of common stock and reduce the value of the shares issued to complete the business combination. Accordingly, our warrants may make it more difficult to effectuate a business combination or increase the cost of acquiring the target business. Additionally, the sale, or even the possibility of sale, of the shares underlying the warrants could have an adverse effect on the market price for our securities or on our ability to obtain future financing. If and to the extent these warrants are exercised, you may experience dilution to your holdings.\n\n**_We may redeem your unexpired warrants prior to their exercise at a time that is disadvantageous to you, thereby making your warrants worthless._**\n\nWe have the ability to redeem outstanding warrants (including the private warrants and any warrants underlying additional units issued to our initial stockholders, officers or directors in payment of working capital loans made to us) at any time after they become exercisable and prior to their expiration, at a price of $0.01 per warrant, provided that the last reported sales price of the common stock equals or exceeds $18.00 per share (as adjusted for stock splits, stock dividends, reorganizations and recapitalizations) for any 20 trading days within a 30 trading-day period commencing at any time after the shares underlying the warrants have become exercisable and ending on the third business day prior to proper notice of such redemption provided that on the date we give notice of redemption and during the entire period thereafter until the time we redeem the warrants, we have an effective registration statement under the Securities Act covering the shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of the warrants and a current prospectus relating to them is available. If and when the warrants become redeemable by us, we may exercise our redemption right even if we are unable to register or qualify the underlying securities for sale under all applicable state securities laws. Redemption of the outstanding warrants could force you (i) to exercise your warrants and pay the exercise price therefor at a time when it may be\n\n37  \n---  \n  \ndisadvantageous for you to do so, (ii) to sell your warrants at the then-current market price when you might otherwise wish to hold your warrants or (iii) to accept the nominal redemption price which, at the time the outstanding warrants are called for redemption, is likely to be substantially less than the market value of your warrants.\n\n**_Our management’s ability to require holders of our warrants to exercise such warrants on a cashless basis will cause holders to receive fewer shares of common stock upon their exercise of the warrants than they would have received had they been able to exercise their warrants for cash._**\n\nIf we call our warrants for redemption after the redemption criteria described elsewhere in this prospectus have been satisfied, our management will have the option to require any holder that wishes to exercise his warrant (including any private warrants) to do so on a “cashless basis.” If our management chooses to require holders to exercise their warrants on a cashless basis, the number of shares of common stock received by a holder upon exercise will be fewer than it would have been had such holder exercised his warrant for cash. This will have the effect of reducing the potential “upside” of the holder’s investment in our company.\n\n**_If our security holders exercise their registration rights, it may have an adverse effect on the market price of our shares of common stock and the existence of these rights may make it more difficult to effect a business combination._**\n\nOur initial stockholders are entitled to make a demand that we register the resale of the Founder’s Shares at any time commencing three months prior to the date on which their shares may be released from escrow. Additionally, the holders of Representative Shares, the private warrants and any warrants our initial stockholders, officers, directors, or their affiliates may be issued in payment of working capital loans made to us, are entitled to demand that we register the resale of the Representative Shares, private warrants and any other warrants we issue to them (and the underlying securities) commencing at any time after we consummate an initial business combination. The presence of these additional securities trading in the public market may have an adverse effect on the market price of our securities. In addition, the existence of these rights may make it more difficult to effectuate a business combination or increase the cost of acquiring the target business, as the stockholders of the target business may be discouraged from entering into a business combination with us or will request a higher price for their securities because of the potential effect the exercise of such rights may have on the trading market for our shares of common stock.\n\n**_The determination for the offering price of our units is more arbitrary than the pricing of securities for an operating company in a particular industry._**\n\nPrior to this offering there has been no public market for any of our securities. The public offering price of the units and the terms of the warrants were negotiated between us and EF Hutton. Factors considered in determining the prices and terms of the units, including the shares of common stock, warrants and rights underlying the units, include:\n\n• | the history and prospects of companies whose principal business is the acquisition of other companies;  \n---|---  \n• | prior offerings of those companies;  \n• | our prospects for acquiring an operating business at attractive values;  \n• | our capital structure;  \n• | an assessment of our management and their experience in identifying operating companies; and  \n• | general conditions of the securities markets at the time of the offering.  \n  \nHowever, although these factors were considered, the determination of our offering price is more arbitrary than the pricing of securities for an operating company in a particular industry since we have no historical operations or financial results to compare them to.\n\n38  \n---  \n  \n**_Provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws and Delaware law may inhibit a takeover of us, which could limit the price investors might be willing to pay in the future for our common stock and could entrench management._**\n\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that may discourage unsolicited takeover proposals that stockholders may consider to be in their best interests. For example, our Board of Directors is divided into three classes, each of which will generally serve for a term of three years with only one class of directors being elected in each year. As a result, at a given annual meeting only a minority of the board of directors may be considered for election. Since our “staggered board” may prevent our stockholders from replacing a majority of our Board of Directors at any given annual meeting, it may entrench management and discourage unsolicited stockholder proposals that may be in the best interests of stockholders. Moreover, our Board of Directors has the ability to designate the terms of and issue new series of preferred stock. See “ _Certain Anti-Takeover Provisions of Delaware Law and our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation and By-Laws_ ” for additional information regarding these provisions as well as other provisions that may discourage unsolicited takeover proposals.\n\nWe are also subject to anti-takeover provisions under Delaware law, which could delay or prevent a change of control. Together these provisions may make more difficult the removal of management and may discourage transactions that otherwise could involve payment of a premium over prevailing market prices for our securities.\n\n**_Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation will provide, subject to limited exceptions, that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware will be the sole and exclusive forum for certain stockholder litigation matters, which could limit our stockholders’ ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers, employees or stockholders._**\n\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation requires, to the fullest extent permitted by law, that derivative actions brought in our name, actions against directors, officers and employees for breach of fiduciary duty and other similar actions may be brought only in the Court of Chancery in the State of Delaware, except any action (A) as to which the Court of Chancery in the State of Delaware determines that there is an indispensable party not subject to the jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery (and the indispensable party does not consent to the personal jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery within ten days following such determination), (B) which is vested in the exclusive jurisdiction of a court or forum other than the Court of Chancery, (C) for which the Court of Chancery does not have subject matter jurisdiction, or (D) any action arising under the Securities Act. Any person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring any interest in shares of our capital stock shall be deemed to have notice of and consented to the forum provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation.\n\nThis choice of forum provision may limit a stockholder’s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with us or any of our directors, officers or employees, which may discourage lawsuits with respect to such claims, although our stockholders will not be deemed to have waived our compliance with federal securities laws and the rules and regulations thereunder and may therefore bring a claim in another appropriate forum. We cannot be certain that a court will decide that this provision is either applicable or enforceable, and if a court were to find the choice of forum provision contained in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation to be inapplicable or unenforceable in an action, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such action in other jurisdictions, which could harm our business, operating results and financial condition.\n\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation will provide that the exclusive forum provision will be applicable to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law. Section 27 of the Exchange Act creates exclusive federal jurisdiction over all suits brought to enforce any duty or liability created by the Exchange Act or the rules and regulations thereunder. As a result, the exclusive forum provision will not apply to suits brought to enforce any duty or liability created by the Exchange Act or any other claim for which the federal courts have exclusive jurisdiction.\n\n**General Risks**\n\n**_We have no operating history and, accordingly, you will not have any basis on which to evaluate our ability to achieve our business objective._**\n\nWe have no operating results to date. Therefore, our ability to commence operations is dependent upon obtaining financing through this public offering of our securities. Since we do not have an operating history, you will have no basis upon which to evaluate our ability to achieve our business objective, which is to acquire an operating business. We have not conducted any substantive discussions and we have no plans, arrangements or understandings with any prospective acquisition candidates. We will not generate any revenues until, at the earliest, after the consummation of a business combination.\n\n39  \n---  \n  \n**_Our independent registered public accounting firm’s report contains an explanatory paragraph that expresses substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a “going concern.”_**\n\nOn September 30, 2023, we had no cash and a working capital deficit of $1,419,166. Further, we have incurred and expect to continue to incur significant costs in pursuit of our financing and acquisition plans. Management’s plans to address this need for capital through this offering are discussed in the section of this prospectus titled “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.” We cannot assure you that our plans to raise capital or to consummate an initial business combination will be successful. These factors, among others, raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. The financial statements contained elsewhere in this prospectus do not include any adjustments that might result from our inability to consummate this offering or our inability to continue as a going concern.\n\n**_You will not be entitled to protections normally afforded to investors of blank check companies._**\n\nSince the net proceeds of this offering are intended to be used to complete a business combination with a target business that has not been identified, we may be deemed to be a “blank check” company under the United States securities laws. However, since we will be listed on a national securities exchange upon the successful consummation of this offering, we are exempt from rules promulgated by the SEC to protect investors of blank check companies such as Rule 419. Accordingly, investors will not be afforded the benefits or protections of those rules which would, for example, completely restrict the transferability of our securities, require us to complete a business combination within 18 months of the effective date of the initial registration statement and restrict the use of interest earned on the funds held in the trust account. Because we are not subject to Rule 419, our units will be immediately tradable and we will be entitled to withdraw amounts from the funds held in the trust account prior to the completion of a business combination.\n\n**_Macro-economic turbulence and instability relating to recent and ongoing global conflicts and other drivers of uncertainty may adversely affect our business, investments and results of operations and our ability to successfully consummate a business combination._**\n\nA deterioration in economic conditions and related drivers of global uncertainty and change, such as reduced business activity, high unemployment, rising interest rates, housing prices, and energy prices (including the price of gasoline), increased consumer indebtedness, lack of available credit, the rate of inflation, and consumer perceptions of the economy, as well as other factors, such as terrorist attacks, protests, looting, and other forms of civil unrest, cyber attacks and data breaches, public health emergencies (such as the COVID-19 pandemic and other epidemics), extreme weather conditions and climate change, significant changes in the political environment, political instability, armed conflict (such as the ongoing military conflict between Ukraine and Russia and the emerging military conflict in Israel and Gaza) and/or public policy, including increased state, local or federal taxation, could adversely affect our financial condition, the financial condition of prospective target companies for our initial business combination, or the financial condition of the combined company even if we successfully consummate a business combination, as well as our ability to locate a commercially viable target company for our business combination in the first instance.\n\n**_Changes in laws or regulations, or a failure to comply with any laws and regulations, may adversely affect our business, investments and results of operations._**\n\nWe are subject to laws and regulations enacted by national, regional and local governments. In particular, we will be required to comply with certain SEC and other legal requirements. Compliance with, and monitoring of, applicable laws and regulations may be difficult, time consuming and costly.\n\nOn March 30, 2022, the SEC issued proposed rules relating to, among other items, enhancing disclosures in business combination transactions involving SPACs and private operating companies; amending the financial statement requirements applicable to transactions involving shell companies; effectively limiting the use of projections in SEC filings in connection with proposed business combination transactions; increasing the potential liability of certain participants in proposed business combination transactions; and the extent to which SPACs could become subject to regulation under the Investment Company Act of 1940. These rules, if adopted, whether in the form proposed or in revised form, may materially adversely affect our ability to negotiate and complete our initial business combination and may increase the costs and time related thereto.\n\n**_We are an “emerging growth company” and “smaller reporting company” and we cannot be certain if the reduced disclosure requirements applicable to emerging growth companies and smaller reporting companies will make our shares of common stock less attractive to investors._**\n\nWe are an “emerging growth company,” as defined in the JOBS Act. We will remain an “emerging growth company” for up to five years. However, if our non-convertible debt issued within a three year period or revenues exceeds $1.235 billion, or the market value of our shares of common stock that are held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million on the last day of the second fiscal quarter of any given fiscal year, we would cease to be an\n\n40  \n---  \n  \nemerging growth company as of the following fiscal year. As an emerging growth company, we are not required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, we have reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements and we are exempt from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. Additionally, as an emerging growth company, we have elected to delay the adoption of new or revised accounting standards that have different effective dates for public and private companies until those standards apply to private companies. As such, our financial statements may not be comparable to companies that comply with public company effective dates. We cannot predict if investors will find our shares of common stock less attractive because we may rely on these provisions. If some investors find our shares of common stock less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our shares and our share price may be more volatile.\n\nAdditionally, we are a “smaller reporting company” as defined in Item 10(f)(1) of Regulation S-K. Smaller reporting companies may take advantage of certain reduced disclosure obligations, including, among other things, providing only two years of audited financial statements. We will remain a smaller reporting company until the last day of the fiscal year in which (1) the market value of our common stock held by non-affiliates exceeds $250 million as of the end of that year’s second fiscal quarter, or (2) our annual revenues exceeded $100 million during such completed fiscal year and the market value of our common stock held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the end of that year’s second fiscal quarter. To the extent we take advantage of such reduced disclosure obligations, it may also make comparison of our financial statements with other public companies difficult or impossible.\n\n**_If we are deemed to be an investment company, we may be required to institute burdensome compliance requirements and our activities may be restricted, which may make it difficult for us to complete a business combination._**\n\nA company that, among other things, is or holds itself out as being engaged primarily, or proposes to engage primarily, in the business of investing, reinvesting, owning, trading or holding certain types of securities would be deemed an investment company under the Investment Company Act, as amended. Since we will invest the proceeds held in the trust account, it is possible that we could be deemed an investment company. Notwithstanding the foregoing, we do not believe that our anticipated principal activities will subject us to the Investment Company Act. To this end, the proceeds held in trust may be invested by the trustee only in United States “government securities” within the meaning of Section 2(a)(16) of the Investment Company Act having a maturity of 185 days or less or in money market funds meeting certain conditions under Rule 2a-7 promulgated under the Investment Company Act which invest only in direct U.S. government treasury obligations. By restricting the investment of the proceeds to these instruments, we intend to meet the requirements for the exemption provided in Rule 3a-1 promulgated under the Investment Company Act.\n\nOn March 30, 2022, the SEC issued proposed rules relating to, among other items, the extent to which SPACs could become subject to regulation under the Investment Company Act of 1940. The SEC’s proposed rules would provide a safe harbor for companies like our company from the definition of “investment company” under Section 3(a)(1)(A) of the Investment Company Act, provided that they satisfy certain conditions that limit a company’s duration, asset composition, business purpose and activities. The duration component of the proposed safe harbor rule would require the company to file a Current Report on Form 8-K with the SEC announcing that it has entered into an agreement with the target company (or companies) to engage in an initial business combination no later than 18 months after the effective date of the company’s registration statement for its initial public offering. The company would then be required to complete its initial business combination no later than 24 months after the effective date of its registration statement for its initial public offering. These rules, if adopted, whether in the form proposed or in revised form, may materially adversely affect our ability to negotiate and complete our initial business combination and may increase the costs and time related thereto.\n\nIf we are deemed to be an investment company under the Investment Company Act, we may be subject to certain restrictions that may make it more difficult for us to complete a business combination, including:\n\n• | restrictions on the nature of our investments; and  \n---|---  \n• | restrictions on the issuance of securities.  \n  \n41  \n---  \n  \nIn addition, we may have imposed upon us certain burdensome requirements, including:\n\n• | registration as an investment company;  \n---|---  \n• | adoption of a specific form of corporate structure; and  \n• | reporting, record keeping, voting, proxy, compliance policies and procedures and disclosure requirements and other rules and regulations.  \n  \nThe SEC is also proposing to amend rules and forms under both the Investment Advisers Act of and the Investment Company Act of 1940 to require registered investment advisers, certain advisers exempt from registration, registered investment companies, and business development companies, to provide additional information regarding their environmental, social, and governance (“ESG”) investment practices. The proposed amendments, if passed, may impose additional disclosure requirements on the company if we are deemed to be an investment company.\n\nCompliance with these additional regulatory burdens and proposed amendments would require additional expense for which we have not allotted.\n\n**_Compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 will require substantial financial and management resources and may increase the time and costs of completing an acquisition._**\n\nSection 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 requires that we evaluate and report on our system of internal controls and may require that we have such system of internal controls audited beginning with our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ending December 31, 2024. If we fail to maintain the adequacy of our internal controls, we could be subject to regulatory scrutiny, civil or criminal penalties and/or stockholder litigation. Any inability to provide reliable financial reports could harm our business. Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act also requires that our independent registered public accounting firm report on management’s evaluation of our system of internal controls. A target company may not be in compliance with the provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act regarding adequacy of their internal controls. The development of the internal controls of any such entity to achieve compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act may increase the time and costs necessary to complete any such acquisition. Furthermore, any failure to implement required new or improved controls, or difficulties encountered in the implementation of adequate controls over our financial processes and reporting in the future, could harm our operating results or cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations. Inferior internal controls could also cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information, which could have a negative effect on the trading price of our stock.\n\n42  \n---  \n  \n**CAUTIONARY NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS**\n\nThe statements contained in this prospectus that are not purely historical are forward-looking statements. Our forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, statements regarding our or our management’s expectations, hopes, beliefs, intentions or strategies regarding the future. In addition, any statements that refer to projections, forecasts or other characterizations of future events or circumstances, including any underlying assumptions, are forward-looking statements. The words “anticipates,” “believe,” “continue,” “could,” “estimate,” “expect,” “intends,” “may,” “might,” “plan,” “possible,” “potential,” “predicts,” “project,” “should,” “would” and similar expressions may identify forward-looking statements, but the absence of these words does not mean that a statement is not forward-looking. Forward-looking statements in this prospectus may include, for example, statements about:\n\n• | our ability to complete our initial business combination;  \n---|---  \n• | our success in retaining or recruiting, or changes required in, our officers, key employees or directors following our initial business combination;  \n• | our officers and directors allocating their time to other businesses and potentially having conflicts of interest with our business or in approving our initial business combination, as a result of which they would then receive expense reimbursements and other benefits;  \n• | our potential ability to obtain additional financing to complete a business combination;  \n• | our pool of prospective target businesses;  \n• | the ability of our officers and directors to generate a number of potential investment opportunities;  \n• | potential changes in control of us if we acquire one or more target businesses for stock;  \n• | our public securities’ potential liquidity and trading;  \n• | the lack of a market for our securities;  \n• | the impact on our business prospects of recently announced or proposed changes to rules or regulations impacting special purpose acquisition companies;   \n• | the impact on our business prospects of the COVID-19 pandemic, ongoing market turbulence, rising interest rates, or geopolitical concerns and government instability;   \n• | our expectations regarding the time during which we will be an “emerging growth company” under the JOBS Act or a “smaller reporting company” as defined in Item 10(f)(1) of Regulation S-K;  \n• | our use of proceeds not held in the trust account; or  \n• | our financial performance following this offering or following our initial business combination.  \n  \nThe forward-looking statements contained in this prospectus are based on our current expectations and beliefs concerning future developments and their potential effects on us. There can be no assurance that future developments affecting us will be those that we have anticipated. These forward-looking statements involve a number of risks, uncertainties (some of which are beyond our control) or other assumptions that may cause actual results or performance to be materially different from those expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements. These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, those factors described under the heading “ _Risk Factors_.” Should one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize, or should any of our assumptions prove incorrect, actual results may vary in material respects from those projected in these forward-looking statements. We undertake no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as may be required under applicable securities laws.\n\n43  \n---  \n  \n**USE OF PROCEEDS**\n\nWe estimate that the net proceeds of this offering, in addition to the funds we will receive from the sale of the private warrants (all of which will be deposited into the trust account), will be as set forth in the following table:\n\n**Without** **Over-Allotment** **Option** | **Over-Allotment** **Option** **Exercised**  \n---|---  \n_Gross proceeds_  \nGross proceeds from units offered to public(1) | $ | 60,000,000 | $ | 69,000,000  \nGross proceeds from sponsor loan | 327,000 | 327,000  \nGross proceeds from private placement warrants offered in the private placement | 2,457,000 | 2,533,500  \nTotal gross proceeds | $ | 62,784,000 | $ | 71,860,500  \n_Estimated offering expenses_(2)  \nUnderwriting commissions (1.0% of gross proceeds from units offered to public, excluding deferred portion)(3) | $ | 510,000 | $ | 586,500  \nLegal fees and expenses | 815,000 | 815,000  \nPrinting and engraving expenses | 65,000 | 65,000  \nAccounting fees and expenses | 365,000 | 365,000  \nSEC/FINRA expenses | 83,000 | 83,000  \nNASDAQ listing and filing fees (including deferred amount) (*) | 75,000 | 75,000  \nMiscellaneous expenses | 247,000 | 247,000  \nTotal offering expenses (other than underwriting commissions) | $ | 1,650,000 | $ | 1,650,000  \nProceeds after estimated offering expenses | $ | 60,624,000 | $ | 69,624,000  \nHeld in trust account | $ | 60,000,000 | $ | 69,000,000  \n% of public offering size | 100 | % | 100 | %  \nNot held in trust account | $ | 624,000 | $ | 624,000  \n  \nThe following table shows the use of the approximately $624,000 of net proceeds not held in the trust account(4)\n\n**Amount** | **% of Total**  \n---|---  \nLegal, accounting, due diligence, travel, and other expenses in connection with any business combination)  | $ | 200,000 | 32 | %  \nLegal and accounting fees related to regulatory reporting obligations | 75,000 | 12 | %  \nPayment for management support, administrative, office space, and other services (5) | 144,000 | 23 | %  \nWorking capital and other expenses (including D&O insurance) (6) | 205,000 | 33 | %  \nTotal | $ | 624,000 | 100.00 | %  \n(1) | Includes amounts payable to public stockholders who properly redeem their shares in connection with our successful completion of our initial business combination.  \n---|---  \n(2) | Prior to the closing of this offering, our sponsor has agreed to loan us up to $1,500,000 to be used for a portion of the expenses of this offering. As of September 30, 2023, we had borrowed $1,203,216 (of up to $1,500,000 available to us) under the promissory note with our sponsor, of which $876,216 will be repaid in connection with the closing of the private placement warrant purchase that will occur simultaneously with the closing of this offering, leaving a balance of $327,000. The principal balance may be prepaid at any time.  \n  \n44  \n---  \n  \n(3) | The underwriters have agreed to defer underwriting commissions of 3.65% of the gross proceeds of this offering. Upon and concurrently with the completion of our initial business combination, up to $2,190,000 in underwriters’ deferred commissions (or up to $2,518,500 in total if the underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised in full) will be paid to EF Hutton from the funds held in the trust account. See “Underwriting.” The remaining funds, less amounts released to the trustee to pay redeeming stockholders, will be released to us and can be used to pay all or a portion of the purchase price of the business or businesses with which our initial business combination occurs or for general corporate purposes, including payment of principal or interest on indebtedness incurred in connection with our initial business combination, to fund the purchases of other companies or for working capital. EF Hutton will not be entitled to any interest accrued on the deferred underwriting discounts and commissions.  \n---|---  \n(4) | These expenses are estimates only. Our actual expenditures for some or all of these items may differ from the estimates set forth herein. For example, we may incur greater legal and accounting expenses than our current estimates in connection with negotiating and structuring our initial business combination based upon the level of complexity of such business combination. In the event we identify a business combination target in a specific industry subject to specific regulations, we may incur additional expenses associated with legal due diligence and the engagement of special legal counsel. In addition, our staffing needs may vary and as a result, we may engage a number of consultants to assist with legal and financial due diligence. We do not anticipate any change in our intended use of proceeds, other than fluctuations among the current categories of allocated expenses, which fluctuations, to the extent they exceed current estimates for any specific category of expenses, would not be available for our expenses. The amount in the table above does not include interest available to us from the trust account. The proceeds held in the trust account will, if they are invested at all, only be invested only in U.S. government treasury obligations with a maturity of 185 days or less or in money market funds meeting certain conditions under Rule 2a-7 under the Investment Company Act which invest only in direct U.S. government treasury obligations. We estimate the interest earned on the trust account will be approximately $1,950,000 per year, assuming an interest rate of 3.25% per year; however, we can provide no assurances regarding this amount.  \n---|---  \n(5) | Represents payment of a total of $12,000 per month payable to our sponsor in exchange for management support, administrative, office space, and other services. These fees will only be paid for 12 months from the date of the close of this offering.   \n(6) | This amount includes an approximate amount of annualized director and officer liability insurance premiums we anticipate paying upon the completion of this offering and until we complete a business combination. Unused funds allotted to other categories will go to this expense category which will include any miscellaneous expenses that may arise.  \n(*) | EF Hutton has agreed in its engagement letter with the Company to reimburse the Company for the costs of the NASDAQ listing fees in connection with this offering.  \n  \nOur Sponsor has committed that it and/or its designees will purchase the private warrants (for an aggregate purchase price of $2,457,000) from us on a private placement basis simultaneously with the consummation of this offering. It has also agreed that if the over-allotment option is exercised by the underwriters in full or in part, it and/or its designees will purchase from us additional private warrants on a pro rata basis (up to a maximum of 76,500 private warrants at a price of $1.00 per private warrant) in an amount that is necessary to maintain in the trust account $10.00 per unit sold to the public in this offering. These additional private warrants will be purchased in a private placement that will occur simultaneously with the purchase of units resulting from the exercise of the over-allotment option. The private warrants are identical to the public warrants sold in this offering subject to certain limited exceptions as described elsewhere in this prospectus. All of the proceeds we receive from these purchases will be placed in the trust account described below.\n\n$60,000,000, or $69,000,000 if the over-allotment option is exercised in full, of net proceeds of this offering and the sale of the private warrants, including $2,190,000, or $2,518,500 if the over-allotment option is exercised in full, of deferred underwriting commissions, will be placed in a U.S.-based trust account with Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, New York, New York, acting as trustee. The funds held in trust will be held as cash or cash items (including demand deposit accounts) or invested only in United States “government securities” within the meaning of Section 2(a)(16) of the Investment Company Act having a maturity of 185 days or less, or in money market funds meeting certain conditions under Rule 2a-7 promulgated under the Investment Company Act which invest only in direct U.S. government treasury obligations, so that we are not deemed to be an investment company under the Investment Company Act. Except with respect to interest earned on the funds held in the trust account that may be released to us to pay our income or other tax obligations as described in this prospectus, the proceeds will not be released from the trust account until the earlier of the completion of a business combination or our redemption of 100% of the outstanding public shares if we have not completed a business combination in the required time period. The proceeds held in the trust account may be used as consideration to pay the sellers of a target business with which we complete a business combination. Any amounts not paid as consideration to the sellers of the target business may be used to finance operations of the target business.\n\nWe will pay $12,000 per month to our sponsor in exchange for management support, administrative, office space, and other services. We will cease paying these monthly fees 12 months from the date of the close of this offering. Regardless of whether the over-allotment option is exercised in full, the net proceeds from this offering available to us out of trust for our working capital requirements in searching for a business combination will be approximately $624,000. We intend to use the proceeds for expenses such as paying for due diligence, legal, accounting and other expenses of structuring and negotiating business combinations, as well as for reimbursement of any out-of-pocket expenses incurred by our officers, directors, initial stockholders or their affiliates in connection with activities on our behalf as described above, and for directors and officers liability insurance. The allocation of the net proceeds available to us outside of the trust account represents our best estimate of the intended uses of these funds. In the event that our assumptions prove to be inaccurate, we may reallocate some of such proceeds within the above-described categories.\n\nWe may use substantially all of the net proceeds of this offering, including the funds held in the trust account, to acquire a target business and to pay our expenses relating thereto. To the extent that our capital stock is used in whole or in part as consideration to effect a business combination, the proceeds held in the trust account which are not used to consummate a business combination will be disbursed to the combined company and will, along with any other net proceeds not expended, be used as working capital to finance the operations of the target business. Such working capital funds could be used in a variety of ways including continuing or expanding the target business’ operations, for strategic acquisitions and for marketing, research and development of existing or new products.\n\n45  \n---  \n  \nTo the extent we are unable to consummate a business combination, we will pay the costs of liquidation from our remaining assets outside of the trust account. If such funds are insufficient, we may use up to $100,000 of interest earned on the funds held in the trust account for our liquidation expenses.\n\nPrior to the closing of this offering, our sponsor has agreed to loan us up to $1,500,000 to be used for a portion of the expenses of the offering. As of September 30, 2023, we had borrowed $1,203,216 (of up to $1,500,000 available to us), of which $876,216 will be repaid in connection with the closing of the private placement warrant purchase that will occur simultaneously with the closing of this offering (leaving $327,000 outstanding), under the promissory note with our sponsor, which was used to pay a portion of the expenses of this offering referenced in the line items above for SEC registration fee, FINRA filing fee, any non-refundable portion of the NASDAQ listing fee not covered by EF Hutton, a portion of the legal and audit fees and other offering expenses. This loan is non-interest bearing, unsecured and repayable upon the earlier of (a) the date on which the SPAC consummates its initial business combination or, at the holder’s discretion, if there are excess proceeds, or (b) the date on which the Company concludes the initial public offering of its securities.\n\nWe believe that, upon consummation of this offering, the approximate $624,000 of net proceeds not held in the trust account will be sufficient to allow us to operate for the next 12 months, assuming that a business combination is not consummated during that time. However, if necessary, in order to meet our working capital needs following the consummation of this offering, our initial stockholders, officers, directors and their affiliates may, but are not obligated to, loan us funds, on a non-interest bearing basis, from time to time or at any time, in whatever amount they deem reasonable in their sole discretion. Each loan would be evidenced by a promissory note. The notes would either be paid upon consummation of our initial business combination, without interest, or, at holder’s discretion, on the date on which the Company determines conducts the initial public offering of its securities. The warrants would be identical to the private warrants. In the event that the initial business combination does not close, we may use a portion of the working capital held outside the trust account to repay such loaned amounts, but no proceeds from our trust account would be used for such repayment. These loans would be repaid at completion of the initial business combination. \n\nA public stockholder will be entitled to receive funds from the trust account (including interest earned on his, her or its portion of the trust account to the extent not previously released to us) only in the event of (i) our redemption of 100% of the outstanding public shares if we have not completed a business combination in the required time period, (ii) if that public stockholder converts such shares, or sells such shares to us in a tender offer, in connection with a business combination which we consummate or (iii) we seek to amend any provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation that would affect our public stockholders’ ability to convert or sell their shares to us as described herein or affect the substance or timing of our obligation to redeem 100% of our public shares if we do not complete a business combination within 12 months (or up to 18 months, if we extend the time to complete a business combination as described in this prospectus) from the closing of this offering. This redemption right shall apply in the event of the approval of any such amendment to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, whether proposed by our initial stockholders, executive officers, directors or any other person. In no other circumstances will a public stockholder have any right or interest of any kind to or in the trust account.\n\n46  \n---  \n  \n**DIVIDEND POLICY**\n\nWe have not paid any cash dividends on our common stock to date and do not intend to pay cash dividends prior to the completion of an initial business combination. The payment of cash dividends in the future will be dependent upon our revenues and earnings, if any, capital requirements and general financial condition subsequent to completion of a business combination. Further, if we incur any indebtedness, our ability to declare dividends may be limited by restrictive covenants we may agree to in connection therewith. The payment of any dividends subsequent to a business combination will be within the discretion of our Board of Directors at such time. It is the present intention of our Board of Directors to retain all earnings, if any, for use in our business operations and, accordingly, our Board of Directors does not anticipate declaring any dividends in the foreseeable future. In addition, our Board of Directors is not currently contemplating and does not anticipate declaring any stock dividends in the foreseeable future, except if we increase the size of the offering pursuant to Rule 462(b) under the Securities Act, in which case we will effect a stock dividend immediately prior to the consummation of the offering in such amount as to maintain the ownership of our initial stockholders at approximately 22% of our issued and outstanding shares of our common stock upon the consummation of this offering (assuming the initial stockholders do not purchase units in this offering).\n\n47  \n---  \n  \n**DILUTION**\n\nThe difference between the public offering price per share, assuming no value is attributed to the rights or warrants included in the units we are offering by this prospectus and the private warrants, and the pro forma net tangible book value per share after this offering constitutes the dilution to investors in this offering. Such calculation does not reflect any dilution associated with the sale and exercise of warrants, including the private warrants. Net tangible book value per share is determined by dividing our net tangible book value, which is our total tangible assets less total liabilities (including the value of shares of common stock which may be converted into cash or sold in a tender offer), by the number of outstanding shares of common stock.\n\nAt September 30, 2023, our net tangible book deficit was $1,419,166, or approximately $(0.73) per share of common stock. For purposes of the dilution calculation, in order to present the maximum estimated dilution as a result of this offering, we have assumed (i) the issuance of 0.20 of a share for each right outstanding, as such issuance will occur upon a business combination without the payment of additional consideration and (ii) the number of shares included in the units offered hereby will be deemed to be 7,200,000 (consisting of 6,000,000 shares included in the units we are offering by this prospectus and 1,200,000 shares for the outstanding rights), and the price per share in this offering will be deemed to be $8.33. After giving effect to the sale of 6,000,000 shares of common stock included in the units we are offering by this prospectus, the sale of the private warrants and the deduction of underwriting commissions, estimated expenses of this offering and proceeds held in the trust account subject to redemption/tender, our pro forma net tangible book value at September 30, 2023 would have been $(2,129,777) or $(0.73) per share, representing an immediate increase in net tangible book value (as decreased by the value of the approximately 6,000,000 shares of common stock that may be converted to cash and assuming no exercise of the underwriters’ over-allotment option) of $0.01 per share to our initial stockholders and an immediate dilution of $9.06 per share or 108.76% to our public stockholders not exercising their conversion rights. The decrease attributable to public shares subject to conversion is included in the calculation below at $10.00 per share, as all public stockholders have the right to convert. The dilution to new investors if the underwriters exercise their over-allotment option in full would be an immediate dilution of $9.04 per share or 108.52%.\n\nThe following table illustrates the dilution to the new investors on a per-share basis, assuming no value is attributed to the rights or warrants included in the units and the private warrants:\n\nWithout exercise of over-allotment option | With exercise of over- allotment option  \n---|---  \nPublic offering price | $8.33 | $8.33  \nNet tangible book value before this offering | $| (0.72| ) | (0.72| )  \nDecrease attributable to public stockholders and private sales | (0.01| ) | 0.01  \nPro forma net tangible book value after this offering | (0.73| ) | (0.71| )  \nDilution to public stockholders | $9.06 | $9.04  \nPercentage of dilution to public stockholders | 108.76| % | 108.52| %  \n  \nThe following table sets forth information with respect to our existing stockholders and the public stockholders:\n\nShares | Total Consideration | Average  \n---|---|---  \nNumber | Purchased | Percentage | Amount | Percentage | Price per Share  \nInitial stockholders | 1,680,000| (1)  | 18.84| % | $| 25,000 | 0.04| % | $| 0.0149  \nRepresentative Shares | 35,000 | 0.39| % | $| — | 0.0| % | $| 0.000  \nPublic stockholders | 7,200,000| (2) | 80.76| % | $| 60,000,000 | 99.96| % | $| 8.33  \nTotal | 8,915,000 | 100.00| % | $| 60,025,000 | 100.00| %  \n(1) | Assumes the over-allotment option has not been exercised and an aggregate of 252,000 Founder’s Shares have been forfeited as a result thereof.  \n---|---  \n(2) | Includes the issuance of an additional 1,200,000 shares underlying the rights contained in the public shareholders  \n  \nThe pro forma net tangible book value after the offering is calculated as follows:\n\nWithout over- allotment option | With over- allotment option  \n---|---  \nNumerator:  \nNet tangible book value before the offering | $| (1,419,166| ) | (1,419,166| )  \nNet proceeds from this offering and private placement and Representative Shares at IPO | 60,624,000 | 69,624,000  \nPlus: Offering costs accrued for and paid in advance, excluded from tangible book value before this offering | 941,806 | 941,806  \nOver-allotment liability | (86,417| ) | —  \nLess: Deferred underwriting commission | (2,190,000| ) | (2,518,500| )  \nLess: Proceeds held in trust subject to conversion/tender | (60,000,000| ) | (69,000,000| )  \n$| (2,129,777| ) | (2,371,860| )  \nDenominator:  \nShares of common stock outstanding prior to this offering | 1,680,000| (1) | 1,932,000  \nShares of common stock included in the units offered | 6,000,000 | 6,900,000  \nShares of common stock underlying the rights included in the units offered | 1,200,000 | 1,380,000  \nRepresentative Shares | 35,000 | 35,000  \nShares subject to redemption | (6,000,000| ) | (6,900,000| )  \n2,915,000 | 3,347,000  \n(1) | Assumes the over-allotment option has not been exercised and an aggregate of 252,000 Founder’s Shares have been forfeited as a result thereof.  \n---|---  \n  \n48  \n---  \n  \n**CAPITALIZATION**\n\nThe following table sets forth our capitalization at September 30, 2023and as adjusted to give effect to the sale of our units and the private warrants and the application of the estimated net proceeds derived from the sale of such securities:\n\nSeptember 30, 2023  \n---  \nActual | **As Adjusted(1)**  \nNotes payable from related party | $| 1,203,216 | $| —  \nDeferred underwriting commissions | — | 2,190,000  \nOver-allotment liability | — | 86,417  \nCommon stock, $0.0001 par value, –0– and 6,000,000 shares which are subject to possible conversion/tender | — | 60,000,000  \nStockholders’ deficit:  \nPreferred stock, $0.0001 par value, 1,000,000 shares authorized; none issued or outstanding | — | —  \nCommon stock, $0.0001 par value, 50,000,000 shares authorized; 1,932,000shares issued and outstanding, actual; 1,715,000 shares issued and outstanding (excluding 6,000,000 shares subject to possible conversion/tender), as adjusted | 193 | 171  \nAdditional paid-in capital | 24,807 | —  \nAccumulated deficit | (502,360| ) | (2,129,948| )  \nTotal stockholders’ deficit: | (477,360| ) | (2,129,777| )  \nTotal capitalization | $| 725,856 | $| 60,146,640  \n(1) | Includes the $2,457,000 we will receive from the sale of the private warrants.  \n---|---  \n(2) | Assumes the over-allotment option has not been exercised and an aggregate of 252,000 Founder’s Shares have been forfeited as a result thereof.  \n  \n49  \n---  \n  \n**MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS**\n\nWe were formed on November 23, 2021 for the purpose of entering into a merger, share exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, recapitalization, reorganization or other similar business combination with one or more target businesses. While we may pursue an initial business combination target in any business, industry or geographic location, we intend to search globally for target companies within the M&E industry with a primary focus on the United States, and in particular on identifying attractive targets among content studios and film production, family entertainment, animation, music, gaming, e-sports, talent management, talent-facing brands and businesses, and more. We intend to utilize cash derived from the proceeds of this offering, our securities, debt or a combination of cash, securities and debt, in effecting a business combination. The issuance of additional shares of common stock or preferred stock:\n\n• | may significantly reduce the equity interest of our stockholders;  \n---|---  \n• | may subordinate the rights of holders of shares of common stock if we issue shares of preferred stock with rights senior to those afforded to our shares of common stock;  \n• | will likely cause a change in control if a substantial number of our shares of common stock are issued, which may affect, among other things, our ability to use our net operating loss carry forwards, if any, and most likely will also result in the resignation or removal of our present officers and directors; and  \n• | may adversely affect prevailing market prices for our securities.  \nSimilarly, if we issue debt securities, it could result in:  \n• | default and foreclosure on our assets if our operating revenues after a business combination are insufficient to pay our debt obligations;  \n• | acceleration of our obligations to repay the indebtedness even if we have made all principal and interest payments when due if the debt security contains covenants that required the maintenance of certain financial ratios or reserves and we breach any such covenant without a waiver or renegotiation of that covenant;  \n• | our immediate payment of all principal and accrued interest, if any, if the debt security is payable on demand; and  \n• | our inability to obtain additional financing, if necessary, if the debt security contains covenants restricting our ability to obtain additional financing while such security is outstanding.  \n  \nWe have neither engaged in any operations nor generated any revenues to date. Our entire activity since inception has been to prepare for our proposed fundraising through an offering of our equity securities.\n\nWe are an emerging growth company as defined in the JOBS Act. As an emerging growth company, we have elected to delay the adoption of new or revised accounting standards that have different effective dates for public and private companies until those standards apply to private companies. As such, our financial statements may not be comparable to companies that comply with public company effective dates.\n\n**Liquidity and Capital Resources**\n\nAs indicated in the accompanying financial statements, at September 30, 2023 we had no cash and working capital deficit of $1,419,166. Further, we have incurred and expect to continue to incur significant costs in pursuit of our financing and acquisition plans. Management plans to address this uncertainty through this offering. We cannot assure you that our plans to raise capital or to consummate an initial business combination will be successful.\n\nOur liquidity needs have been satisfied, as of September 30, 2023, through the payment of certain of our deferred offering costs with the $25,000 purchase price of the Founder’s Shares and loans from our sponsor in an aggregate\n\n50  \n---  \n  \namount of $327,000 are more fully described below. We estimate that the net proceeds from (i) the sale of the units in this offering, after deducting offering expenses of approximately $1,650,000 and underwriting discounts and commissions of $510,000 (or $586,500 if the over-allotment option is exercised in full), excluding $2,190,000, or $2,518,500 if the over-allotment option is exercised in full, of deferred underwriting commissions, and (ii) the sale of the private warrants for a purchase price of $2,457,000 (or $2,533,500 if the over-allotment option is exercised in full) will be $60,624,000 (or $69,624,000 if the over-allotment option is exercised in full). Of this amount, $60,000,000 (or $69,000,000 if the over-allotment option is exercised in full) will be held in the trust account. The remaining $624,000 will not be held in trust.\n\nWe may use substantially all of the net proceeds of this offering, including the funds held in the trust account, to acquire a target business and to pay our expenses relating thereto. To the extent that our capital stock is used in whole or in part as consideration to effect a business combination, the remaining proceeds held in the trust account as well as any other net proceeds not expended will be used as working capital to finance the operations of the target business. Such working capital funds could be used in a variety of ways including continuing or expanding the target business’ operations, for strategic acquisitions and for marketing, research and development of existing or new products. Such funds could also be used to repay any operating expenses or finders’ fees which we had incurred prior to the completion of our business combination if the funds available to us outside of the trust account were insufficient to cover such expenses.\n\nWe believe that, upon consummation of this offering, the approximate $624,000 of net proceeds not held in the trust account, together with the interest earned on the funds held in the trust account available to us for working capital needs, will be sufficient to allow us to operate for at least the next 18 months, assuming that a business combination is not consummated during that time. Over this time period, we will be using these funds for identifying and evaluating prospective acquisition candidates, performing business due diligence on prospective target businesses, traveling to and from the offices, plants or similar locations of prospective target businesses, reviewing corporate documents and material agreements of prospective target businesses, selecting the target business to acquire and structuring, negotiating and consummating the business combination. We anticipate that we will incur approximately:\n\n• | $200,000 of expenses for legal, accounting due diligence, travel, and other expenses in connection with any business combination;  \n---|---  \n• | $75,000 of expenses in legal and accounting fees relating to our regulatory reporting obligations;  \n• | $144,000 for management support, administrative, office space, and other services ($12,000 per month); and   \n• | $205,000 for working capital and other expenses including directors and officers insurance premiums   \n  \nIf our estimates of the above costs are less than the actual costs, we may have insufficient funds available to operate our business prior to our initial business combination. Moreover, we may need to obtain additional financing either to consummate our initial business combination or because we become obligated to redeem a significant number of our public shares upon consummation of our initial business combination, in which case we may issue additional securities or incur debt in connection with such business combination. We do not have a maximum debt leverage ratio or a policy with respect to how much debt we may incur. The amount of debt we will be willing to incur will depend on the facts and circumstances of the proposed business combination and market conditions at the time of the potential business combination. At this time, we are not party to any arrangement or understanding with any third party with respect to raising additional funds through the sale of our securities or the incurrence of debt. Subject to compliance with applicable securities laws, we would only consummate such financing simultaneously with the consummation of our initial business combination. In the current economic environment, it has become especially difficult to obtain acquisition financing. Additionally, following our initial business combination, if cash on hand is insufficient, we may need to obtain additional financing in order to meet our obligations.\n\n51  \n---  \n  \n**Related Party Transactions**\n\nPrior to the closing of this offering, our sponsor has agreed to loan us up to $1,500,000 to be used for a portion of the expenses of this offering. As of September 30, 2023, we had borrowed $1,203,216 (of up to $1,500,000) available to us) under the promissory note with our sponsor, of which $876,216 will be repaid in connection with the closing of the private placement warrant purchase that will occur simultaneously with the closing of this offering, leaving $327,000 to be repayable either on (a) the date on which the SPAC consummates its initial business combination or, at the holder’s discretion, if funds allow, or (b) the date on which the Company concludes the initial public offering of its securities. This loan is non-interest bearing, unsecured and will be repaid with proceeds not held in the trust account.\n\nOur sponsor, Bengochea SPAC Sponsors I LLC, has committed it will purchase 2,457,000 private warrants at $1.00 per private warrant (for a total purchase price of $2,457,000) from us. This purchase will take place on a private placement basis simultaneously with the consummation of this offering. It has also agreed that if the over-allotment option is exercised by the underwriters in full or in part, it and/or its designees will purchase from us additional private warrants on a pro rata basis (up to a maximum of 76,500 private warrants at a price of $1.00 per private warrant) in an amount that is necessary to maintain in the trust account $10.00 per unit sold to the public in this offering, without taking into account any interest earned on such funds or any increase as a result of our extending the time to consummate a business combination as described herein. These additional private warrants will be purchased in a private placement that will occur simultaneously with the purchase of units resulting from the exercise of the over-allotment option.\n\nWe do not believe we will need to raise additional funds following this offering in order to meet the expenditures required for operating our business. However, in order to finance transaction costs in connection with an intended initial business combination, our initial stockholders, officers, directors or their affiliates may, but are not obligated to, loan us funds on a non-interest bearing basis as may be required. If we consummate an initial business combination, we would repay such loaned amounts. In the event that the initial business combination does not close, we may use a portion of the working capital held outside the trust account to repay such loaned amounts, but no proceeds from our trust account would be used for such repayment.\n\n**Controls and Procedures**\n\nWe are not currently required to maintain an effective system of internal controls as defined by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. We will be required to comply with the internal control requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2024. As of the date of this prospectus, we have not completed an assessment, nor have our auditors tested our systems, of internal controls. We expect to assess the internal controls of our target business or businesses prior to the completion of our initial business combination and, if necessary, to implement and test additional controls as we may determine are necessary in order to state that we maintain an effective system of internal controls. A target business may not be in compliance with the provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act regarding the adequacy of internal controls. Target businesses we may consider for a business combination may have internal controls that need improvement in areas such as:\n\n• | staffing for financial, accounting and external reporting areas, including segregation of duties;  \n---|---  \n• | reconciliation of accounts;  \n• | proper recording of expenses and liabilities in the period to which they relate;  \n• | evidence of internal review and approval of accounting transactions;  \n• | documentation of processes, assumptions and conclusions underlying significant estimates; and  \n• | documentation of accounting policies and procedures.  \n  \n52  \n---  \n  \nBecause it will take time, management involvement and perhaps outside resources to determine what internal control improvements are necessary for us to meet regulatory requirements and market expectations for our operation of a target business, we may incur significant expense in meeting our public reporting responsibilities, particularly in the areas of designing, enhancing, or remediating internal and disclosure controls. Doing so effectively may also take longer than we expect, thus increasing our exposure to financial fraud or erroneous financing reporting.\n\nOnce our management’s report on internal controls is complete, we will retain our independent auditors to audit and render an opinion on such report when required by Section 404. The independent auditors may identify additional issues concerning a target business’s internal controls while performing their audit of internal control over financial reporting.\n\n**Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure**\n\nOn May 24, 2023, our Company’s Board of Directors ratified the dismissal of Marcum LLP (the “Former Auditor”) as the Company’s independent registered public accounting firm, effective as of May 17, 2023. The dismissal was not due to any disagreements with the Former Auditor on any matter of accounting principles or practices, financial statement disclosure, or auditing scope or procedure.\n\nThe reports of the Former Auditor on the Company’s financial statements for the period from November 23, 2021 (inception) through December 31, 2021 did not contain an adverse opinion or a disclaimer of opinion, and was not qualified or modified as to uncertainty, audit scope or accounting principles except that the report contained an explanatory paragraph stating that there was substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. For the period from November 23, 2021 (inception) through the date of the Former Auditor’s termination on May 17, 2023, there were no “disagreements” ​(as defined in Item 304(a)(1)(iv) of Regulation S-K and related instructions) with the Former Auditor on any matter of accounting principles or practices, financial statement disclosure or auditing scope or procedure, which disagreements if not resolved to the satisfaction of the Former Auditor would have caused the Former Auditor to make reference thereto in its reports on the financial statements for such period. During the period November 23, 2021 (inception) through the date of the Former Auditor’s termination on May 17, 2023, there were no “reportable events” ​(as defined in Item 304(a)(1)(v) of Regulation S-K).\n\nThe Company provided the Former Auditor with a copy of the disclosure it is making herein in this section of the prospectus, and requested that the Former Auditor furnish the Company with a copy of its letter addressed to the SEC, stating whether or not the Former Auditor agrees with the statements related to them made by the Company in this prospectus. A copy of the former Auditor’s letter to the SEC dated October 18, 2023 is attached as Exhibit 16 to the registration of this prospectus forms a part.\n\nOn May 24, 2023, the Board of Directors of our company ratified the appointment of MaloneBailey, LLP, as the Company’s new independent registered public accounting firm, effective as of the signing of MaloneBailey, LLP’s engagement letter on May 23, 2023, to perform independent audit services on the balance sheets of our company, as of December 31, 2022, and December 31, 2021, and the related statements of operations, changes in stockholder’s equity, and cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2022, and for the period from November 23, 2021 (inception) through December 31, 2021.\n\nDuring the period from November 23, 2021 (inception) to the date of MaloneBailey, LLP’s engagement, May 23, 2023, we, or anyone on our behalf, did not consult with MaloneBailey, LLP regarding either (i) the application of accounting principles to a specified transaction, either completed or proposed, or the type of audit opinion that might be rendered with respect to the consolidated financial statements of the Company, and no written report or oral advice was provided to the Company by MaloneBailey, LLP that was an important factor considered by the Company in reaching a decision as to any accounting, auditing or financial reporting issue; or (ii) any matter that was the subject of a “disagreement” ​(as defined in Item 304(a)(1)(iv) of Regulation S-K and the related instructions) or a “reportable event” ​(as that term is defined in Item 304(a)(1)(v) of Regulation S-K).\n\n**Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk**\n\nThe net proceeds of this offering, including amounts in the trust account, will, if they are invested at all, only be invested in United States “government securities” within the meaning of Section 2(a)(16) of the Investment Company Act having a maturity of 185 days or less, or in money market funds meeting certain conditions under Rule 2a-7 promulgated under the Investment Company Act which invest only in direct U.S. government treasury obligations. Due to the short-term nature of these investments, we believe there will be no associated material exposure to interest rate risk.\n\n**Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements; Commitments and Contractual Obligations; Quarterly Results**\n\nAs of the date of this prospectus, we did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of Regulation S-K and did not have any commitments or contractual obligations. No unaudited quarterly operating data is included in this prospectus as we have conducted no operations to date.\n\n53  \n---  \n  \n**PROPOSED BUSINESS**\n\n**General**\n\nWe are a blank check company incorporated as a Delaware corporation whose business purpose is to effect a merger, capital stock exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses. We have not selected any specific business combination target and we have not, nor has anyone on our behalf, engaged in any substantive discussions, directly or indirectly, with any business combination target with respect to an initial business combination with us. While we may pursue an initial business combination target in any business, industry or geographic location, we intend to search globally for target companies within the M&E industry with a primary focus on the United States, and in particular on identifying attractive targets among content studios and film production, family entertainment, animation, music, gaming, e-sports, talent management, talent-facing brands and businesses.\n\n**Overview**\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic catalyzed immense and dramatic power shifts in the vast, interconnected M&E industry, which surged to $2.2 trillion in global revenues in 2021 and is expected to reach $2.6 trillion by 2025 according to a 2021 report by PricewaterhouseCoopers.2 A clear driver of change in this space has been the new potential of AI-based technologies plus the evolution of digital consumption, especially as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, as a sustained revenue driver existing alongside traditional media consumption channels. Consumers’ embrace of the new ecosystem helped offset revenue declines due to pandemic-related closures and has created heightened growth opportunities for media & entertainment companies.\n\nAs a result, our management team believes a number of strong and growing M&E businesses are now in a position where capital and expertise are needed to achieve their full growth potential. While some M&E business have turned to consolidation, others are seeking capital and scale through alternative means that maintain independence from larger conglomerates. This includes, for instance, celebrity-owned studios and production houses with robust content pipelines seeking enhanced scale; new media entities (e.g., podcast, music rights and IP aggregators, e-Sports) looking for capital to continue their growth trajectory; undervalued talent-facing companies with solid business fundamentals, such as large agencies and PR firms; and non-traditional business divisions, such as virtual reality or animated digital production houses, trapped within traditional media companies.\n\n**Business Strategy**\n\nWe believe that our team has desirable attributes to potential targets in the M&E space. Our team is a multi-cultural, multi-ethnic mixture of seasoned public-company executives, Hollywood insiders, media operators, media investors, and individuals with ample public markets and M&A experience. Our team has demonstrated an extensive track record of successful acquisitions, value creation, and value enhancement in media & entertainment industry and has access to proprietary opportunities globally that can be leveraged to drive value. Our team’s proprietary connections include touchpoints to, for example, celebrity-owned studios and brands, family entertainment media, animation, talent management, and music, including direct relationships with many celebrities.\n\n2 Global Entertainment & Media Outlook 2022-2026 (pwc.com), PricewaterhouseCoopers. June 20, 2022, https://www.pwc.com/gx/en/news-room/press-releases/2022/global-entertainment-and-media-outlook-2022-2026.html.\n\n54  \n---  \n  \nOur team’s track record extends to successful experiences negotiating deals with numerous studios, franchises, agencies, distributors and streamers, as well as experience working directly with talent and production studios, navigating M&E companies through acquisition transactions (as both acquiror and acquiree), expanding product ranges for existing businesses, and providing strategic guidance to develop revenue and commercial opportunities.\n\nFurthermore, we believe our team’s diversity is especially attractive to prospective M&E targets and a key competitive advantage to achieving higher value. The U.S. M&E sector is one of the least diverse of all industries, with 92% of film executives, for instance, being white, according to a 2021 McKinsey & Company report. The same report found this has translated into substantial loses for the industry, with an estimated minimum $10 billion in revenue lost due to a lack of representation.3\n\nGiven the wealth of data supporting the reality that diverse teams outperform non-diverse counterparts, our diverse management team represents a core advantage for our company; we believe our team’s diversity will make us more attractive to M&E targets, both in terms of addressing diversity gaps and in terms of helping prospective targets achieve higher returns once public.\n\n**Management Team**\n\nOur management team has a long history of value creation in the private and public markets, with a strong track record of creating value for stockholders including through acquiring and operating successful businesses within our target sectors. In particular, many of the companies our team has invested in or operated have been affiliated with celebrity partners, and several members of our team have become trusted partners with celebrities and business owners. We believe this unique network of relationships and extensive experience sourcing and executing transactions will enhance our ability to complete a successful business combination and accelerate the growth trajectory and profitability of the acquired business post-business combination.\n\nWe believe that we are well positioned to identify attractive acquisition opportunities in the M&E industry, in particular because our team will utilize their access to industry contacts and proprietary deal flow to generate business combination opportunities. We believe that our team’s networks in particular will broaden our access to potential transaction opportunities outside typical competitive deal sourcing intermediaries. Our team is well-connected in our target sectors and, as such we have the opportunity to be potential targets’ preferred partner for opportunities that they might think are appropriate for a SPAC acquisition. Illustrative networks, for instance, include the networks and accolades of Mr. Hertz, Mr. Yada, and Mr. Melendez.\n\nMr. Hertz, who is an independent director on our Board and chair of our Executive Committee, works closely with the Smith Family Circle and is a director for JUST GOODS, as well as an advisor to the Smith Family’s marquee media and branded products company, Westbrook Inc. Mr. Hertz is also a Senior Partner in the Los Angeles law firm of Hertz Lichtenstein Young & Polk LLP, which represents some of the most\n\n3 “Race in the workplace: The Black experience in the US private sector” McKinsey & Company.\n\n55  \n---  \n  \nprominent talent, entrepreneurs, agencies and brands in the entertainment, fashion, sports, media, and technology. Prior to joining the firm, Mr. Hertz oversaw music – business and legal affairs – for The Walt Disney Company. Mr. Hertz is also a principal in memBrain – an entertainment marketing and strategy consulting firm. memBrain advises numerous Fortune 500 and emerging ventures in various industries, such as Hasbro, McDonald’s, Intel, UBS, the NY Islanders, and Logitech.\n\nKosaku Yada and Miguel Melendez, who serve as our strategic advisors, are also deeply integrated with several media companies and celebrity circles. Mr. Yada is the CEO and a co-founder of Westbrook Inc., as well as a director for the Smith Family Circle, Founding CEO of the Smith Family Circle, a Board Member of JUST Goods, Inc, and Managing Partner at Dreamers VC. Mr. Melendez is also a Westbrook Inc. co-founder, as well as a co-founder of Just Water and a partner in Three Six Zero Entertainment. He has been a talent and business management executive for over three decades, during which time he has established and guided the careers of numerous recording artists and international pop acts, including Academy Award and Grammy Award winner Jennifer Hudson, Grammy Award winning artist Robin Thicke and Teddy Riley’s Blackstreet. Mr. Melendez’s creative partnerships have also produced a variety of successful content in both television and film including the Emmy Award winning Facebook Watch series, Red Table Talk, the critically acclaimed TNT series _Hawthorne,_ and the Queen Latifah Talk Show for CBS.\n\nThe networks and experiences of our other members are discussed in more detail in the section titled “ _Management Team_ ” and we believe each individual member of our team features a comparably strong mixture of experiences and networks which we feel constitutes a strong advantage to successfully consummating a deal. The Chairman of our Board, Mr. Turner, for example, was formerly Chair of the Board of Microvision, Inc. (NASDAQ: MVIS), a public company in the lidar space, and is currently the company’s Audit Committee chairman. He has served on numerous public and private companies boards of directors as well. Mr. Turner was the Chief Financial Officer of Coinstar Inc. from 2003 until June 2009 and was CFO when the company acquired Redbox. He also previously served as Senior Vice President of Operations, Chief Financial Officer, and Treasurer of Real Networks, Inc., a digital media and technology company.\n\nSimilarly, our Chief Executive Officer Mr. Bengochea has extensive media experience. Mr. Bengochea is currently Founder and Chief Executive Officer of Bengochea Capital LLC, an investment firm founded in 2020 to pursue frontier asset classes and, through Mr. Bengochea’s network of connections to various industry executives and celebrities, to examine global opportunities in media and entertainment. Bengochea Capital has been present at the Cannes Film Festival, among other prestigious events, and was a registered media entity with the Recording Academy for the 2023 Grammy Awards, and is a registered media entity with the Recording Academy for the upcoming 2024 Grammy Awards. Prior to founding Bengochea Capital, Mr. Bengochea worked for Sony’s Global Business Development team in Los Angeles and, before that, practiced law as a corporate attorney at the law firm of Jenner & Block in New York City. Mr. Bengochea holds an A.B. summa cum laude from Harvard University, a J.D. from Harvard Law School, and an M.B.A. from Harvard Business School. \n\nMrs. Waxman also represents a wealth of media experience. Throughout her 30-year tenure at 20th Century Fox, Mrs. Waxman served in a variety of roles within the finance organization. Most notably, as Executive Vice President and Deputy CFO, she was responsible for driving strategic priorities, setting financial priorities, policies and procedures and controls for the global finance organization. She also provided financial leadership and guidance to over 300 employees in all finance divisions including film production, theatrical, home entertainment and television marketing and distribution, financial reporting, accounting, corporate compliance, and strategic sourcing. Before joining 20th Century Fox, Ms. Waxman was a Senior Auditor at Ernst & Young.\n\n**Commitment to Diversity**\n\nAs a first generation American and native Spanish speaker, Mr. Bengochea is a passionate advocate for greater Hispanic and general diversity in entertainment, media, and in the public markets, and for promoting more people of color in executive leadership level. \n\nSeveral members of our team also champion diversity of leadership and investment. This is a statistical rarity in both the public markets and in the SPAC space, and that the team believes there is high demand to remedy this disparity in both in the public markets and in the media and entertainment industry. Reports such as the aforementioned McKinsey & Company finding that a lack of diversity is causing substantial losses in the media industry, we believe, further augments our team’s attractiveness to potential targets, and is a further point of differentiation in the marketplace. \n\n56  \n---  \n  \n**Acquisition Strategy**\n\nOur team will leverage its skills, expertise and strong network within Hollywood and other international M&E hubs to identify attractive target companies and provide guidance on the benefits of being a publicly-traded entity, including broader access to capital, increased liquidity for potential acquisitions, expanded branding opportunities in the marketplace, and reputational and consumer confidence gains, and on the process of transitioning from a private company to a public registrant. We will also be able to source potential targets from our team’s contacts within private equity, with celebrities, with M&E investors, and with various industry leaders. Upon completion of this offering, each of our team members will communicate our acquisition criteria to their respective networks and immediately begin screening opportunities.\n\nConsistent with this strategy, we have identified parameters and criteria that we think are important and relevant in evaluating prospective target businesses. We will apply these parameters in evaluating prospects, even though we may ultimately decide to execute our initial business combination with a fundamentally strong company that may not match all of our initial parameters:\n\n• | **Growth Prospects** : We intend to seek companies with high growth trajectories within the M&E industry that are driven by competitive advantages that can be accelerated or magnified through a partnership with us and access to the public markets.  \n---|---  \n• | **Earnings Potential** : We intend to acquire one or more businesses that have multiple and diverse potential drivers of revenue and earnings growth and that have the potential to generate strong and stable free cash flow.  \n• | **M &E Focus**: We intend to prioritize entities within our team’s core spheres of expertise and from among our team’s proprietary connections, such as celebrity content producers and brands, family entertainment, animation, gaming, and music businesses which we believe have benefited from the evolving M&E ecosystem. This includes businesses in entertainment for which AI can enhance cash flows by improving efficiency or output or reduce costs.  \n• | **Diversity** : We intend to seek targets that can benefit from our team’s diversity and relationships in the M&E sector. This includes prospective targets who can enhance their existing business and generate value by working with individual members of our team or becoming part of our team’s network; targets who are minority owned-or-operated; and targets who wish to increase or highlight their executive diversity.   \n• | **Public Advantages** : We intend to seek target companies that are public market ready and whose leadership teams have the vision to take advantage of and appreciate the benefits of becoming a publicly-traded entity.  \n• | **Evolving Circumstance** : We intend to seek companies which are capitalizing on M&E industry shifts and trends created by various factors such as the COVID-19 pandemic and the migration from cable television to streaming services.  \n• | **Valuations** : We consider ourselves to be rigorous, disciplined and valuation-centric investors, with a keen understanding of market value and successful track record. We intend to seek companies with a respectable market share and growth potential in the segments in which they operate. We expect that the COVID-19 pandemic and ongoing turbulence in the market, such as the recent SAG-AFTRA strike, have continued to disrupt a number of companies within the M&E industry that may also be available at a discount.   \n  \n57  \n---  \n  \nThese criteria are not intended to be exhaustive. Any evaluation relating to the merits of a particular initial business combination may be based, to the extent relevant, on these general guidelines, as well as other considerations, factors and criteria deemed relevant by our management in effecting our initial business combination consistent with our business objectives. In the event that we decide to enter into our initial business combination with a target business that does not meet any of the above criteria and guidelines, we will disclose that the target business does not meet any of the above criteria in our stockholder communications related to our initial business combination. In evaluating a prospective target business, we expect to conduct a due diligence review which may encompass, among other things, meetings with incumbent management and employees, document reviews, interviews of customers and suppliers, inspections of facilities, as well as reviewing financial and other information which will be made available to us.\n\nOur management team’s existing M&E connections are expected to position us favorably as a business partner with a number of prospective targets. We are not prohibited from pursuing a business combination with a company that is affiliated with our sponsor, officers or directors. In the event that we seek to complete a business combination with a business that is affiliated with our sponsor, officers or directors, we, or a committee of independent directors, expect to obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm or another independent entity that commonly renders valuation opinions that our business combination is fair to our stockholders from a financial point of view. In the event that we seek such a business combination, we expect that the independent members of our Board of Directors would be involved in approving the transaction.\n\n**_Sources of Target Businesses_**\n\nWhile we have not yet selected a target business with which to consummate our initial business combination, we believe based on our management’s business knowledge and past experience that there are numerous potential candidates. We expect that our principal means of identifying potential target businesses will be through the extensive contacts and relationships of our initial stockholders, officers and directors. While our officers and directors are not required to commit any specific amount of time in identifying or performing due diligence on potential target businesses, our officers and directors believe that the relationships they have developed over their careers will generate a number of potential business combination opportunities that will warrant further investigation. We also anticipate that target business candidates will be brought to our attention from various unaffiliated sources, including investment bankers, venture capital funds, private equity funds, leveraged buyout funds, management buyout funds and other members of the financial community. Target businesses may be brought to our attention by such unaffiliated sources as a result of being solicited by us through calls or mailings. These sources may also introduce us to target businesses they think we may be interested in on an unsolicited basis, since many of these sources will have read this prospectus and know what types of businesses we are targeting.\n\nOur officers and directors must present to us all target business opportunities that have a fair market value of at least 80% of the assets held in the trust account (net of deferred underwriting commissions and taxes payable) at the time of the agreement to enter into the initial business combination, subject to any fiduciary or contractual obligations. While we do not presently anticipate engaging the services of professional firms or other individuals that specialize in business acquisitions on any formal basis, we may engage the services of professional firms or other individuals that specialize in business acquisitions, in which event we may pay a finder’s fee, consulting fee or other compensation to be determined in an arm’s length negotiation based on the terms of the transaction, with such fee potentially coming from the $12,000 per month fee we have allocated for various management services as discussed throughout this prospectus.\n\n58  \n---  \n  \nOur audit committee will review and approve all reimbursements and payments made to our initial stockholders, officers, directors or our or their respective affiliates, with any interested director abstaining from such review and approval.\n\nWe have no present intention to enter into a business combination with a target business that is affiliated with any of our officers, directors or initial stockholders. However, we are not restricted from entering into any such transactions and may do so if (i) such transaction is approved by a majority of our disinterested independent directors and (ii) we obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm, or another independent entity that commonly renders valuation opinions, that the business combination is fair to our unaffiliated stockholders from a financial point of view.\n\n**_Selection of a Target Business and Structuring of a Business Combination_**\n\nSubject to our management team’s fiduciary obligations and the limitations that a target business have a fair market value of at least 80% of the balance in the trust account (net of deferred underwriting commissions and taxes payable) at the time of the execution of a definitive agreement for our initial business combination, as described below in more detail, and that we must acquire a controlling interest in the target business, our management will have virtually unrestricted flexibility in identifying and selecting a prospective target business. We have not established any specific attributes or criteria (financial or otherwise) for prospective target businesses. In evaluating a prospective target business, our management may consider a variety of factors, including one or more of the following:\n\n• | financial condition and results of operation;  \n---|---  \n• | growth potential;  \n• | brand recognition and potential;  \n• | experience and skill of management and availability of additional personnel;  \n• | capital requirements;  \n• | competitive position;  \n• | barriers to entry;  \n• | stage of development of the products, processes or services;  \n• | existing distribution and potential for expansion;  \n• | degree of current or potential market acceptance of the products, processes or services;  \n• | proprietary aspects of our tangible and intangible assets and the extent of intellectual property or other protections for our products, formulas, brands or media;   \n• | impact of regulation on the business;  \n• | regulatory environment of the industry;  \n• | costs associated with effecting the business combination;  \n• | industry leadership, sustainability of market share and attractiveness of industries in which a target business participates; and  \n• | macro competitive dynamics in the industry within which the company competes.  \n  \n59  \n---  \n  \nThese criteria are not intended to be exhaustive. Any evaluation relating to the merits of a particular business combination will be based, to the extent relevant, on the above factors as well as other considerations deemed relevant by our management in effecting a business combination consistent with our business objective. In evaluating a prospective target business, we will conduct an extensive due diligence review which will encompass, among other things, meetings with incumbent management and inspection of facilities, as well as review of financial and other information which is made available to us. This due diligence review will be conducted either by our management or by unaffiliated third parties we may engage, although we have no current intention to engage any such third parties.\n\nThe time and costs required to select and evaluate a target business and to structure and complete the business combination cannot presently be ascertained with any degree of certainty. Any costs incurred with respect to the identification and evaluation of a prospective target business with which a business combination is not ultimately completed will result in a loss to us and reduce the amount of capital available to otherwise complete a business combination.\n\n**_Fair Market Value of Target Business_**\n\nNASDAQ listing rules require that the target business or businesses that we acquire must collectively have a fair market value equal to at least 80% of the balance of the funds in the trust account (net of deferred underwriting commissions and taxes payable) at the time of the execution of a definitive agreement for our initial business combination. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if we are not then listed on NASDAQ for whatever reason, we would no longer be required to meet the foregoing 80% fair market value test.\n\nWe currently anticipate structuring a business combination to acquire 100% of the equity interests or assets of the target business or businesses. We may, however, structure our initial business combination where we merge directly with the target business or a newly formed subsidiary or where we acquire less than 100% of such interests or assets of the target business in order to meet certain objectives of the target management team or stockholders or for other reasons, but we do not intend to complete such business combination unless the post-transaction company owns or acquires 50% or more of the outstanding voting securities of the target or otherwise acquires a controlling interest in the target sufficient for it not to be required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act. Even if the post-transaction company owns or acquires 50% or more of the voting securities of the target, our stockholders prior to the business combination may collectively own a minority interest in the post-transaction company, depending on valuations ascribed to the target and us in the business combination transaction. For example, we could pursue a transaction in which we issue a substantial number of new shares in exchange for all of the outstanding capital stock of a target. In this case, we could acquire a 100% controlling interest in the target; however, as a result of the issuance of a substantial number of new shares, our stockholders immediately prior to our initial business combination could own less than a majority of our outstanding shares subsequent to our initial business combination. If less than 100% of the equity interests or assets of a target business or businesses are owned or acquired by the post-transaction company, the portion of such business or businesses that is owned or acquired is what will be valued for purposes of the 80% of trust account balance test.\n\nThe fair market value of the target will be determined by our Board of Directors based upon one or more standards generally accepted by the financial community (such as actual and potential sales, earnings, cash flow and/or book value). The proxy solicitation materials or tender offer documents used by us in connection with any proposed transaction will provide public stockholders with our analysis of the fair market value of the target business, as well as the basis for our determinations. If our board is not able to independently determine that the target business has a sufficient fair market value, we will obtain an opinion from an unaffiliated, independent investment banking firm, or another independent entity that commonly renders valuation opinions, with respect to the satisfaction of such criteria. We will not be required to obtain an opinion from an investment banking firm as to the fair market value if our Board of Directors independently determines that the target business complies with the 80% threshold.\n\n**_Lack of Business Diversification_**\n\nWe may seek to effect a business combination with more than one target business, although we expect to complete our business combination with just one business. Therefore, at least initially, the prospects for our success may be entirely dependent upon the future performance of a single business operation. Unlike other entities which\n\n60  \n---  \n  \nmay have the resources to complete several business combinations of entities operating in multiple industries or multiple areas of a single industry, it is probable that we will not have the resources to diversify our operations or benefit from the possible spreading of risks or offsetting of losses. By consummating a business combination with only a single entity, our lack of diversification may:\n\n• | subject us to numerous economic, competitive and regulatory developments, any or all of which may have a substantial adverse impact upon the particular industry in which we may operate subsequent to a business combination, and  \n---|---  \n• | result in our dependency upon the performance of a single operating business or the development or market acceptance of a single or limited number of products, processes or services.  \n  \nIf we determine to simultaneously acquire several businesses and such businesses are owned by different sellers, we will need for each of such sellers to agree that our purchase of its business is contingent on the simultaneous closings of the other acquisitions, which may make it more difficult for us, and delay our ability, to complete the business combination. With multiple acquisitions, we could also face additional risks, including additional burdens and costs with respect to possible multiple negotiations and due diligence investigations (if there are multiple sellers) and the additional risks associated with the subsequent assimilation of the operations and services or products of the acquired companies in a single operating business.\n\n**_Limited Ability to Evaluate the Target Business’ Management_**\n\nAlthough we intend to scrutinize the management of a prospective target business when evaluating the desirability of effecting a business combination, we cannot assure you that our assessment of the target business’ management will prove to be correct. In addition, we cannot assure you that the management team will have the necessary skills, qualifications or abilities to manage a public company. Furthermore, the future role of our officers and directors, if any, in the target business following a business combination cannot presently be stated with any certainty. While it is possible that some of our key personnel will remain associated in senior management or advisory positions with us following a business combination, it is unlikely that they will devote their full-time efforts to our affairs subsequent to a business combination. Moreover, they would only be able to remain with the company after the consummation of a business combination if they are able to negotiate employment or consulting agreements in connection with the business combination. Such negotiations would take place simultaneously with the negotiation of the business combination and could provide for them to receive compensation in the form of cash payments and/or our securities for services they would render to the company after the consummation of the business combination. While the personal and financial interests of our key personnel may influence their motivation in identifying and selecting a target business, their ability to remain with the company after the consummation of a business combination will not be the determining factor in our decision as to whether or not we will proceed with any potential business combination. Additionally, we cannot assure you that our officers and directors will have significant experience or knowledge relating to the operations of the particular target business.\n\nFollowing a business combination, we may seek to recruit additional managers to supplement the incumbent management of the target business. We cannot assure you that we will have the ability to recruit additional managers, or that any such additional managers we do recruit will have the requisite skills, knowledge or experience necessary to enhance the incumbent management.\n\n**_Stockholders May Not Have the Ability to Approve an Initial Business Combination_**\n\nIn connection with any proposed business combination, we will either (1) seek stockholder approval of our initial business combination at a meeting called for such purpose at which stockholders may seek to convert their shares, regardless of whether they vote for or against the proposed business combination or don’t vote at all, into their pro rata share of the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account (net of taxes payable), or (2) provide our stockholders with the opportunity to sell their shares to us by means of a tender offer (and thereby avoid the need for a stockholder vote) for an amount equal to their pro rata share of the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account (net of taxes payable), in each case subject to the limitations described herein and in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation. The decision as to whether we will seek stockholder approval of a proposed business combination or will allow stockholders to sell their shares to us in a tender offer will be\n\n61  \n---  \n  \nmade by us, solely in our discretion, and will be based on a variety of factors such as the timing of the transaction and whether the terms of the transaction would otherwise require us to seek stockholder approval. If we determine to engage in a tender offer, such tender offer will be structured so that each stockholder may tender all of his, her or its shares rather than some pro rata portion of his, her or its shares. In that case, we will file tender offer documents with the SEC which will contain substantially the same financial and other information about the initial business combination as is required under the SEC’s proxy rules. Whether we seek stockholder approval or engage in a tender offer, we will consummate our initial business combination only if a majority of the outstanding shares of common stock voted are voted in favor of the business combination. We have no specified maximum percentage threshold for conversions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and even those public stockholders who vote in favor of our initial business combination have the right to convert their public shares. As a result, this may make it easier for us to consummate our initial business combination.\n\nIf we seek to consummate an initial business combination with a target business that imposes any type of working capital closing condition or requires us to have a minimum amount of funds available from the trust account upon consummation of such initial business combination, this may force us to seek third party financing which may not be available on terms acceptable to us or at all. As a result, we may not be able to consummate such initial business combination and we may not be able to locate another suitable target within the applicable time period, if at all. Public stockholders may therefore have to wait 12 months (or up to 18 months, if we extend the time to complete a business combination as described in this prospectus) from the closing of this offering in order to be able to receive a pro rata share of the trust account.\n\nOur initial stockholders, officers and directors have agreed (1) to vote any shares of common stock owned by them in favor of any proposed business combination, (2) not to convert any shares of common stock in connection with a stockholder vote to approve a proposed initial business combination and (3) not sell any shares of common stock in any tender in connection with a proposed initial business combination.\n\nNone of our officers, directors, initial stockholders or their affiliates has indicated any intention to purchase units or shares of common stock in this offering or from persons in the open market or in private transactions. However, if we hold a meeting to approve a proposed business combination and a significant number of stockholders vote, or indicate an intention to vote, against such proposed business combination or that they wish to convert their shares, our officers, directors, initial stockholders or their affiliates could make such purchases in the open market or in private transactions in order to reduce the number of conversions. Notwithstanding the foregoing, our officers, directors, initial stockholders and their affiliates will not make purchases of shares of common stock if the purchases would violate Section 9(a)(2) or Rule 10b-5 of the Exchange Act, which are rules designed to stop potential manipulation of a company’s stock.\n\n**_Conversion Rights_**\n\nAt any meeting called to approve an initial business combination, public stockholders may seek to convert their shares, regardless of whether they vote for or against the proposed business combination or do not vote at all, into their pro rata share of the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account as of two business days prior to the consummation of the initial business combination, less any taxes then due but not yet paid. Alternatively, we may provide our public stockholders with the opportunity to sell their shares of our common stock to us through a tender offer (and thereby avoid the need for a stockholder vote) for an amount equal to their pro rata share of the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account, less any taxes then due but not yet paid. The per-share amount we will distribute to investors who properly convert their shares will not be reduced by the deferred underwriting commissions we will pay to EF Hutton.\n\nOur initial stockholders and our officers and directors will not have conversion rights with respect to any shares of common stock owned by them, directly or indirectly, whether acquired prior to this offering or purchased by them in this offering or in the aftermarket. Additionally, the holders of the Representative Shares will not have conversion rights with respect to the Representative Shares.\n\n62  \n---  \n  \nWe may require public stockholders, whether they are a record holder or hold their shares in “street name,” to either (i) tender their certificates to our transfer agent or (ii) deliver their shares to the transfer agent electronically using Depository Trust Company’s DWAC (Deposit/Withdrawal At Custodian) System, at the holder’s option, in each case prior to a date set forth in the proxy materials sent in connection with the proposal to approve the business combination.\n\nThere is a nominal cost associated with the above-referenced delivery process and the act of certificating the shares or delivering them through the DWAC System. The transfer agent will typically charge the tendering broker a nominal amount and it would be up to the broker whether or not to pass this cost on to the holder. However, this fee would be incurred regardless of whether or not we require holders seeking to exercise conversion rights. The need to deliver shares is a requirement of exercising conversion rights regardless of the timing of when such delivery must be effectuated.\n\nHowever, in the event we require stockholders seeking to exercise conversion rights prior to the consummation of the proposed business combination and the proposed business combination is not consummated this may result in an increased cost to stockholders.\n\nAny proxy solicitation materials we furnish to stockholders in connection with a vote for any proposed business combination will indicate whether we are requiring stockholders to satisfy such certification and delivery requirements. Accordingly, a stockholder would have from the time the stockholder received our proxy statement up until the vote on the proposal to approve the business combination to deliver his or her shares if he or she wishes to seek to exercise his conversion rights. This time period varies depending on the specific facts of each transaction. However, as the delivery process can be accomplished by the stockholder, whether or not he is a record holder or his shares are held in “street name,” in a matter of hours by simply contacting the transfer agent or his broker and requesting delivery of his shares through the DWAC System, we believe this time period is sufficient for an average investor. However, we cannot assure you of this fact. Please see the risk factor titled “ _In connection with any stockholder meeting called to approve a proposed initial business combination, we may require stockholders who wish to convert their shares in connection with a proposed business combination to comply with specific requirements for conversion that may make it more difficult for them to exercise their conversion rights prior to the deadline for exercising their rights_ ” for further information on the risks of failing to comply with these requirements.\n\nAny request to convert such shares once made, may be withdrawn at any time up to the vote on the proposed business combination or the expiration of the tender offer. Furthermore, if a holder of public shares delivered his or her certificate in connection with an election of their conversion and subsequently decides prior to the applicable date not to elect to exercise such rights, he or she may simply request that the transfer agent return the certificate (physically or electronically).\n\nIf the initial business combination is not approved or completed for any reason, then our public stockholders who elected to exercise their conversion rights would not be entitled to convert their shares for the applicable pro rata share of the trust account. In such case, we will promptly return any shares delivered by public holders.\n\n**_Liquidation if No Business Combination_**\n\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that we will have only 12 months from the closing of this offering to complete an initial business combination.\n\nHowever, we may extend the period of time to consummate a business combination up to two times, each by an additional three months (for a total of 18 months to complete a business combination). In order to extend the time available for the Company to consummate a business Combination, without the need for a separate stockholder vote, our Sponsor must, upon five days’ advance notice prior to the application deadline, deposit into the trust account $199,800, or $229,770 if the underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised in full ($0.0333 per unit in either case), or an aggregate of $399,600, or $459,540 if the over-allotment option is exercised in full, for each three-month extension, on or prior to the date of the application deadline. In the event that the stockholders, or affiliates or designees, elect to extend the time to complete the company’s initial business combination and deposit the applicable amount of money into trust, the initial stockholders will receive a non-interest bearing, unsecured promissory note equal to the amount of any such deposit that will not be repaid in the event that the company is unable to close a business combination unless there are funds available outside the trust account to do so. Such note would be paid upon consummation of the company’s initial business combination.\n\n63  \n---  \n  \nIf we have not completed an initial business combination by such date and stockholders have not otherwise amended our charter to extend this date, we will (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up, (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten business days thereafter, redeem 100% of the outstanding public shares, at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account, including any interest not previously released to us but net of taxes payable and up to $100,000 of interest income that may be released to us for liquidation expenses, divided by the number of then outstanding public shares, which redemption will completely extinguish public stockholders’ rights as stockholders (including the right to receive further liquidation distributions, if any), subject to applicable law, and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of our remaining stockholders and our Board of Directors, dissolve and liquidate, subject (in the case of (ii) and (iii) above) to our obligations under Delaware law to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable law.\n\nOur initial stockholders, officers and directors have agreed that they will not propose any amendment to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation that would affect our public stockholders’ ability to convert or sell their shares to us in connection with a business combination as described herein or affect the substance or timing of our obligation to redeem 100% of our public shares if we do not complete a business combination within 12 months (or up to 18 months, if we extend the time to complete a business combination as described in this prospectus) from the closing of this offering unless we provide our public stockholders with the opportunity to convert their shares of common stock upon such approval at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account, including interest not previously released to us but net of franchise and income taxes payable, divided by the number of then outstanding public shares. This redemption right shall apply in the event of the approval of any such amendment, whether proposed by our initial stockholders, executive officers, directors or any other person.\n\nUnder the Delaware General Corporation Law, stockholders may be held liable for claims by third parties against a corporation to the extent of distributions received by them in a dissolution. The pro rata portion of our trust account distributed to our public stockholders upon the redemption of 100% of our outstanding public shares in the event we do not complete our initial business combination within the required time period may be considered a liquidation distribution under Delaware law. If the corporation complies with certain procedures set forth in Section 280 of the Delaware General Corporation Law intended to ensure that it makes reasonable provision for all claims against it, including a 60-day notice period during which any third-party claims can be brought against the corporation, a 90-day period during which the corporation may reject any claims brought, and an additional 150-day waiting period before any liquidating distributions are made to stockholders, any liability of stockholders with respect to a liquidating distribution is limited to the lesser of such stockholder’s pro rata share of the claim or the amount distributed to the stockholder, and any liability of the stockholder would be barred after the third anniversary of the dissolution. It is our intention to redeem our public shares as soon as reasonably possible following our 12-month anniversary (or up to 18 months, if we extend the time to complete a business combination as described in this prospectus), and, therefore, we do not intend to comply with those procedures. As such, our stockholders could potentially be liable for any claims to the extent of distributions received by them (but no more) and any liability of our stockholders may extend well beyond the third anniversary of such date.\n\nFurthermore, if the pro rata portion of our trust account distributed to our public stockholders upon the redemption of 100% of our public shares in the event we do not complete our initial business combination within the required time period is not considered a liquidation distribution under Delaware law and such redemption distribution is deemed to be unlawful, then pursuant to Section 174 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, the statute of limitations for claims of creditors could then be six years after the unlawful redemption distribution, instead of three years, as in the case of a liquidation distribution.\n\nBecause we will not be complying with Section 280 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, Section 281(b) of the Delaware General Corporation Law requires us to adopt a plan, based on facts known to us at such time that will provide for our payment of all existing and pending claims or claims that may be potentially brought against us within the subsequent ten years. However, because we are a blank check company, rather than an operating company, and our operations will be limited to searching for prospective target businesses to acquire, the only likely claims to arise would be from our current and former vendors (such as lawyers, auditors investment bankers, etc.) or prospective target businesses.\n\n64  \n---  \n  \nWe are required to seek to have all third parties (including any vendors or other entities we engage after this offering) and any prospective target businesses enter into agreements with us waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind they may have in or to any monies held in the trust account. As a result, the claims that could be made against us will be limited, thereby lessening the likelihood that any claim would result in any liability extending to the trust. We therefore believe that any necessary provision for creditors will be reduced and should not have a significant impact on our ability to distribute the funds in the trust account to our public stockholders. Nevertheless, MaloneBailey, LLP, our independent registered public accounting firm, and the underwriters of the offering, will not execute agreements with us waiving such claims to the monies held in the trust account. Furthermore, there is no guarantee that other vendors, service providers and prospective target businesses will execute such agreements. Nor is there any guarantee that, even if they execute such agreements with us, they will not seek recourse against the trust account. Bengochea SPAC Sponsors I LLC, an entity affiliated with Mr. Bengochea, has agreed that it will be liable to ensure that the proceeds in the trust account are not reduced below $10.00 per share by the claims of target businesses or claims of vendors or other entities that are owed money by us for services rendered or contracted for or products sold to us, but we cannot assure you that it will be able to satisfy its indemnification obligations if it is required to do so. We have not independently verified whether Bengochea SPAC Sponsors I LLC has sufficient funds to satisfy its indemnity obligations, we have not asked it to reserve for such obligations and we do not believe it has any significant liquid assets. Accordingly, we believe it is unlikely that it will be able to satisfy its indemnification obligations if it is required to do so. Additionally, the agreement Bengochea SPAC Sponsors I LLC entered into specifically provides for two exceptions to the indemnity given: it will have no liability (1) as to any claimed amounts owed to a target business or vendor or other entity who has executed an agreement with us waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind they may have in or to any monies held in the trust account, or (2) as to any claims for indemnification by the underwriters of this offering against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act. As a result, if we liquidate, the per-share distribution from the trust account could be less than $10.00 due to claims or potential claims of creditors.\n\nWe anticipate notifying the trustee of the trust account to begin liquidating such assets promptly after our 12-month anniversary (or up to 18 months, if we extend the time to complete a business combination as described in this prospectus) and anticipate it will take no more than 10 business days to effectuate such distribution. The holders of the Founder’s Shares have waived their rights to participate in any liquidation distribution from the trust account with respect to such shares. There will be no distribution from the trust account with respect to our rights or warrants, which will expire worthless. We will pay the costs of any subsequent liquidation from our remaining assets outside of the trust account. If such funds are insufficient, we will use the up to $100,000 of interest earned on the funds held in the trust account that may be released to us for our liquidation expenses.\n\nIf we are unable to complete an initial business combination and expend all of the net proceeds of this offering, other than the proceeds deposited in the trust account, and without taking into account interest, if any, earned on the trust account, or any increase as a result of our extending the time to consummate a business combination as described herein, the initial per-share redemption price would be $10.00. As discussed above, the proceeds deposited in the trust account could become subject to claims of our creditors that are in preference to the claims of public stockholders.\n\nOur public stockholders shall be entitled to receive funds from the trust account only in the event of our failure to complete a business combination within the required time period, if the stockholders seek to have us convert or purchase their respective shares upon a business combination which is actually completed by us or upon certain amendments to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation prior to consummating an initial business combination. In no other circumstances shall a stockholder have any right or interest of any kind to or in the trust account.\n\nIf we are forced to file a bankruptcy case or an involuntary bankruptcy case is filed against us which is not dismissed, the proceeds held in the trust account could be subject to applicable bankruptcy law, and may be included in our bankruptcy estate and subject to the claims of third parties with priority over the claims of our stockholders. To the extent any bankruptcy claims deplete the trust account, we cannot assure you we will be able to return to our public stockholders at least $10.00 per share.\n\n65  \n---  \n  \nIf we are forced to file a bankruptcy case or an involuntary bankruptcy case is filed against us which is not dismissed, any distributions received by stockholders could be viewed under applicable debtor/creditor and/or bankruptcy laws as either a “preferential transfer” or a “fraudulent conveyance.” As a result, a bankruptcy court could seek to recover all amounts received by our stockholders. Furthermore, because we intend to distribute the proceeds held in the trust account to our public stockholders promptly after 12 months (or up to 18 months, if we extend the time to complete a business combination as described in this prospectus) from the closing of this offering, this may be viewed or interpreted as giving preference to our public stockholders over any potential creditors with respect to access to or distributions from our assets. Furthermore, our Board may be viewed as having breached their fiduciary duties to our creditors and/or may have acted in bad faith, and thereby exposing itself and our company to claims of punitive damages, by paying public stockholders from the trust account prior to addressing the claims of creditors. We cannot assure you that claims will not be brought against us for these reasons.\n\n**_Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation_**\n\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation contains certain requirements and restrictions relating to this offering that will apply to us until the consummation of our initial business combination. These provisions cannot be amended without the approval of a majority of our stockholders. If we seek to amend any provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation that would affect our public stockholders’ ability to convert or sell their shares to us as described herein or affect the substance or timing of our obligation to redeem 100% of our public shares if we do not complete a business combination within 12 months (or up to 18 months, if we extend the time to complete a business combination as described in this prospectus) from the closing of this offering, we will provide public stockholders with the opportunity to convert their public shares in connection with any such vote. This conversion right shall apply in the event of the approval of any such amendment, whether proposed by any executive officer, director, initial stockholder, or any other person. Our initial stockholders, officers and directors have agreed to waive any conversion rights with respect to any Founder’s Shares and any public shares they may hold in connection with any vote to amend our amended and restated certificate of incorporation. Specifically, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides, among other things, that:\n\n• | we shall either (1) seek stockholder approval of our initial business combination at a meeting called for such purpose at which stockholders may seek to convert their shares, regardless of whether they vote for or against the proposed business combination or don’t vote at all, into their pro rata share of the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account (net of taxes payable), or (2) provide our stockholders with the opportunity to sell their shares to us by means of a tender offer (and thereby avoid the need for a stockholder vote) for an amount equal to their pro rata share of the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account (net of taxes payable), in each case subject to the limitations described herein and in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation;  \n---|---  \n• | we will consummate our initial business combination only if a majority of the outstanding shares of common stock voted are voted in favor of the business combination;  \n• | if our initial business combination is not consummated within 12 months (or up to 18 months, if we extend the time to complete a business combination as described in this prospectus) from the closing of this offering, then we will redeem all of the outstanding public shares and thereafter liquidate and dissolve our company;  \n• | upon the consummation of this offering, $60,000,000, or $69,000,000 if the over-allotment option is exercised in full, shall be placed into the trust account;  \n• | we may not consummate any other business combination, merger, capital stock exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization or similar transaction prior to our initial business combination; and  \n  \n66  \n---  \n  \n• | prior to our initial business combination, we may not issue additional stock that participates in any manner in the proceeds of the trust account, or that votes as a class with the common stock sold in this offering on an initial business combination.  \n---|---  \n  \n**Competition**\n\nIn identifying, evaluating and selecting a target business, we may encounter intense competition from other entities having a business objective similar to ours. Many of these entities are well established and have extensive experience identifying and effecting business combinations directly or through affiliates. Many of these competitors possess greater technical, human and other resources than us and our financial resources will be relatively limited when contrasted with those of many of these competitors. While we believe there may be numerous potential target businesses that we could acquire with the net proceeds of this offering, our ability to compete in acquiring certain sizable target businesses may be limited by our available financial resources.\n\nThe following also may not be viewed favorably by certain target businesses:\n\n• | our obligation to seek stockholder approval of a business combination or engage in a tender offer may delay the completion of a transaction;  \n---|---  \n• | our obligation to convert or repurchase shares of common stock held by our public stockholders may reduce the resources available to us for a business combination; and  \n• | our outstanding warrants, as well as the rights to one-fifth (1/5) of one share of common stock upon consummation of our initial business combination included within our units, and the potential future dilution they represent.  \n  \nAny of these factors may place us at a competitive disadvantage in successfully negotiating a business combination. Our management believes, however, that our status as a public entity and potential access to the United States public equity markets may give us a competitive advantage over privately held entities having a similar business objective as ours in acquiring a target business with significant growth potential on favorable terms.\n\nIf we succeed in effecting a business combination, there will be, in all likelihood, intense competition from competitors of the target business, including from companies that may be subject to less stringent disclosure and other securities law requirements as the surviving company in our business combination and that therefore may have a competitive advantage. We cannot assure you that, subsequent to a business combination, we will have the resources or ability to compete effectively.\n\n**Facilities**\n\nWe currently maintain our principal executive offices at P.O. Box 2506, Toluca Lake, California 91610. The cost for this space is included in the $12,000 per month fee that we will pay our sponsor, Bengochea SPAC Sponsors LLC, in exchange for management support, administrative, office space, and other services. We consider our current office space adequate for our current operations.\n\n**Employees**\n\nWe have three executive officers. These individuals are not obligated to devote any specific number of hours to our matters and intend to devote only as much time as they deem necessary to our affairs. The amount of time they will devote in any time period will vary based on whether a target business has been selected for the business combination and the stage of the business combination process the company is in. Accordingly, once a suitable target business has been located, management may spend more time investigating such target business and negotiating and processing the business combination (and consequently spend more time on our affairs) than had been spent prior to locating a suitable target business. We presently expect our executive officers to devote such amount of time as they reasonably believe is necessary to our business. We do not intend to have any full-time employees prior to the consummation of a business combination.\n\n**Periodic Reporting and Audited Financial Statements**\n\nWe have registered our units, common stock, warrants and rights under the Exchange Act and have reporting obligations, including the requirement that we file annual, quarterly and current reports with the SEC. In accordance with the requirements of the Exchange Act, our annual report will contain financial statements audited and reported on by our independent registered public accountants.\n\n67  \n---  \n  \nWe will provide stockholders with audited financial statements of the prospective target business as part of any proxy solicitation materials or tender offer documents sent to stockholders to assist them in assessing the target business. These financial statements will need to be prepared in accordance with or reconciled to United States generally accepted accounting principles or international financial reporting standards as promulgated by the International Accounting Standards Board. We cannot assure you that any particular target business identified by us as a potential acquisition candidate will have the necessary financial statements. To the extent that this requirement cannot be met, we may not be able to acquire the proposed target business.\n\nWe may be required to have our internal control procedures audited for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2024, as required by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. A target company may not be in compliance with the provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act regarding adequacy of their internal controls. The development of the internal controls of any such entity to achieve compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act may increase the time and costs necessary to complete any such acquisition.\n\n**Legal Proceedings**\n\nThere is no material litigation, arbitration or governmental proceeding currently pending against us or any members of our management team in their capacity as such, and we and the members of our management team have not been subject to any such proceeding in the 12 months preceding the date of this prospectus.\n\nHowever, we are currently involved in a contractual dispute with OMNIA Global, a family office investment firm founded by Daniel Hansen and headquartered in Zug, Switzerland, which had previously agreed to invest a portion of the funds needed to finance this offering in exchange for a minority equity stake in our sponsor. In October 2023, after providing repeated positive indications of its intention to deliver its investment by our sponsor’s capital call deadline and marketing its expected participation in the offering to its investors, OMNIA Global breached its contract, with Mr. Hansen advising that OMNIA Global did not have sufficient funds to satisfy its obligations thereunder. On November 24, 2023, the Board removed James M. Findlay, a former director of the Company who was an employee of OMNIA Global, from the Board in light of the breach. It is possible the dispute with OMNIA Global will result in our becoming involved in one or more arbitration or litigation proceedings regarding the breach. However, the breach by OMNIA Global is not expected to impact the Company’s ability to successfully consummate the offering.\n\n**Comparison to Offerings of Blank Check Companies Subject to Rule 419**\n\nThe following table compares and contrasts the terms of our offering and the terms of an offering of blank check companies under Rule 419 promulgated by the SEC assuming that the gross proceeds, underwriting discounts and underwriting expenses for the Rule 419 offering are the same as this offering and that the underwriters will not exercise their over-allotment option. None of the terms of a Rule 419 offering will apply to this offering because we will have net tangible assets in excess of $5,000,000 upon the successful consummation of this offering and will file a Current Report on Form 8-K, including an audited balance sheet demonstrating this fact.\n\n**Terms of the Offering** | **Terms Under a Rule 419 Offering**  \n---|---  \n**Escrow of offering proceeds** | $60,000,000 of the proceeds from this offering and the sale of the private warrants will be placed in a U.S.-based trust account with Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company acting as trustee. | $51,570,000 of the offering proceeds would be required to be deposited into either an escrow account with an insured depositary institution or in a separate bank account established by a broker-dealer in which the broker-dealer acts as trustee for persons having the beneficial interests in the account.  \n**Investment of net proceeds** | The $60,000,000 of the proceeds of this offering and the sale of the private warrants held in trust will, if such proceeds are invested at all, only be invested in United States “government securities” within the meaning of Section 2(a)(16) of the Investment Company Act with a maturity of 185 days or less or in money market funds meeting certain conditions under Rule 2a-7 promulgated under the Investment Company Act which invest only in direct U.S. government treasury obligations. | Proceeds could be invested only in specified securities such as a money market fund meeting conditions of the Investment Company Act or in securities that are direct obligations of, or obligations guaranteed as to principal or interest by, the United States.  \n**Limitation on fair value or net assets of target business** | Our initial business combination must occur with one or more target businesses that together have a fair market value of at least 80% of the assets held in the trust account (excluding deferred underwriting commissions and taxes payable) at the time of the agreement to enter into the initial business combination.

If the over-allotment option is exercised after the initial filing of such Current Report on Form 8-K, we will file an amendment to the Form 8-K to provide updated financial information to reflect the exercise and consummation of the over-allotment option. We will also include in this Form 8-K, an amendment thereto, or in a subsequent Form 8-K, information indicating if EF Hutton has allowed separate trading of the shares of common stock, warrants and rights prior to the 52nd day after the date of this prospectus. The distributable right will be distributed upon successful completion of our initial business combination. | No trading of the units or the underlying shares of common stock, warrants and rights would be permitted until the completion of a business combination. During this period, the securities would be held in the escrow or trust account.  \n**Exercise of the warrants** | The warrants cannot be exercised until 30 days after the completion of a business combination and, accordingly, will be exercised only after the trust account has been terminated and distributed | The warrants could be exercised prior to the completion of a business combination, but securities received and cash paid in connection with the exercise would be deposited in the escrow or trust account.  \n**Election to remain an investor** | We will either (1) give our stockholders the opportunity to vote on the business combination or (2) provide our public stockholders with the opportunity to sell their shares of our common stock to us in a tender offer for cash equal to their pro rata share of the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account, less taxes.

Unless a sufficient number of investors elect to remain investors, all of the deposited funds in the escrow account must be returned to all investors and none of the securities will be issued.  \n**Business combination deadline** | Pursuant to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, if we are unable to complete our initial business combination within 12 months (or up to 18 months, if we extend the time to complete a business combination as described in this prospectus) from the closing of this offering, we will (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up, (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten business days thereafter, redeem 100% of the outstanding public shares, at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account, including any interest not released to us but net of taxes payable, divided by the number of then outstanding public shares, which redemption will completely extinguish public stockholders’ rights as stockholders (including the right to receive further liquidation distributions, if any), subject to applicable law, and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of our remaining stockholders and our Board of Directors, dissolve and liquidate, subject (in the case of (ii) and (iii) above) to our obligations under Delaware law to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable law. | If an acquisition has not been consummated within 18 months after the effective date of the initial registration statement, funds held in the trust or escrow account would be returned to investors.  \n**Interest earned on the funds in the trust account** | There can be released to us, from time to time, any interest earned on the funds in the trust account that we may need to pay our tax obligations (excluding taxes payable pursuant to the IR Act).

However, they have no written advisory agreement with us. Moreover, they are not board members, have no fiduciary obligations to us, will not perform board or committee functions and will not have any voting or decision-making power. Accordingly, if any of our advisors becomes aware of a business combination which is suitable for any of the entities to which he has fiduciary or contractual obligations (including other blank check companies), he will honor his fiduciary or contractual obligations to present such business combination opportunity to such entity, and only present it to us if such entity rejects the opportunity. Nonetheless, we believe them to be powerful assets whose networks, experiences, and accolades make them value-enhancing additions to our team. They are as follows:\n\n**_Kosaku Yada_ **is the current CEO and co-founder of Westbrook Inc., which he co-founded in 2019 alongside Will Smith, Jada Smith, and Miguel Melendez.

However, we will enter into an administrative services agreement pursuant to which, commencing on the date of the closing of this offering lasting for 12 months from such date of closing of this offering, we will pay $12,000 per month to our sponsor in exchange for management support, administrative, office space, and other services, which amounts our sponsor would have discretion to use as it sees fit in connection with its operations, including, potentially, by making payments to our Chief Executive Officer in his individual capacity because he is also the Chief Executive Officer of our sponsor. This arrangement would be solely pursuant to any agreements between our Chief Executive Officer and our sponsor, to which the Company is not a party, and any such payments would not be intended to provide our Chief Executive Officer with compensation in lieu of a salary for his service as Chief Executive Officer of the Company. Our sponsor, officers and directors, or any affiliate of our sponsor or officers, will also be reimbursed for any out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with activities on our behalf such as identifying potential target businesses and performing due diligence on suitable business combinations. There is no limit on the amount of out-of-pocket expenses reimbursable by us; provided, however, that to the extent such expenses exceed the available proceeds not deposited in the trust account, such expenses would not be reimbursed by us unless we consummate an initial business combination. They may also receive repayment for any loans made by them to us for working capital needs or extending our time to consummate an initial business combination.\n\n73  \n---  \n  \nNo other compensation of any kind, including any finder’s fee, reimbursement, consulting fee or monies in respect of any payment of a loan, will be paid by us to our sponsor, officers and directors, or any affiliate of our sponsor or officers, prior to, or in connection with any services rendered in order to effectuate the consummation of our initial business combination (regardless of the type of transaction that it is).\n\nAfter our initial business combination, members of our management team who remain with us may be paid consulting, management or other fees from the combined company with any and all amounts being fully disclosed to stockholders, to the extent then known, in the proxy solicitation materials furnished to our stockholders. However, the amount of such compensation may not be known at the time of the stockholder meeting held to consider an initial business combination, as it will be up to the directors of the post-combination business to determine executive and director compensation. In this event, such compensation will be publicly disclosed at the time of its determination in a Current Report on Form 8-K or a periodic report, as required by the SEC.\n\n**Director Independence**\n\nCurrently Brian Turner, Ken Hertz, Lisa Harrington, and Scott Morris would each be considered an “independent director” under NASDAQ listing rules, which is defined generally as a person other than an officer or employee of the company or its subsidiaries or any other individual having a relationship, which, in the opinion of the company’s board of directors would interfere with the director’s exercise of independent judgment in carrying out the responsibilities of a director.\n\nOur independent directors will have regularly scheduled meetings at which only independent directors are present.\n\nAny affiliated transactions will be on terms no less favorable to us than could be obtained from independent parties. Our Board of Directors will review and approve all affiliated transactions with any interested director abstaining from such review and approval.\n\n**Executive Committee**\n\nWe have formed an executive committee of our Board of Directors whose members are Ken Hertz, Brian Turner and Jose A. Bengochea. Ken Hertz is the chair of the executive committee. The executive committee has been formed for the purpose of broadening potential deal pipeline and sourcing targets from the networks of the executive committee members.\n\n74  \n---  \n  \n**Audit Committee**\n\nEffective upon the date of this prospectus, we will establish an audit committee of the board of directors, which will consist of Brian Turner, Lisa Harrington, and Scott Morris, each of whom is an independent director under NASDAQ’s listing standards. Brian Turner will serve as chair of the audit committee. The audit committee’s duties, which are specified in our Audit Committee Charter, include, but are not limited to:\n\n• | reviewing and discussing with management and the independent auditor the annual audited financial statements, and recommending to the board whether the audited financial statements should be included in our Form 10-K;  \n---|---  \n• | discussing with management and the independent auditor significant financial reporting issues and judgments made in connection with the preparation of our financial statements;  \n• | discussing with management major risk assessment and risk management policies;  \n• | monitoring the independence of the independent auditor;  \n• | verifying the rotation of the lead (or coordinating) audit partner having primary responsibility for the audit and the audit partner responsible for reviewing the audit as required by law;  \n• | reviewing and approving all related-party transactions;  \n• | inquiring and discussing with management our compliance with applicable laws and regulations;  \n• | pre-approving all audit services and permitted non-audit services to be performed by our independent auditor, including the fees and terms of the services to be performed;  \n• | appointing or replacing the independent auditor;  \n• | determining the compensation and oversight of the work of the independent auditor (including resolution of disagreements between management and the independent auditor regarding financial reporting) for the purpose of preparing or issuing an audit report or related work;  \n• | establishing procedures for the receipt, retention and treatment of complaints received by us regarding accounting, internal accounting controls or reports which raise material issues regarding our financial statements or accounting policies; and  \n• | approving reimbursement of expenses incurred by our management team in identifying potential target businesses.  \n  \n**Financial Experts on Audit Committee**\n\nThe audit committee will at all times be composed exclusively of “independent directors” who are “financially literate” as defined under NASDAQ’s listing standards. NASDAQ’s standards define “financially literate” as being able to read and understand fundamental financial statements, including a company’s balance sheet, income statement and cash flow statement.\n\nIn addition, we must certify to NASDAQ that the committee has, and will continue to have, at least one member who has past employment experience in finance or accounting, requisite professional certification in accounting, or other comparable experience or background that results in the individual’s financial sophistication. The Board of Directors has determined that each of Brian Turner and Scott Morris qualifies as an “audit committee financial expert,” as defined under rules and regulations of the SEC.\n\n75  \n---  \n  \n**Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee**\n\nEffective upon the date of this prospectus, we will establish a nominating and corporate governance committee of the board of directors. The members of our nominating and corporate governance will be Scott Morris, Ken Hertz, and Brian Turner. Scott Morris will serve as chair of the nominating and corporate governance committee.\n\nThe primary purposes of our nominating and corporate governance committee will be to assist the board in:  \n---  \n• | identifying, screening and reviewing individuals qualified to serve as directors and recommending to the board of directors candidates for nomination for election at the annual meeting of stockholders or to fill vacancies on the board of directors;  \n---|---  \n• | developing, recommending to the board of directors and overseeing implementation of our corporate governance guidelines;  \n---|---  \n• | coordinating and overseeing the annual self-evaluation of the board of directors, its committees, individual directors and management in the governance of the company; and  \n• | reviewing on a regular basis our overall corporate governance and recommending improvements as and when necessary.  \n  \nThe nominating and corporate governance committee will be governed by a charter that complies with the rules of NASDAQ.\n\n**_Guidelines for Selecting Director Nominees_**\n\nThe guidelines for selecting nominees, which are specified in the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee charter, generally provide that person to be nominated:\n\n• | should have demonstrated notable or significant achievements in business, education or public service;  \n---|---  \n• | should possess the requisite intelligence, education and experience to make a significant contribution to the board of directors and bring a range of skills, diverse perspectives and backgrounds to its deliberations; and  \n• | should have the highest ethical standards, a strong sense of professionalism and intense dedication to serving the interests of the stockholders.  \n  \nThe Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee will consider a number of qualifications relating to management and leadership experience, background and integrity and professionalism in evaluating a person’s candidacy for membership on the board of directors. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee may require certain skills or attributes, such as financial or accounting experience, to meet specific board needs that arise from time to time and will also consider the overall experience and makeup of its members to obtain a broad and diverse mix of board members. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee does not distinguish among nominees recommended by stockholders and other persons.\n\n**Compensation Committee**\n\nEffective upon the date of this prospectus, we will establish a compensation committee of the board of directors, which will consist of Lisa Harrington, Scott Morris, and Brian Turner, each of whom is an independent director under NASDAQ’s listing standards. Lisa Harrington will serve as chair of the compensation committee. The compensation committee’s duties, which are specified in our Compensation Committee Charter, include, but are not limited to:\n\n• | reviewing and approving on an annual basis the corporate goals and objectives relevant to our Chief Executive Officer’s compensation, evaluating our Chief Executive Officer’s performance in light of such goals and objectives and determining and approving the remuneration (if any) of our Chief Executive Officer based on such evaluation;  \n---|---  \n• | reviewing and approving the compensation of all of our other executive officers;  \n  \n76  \n---  \n  \n• | reviewing our executive compensation policies and plans;  \n---|---  \n• | implementing and administering our incentive compensation equity-based remuneration plans;  \n• | assisting management in complying with our proxy statement and annual report disclosure requirements;  \n• | approving all special perquisites, special cash payments and other special compensation and benefit arrangements for our executive officers and employees;  \n• | if required, producing a report on executive compensation to be included in our annual proxy statement; and  \n• | reviewing, evaluating and recommending changes, if appropriate, to the remuneration for directors.  \n  \n**Code of Ethics**\n\nEffective upon the date of this prospectus, we will adopt a code of ethics that applies to all of our executive officers, directors and employees. The code of ethics will codify the business and ethical principles that govern all aspects of our business.\n\n**Conflicts of Interest**\n\nIn general, officers and directors of a corporation incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware are required to present business opportunities to a corporation if:\n\n• | the corporation could financially undertake the opportunity;  \n---|---  \n• | the opportunity is within the corporation’s line of business; and  \n• | it would not be fair to the corporation and its stockholders for the opportunity not to be brought to the attention of the corporation.  \n  \nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that:\n\n• | except as may be prescribed by any written agreement with us, we renounce our interest in any corporate opportunity offered to any director or officer unless such opportunity is expressly offered to such person solely in his or her capacity as a director or officer of our company and such opportunity is one we are legally and contractually permitted to undertake and would otherwise be reasonable for us to pursue; and  \n---|---  \n• | our officers and directors will not be liable to our company or our stockholders for monetary damages for breach of any fiduciary duty by reason of any of our activities to the fullest extent permitted by Delaware law.  \n  \nOur officers and directors are, and may in the future become, affiliated with other companies. In order to minimize potential conflicts of interest which may arise from such other corporate affiliations, each of our officers and directors has contractually agreed, pursuant to a written agreement with us, until the earliest of our execution of a definitive agreement for a business combination, our liquidation or such time as he or she ceases to be an officer or director, to present to our company for our consideration, prior to presentation to any other entity, any suitable business opportunity which may reasonably be required to be presented to us, subject to any fiduciary or contractual obligations he or she might have. The foregoing agreement does not restrict our officers from becoming affiliated with other companies in the future which could take priority over our company; however, we believe that such agreement still benefits us because our officers and directors are obligated to present suitable business opportunities to us to the extent that none of their other fiduciary or contractual obligations require them to present it to another entity.\n\n77  \n---  \n  \nThe following table summarizes the pre-existing fiduciary or contractual obligations of our officers and directors:\n\n**Name of Individual(s)** | **Name of Affiliated Company** | **Position at Affiliated Company**  \n---|---|---  \nJose Antonio Bengochea | Bengochea Capital, LLC Bengochea SPAC Sponsors I LLC | CEO Founder CEO  \nJane Waxman | None | None  \nWilliam J.

This is because our officers and directors and affiliates will not receive liquidation distributions from the trust account with respect to any of the Founder’s Shares or warrants.   \n  \nFor the foregoing reasons, our Board may have a conflict of interest in determining whether a particular target business is appropriate to effect a business combination with.\n\nTo further minimize conflicts of interest, we have agreed not to consummate an initial business combination with an entity that is affiliated with any of our officers, directors or initial stockholders unless we have obtained an opinion from an independent investment banking firm, or another independent entity that commonly renders valuation opinions, that the business combination is fair to our unaffiliated stockholders from a financial point of view. We will also need to obtain the approval of a majority of our disinterested independent directors. Furthermore, in no event will any of our initial stockholders, members of our management team or their respective affiliates be paid any compensation prior to, or for any services they render in order to effectuate, the consummation of an initial business combination (regardless of the type of transaction that it is) other than the payment of a total of $12,000 per month to our sponsor in exchange for management support, administrative, office space, and other services, as well as repayment of the $1,500,000loan from our sponsor and reimbursement of any out-of-pocket expenses.\n\n78  \n---  \n  \n**PRINCIPAL STOCKHOLDERS**\n\nThe following table sets forth information regarding the beneficial ownership of our shares of common stock as of the date of this prospectus and as adjusted to reflect the sale of our shares of common stock included in the units offered by this prospectus (assuming none of the individuals listed purchase units in this offering), by:\n\n• | each person known by us to be the beneficial owner of more than 5% of our outstanding shares of common stock;  \n---|---  \n• | each of our officers and directors; and  \n• | all of our officers and directors as a group.  \n  \nUnless otherwise indicated, we believe that all persons named in the table have sole voting and investment power with respect to all shares of common stock beneficially owned by them. The following table does not reflect record of beneficial ownership of the warrants included in the units offered by this prospectus or the private warrants as these warrants are not exercisable within 60 days of the date of this prospectus.\n\n**Prior to Offering** | **After Offering**(3)  \n---|---  \n**Name and Address of Beneficial Owner**(1) | **Amount and** **Nature of** **Beneficial** **Ownership** | **Approximate** **Percentage** **of** **Outstanding** **Shares of** **Common** **Stock**(2) | **Amount and** **Nature of** **Beneficial** **Ownership** | **Approximate** **Percentage of** **Outstanding** **Shares of** **Common Stock**  \nJose Antonio Bengochea (4) | 385,000 | 20.02% | 385,000 | 4.99%  \nBrian Turner (5) | 100,000 | 5.20% | 100,000 | 1.29%  \nJane Waxman | 40,000 | 2.08% | 40,000 | *  \nWilliam Caragol (6) | 80,000 | 4.16% | 80,000 | 1.04%  \nLisa Harrington | 20,000 | 1.04% | 20,000 | *  \nKen Hertz | 30,000 | 1.56% | 30,000 | *  \nScott Morris (7) | 45,000 | 2.34% | 40,000 | *  \nBengochea SPAC Sponsors I LLC (8) | 1,932,000 | 100.00% | 1,695,000 | 21.95%  \nAll directors and executive officers as a group (7 individuals) (9) | 700,000 | 37.18% | 700,000  \n(1) | Unless otherwise indicated, the business address of each of the individuals is c/o Iron Horse Acquisitions Corp., P.O. 2506, Toluca Lake, California 91610. Share amounts indicated for each director and each officer are inclusive of both amounts held by the Sponsor on behalf of each individual for their service as a director or officer of the Company as well as amounts held by the Sponsor on behalf of each individual, to the extent applicable, in their capacities as investors in the Sponsor.   \n---|---  \n(2) | Percentages are based on 1,932,000 Founder’s Shares outstanding prior to the date of the offering, and therefore prior to any potential forfeiture of up to 252,000 shares in the aggregate depending on the extent to which the underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised in connection with this offering.  \n(3) | Figures in this column assume there was no exercise of the over-allotment option and, therefore, the forfeiture of an aggregate of 252,000 shares of common stock.  \n(4) | Figures in this row include 47,500 shares held by the Sponsor on behalf of Mr. Bengochea for his service as a director and officer of the Company as well as 337,500 shares held by the Sponsor on behalf of Bengochea Capital LLC, a limited liability company controlled solely by Mr. Bengochea, on the basis of funds invested by Bengochea Capital LLC in the Sponsor.   \n(5) | Figures in this row include 45,000 shares held by the Sponsor on behalf of Mr. Turner for his service as a director of the Company as well as 55,000 shares held by the Sponsor on behalf of Mr. Turner on the basis of funds invested by Mr. Turner in the Sponsor.   \n(6) | Figures in this row include 30,000 shares held by the Sponsor on behalf of Mr. Caragol for his service as an officer of the Company as well as 50,000 shares held by the Sponsor on behalf of Mr. Caragol on the basis of funds invested by Mr. Caragol in the Sponsor.   \n(7) | Figures in this row include 20,000 shares held by the Sponsor on behalf of Mr. Morris for his service as an officer of the Company as well as 25,000 shares held by the Sponsor on behalf of Mr. Morris on the basis of funds invested by Mr. Morris in the Sponsor.  \n(8) | Prior to the consummation of the offering, virtually all of the shares of the Company are held by the Sponsor. Amounts held by the Sponsor are inclusive of (a) amounts held on behalf of directors and officers for their service as such, (b) amounts held on behalf of the various constituent investors in the Sponsor, and (c) 252,000 shares in the aggregate which could potentially be forfeited depending on the extent to which the underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised in connection with this offering. Excluding amounts held by the Sponsor on behalf of directors and officers for their service, prior to the consummation of the offering, the number of shares held by the Sponsor is 1,684,500.  \n(9) | Figures in this row include all shares held by the Sponsor on behalf of our directors and officers as a group, whether such shares are attributable to a director or officer on the basis of his or her service as such or on the basis of funds invested by a director or officer in the Sponsor (including, in the case of Mr. Bengochea, funds invested through Bengochea Capital LLC).  \n(*) | Less than 1%, rounded down to the nearest 0.1%   \n  \nImmediately after this offering, our initial stockholders will beneficially own approximately 22% of the then issued and outstanding shares of common stock (assuming they do not purchase any units offered by this prospectus). None of our officers, directors and initial stockholders has indicated to us that it or they intend to purchase our securities in the offering. Because of the ownership block held by our officers, directors and initial stockholders, such individuals may be able to effectively exercise influence over all matters requiring approval by our stockholders, including the election of directors and approval of significant corporate transactions other than approval of our initial business combination.\n\nIf the underwriters do not exercise all or a portion of the over-allotment option, an aggregate of 252,000 Founder’s Shares will be forfeited. Only a number of shares necessary to maintain the 22% ownership interest in our shares of common stock after giving effect to the offering and the exercise, if any, of the underwriters’ over-allotment option (assuming they do not purchase any units in this offering) will be necessary.\n\n79  \n---  \n  \nAll of the Founder’s Shares outstanding prior to the date of this prospectus will be placed in escrow with Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, as escrow agent, until the earlier of 180 days after the date of the consummation of our initial business combination, or earlier if, subsequent to our initial business combination, we consummate a liquidation, merger, stock exchange or other similar transaction which results in all of our stockholders having the right to exchange their shares of common stock for cash, securities or other property. Up to 252,000 of the Founder’s Shares may also be released from escrow earlier than this date for cancellation if the over-allotment option is not exercised in full as described above.\n\nDuring the escrow period, the holders of these shares will not be able to sell or transfer their securities except for transfers, assignments or sales (i) among our initial stockholders or to our initial stockholders’ members, officers, directors, consultants or their affiliates, (ii) to a holder’s stockholders or members upon its liquidation, (iii) by bona fide gift to a member of the holder’s immediate family or to a trust, the beneficiary of which is the holder or a member of the holder’s immediate family, for estate planning purposes, (iv) by virtue of the laws of descent and distribution upon death, (v) pursuant to a qualified domestic relations order, (vi) to us for no value for cancellation in connection with the consummation of our initial business combination, or (vii) in connection with the consummation of a business combination at prices no greater than the price at which the shares were originally purchased, in each case (except for clause (vi) or with our prior consent) where the transferee agrees to the terms of the escrow agreement and to be bound by these transfer restrictions, but will retain all other rights as our stockholders, including, without limitation, the right to vote their shares of common stock and the right to receive cash dividends, if declared. If dividends are declared and payable in shares of common stock, such dividends will also be placed in escrow. If we are unable to effect a business combination and liquidate, there will be no liquidation distribution with respect to the Founder’s Shares.\n\nOur sponsor, Bengochea SPAC Sponsors I LLC, and/or its designees will purchase from us an aggregate of 2,457,000 private warrants (for a total purchase price of $2,457,000) from us. These purchases will take place on a private placement basis simultaneously with the consummation of this offering. It has also agreed that if the over-allotment option is exercised by the underwriters in full or in part, it and/or its designees will purchase from us additional private warrants on a pro rata basis (up to a maximum of 76,500 additional private warrants) at a price of $1.00 per private warrant in an amount that is necessary to maintain in the trust account $10.00 per unit sold to the public in this offering, without taking into account any interest earned on such funds or any increase as a result of our extending the time to consummate a business combination as described herein. These additional private warrants will be purchased in a private placement that will occur simultaneously with the purchase of units resulting from the exercise of the over-allotment option. The private warrants are identical to the public warrants sold in this offering. The initial purchasers have agreed not to transfer, assign or sell any of the private warrants and underlying securities (except in connection with the same limited exceptions that the Founder’s Shares may be transferred as described above) until after the completion of our initial business combination. In the event of a liquidation prior to our initial business combination, the private warrants will likely be worthless.\n\nIn order to meet our working capital needs following the consummation of this offering, our initial stockholders, officers, directors and their affiliates may, but are not obligated to, loan us funds, on a non-interest bearing basis, from time to time or at any time, in whatever amount they deem reasonable in their sole discretion. Each loan would be evidenced by a promissory note. The notes would either be paid upon consummation of our initial business combination, without interest, or, at the holder’s discretion, if there are excess funds, on the date on which the Company concludes the initial public offering of its securities. In the event that the initial business combination does not close, we may use a portion of the working capital held outside the trust account to repay such loaned amounts, but no proceeds from our trust account would be used for such repayment.\n\nOur executive officers are our “promoters,” as that term is defined under the federal securities laws.\n\n80  \n---  \n  \n**CERTAIN TRANSACTIONS**\n\nIn November 2021, we issued 5,750,000 shares of common stock to Bengochea SPAC Sponsors I LLC, for $25,000 in cash, at a purchase price of approximately $0.00435 per share, in connection with our organization. In September 2022, the initial stockholders surrendered 2,875,000 shares of common stock, resulting in there being an aggregate of 2,875,000 Founder’s Shares outstanding. In September 2023, the initial stockholders surrendered 943,000 shares of common stock for no consideration, resulting in there being an aggregate of 1,932,000 Founder’s Shares outstanding shares of common stock. Bengochea SPAC Sponsors I LLC shall subsequently transfer, on consummation of this offering, certain of such shares to our officers, directors and other individuals at the same price originally paid for such shares. If the underwriters do not exercise all or a portion of their over-allotment option, our initial stockholders will forfeit up to an aggregate of 252,000 shares of common stock in proportion to the portion of the over-allotment option that was not exercised.\n\nIf the underwriters determine the size of the offering should be increased (including pursuant to Rule 462(b) under the Securities Act) or decreased, a share dividend or a contribution back to capital, as applicable, would be effectuated in order to maintain our initial stockholders’ ownership at a percentage of the number of shares to be sold in this offering.\n\nOur sponsor has committed that it and/or its designees will purchase, pursuant to a written subscription agreement with us, the 2,457,000 private warrants (for a total purchase price of $2,457,000) from us. This purchase will take place on a private placement basis simultaneously with the consummation of this offering. It has also agreed that if the over-allotment option is exercised by the underwriters in full or in part, it and/or its designees will purchase from us additional private warrants on a pro rata basis (up to a maximum of 76,500 private warrants) at a price of $1.00 per private warrant in an amount that is necessary to maintain in the trust account $10.00 per unit sold to the public in this offering, without taking into account any interest earned on such funds or any increase as a result of our extending the time to consummate a business combination as described herein. These additional private warrants will be purchased in a private placement that will occur simultaneously with the purchase of units resulting from the exercise of the over-allotment option. The purchase price for the private warrants will be deposited into the trust account simultaneously with the consummation of the offering. The private warrants are identical to the warrants sold in this offering. The purchasers have agreed not to transfer, assign or sell any of the private warrants and underlying securities (except to certain permitted transferees) until after the completion of our initial business combination. In the event of a liquidation prior to our initial business combination, the private warrants will likely be worthless.\n\nIn order to meet our working capital needs following the consummation of this offering, our initial stockholders, officers and directors or their affiliates may, but are not obligated to, loan us funds, on a non-interest bearing basis, from time to time or at any time, in whatever amount they deem reasonable in their sole discretion. Each loan would be evidenced by a promissory note. The notes would either be paid upon consummation of our initial business combination, without interest, or, at holder’s discretion, if there are excess proceeds, upon the close of this initial public offering. In the event that the initial business combination does not close, we may use a portion of the working capital held outside the trust account to repay such loaned amounts, but no proceeds from our trust account would be used for such repayment.\n\nThe holders of our Founder’s Shares issued and outstanding on the date of this prospectus, as well as the holders of the Representative Shares, private warrants and any warrants our initial stockholders, officers, directors or their affiliates may be issued in payment of working capital loans made to us (and all underlying securities), will be entitled to registration rights pursuant to an agreement to be signed prior to or on the effective date of this offering. The holders of a majority of these securities are entitled to make up to two demands that we register such securities. The holders of the majority of the Founder’s Shares can elect to exercise these registration rights at any time commencing three months prior to the date on which these shares of common stock are to be released from escrow. The holders of a majority of the Representative Shares, private warrants and warrants issued in payment of working capital loans made to us (or underlying securities) can elect to exercise these registration rights at any time after we consummate a business combination. In addition, the holders have certain “piggy-back” registration rights with respect to registration statements filed subsequent to our consummation of a business combination. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, EF Hutton may only make a demand on one occasion and only during the five-year period beginning on the effective date of the registration statement of which this prospectus forms a part. In addition, EF Hutton may participate in a “piggy-back” registration only during the seven-year period beginning on the effective date of the registration statement of which this prospectus forms a part. We will bear the expenses incurred in connection with the filing of any such registration statements.\n\n81  \n---  \n  \nPrior to the closing of this offering, our sponsor has agreed to loan us up to $1,500,000 to be used for a portion of the expenses of the offering. As of September 30, 2023, we had borrowed $1,203,216 (of up to $1,500,000 available to us), of which $876,216 will be repaid in connection with the closing of the private placement warrant purchase that will occur simultaneously with the closing of this offering (leaving $327,000 outstanding), under the promissory note with our sponsor, which was used to pay a portion of the expenses of this offering referenced in the line items above for SEC registration fee, FINRA filing fee, any non-refundable portion of the NASDAQ listing fee not covered by EF Hutton, a portion of the legal and audit fees and other offering expenses. This loan is non-interest bearing, unsecured and repayable upon the earlier of (a) the date on which the SPAC consummates its initial business combination or, at the holder’s discretion, if funds allow, or (b) the date on which the Company concludes the initial public offering of its securities. The principal balance may be prepaid at any time.\n\nWe will pay $12,000 per month to our sponsor in exchange for management support, administrative, office space, and other services. We will cease paying these monthly fees 12 months from the date of the close of this offering. See “ _Executive Compensation_ ” for further information relating to this payment and the possibility that some portion of the amount may be paid by our sponsor to our Chief Executive Officer.\n\nWe will enter into agreements with our officers and directors to provide contractual indemnification in addition to the indemnification provided for in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation.\n\nOther than the foregoing payments, no compensation or fees of any kind will be paid to our initial stockholders, members of our management team or their respective affiliates, for services rendered prior to or in connection with the consummation of our initial business combination (regardless of the type of transaction that it is). However, such individuals will receive reimbursement for any out-of-pocket expenses incurred by them in connection with activities on our behalf, such as identifying potential target businesses, performing business due diligence on suitable target businesses and business combinations as well as traveling to and from the offices, plants or similar locations of prospective target businesses to examine their operations. There is no limit on the amount of out-of-pocket expenses reimbursable by us; provided, however, that to the extent such expenses exceed the available proceeds not deposited in the trust account, such expenses would not be reimbursed by us unless we consummate an initial business combination.\n\nAfter our initial business combination, members of our management team who remain with us may be paid consulting, management or other fees from the combined company with any and all amounts being fully disclosed to stockholders, to the extent then known, in the proxy solicitation materials furnished to our stockholders. However, the amount of such compensation may not be known at the time of the stockholder meeting held to consider an initial business combination, as it will be up to the directors of the post-combination business to determine executive and director compensation. In this event, such compensation will be publicly disclosed at the time of its determination in a Current Report on Form 8-K or a periodic report, as required by the SEC.\n\nAll ongoing and future transactions between us and any of our officers and directors or their respective affiliates will be on terms believed by us to be no less favorable to us than are available from unaffiliated third parties. Such transactions will require prior approval by a majority of our uninterested “independent” directors or the members of our board who do not have an interest in the transaction, in either case who had access, at our expense, to our attorneys or independent legal counsel. We will not enter into any such transaction unless our disinterested “independent” directors determine that the terms of such transaction are no less favorable to us than those that would be available to us with respect to such a transaction from unaffiliated third parties.\n\n82  \n---  \n  \n**Related Party Policy**\n\nOur Code of Ethics requires us to avoid, wherever possible, all related party transactions that could result in actual or potential conflicts of interests, except under guidelines approved by the Board of Directors (or the audit committee). Related-party transactions are defined as transactions in which (1) the aggregate amount involved will or may be expected to exceed $120,000 in any calendar year, (2) we or any of our subsidiaries is a participant, and (3) any (a) executive officer, director or nominee for election as a director, (b) greater than 5% beneficial owner of our shares of common stock, or (c) immediate family member, of the persons referred to in clauses (a) and (b), has or will have a direct or indirect material interest (other than solely as a result of being a director or a less than 10% beneficial owner of another entity). A conflict of interest situation can arise when a person takes actions or has interests that may make it difficult to perform his or her work objectively and effectively. Conflicts of interest may also arise if a person, or a member of his or her family, receives improper personal benefits as a result of his or her position.\n\nOur audit committee, pursuant to its written charter, will be responsible for reviewing and approving related-party transactions to the extent we enter into such transactions. The audit committee will consider all relevant factors when determining whether to approve a related party transaction, including whether the related party transaction is on terms no less favorable to us than terms generally available from an unaffiliated third-party under the same or similar circumstances and the extent of the related party’s interest in the transaction. No director may participate in the approval of any transaction in which he or she is a related party, but that director is required to provide the audit committee with all material information concerning the transaction. We also require each of our directors and executive officers to complete a directors’ and officers’ questionnaire that elicits information about related party transactions.\n\nThese procedures are intended to determine whether any such related party transaction impairs the independence of a director or presents a conflict of interest on the part of a director, employee or officer.\n\nTo further minimize conflicts of interest, we have agreed not to consummate an initial business combination with an entity that is affiliated with any of our initial stockholders, officers or directors unless we have obtained an opinion from an independent investment banking firm, or another independent entity that commonly renders valuation opinions, that the business combination is fair to our unaffiliated stockholders from a financial point of view. We will also need to obtain approval of a majority of our disinterested independent directors. However, the following payments will be made to our sponsor, officers or directors, or our or their affiliates, none of which will be made from the proceeds of this offering held in the trust account prior to the completion of our initial business combination:\n\n• | Repayment of up to an aggregate of $1,500,000 in loans made to us by our sponsor to cover offering-related and organizational expenses;  \n---|---  \n• | Payment of $12,000 per month to our sponsor in exchange for management support, administrative, office space, and other services. We will cease paying these monthly fees 12 months from the date of the close of this offering.  \n• | Reimbursement for any out-of-pocket expenses related to identifying, investigating and completing an initial business combination;   \n• |  Repayment of non-interest-bearing extension loans which may be made by our sponsor or an affiliate of our sponsor or certain of our officers and directors to extend the time we have to consummate an intended initial business combination. Such loans may be convertible into warrants, at a price of $1.00 per warrant, at the option of the lender. The warrants would be identical to the private placement warrants, including as to exercise price, exercisability and exercise period; and  \n• | Repayment of non-interest bearing loans which may be made by our sponsor or an affiliate of our sponsor or certain of our officers and directors to finance transaction costs in connection with an intended initial business combination, the terms of which have not been determined nor have any written agreements been executed with respect thereto.  \n  \nOur audit committee will review on a quarterly basis all payments that were made to our sponsor, officers or directors, or our or their affiliates.\n\n83  \n---  \n  \n**DESCRIPTION OF SECURITIES**\n\n**General**\n\nAs of the date of this prospectus, we will be authorized to issue 50,000,000 shares of common stock, par value $0.0001, and 1,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par value $0.0001. As of the date of this prospectus, 1,932,000 shares of common stock are outstanding. No shares of preferred stock are currently outstanding. The following description summarizes the material terms of our securities. Because it is only a summary, it may not contain all the information that is important to you. For a complete description you should refer to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, bylaws and the form of warrant agreement, which are filed as exhibits to the registration statement of which this prospectus is a part, and to the applicable provisions of Delaware law.\n\n**Units**\n\nEach unit consists of one share of common stock, one warrant, and one-fifth (1/5) of one right. Each warrant entitles the holder to purchase one share of common stock. Each right entitles the holder to receive one-fifth (1/5) of one share of common stock upon consummation of our initial business combination.\n\nWe will file a Current Report on Form 8-K which includes an audited balance sheet promptly upon the consummation of this offering. The audited balance sheet will reflect proceeds we receive from the exercise of the over-allotment option, if the over-allotment option is exercised on the date of this prospectus. If the over-allotment option is exercised after the date of this prospectus, we will file an amendment to the Form 8-K to provide updated financial information to reflect the exercise of the over-allotment option. We will also include in this Form 8-K, an amendment thereto, or in a subsequent Form 8-K information indicating if EF Hutton has allowed separate trading of the shares of common stock, warrants and rights prior to the 52nd day after the date of this prospectus.\n\n**Common Stock**\n\nOur stockholders of record are entitled to one vote for each share held on all matters to be voted on by stockholders. In connection with any vote held to approve our initial business combination, our initial stockholders, as well as all of our officers and directors, have agreed to vote their respective shares of common stock owned by them immediately prior to this offering and any shares purchased in this offering or following this offering in the open market in favor of the proposed business combination.\n\nWe will consummate our initial business combination only if a majority of the outstanding shares of common stock voted are voted in favor of the business combination.\n\nOur Board of Directors is divided into three classes, each of which will generally serve for a term of three years with only one class of directors being elected in each year. There is no cumulative voting with respect to the election of directors, with the result that the holders of more than 50% of the shares eligible to vote for the election of directors can elect all of the directors.\n\nPursuant to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, if we do not consummate an initial business combination by 12 months (or up to 18 months, if we extend the time to complete a business combination as described in this prospectus) from the closing of this offering, we will cease our corporate existence except for the purposes of winding up our affairs and liquidating. If we are forced to liquidate prior to an initial business combination, our public stockholders are entitled to share ratably in the trust account, based on the amount then held in the trust account.\n\nOur initial stockholders, officers and directors have agreed to waive their rights to participate in any liquidation distribution from the trust account occurring upon our failure to consummate an initial business combination with respect to the founder’s common stock. Our initial stockholders, officers and directors will therefore not participate in any liquidation distribution from the trust account with respect to such shares. They will, however, participate in any liquidation distribution from the trust account with respect to any shares of common stock acquired in, or following, this offering.\n\nOur stockholders have no conversion, preemptive or other subscription rights and there are no sinking fund or redemption provisions applicable to the shares of common stock, except that public stockholders have the right to sell their shares to us in a tender offer or have their shares of common stock converted to cash equal to their pro rata share of the trust account in connection with the consummation of our business combination. Public stockholders who sell or convert their stock into their share of the trust account still have the right to exercise the warrants that they received as part of the units.\n\n84  \n---  \n  \n**Preferred Stock**\n\nThere are no shares of preferred stock outstanding. Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation authorizes the issuance of 1,000,000 shares of preferred stock with such designation, rights and preferences as may be determined from time to time by our Board of Directors. No shares of preferred stock are being issued or registered in this offering. Accordingly, our Board of Directors is empowered, without stockholder approval, to issue preferred stock with dividend, liquidation, conversion, voting or other rights which could adversely affect the voting power or other rights of the holders of common stock. However, the underwriting agreement prohibits us, prior to a business combination, from issuing preferred stock which participates in any manner in the proceeds of the trust account, or which votes as a class with the common stock on a business combination. We may issue some or all of the preferred stock to effect a business combination. In addition, the preferred stock could be utilized as a method of discouraging, delaying or preventing a change in control of us. Although we do not currently intend to issue any shares of preferred stock, we cannot assure you that we will not do so in the future.\n\n**Warrants**\n\nNo warrants are currently outstanding. Each warrant entitles the registered holder to purchase one share of common stock at a price of $11.50 per share, subject to adjustment as discussed below, at any time commencing 30 days after the completion of an initial business combination. However, no warrants will be exercisable for cash unless we have an effective and current registration statement covering the shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of the warrants and a current prospectus relating to such shares of common stock. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if a registration statement covering the shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of the public warrants is not effective within a specified period following the consummation of our initial business combination, warrant holders may, until such time as there is an effective registration statement and during any period when we shall have failed to maintain an effective registration statement, exercise warrants on a cashless basis pursuant to the exemption provided by Section 3(a)(9) of the Securities Act, provided that such exemption is available. If that exemption, or another exemption, is not available, holders will not be able to exercise their warrants on a cashless basis. In the event of such cashless exercise, each holder would pay the exercise price by surrendering the warrants for that number of shares of common stock equal to the quotient obtained by dividing (x) the product of the number of shares of common stock underlying the warrants, multiplied by the difference between the exercise price of the warrants and the “fair market value” (defined below) by (y) the fair market value. The “fair market value” for this purpose will mean the average reported last sale price of the shares of common stock for the 5 trading days ending on the trading day prior to the date of exercise. The warrants will expire on the fifth anniversary of our completion of an initial business combination, at 5:00 p.m., New York City time, or earlier upon redemption or liquidation of the trust account.\n\nThe private warrants, as well as any warrants underlying additional units we issue to our initial stockholders, officers, directors or their affiliates in payment of working capital loans made to us, will be identical to the warrants underlying the units being offered by this prospectus.\n\nWe may call the warrants for redemption, in whole and not in part, at a price of $0.01 per warrant,\n\n• | at any time after the warrants become exercisable,  \n---|---  \n• | upon not less than 30 days’ prior written notice of redemption to each warrant holder,  \n• | if, and only if, the reported last sale price of the shares of common stock equals or exceeds $18.00 per share (as adjusted for stock splits, stock dividends, reorganizations and recapitalizations), for any 20 trading days within a 30 trading day period commencing at any time after the shares underlying the warrants have become exercisable and ending on the third business day prior to the notice of redemption to warrant holders; and  \n• | if, and only if, there is a current registration statement in effect with respect to the shares of common stock underlying such warrants.  \n  \nThe right to exercise will be forfeited unless the warrants are exercised prior to the date specified in the notice of redemption. On and after the redemption date, a record holder of a warrant will have no further rights except to receive the redemption price for such holder’s warrant upon surrender of such warrant.\n\nThe redemption criteria for our warrants have been established at a price which is intended to provide warrant holders a reasonable premium to the initial exercise price and provide a sufficient differential between the then-prevailing share price and the warrant exercise price so that if the share price declines as a result of our redemption call, the redemption will not cause the share price to drop below the exercise price of the warrants.\n\nIf we call the warrants for redemption as described above, our management will have the option to require all holders that wish to exercise warrants to do so on a “cashless basis.” In such event, each holder would pay the exercise price by surrendering the warrants for that number of shares of common stock equal to the quotient obtained by dividing (x) the product of the number of shares of common stock underlying the warrants, multiplied by the difference between the exercise price of the warrants and the “fair market value” (defined below) by (y) the fair market value. The “fair market value” for this purpose shall mean the average reported last sale price of the shares of common stock for the 5 trading days ending on the third trading day prior to the date on which the notice of redemption is sent to the holders of warrants.\n\n85  \n---  \n  \nThe warrants will be issued in registered form under a warrant agreement between Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, as warrant agent, and us. The warrant agreement provides that the terms of the warrants may be amended without the consent of any holder to cure any ambiguity or correct any defective provision, but requires the approval, by written consent or vote, of the holders of at least a majority of the then outstanding warrants in order to make any change that adversely affects the interests of the registered holders.\n\nThe exercise price and number of shares of common stock issuable on exercise of the warrants may be adjusted in certain circumstances including in the event of a stock dividend, extraordinary dividend or our recapitalization, reorganization, merger or consolidation. However, except as described below, the warrants will not be adjusted for issuances of shares of common stock at a price below their respective exercise prices.\n\nIn addition, if (x) we issue additional shares of common stock or equity-linked securities for capital raising purposes in connection with the closing of our initial business combination at an issue price or effective issue price of less than $9.20 per share of common stock (with such issue price or effective issue price to be determined in good faith by our Board of Directors, and in the case of any such issuance to our initial stockholders or their affiliates, without taking into account any Founder’s Shares held by them prior to such issuance) (the “Newly Issued Price”), (y) the aggregate gross proceeds from such issuances represent more than 60% of the total equity proceeds, and interest thereon, available for the funding of our initial business combination on the date of the consummation of our initial business combination (net of redemptions), and (z) the volume weighted average trading price of our shares of common stock during the 20 trading day period starting on the trading day prior to the day on which we consummate our initial business combination (such price, the “Market Value”) is below $9.20 per share, the exercise price of the warrants will be adjusted (to the nearest cent) to be equal to 115% of the higher of the Market Value and the Newly Issued Price, the corresponding $18.00 per share redemption trigger price will be adjusted (to the nearest cent) to be equal to 180% of the higher of the Market Value and the Newly Issued Price.\n\nThe warrants may be exercised upon surrender of the warrant certificate on or prior to the expiration date at the offices of the warrant agent, with the exercise form on the reverse side of the warrant certificate completed and executed as indicated, accompanied by full payment of the exercise price, by certified or official bank check payable to us, for the number of warrants being exercised. The warrant holders do not have the rights or privileges of holders of shares of common stock and any voting rights until they exercise their warrants and receive shares of common stock. After the issuance of shares of common stock upon exercise of the warrants, each holder will be entitled to one vote for each share held of record on all matters to be voted on by stockholders.\n\nWarrant holders may elect to be subject to a restriction on the exercise of their warrants such that an electing warrant holder would not be able to exercise their warrants to the extent that, after giving effect to such exercise, such holder would beneficially own in excess of 10.1% of the shares of common stock outstanding.\n\nNo fractional shares will be issued upon exercise of the warrants. If, upon exercise of the warrants, a holder would be entitled to receive a fractional interest in a share, we will, upon exercise, round up to the nearest whole number the number of shares of common stock to be issued to the warrant holder.\n\n**Rights included as part of units**\n\nExcept in cases where we are not the surviving company in a business combination, each holder of a right will automatically receive one-fifth (1/5) of one share of common stock upon consummation of our initial business combination, even if the holder of a public right converted all shares held by such holder in connection with the initial business combination. In the event we will not be the surviving company upon completion of our initial business combination, each holder of a right will be required to affirmatively convert such holder’s rights in order to receive the one-fifth (1/5) of one share of common stock underlying each right upon consummation of the business combination. No additional consideration will be required to be paid by a holder of rights in order to receive such holder’s additional shares upon consummation of an initial business combination. The shares issuable upon exchange of the rights will be freely tradable (except to the extent held by affiliates of ours). If we enter into a definitive agreement for a business combination in which we will not be the surviving entity, the definitive agreement will provide for the holders of rights to receive the same per share consideration the holders of our common stock will receive in the transaction on an as-converted basis into common stock.\n\nWe will not issue fractional shares in connection with an exchange of rights. Fractional shares will either be rounded down to the nearest whole share or otherwise addressed in accordance with applicable law. As a result, you must hold rights in multiples of 5 in order to receive shares for all of your rights upon closing of a business combination. If we are unable to complete an initial business combination within the required time period and we liquidate the funds held in the trust account, holders of rights will not receive any of such funds with respect to their rights, nor will they receive any distribution from our assets held outside of the trust account with respect to such rights, and the rights will expire worthless. Further, there are no contractual penalties for failure to deliver securities to the holders of the rights upon consummation of an initial business combination. Additionally, in no event will we be required to net cash settle the rights. Accordingly, the rights may expire worthless.\n\n**Dividends**\n\nWe have not paid any cash dividends on our shares of common stock to date and do not intend to pay cash dividends prior to the completion of a business combination. The payment of cash dividends in the future will be dependent upon our revenues and earnings, if any, capital requirements and general financial condition subsequent to completion of a business combination. The payment of any dividends subsequent to a business combination will be within the discretion of our then board of directors. It is the present intention of our Board of Directors to retain all earnings, if any, for use in our business operations and, accordingly, our Board does not anticipate declaring any dividends in the foreseeable future.\n\n**Our Transfer Agent and Warrant Agent**\n\nThe transfer agent for our securities and warrant agent for our warrants is Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company1 State Street, 30th Floor, New York, New York 10004.\n\n86  \n---  \n  \n**Listing of our Securities**\n\nWe have applied to have our units listed on NASDAQ under the symbol “IROHU” and, once the common stock, warrants and rights begin separate trading, under the symbols “IROH,” “IROHW” and “IROHR,” respectively. If approved for listing, we anticipate that our units will be listed on NASDAQ on or promptly after the effective date of the registration statement. Following the date the common stock, warrants and rights are eligible to trade separately, we anticipate that the common stock, warrants and rights will be listed separately and as a unit on NASDAQ.\n\n**Certain Anti-Takeover Provisions of Delaware Law and our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation and By-Laws**\n\n**_Staggered board of directors; board vacancies_**\n\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that our Board of Directors will be classified into three classes of directors of approximately equal size. As a result, in most circumstances, a person can gain control of our board only by successfully engaging in a proxy contest at two or more annual meetings. Additionally, in certain circumstances, when a vacancy on the Board of Directors arises due to the expansion of our board’s size or due to the resignation, death or removal of a director, our bylaws authorize the Board of Directors (rather than our stockholders) to fill the resulting vacancy, which may make it harder for stockholders to replace directors.\n\n**_Stockholder action; special meeting of stockholders_**\n\nOur bylaws provide that stockholders may not take action by written consent, but may only take action at an annual or special meetings of stockholders. Additionally, our bylaws provide that special meetings of our stockholders may be called only by a majority vote of our Board of Directors, by our president or by our Chairman or by our Secretary at the request in writing of stockholders owning a majority of our issued and outstanding capital stock entitled to vote.\n\n**_Advance notice requirements for stockholder proposals and director nominations_**\n\nOur bylaws provide that stockholders seeking to bring business before our annual meeting of stockholders, or to nominate candidates for election as directors at our annual meeting of stockholders must provide timely notice of their intent in writing. To be timely, a stockholder’s notice will need to be delivered to our principal executive offices not later than the close of business on the 60th day nor earlier than the close of business on the 90th day prior to the scheduled date of the annual meeting of stockholders. In the event that less than 70 days’ notice or prior public disclosure of the date of the annual meeting of stockholders is given, a stockholder’s notice shall be timely if delivered to our principal executive offices not later than the 10th day following the day on which public announcement of the date of our annual meeting of stockholders is first made or sent by us. Our bylaws also specify certain requirements as to the form and content of a stockholders’ meeting. These provisions may preclude our stockholders from bringing matters before our annual meeting of stockholders or from making nominations for directors at our annual meeting of stockholders.\n\n**_Supermajority approval requirement_**\n\nUnder our bylaws, subject to certain exceptions and qualifications, the approval of holders representing at least two thirds (2/3rds) of the total voting power of the shares entitled to vote generally in the election of directors will be required for stockholders to adopt, amend or repeal our bylaws and certain provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation.\n\n**_Authorized but unissued shares_**\n\nOur authorized but unissued common stock and preferred stock are available for future issuances without stockholder approval and could be utilized for a variety of corporate purposes, including future offerings to raise additional capital, acquisitions and employee benefit plans. The existence of authorized but unissued and unreserved common stock and preferred stock could render more difficult or discourage an attempt to obtain control of us by means of a proxy contest, tender offer, merger or otherwise.\n\n**_Exclusive forum selection_**\n\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation will require, to the fullest extent permitted by law, that derivative actions brought in our name, actions against directors, officers and employees for breach of fiduciary duty and other similar actions may be brought only in the Court of Chancery in the State of Delaware, except any action (A) as to which the Court of Chancery in the State of Delaware determines that there is an indispensable party not subject to the jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery (and the indispensable party does not consent to the personal jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery within ten days following such determination), (B) which is vested in the exclusive jurisdiction of a court or forum other than the Court of Chancery, (C) for which the Court of Chancery does not have subject matter jurisdiction or (D) any action arising under the Securities Act. If an action is brought outside of Delaware, the stockholder bringing the suit will be deemed to have consented to service of process on such stockholder’s counsel. Although we believe this provision benefits us by providing increased consistency in the application of Delaware law in the types of lawsuits to which it applies, a court may determine that this provision is unenforceable, and to the extent it is enforceable, the provision may have the effect of discouraging lawsuits against our directors and officers, although our stockholders will not be deemed to have waived our compliance with federal securities laws and the rules and regulations thereunder and therefore bring a claim in another appropriate forum. Additionally, we cannot be certain that a court will decide that this provision is either applicable or enforceable, and if a court were to find the choice of forum provision contained in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation to be inapplicable or unenforceable in an action, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such action in other jurisdictions, which could harm our business, operating results and financial condition.\n\n87  \n---  \n  \nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation will provide that the exclusive forum provision will be applicable to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law. Section 27 of the Exchange Act creates exclusive federal jurisdiction over all suits brought to enforce any duty or liability created by the Exchange Act or the rules and regulations thereunder. As a result, the exclusive forum provision will not apply to suits brought to enforce any duty or liability created by the Exchange Act or any other claim for which the federal courts have exclusive jurisdiction.\n\n**Limitation on Liability and Indemnification of Directors and Officers**\n\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that our directors and officers will be indemnified by us to the fullest extent authorized by Delaware law as it now exists or may in the future be amended. In addition, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that our directors will not be personally liable for monetary damages to us for breaches of their fiduciary duty as directors, unless they violated their duty of loyalty to us or our stockholders, acted in bad faith, knowingly or intentionally violated the law, authorized unlawful payments of dividends, unlawful stock purchases or unlawful redemptions, or derived an improper personal benefit from their actions as directors.\n\nWe will enter into agreements with our officers and directors to provide contractual indemnification in addition to the indemnification provided for in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation. Our bylaws also will permit us to secure insurance on behalf of any officer, director or employee for any liability arising out of his or her actions, regardless of whether Delaware law would permit indemnification. We will purchase a policy of directors’ and officers’ liability insurance that insures our directors and officers against the cost of defense, settlement or payment of a judgment in some circumstances and insures us against our obligations to indemnify the directors and officers.\n\nThese provisions may discourage stockholders from bringing a lawsuit against our directors for breach of their fiduciary duty. These provisions also may have the effect of reducing the likelihood of derivative litigation against directors and officers, even though such an action, if successful, might otherwise benefit us and our stockholders. Furthermore, a stockholder’s investment may be adversely affected to the extent we pay the costs of settlement and damage awards against directors and officers pursuant to these indemnification provisions. We believe that these provisions, the insurance and the indemnity agreements are necessary to attract and retain talented and experienced directors and officers.\n\nInsofar as indemnification for liabilities arising under the Securities Act may be permitted to our directors, officers and controlling persons pursuant to the foregoing provisions, or otherwise, we have been advised that in the opinion of the SEC such indemnification is against public policy as expressed in the Securities Act and is, therefore, unenforceable.\n\n88  \n---  \n  \n**SHARES ELIGIBLE FOR FUTURE SALE**\n\nImmediately after this offering, we will have 7,715,000 shares of common stock outstanding, 8,867,000 shares if the over-allotment option is exercised in full. Of these shares, the 6,000,000 shares sold in this offering, or 6,900,000 shares if the over-allotment option is exercised in full, will be freely tradable without restriction or further registration under the Securities Act, except for any shares purchased by one of our affiliates within the meaning of Rule 144 under the Securities Act. All of the remaining shares are restricted securities under Rule 144, in that they were issued in private transactions not involving a public offering. All of those shares have been placed in escrow and will not be transferable until they are released except in limited circumstances described elsewhere in this prospectus.\n\n**_Rule 144_**\n\nA person who has beneficially owned restricted shares of common stock or warrants for at least six months would be entitled to sell their securities provided that (i) such person is not deemed to have been one of our affiliates at the time of, or at any time during the three months preceding, a sale and (ii) we are subject to the Exchange Act periodic reporting requirements for at least three months before the sale. Persons who have beneficially owned restricted shares of common stock for at least six months but who are our affiliates at the time of, or any time during the three months preceding, a sale would be subject to additional restrictions, by which such person would be entitled to sell within any three-month period a number of shares that does not exceed the greater of either of the following:\n\n• | 1% of the number of shares of common stock then outstanding, which will equal 77,150 shares immediately after this offering (or 88,670 if the over-allotment option is exercised in full); and  \n---|---  \n• | the average weekly trading volume of the shares of common stock during the four calendar weeks preceding the filing of a notice on Form 144 with respect to the sale.  \n  \nSales under Rule 144 are also limited by manner of sale provisions and notice requirements and to the availability of current public information about us.\n\n**Restrictions on the Use of Rule 144 by Shell Companies or Former Shell Companies**\n\nHistorically, the SEC staff had taken the position that Rule 144 is not available for the resale of securities initially issued by companies that are, or previously were, blank check companies, like us. The SEC has codified and expanded this position in the amendments discussed above by prohibiting the use of Rule 144 for resale of securities issued by any shell companies (other than business combination related shell companies) or any issuer that has been at any time previously a shell company. The SEC has provided an important exception to this prohibition, however, if the following conditions are met:\n\n• | the issuer of the securities that was formerly a shell company has ceased to be a shell company;  \n---|---  \n• | the issuer of the securities is subject to the reporting requirements of Section 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act;  \n• | the issuer of the securities has filed all Exchange Act reports and material required to be filed, as applicable, during the preceding 12 months (or such shorter period that the issuer was required to file such reports and materials), other than Form 8-K reports; and  \n• | at least one year has elapsed from the time that the issuer filed current Form 10 type information with the SEC reflecting its status as an entity that is not a shell company.  \n  \n89  \n---  \n  \nAs a result, it is likely that pursuant to Rule 144, our initial stockholders will be able to sell their Founder’s Shares freely without registration one year after we have completed our initial business combination assuming none of them are affiliates of ours at that time.\n\n**_Registration Rights_**\n\nThe holders of the Founder’s Shares and Representative Shares issued and outstanding on the date of this prospectus, as well as the holders of the private warrants and any warrants our initial stockholders, officers, directors or their affiliates may be issued in payment of working capital loans made to us (and all underlying securities), will be entitled to registration rights pursuant to an agreement to be signed prior to or on the effective date of this offering. The holders of a majority of these securities are entitled to make up to two demands that we register such securities. The holders of the majority of the Founder’s Shares can elect to exercise these registration rights at any time commencing three months prior to the date on which these shares of common stock are to be released from escrow. The holders of a majority of the Representative Shares, private warrants and warrants issued to our initial stockholders, officers, directors or their affiliates in payment of working capital loans made to us (or underlying securities) can elect to exercise these registration rights at any time after we consummate a business combination. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, EF Hutton may only make a demand on one occasion and only during the five-year period beginning on the effective date of the registration statement of which this prospectus forms a part. In addition, the holders have certain “piggy-back” registration rights with respect to registration statements filed subsequent to our consummation of a business combination; provided, however, that EF Hutton may participate in a “piggy-back” registration only during the seven-year period beginning on the effective date of the registration statement of which this prospectus forms a part. We will bear the expenses incurred in connection with the filing of any such registration statements.\n\n90  \n---  \n  \n**MATERIAL U.S. FEDERAL TAX CONSIDERATIONS**\n\nThe following is a discussion of certain material U.S. federal income and estate tax considerations with respect to your ownership and disposition of our units, shares of common stock, warrants and rights, which we refer to collectively as our securities, assuming you purchase the securities in this offering and will hold them as capital assets within the meaning of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”).\n\nThis discussion does not address all of the U.S. federal income and estate tax considerations that may be relevant to you in light of your particular circumstances, and it does not describe all of the tax consequences that may be relevant to persons subject to special rules, such as:\n\n• | certain financial institutions;  \n---|---  \n• | insurance companies;  \n• | dealers and traders in securities or foreign currencies;  \n• | persons holding our securities as part of a hedge, straddle, conversion transaction or other integrated transaction;  \n• | former citizens or residents of the United States;  \n• | U.S. persons whose functional currency for U.S. federal income tax purposes is not the U.S. dollar;  \n• | partnerships or other entities classified as partnerships for U.S. federal income tax purposes;  \n• | persons liable for the alternative minimum tax; and  \n• | tax-exempt organizations.  \n  \nThe following does not discuss any aspect of state, local or non-U.S. taxation. This discussion is based on current provisions of the Code, Treasury regulations, judicial opinions, published positions of the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) and all other applicable authorities, all of which are subject to change, possibly with retroactive effect.\n\nIf an entity that is treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes holds our securities, the tax treatment of a partner will generally depend on the status of the partner and the activities of the entity. If you are a partner in such an entity, you should consult your tax advisor.\n\n**WE URGE PROSPECTIVE INVESTORS TO CONSULT THEIR TAX ADVISORS REGARDING THE U.S. FEDERAL, STATE, LOCAL AND NON-U.S. INCOME, ESTATE AND OTHER TAX CONSIDERATIONS WITH RESPECT TO ACQUIRING, HOLDING AND DISPOSING OF OUR SECURITIES.**\n\n91  \n---  \n  \n**Allocation of Purchase Price and Characterization of a Unit**\n\nNo statutory, administrative or judicial authority directly addresses the treatment of a unit or instruments similar to a unit for U.S. federal income tax purposes and, therefore, that treatment is not entirely clear. The acquisition of a unit should be treated for U.S. federal income tax purposes as the acquisition of one share of our common stock, one warrant to acquire one share of our common stock, and one right entitling the holder to receive one-fifth (1/5) of one share of common stock upon the consummation of our initial business combination, subject to adjustment as described in this prospectus. For U.S. federal income tax purposes, each holder of a unit must allocate the purchase price paid by such holder for such unit between the one share of common stock and the warrant based on the relative fair market value of each at the time of issuance. Under U.S. federal income tax law, each investor must make their own determination of such value based on all the relevant facts and circumstances. Therefore, we strongly urge each investor to consult their own tax adviser regarding the determination of value for these purposes. The price allocated to each share of common stock and warrant should be the stockholder’s tax basis in such share or warrant, as the case may be. Any disposition of a unit should be treated for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a disposition of the share of common stock and warrant comprising the unit, and the amount realized on the disposition should be allocated between the share of common stock and the warrant based on their respective relative fair market values (as determined by each such unit holder on all the relevant facts and circumstances) at the time of disposition. The separation of shares of common stock and warrants, nor the one right entitling the holder thereof to receive one-fifth (1/5) of one share of common stock upon the consummation of our initial business combination comprising units should not be a taxable event for U.S. federal income tax purposes.\n\nThe foregoing treatment of the shares of common stock and warrants and a holder’s purchase price allocation are not binding on the IRS or the courts. Because there are no authorities that directly address instruments that are similar to the units, no assurance can be given that the IRS or the courts will agree with the characterization described above or the discussion below. Accordingly, each prospective investor is urged to consult their own tax advisors regarding the tax consequences of an investment in a unit (including alternative characterizations of a unit). The balance of this discussion assumes that the characterization of the units described above is respected for U.S. federal income tax purposes.\n\n**Personal Holding Company Status**\n\nWe could be subject to United States federal income tax at rates in excess of those generally applicable to U.S. corporations on a portion of our income if we are determined to be a personal holding company, or PHC, for United States federal income tax purposes. A U.S. corporation will generally be classified as a PHC for United States federal income tax purposes in a given taxable year if (i) at any time during the last half of such taxable year, five or fewer individuals (without regard to their citizenship or residency and including as individuals for this purpose certain entities such as certain tax-exempt organizations, pension funds, and charitable trusts) own or are deemed to own (pursuant to certain constructive ownership rules) more than 50% of the stock of the corporation by value and (ii) at least 60% of the corporation’s adjusted ordinary gross income, as determined for United States federal income tax purposes, for such taxable year consists of PHC income (which includes, among other things, dividends, interest, certain royalties, annuities and, under certain circumstances, rents).\n\nDepending on the date and size of our initial business combination, it is possible that at least 60% of our adjusted ordinary gross income may consist of PHC income as discussed above. In addition, depending on the concentration of our stock in the hands of individuals, including certain tax-exempt organizations, pension funds, and charitable trusts, it is possible that more than 50% of our stock will be owned or deemed owned (pursuant to the constructive ownership rules) by such persons during the last half of a taxable year. Thus, no assurance can be given that we will not become a PHC following this offering or in the future. If we are or were to become a PHC in a given taxable year, we would be subject to an additional PHC tax, currently 20%, on our undistributed taxable income, subject to certain adjustments.\n\n**U.S. Holders**\n\nThis section is addressed to U.S. holders of our securities. For purposes of this discussion, you are a “U.S. holder” if you are a beneficial owner of a security that is:\n\n• | an individual citizen or resident of the United States for U.S. federal income tax purposes;  \n---|---  \n• | a corporation, or other entity taxable as a corporation, created or organized in, or under the laws of, the United States or any state thereof or the District of Columbia; or  \n• | an estate or trust the income of which is subject to U.S. federal income taxation regardless of its source.  \n  \n92  \n---  \n  \n**_Dividends and Distributions_**\n\nAs discussed under “Dividend Policy” above, we do not anticipate that any dividends will be paid in the foreseeable future. If we do make distributions on our common stock, such distributions generally will be treated as dividends for U.S. federal income tax purposes to the extent of our current or accumulated earnings and profits. Distributions in excess of our current or accumulated earnings and profits generally will first reduce your basis in the common stock (but not below zero) and then will be treated as gain realized on the sale or other disposition of the common stock (as described in the first paragraph under “— Sale or Other Disposition or Conversion of Common Stock” below).\n\nThe conversion feature of the common stock described under “Proposed Business — Effecting a Business Combination — Conversion Rights” may be viewed as a position with respect to substantially similar or related property which diminishes your risk of loss and thereby affects your ability to satisfy the holding period requirements for the dividends received deduction or the preferential tax rate on qualified dividend income with respect to the time period prior to the approval of an initial business combination.\n\n**_Sale or Other Disposition or Conversion of Common Stock_**\n\nGain or loss you realize on the sale or other disposition of our common stock (other than conversion into cash but including a liquidation in the event we do not consummate a business combination within the required time) will be capital gain or loss. The amount of your gain or loss will be equal to the difference between your tax basis in the common stock disposed of and the amount realized on the disposition. The deductibility of capital losses is subject to limitations. Any capital gain or loss you realize on a sale or other disposition of our common stock will generally be long-term capital gain or loss if your holding period for the common stock is more than one year. However, the conversion feature of the common stock described under “Proposed Business — Effecting a Business Combination — Conversion Rights” could affect your ability to satisfy the holding period requirements for the long-term capital gain tax rate with respect to the time period prior to the approval of an initial business combination.\n\nIf you convert your common stock into a right to receive cash as described in “Proposed Business — Effecting a Business Combination — Conversion Rights,” the conversion generally will be treated as a sale of common stock described in the preceding paragraph (rather than as a dividend or distribution). The conversion will, however, be treated as a dividend or distribution and taxed as described in “— Dividends and Distributions” above if your percentage ownership in us (including shares that you are deemed to own under certain attribution rules, such as the shares into which the warrants are exercisable) after the conversion is not meaningfully reduced from what your percentage ownership was prior to the conversion. If you have a relatively minimal stock interest and, taking into account the effect of conversion by other stockholders, your percentage ownership in us is reduced as a result of the conversion, you may be regarded as having suffered a meaningful reduction in interest. For example, the IRS has indicated in a published ruling that even a small reduction of a minority stockholder’s proportionate interest in a publicly-held corporation may constitute such a “meaningful reduction” in a transaction in which a holder held less than 1% of the shares of a corporation and did not have management control over the corporation.\n\nYou should consult your own tax advisor as to whether conversion of your common stock will be treated as a sale or as a dividend under the Code and, if you actually or constructively own 5% (or, if our stock is not then publicly traded, 1%) or more of our common stock before conversion, whether you are subject to special reporting requirements with respect to such conversion.\n\n**_Sale or Other Disposition, Exercise or Expiration of Warrants_**\n\nUpon the sale or other disposition of a warrant (other than by exercise), you will generally recognize capital gain or loss equal to the difference between the amount realized on the sale or other disposition and your tax basis in the warrant. This capital gain or loss will be long-term capital gain or loss if, at the time of the sale or other disposition, the warrant has been held by you for more than one year. The deductibility of capital losses is subject to limitations.\n\nIn general, you will not be required to recognize income, gain or loss upon exercise of a warrant for its exercise price. Your basis in a share of common stock received upon exercise will be equal to the sum of (1) your basis in the warrant and (2) the exercise price of the warrant. Your holding period in the shares received upon exercise will commence on the day after you exercise the warrants. Although there is no direct legal authority as to the U.S. federal income tax treatment of an exercise of a warrant on a cashless basis, we intend to take the position that such exercise will not be taxable, either because the exercise is not a gain realization event or because it qualifies as a tax-free recapitalization. In the former case, the holding period of the common stock should commence on the day after the warrant is exercised. In the latter case, the holding period of the common stock would include the holding period of the exercised warrants. However, our position is not binding on the IRS and the IRS may treat a cashless exercise of a warrant as a taxable exchange. You are urged to consult your own tax advisor as to the consequences of an exercise of a warrant on a cashless basis.\n\n93  \n---  \n  \nIf a warrant expires without being exercised, you will recognize a capital loss in an amount equal to your basis in the warrant. Such loss will be long-term capital loss if, at the time of the expiration, the warrant has been held by you for more than one year. The deductibility of capital losses is subject to limitations.\n\n**_Constructive Dividends on Warrants_**\n\nAs discussed under “Dividend Policy” above, we do not anticipate that any dividends will be paid in the foreseeable future. If at any time during the period you hold warrants, however, we were to pay a taxable dividend to our stockholders and, in accordance with the anti-dilution provisions of the warrants, the conversion rate of the warrants were increased, that increase would be deemed to be the payment of a taxable dividend to you to the extent of our earnings and profits, notwithstanding the fact that you will not receive a cash payment. If the conversion rate is adjusted in certain other circumstances (or in certain circumstances, there is a failure to make adjustments), such adjustments may also result in the deemed payment of a taxable dividend to you. You should consult your tax advisor regarding the proper treatment of any adjustments to the warrants.\n\n**_Unearned Income Medicare Tax_**\n\nA 3.8% Medicare contribution tax will generally apply to all or some portion of the net investment income of a U.S. holder that is an individual with adjusted gross income that exceeds a threshold amount ($250,000 if married filing jointly or if considered a “surviving spouse” for federal income tax purposes, $125,000 if married filing separately, and $200,000 in other cases). This 3.8% tax will also apply to all or some portion of the undistributed net investment income of certain U.S. holders that are estates and trusts. For these purposes, dividends and gains from the taxable dispositions of the common stock and warrants will generally be taken into account in computing such a U.S. holder’s net investment income.\n\n**_Information Reporting and Backup Withholding_**\n\nInformation returns may be filed with the IRS with respect to dividends or other distributions we may pay to you and proceeds from the sale of your shares of common stock or warrants. You will be subject to backup withholding on these payments if you fail to provide your taxpayer identification number to the paying agent and comply with certain certification procedures or otherwise establish an exemption from backup withholding. Backup withholding is not an additional tax. Any amounts withheld with respect to your shares of common stock or warrants under the backup withholding rules will be refunded to you or credited against your United States federal income tax liability, if any, by the IRS provided that certain required information is furnished to the IRS in a timely manner.\n\n**Non-U.S. Holders**\n\nThis section is addressed to non-U.S. holders of the securities. For purposes of this discussion, a “non-U.S. holder” is a beneficial owner of our units, common stock or warrants (other than an entity treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes) that is not a U.S. holder.\n\n**_Dividends and Distributions_**\n\nAs discussed under “Dividend Policy” above, we do not anticipate that any dividends will be paid in the foreseeable future. If, however, we were to pay taxable dividends to you with respect to your shares of common stock (including any deemed distributions treated as a dividend on the warrants, as described in “— Constructive Dividends on Warrants” below), those dividends would generally be subject to United States withholding tax at a rate of 30% of the gross amount, unless you are eligible for a reduced rate of withholding tax under an applicable income tax treaty and you provide proper certification of your eligibility for such reduced rate (usually on an IRS Form W-8BEN or Form W-8BEN-E). A distribution generally will constitute a dividend for U.S. federal income tax purposes to the extent of our current or accumulated earnings and profits as determined under the Code. Any distribution not constituting a dividend generally will be treated first as reducing your basis in your shares of common stock and, to the extent it exceeds your basis, as gain from the disposition of your shares of common stock treated as described under “Sale or Other Disposition of Common Stock or Warrants” below. The full amount of any distributions to you may, however, be subject to United States withholding tax unless the applicable withholding agent elects to withhold a lesser amount based on a reasonable estimate of the amount of the distribution that would be treated as a dividend. In addition, if we determine that we are likely to be classified as a “United States real property holding corporation” (see “Sale or Other Disposition of Common Stock or Warrants” below), we will withhold at least 15% of any distribution that exceeds our current and accumulated earnings and profits as provided by the Code.\n\n94  \n---  \n  \nDividends we pay to you that are effectively connected with your conduct of a trade or business within the United States (and, if certain income tax treaties apply, are attributable to a United States permanent establishment maintained by you) generally will not be subject to United States withholding tax if you comply with applicable certification and disclosure requirements (usually by providing an IRS Form W-8ECI). Instead, such dividends generally will be subject to United States federal income tax, net of certain deductions, at the same graduated individual or corporate rates applicable to United States persons. If you are a corporation, effectively connected income may also be subject to a “branch profits tax” at a rate of 30% (or such lower rate as may be specified by an applicable income tax treaty).\n\n**_Exercise of Warrants_**\n\nYou generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax on the exercise of the warrants into shares of common stock. However, if a cashless exercise of warrants results in a taxable exchange, as described in “— U.S. Holders — Sale or Other Disposition, Exercise or Expiration of Warrants,” the rules described below under “Sale or Other Disposition of Common Stock or Warrants” would apply.\n\n**_Sale or Other Disposition of Common Stock or Warrants_**\n\nYou generally will not be subject to United States federal income tax on any gain realized upon the sale, exchange or other disposition of our common stock (which would include a dissolution and liquidation in the event we do not consummate an initial business combination within the required timeframe) or warrants (including an expiration or redemption of our warrants), unless:\n\n• | the gain is effectively connected with your conduct of a trade or business within the United States (and, under certain income tax treaties, is attributable to a United States permanent establishment you maintain);  \n---|---  \n• | you are an individual, you hold your shares of common stock or warrants as capital assets, you are present in the United States for 183 days or more in the taxable year of disposition and you meet other conditions, and you are not eligible for relief under an applicable income tax treaty; or  \n• | we are or have been a “United States real property holding corporation” for United States federal income tax purposes and, in the case where the shares of our common stock are regularly traded on an established securities market, you hold or have held, directly or indirectly, at any time within the shorter of the five-year period preceding disposition or your holding period for your shares of common stock or warrants, more than 5% of our common stock. Special rules may apply to the determination of the 5% threshold in the case of a holder of a warrant. You are urged to consult your own tax advisors regarding the effect of holding the warrants on the calculation of such 5% threshold. We will be classified as a United States real property holding corporation if the fair market value of our “United States real property interests” equals or exceeds 50% of the sum of (1) the fair market value of our United States real property interests, (2) the fair market value of our non-United States real property interests and (3) the fair market value of any other of our assets which are used or held for use in our trade or business. Although we currently are not a United States real property holding corporation, we cannot determine whether we will be a United States real property holding corporation in the future until we consummate an initial business combination.  \n  \nGain that is effectively connected with your conduct of a trade or business within the United States generally will be subject to United States federal income tax, net of certain deductions, at the same rates applicable to United States persons. If you are a corporation, the branch profits tax also may apply to such effectively connected gain. If the gain from the sale or disposition of your shares of common stock or warrants is effectively connected with your conduct of a trade or business in the United States but under an applicable income tax treaty is not attributable to a permanent establishment you maintain in the United States, your gain may be exempt from United States tax under the treaty. If you are described in the second bullet point above, you generally will be subject to United States federal income tax at a rate of 30% on the gain realized, although the gain may be offset by some United States source capital losses realized during the same taxable year. If you are described in the third bullet point above, gain recognized by you on the sale, exchange or other disposition of shares of common stock or warrants will be subject to U.S. federal income tax on a net income basis at normal graduated U.S. federal income tax rates. In addition, a buyer of your shares of common stock or warrants may be required to withhold United States income tax at a rate of 15% of the amount realized upon such disposition.\n\n95  \n---  \n  \nIf you convert your common stock into a right to receive cash as described in “Proposed Business — Effecting a Business Combination — Conversion Rights,” the conversion generally will be treated as a sale of common stock rather than as a dividend or distribution. The conversion will, however, be treated as a dividend or distribution and taxed as described in “Dividends and Distributions” if your percentage ownership in us (including shares that you are deemed to own under certain attribution rules, such as the shares into which the warrants are exercisable) after the conversion is not meaningfully reduced from what your percentage ownership was prior to the conversion. See the discussion in “— U.S. Holders — Sale or Other Disposition or Conversion of Common Stock.” You should consult your own tax advisor as to whether conversion of your common stock will be treated as a sale or as a dividend under the Code.\n\n**_Constructive Dividends on Warrants_**\n\nAs discussed under “Dividend Policy” above, we do not anticipate that any dividends will be paid in the foreseeable future. If at any time during the period you hold warrants, however, we were to pay a taxable dividend to our stockholders and, in accordance with the anti-dilution provisions of the warrants, the conversion rate of the warrants were increased, that increase would be deemed to be the payment of a taxable dividend to you to the extent of our earnings and profits, notwithstanding the fact that you will not receive a cash payment. If the conversion rate is adjusted in certain other circumstances (or in certain circumstances, there is a failure to make adjustments), such adjustments may also result in the deemed payment of a taxable dividend to you. Any resulting withholding tax attributable to deemed dividends would be collected from other amounts payable or distributable to you. You should consult your tax advisor regarding the proper treatment of any adjustments to the warrants.\n\n**_Information Reporting and Backup Withholding_**\n\nWe must report annually to the IRS the amount of dividends or other distributions we may pay to you on your shares of common stock and the amount of tax we withhold on any such distributions regardless of whether withholding is required. The IRS may make copies of the information returns reporting those dividends and amounts withheld available to the tax authorities in the country in which you reside pursuant to the provisions of an applicable income tax treaty or exchange of information treaty.\n\nThe United States imposes backup withholding on dividends and certain other types of payments to United States persons. You will not be subject to backup withholding on dividends you receive on your shares of common stock if you provide proper certification (usually on an IRS Form W-8BEN or Form W-8BEN-E) of your status as a non-United States person or you are a corporation or one of several types of entities and organizations that qualify for exemption (an “exempt recipient”).\n\nInformation reporting and backup withholding generally are not required with respect to the amount of any proceeds from the sale of your shares of common stock or warrants outside the United States through a foreign office of a foreign broker that does not have certain specified connections to the United States. However, if you sell your shares of common stock or warrants through a United States broker or the United States office of a foreign broker, the broker will be required to report to the IRS the amount of proceeds paid to you unless you provide appropriate certification (usually on an IRS Form W-8BEN or Form W-8BEN-E) to the broker of your status as a non-United States person or you are an exempt recipient. Information reporting also would apply if you sell your shares of common stock or warrants through a foreign broker deriving more than a specified percentage of its income from United States sources or having certain other connections to the United States.\n\nBackup withholding is not an additional tax. Any amounts withheld with respect to your shares of common stock or warrants under the backup withholding rules will be refunded to you or credited against your United States federal income tax liability, if any, by the IRS provided that certain required information is furnished to the IRS in a timely manner.\n\n96  \n---  \n  \n**_Estate Tax_**\n\nCommon stock owned or treated as owned by an individual who is not a citizen or resident (as defined for United States federal estate tax purposes) of the United States at the time of his or her death, or by an entity the property of which is potentially includible in such an individual’s gross estate, will be included in the individual’s gross estate for United States federal estate tax purposes and therefore may be subject to United States federal estate tax unless an applicable estate tax treaty provides otherwise. The foregoing may also apply to warrants.\n\n**_Unearned Income Medicare Tax_**\n\nIf you are a foreign estate or trust, you may be subject to the Medicare contribution tax described under “U.S. Holders — Unearned Income Medicare Tax” above. Non-U.S. holders should consult their tax advisors regarding the possible implications of the Medicare contribution tax on their investments in the units.\n\n**FATCA**\n\nA 30% withholding tax will be imposed on payments to certain foreign entities of U.S.-source dividends, unless various U.S. information reporting and due diligence requirements (generally relating to ownership by U.S. persons of interests in or accounts with those entities) have been satisfied or an exemption has otherwise been established. Such withholding was scheduled to apply to payments of gross proceeds from the sale or other disposition of property that produces U.S.-source interest or dividends beginning on January 1, 2019, but the IRS released proposed regulations that, if finalized in their proposed form, would eliminate the obligation to withhold on gross proceeds. Such proposed regulations also delayed withholding on certain other payments received from other foreign financial institutions that are allocable, as provided for under final Treasury Regulations, to payments of U.S.-source dividends, and other fixed or determinable annual or periodic income. Although these proposed Treasury Regulations are not final, taxpayers generally may rely on them until final Treasury Regulations are issued. Potential investors should consult their tax advisors regarding the possible implications of this withholding tax on their investment in our securities.\n\n97  \n---  \n  \n**UNDERWRITING**\n\nWe are offering the units described in this prospectus through the underwriters named below. EF Hutton, division of Benchmark Investments, LLC, is acting as representative of the underwriters. We have entered into an underwriting agreement with the representative. Subject to the terms and conditions of the underwriting agreement, the underwriters have agreed to purchase, and we have agreed to sell to the underwriters, the number of units listed next to each of its name in the following table:\n\n**Underwriter** | **Number of Units**  \n---|---  \nEF Hutton, division of Benchmark Investments, LLC  \nTotal | 6,000,000  \n  \nThe underwriting agreement provides that the underwriters must buy all of the units if they buy any of them. However, the underwriters are not required to purchase the units covered by the option to purchase additional units as described below.\n\nOur units are offered subject to a number of conditions, including:\n\n• | receipt and acceptance of our units by the underwriters; and  \n---|---  \n• | the underwriters’ right to reject orders in whole or in part.  \n  \nIn connection with this offering, the underwriters or securities dealers may distribute prospectuses electronically.\n\n**Option To Purchase Additional Units**\n\nWe have granted the underwriters an over-allotment option to buy up to an aggregate of 900,000 additional units. The underwriters have 45 days from the date of this prospectus to exercise this option. If the underwriters exercise this option, they will purchase additional units approximately in proportion to the amounts specified in the table above.\n\n**Underwriting Discount**\n\nUnits sold by the underwriters to the public will initially be offered at the initial offering price set forth on the cover of this prospectus. Any units sold by the underwriters to securities dealers may be sold at a discount of up to $ per unit from the initial public offering price and the dealers may reallow a concession not in excess of $  per unit to other dealers. Sales of units made outside of the United States may be made by affiliates of the underwriters. After completion of this offering, if the underwriters still hold any units sold by us to them in this offering, the representative may change the offering price and the other selling terms. Upon execution of the underwriting agreement, the underwriters will be obligated to purchase the units at the prices and upon the terms stated therein.\n\nThe following table shows the per unit and total underwriting discount we will pay to the underwriters assuming both no exercise and full exercise of the underwriters’ over-allotment option to purchase up to 900,000 additional units.\n\n**No Exercise** | **Full Exercise**  \n---|---  \nPer Unit(1) | $ | 0.45 | $ | 0.45  \nTotal | $ | 2,700,000 | $ | 3,105,000  \n(1) | Includes $0.45 per unit, or $2,700,000 (or $3,105,000 if the over-allotment option is exercised in full) in the aggregate payable to EF Hutton, $0.085 per unit (i.e., $510,000, or $586,500 if the over-allotment option is exercised in full) of which is payable upon consummation of this offering and $0.365 per unit (i.e., $2,190,000, or $2,518,500 if the over-allotment option is exercised in full) of which is for deferred underwriting commissions which will be placed in a trust account located in the United States as described herein. The deferred commissions will be released to EF Hutton only upon completion of an initial business combination, as described in this prospectus. The underwriters will receive compensation in addition to the underwriting discount, including 35,000 shares of common stock to be issued upon consummation of this offering, which we refer to herein as the “Representative Shares.”   \n---|---  \n  \n98  \n---  \n  \nIf we do not complete our initial business combination within 12 months (or up to 18 months, if we extend the time to complete a business combination as described in this prospectus) from the closing of this offering, EF Hutton has agreed that (i) it will forfeit any rights or claims to the deferred underwriting discounts and commissions, including any accrued interest thereon, then in the trust account and (ii) that the deferred underwriters’ discounts and commissions will be distributed on a pro rata basis, together with any accrued interest thereon (which interest will be net of taxes payable) to the public stockholders.\n\nIn addition to the underwriting discount, we will pay EF Hutton a cash fee equal of one half of one percent (0.5%) of the total consideration payable in any proposed business combination if EF Hutton introduces us to the target business with which we complete such business combination.\n\nWe have also agreed to pay all expenses relating to the offering, including actual accountable expenses of the representative not to exceed $70,000, which amount includes expenses for the representative’s legal counsel and road show expenses, with the exception of the NASDAQ listing fees, the cost of which EF Hutton has agreed to reimburse the Company for.\n\nWe estimate that the total expenses of the offering payable by us, not including the underwriting discount, will be approximately $[1,251,000].\n\n**Representative Shares**\n\nWe have agreed to issue to EF Hutton and/or its designees 35,000 Representative Shares upon the consummation of this offering. The holders of the Representative Shares have agreed not to transfer, assign or sell any such shares without our prior consent until the completion of our initial business combination. In addition, the holders of the Representative Shares have agreed (i) to waive their conversion rights (or right to participate in any tender offer) with respect to such shares in connection with the completion of our initial business combination and (ii) to waive their rights to liquidating distributions from the trust account with respect to such shares if we fail to complete our initial business combination within 12 months (or up to 18 months, if we extend the time to complete a business combination as described in this prospectus) from the closing of this offering.\n\nThe Representative Shares have been deemed compensation by FINRA and are therefore subject to a lock-up for a period of 180 days immediately following the date of the effectiveness of the registration statement of which this prospectus forms a part pursuant to Rule 5110(e)(1) of the FINRA Manual. Pursuant to FINRA Rule 5110(e)(1), these securities will not be sold during the offering, or sold, transferred, assigned, pledged, or hypothecated, or be the subject of any hedging, short sale, derivative, put or call transaction that would result in the economic disposition of the securities by any person for a period of 180 days immediately following the effective date of the registration statement of which this prospectus forms a part or commencement of sales of the public offering, except to any underwriter and selected dealer participating in the offering and their bona fide officers or partners, provided that all securities so transferred remain subject to the lockup restriction above for the remainder of the time period.\n\nThe representative shares have resale registration rights including one demand and unlimited “piggy-back” rights for periods of five and seven years, respectively, from the commencement of sales of this offering. In compliance with FINRA Rule 5110(g)(8), registration rights granted to EF Hutton and/or its designees are limited to demand and “piggy back” rights for periods of five and seven years, respectively, from the effective date of the registration statement of which this prospectus forms a part and such demand rights may be exercised on only one occasion. \n\n99  \n---  \n  \n**Rights of First Refusal**\n\nIf, from the consummation of an initial business combination to twelve months thereafter (but in no event later than three years from the effective date of the registration statement of which prospectus forms part), we determine to pursue any public or private equity offering, including any equity-linked financing (such as a forward purchase arrangement or similar type of equity line financing), then EF Hutton shall have the right, but not the obligation, to act as lead underwriter, placement agent, book running manager or arranger, as the case may be, in connection with that financing.\n\n**Indemnification**\n\nWe have agreed to indemnify the underwriter against certain liabilities, including certain liabilities under the Securities Act. If we are unable to provide this indemnification, we have agreed to contribute to payments the underwriter may be required to make in respect of those liabilities.\n\n**NASDAQ****Listing**\n\nWe have applied to have our units listed on NASDAQ under the symbol “IROHU” and, once the common stock, warrants and rights begin separate trading, under the symbols “IROH,” “IROHW” and “IROHR,” respectively.\n\n**Price Stabilization, Short Positions**\n\nIn connection with this offering, the underwriters may engage in activities that stabilize, maintain or otherwise affect the price of units during and after this offering, including:\n\n• | stabilizing transactions;  \n---|---  \n• | short sales;  \n• | purchases to cover positions created by short sales;  \n• | imposition of penalty bids; and  \n• | syndicate covering transactions.  \n  \nStabilizing transactions consist of bids or purchases made for the purpose of preventing or retarding a decline in the market price of our units while this offering is in progress. Stabilization transactions permit bids to purchase the underlying security so long as the stabilizing bids do not exceed a specified maximum. These transactions may also include making short sales of our units, which involve the sale by the underwriters of a greater number of units than they are required to purchase in this offering and purchasing units on the open market to cover short positions created by short sales. Short sales may be “covered short sales,” which are short positions in an amount not greater than the underwriters’ option to purchase additional units referred to above, or may be “naked short sales,” which are short positions in excess of that amount.\n\nThe underwriters may close out any covered short position by either exercising their option, in whole or in part, or by purchasing units in the open market. In making this determination, the underwriters will consider, among other things, the price of units available for purchase in the open market as compared to the price at which they may purchase units through the over-allotment option.\n\n100  \n---  \n  \nNaked short sales are short sales made in excess of the over-allotment option. The underwriters must close out any naked short position by purchasing units in the open market. A naked short position is more likely to be created if the underwriters are concerned that there may be downward pressure on the price of the units in the open market that could adversely affect investors who purchased in this offering.\n\nThe underwriters also may impose a penalty bid. This occurs when a particular underwriter repays to the representative of the underwriters a portion of the underwriting discount received by it because the representative has repurchased units sold by or for the account of that underwriter in stabilizing or short covering transactions.\n\nThese stabilizing transactions, short sales, purchases to cover positions created by short sales, the imposition of penalty bids and syndicate covering transactions may have the effect of raising or maintaining the market price of our units or preventing or retarding a decline in the market price of our units. As a result of these activities, the price of our units may be higher than the price that otherwise might exist in the open market. The underwriters may carry out these transactions on NASDAQ, in the over-the-counter market or otherwise. Neither we nor the underwriters make any representation or prediction as to the effect that the transactions described above may have on the price of the units. Neither we, nor the underwriters, make any representation that the underwriter will engage in these stabilization transactions or that any transaction, once commenced, will not be discontinued without notice.\n\n**Determination of Offering Price**\n\nPrior to this offering, there was no public market for our units. The initial public offering price will be determined by negotiation between us and the representative of the underwriters. The principal factors to be considered in determining the initial public offering price include:\n\n• | the information set forth in this prospectus and otherwise available to the representative;  \n---|---  \n• | our history and prospects and the history and prospects for the industry in which we compete;  \n• | our past and present financial performance;  \n• | our prospects for future earnings and the present state of our development;  \n• | the general condition of the securities market at the time of this offering;  \n• | the recent market prices of, and demand for, publicly traded units of generally comparable companies; and  \n• | other factors deemed relevant by the underwriters and us.  \n  \nNeither we nor the underwriters can assure investors that an active trading market will develop for our units, warrants or common stock or that the units will trade in the public market at or above the initial public offering price.\n\n**Affiliations**\n\nEF Hutton and its affiliates are full service financial institutions engaged in various activities, which may include securities trading, commercial and investment banking, financial advisory, investment management, investment research, principal investment, hedging, financing and brokerage activities. EF Hutton and its affiliates may from time to time in the future engage with us and perform services for us or in the ordinary course of their business for which they will receive customary fees and expenses. In the ordinary course of their various business activities, the underwriters and their respective affiliates may also make or hold a broad array of investments and actively trade debt and equity securities (or related derivative securities) and financial instruments (including bank loans) for their own account and for the accounts of their customers, and such investment and securities activities may involve securities and/or instruments of us. The underwriters and their affiliates may also make investment recommendations and/or publish or express independent research views in respect of these securities or instruments and may at any time hold, or recommend to clients that they acquire, long and/or short positions in these securities and instruments.\n\n101  \n---  \n  \n**Additional Future Arrangements**\n\nExcept as set forth above, we are not under any contractual obligation to engage any of the underwriters to provide any services for us after this offering and have no present intent to do so. However, the underwriters may introduce us to potential target businesses or assist us in raising additional capital in the future. If any of the underwriters provide services to us after this offering, we may pay such underwriter fair and reasonable fees that would be determined at that time in an arm’s length negotiation; provided that no agreement will be entered into with any underwriter and no fees for such services will be paid to any underwriter prior to the date that is 60 days from the date of this prospectus, unless FINRA determines that such payment would not be deemed underwriter’s compensation in connection with this offering.\n\n**Electronic Distribution**\n\nA prospectus in electronic format may be made available on the Internet sites or through other online services maintained by the underwriters participating in this offering, or by their affiliates. In those cases, prospective investors may view offering terms online and, depending upon the particular underwriter, prospective investors may be allowed to place orders online. The underwriters may agree with us to allocate a specific number of units for sale to online brokerage account holders. Any such allocation for online distributions will be made by the underwriters on the same basis as other allocations. Other than the prospectus in electronic format, the information on any underwriter’s website and any information contained in any other website maintained by an underwriter is not part of the prospectus or the registration statement of which this prospectus forms a part, has not been approved and/or endorsed by us or any underwriter in its capacity as underwriter and should not be relied upon by investors.\n\n**Selling Restrictions**\n\n_Canada_\n\n**_Resale Restrictions_**\n\nWe intend to distribute our securities in the Province of Ontario, Canada (the “Canadian Offering Jurisdiction”) by way of a private placement and exempt from the requirement that we prepare and file a prospectus with the securities regulatory authorities in such Canadian Offering Jurisdiction. Any resale of our securities in Canada must be made under applicable securities laws that will vary depending on the relevant jurisdiction, and which may require resales to be made under available statutory exemptions or under a discretionary exemption granted by the applicable Canadian securities regulatory authority. Canadian resale restrictions in some circumstances may apply to resales of interests made outside of Canada. Canadian purchasers are advised to seek legal advice prior to any resale of our securities. We may never be a “reporting issuer”, as such term is defined under applicable Canadian securities legislation, in any province or territory of Canada in which our securities will be offered and there currently is no public market for any of the securities in Canada, and one may never develop. Canadian investors are advised that we have no intention to file a prospectus or similar document with any securities regulatory authority in Canada qualifying the resale of the securities to the public in any province or territory in Canada.\n\n**_Representations of Purchasers_**\n\nA Canadian purchaser will be required to represent to us and the dealer from whom the purchase confirmation is received that:\n\n• | the purchaser is entitled under applicable provincial securities laws to purchase our securities without the benefit of a prospectus qualified under those securities laws;  \n---|---  \n• | where required by law, that the purchaser is purchasing as principal and not as agent;  \n• | the purchaser has reviewed the text above under Resale Restrictions; and  \n• | the purchaser acknowledges and consents to the provision of specified information concerning its purchase of our securities to the regulatory authority that by law is entitled to collect the information.  \n  \n102  \n---  \n  \n**_Rights of Action — Ontario Purchasers Only_**\n\nUnder Ontario securities legislation, certain purchasers who purchase a security offered by this prospectus during the period of distribution will have a statutory right of action for damages, or while still the owner of our securities, for rescission against us in the event that this prospectus contains a misrepresentation without regard to whether the purchaser relied on the misrepresentation. The right of action for damages is exercisable not later than the earlier of 180 days from the date the purchaser first had knowledge of the facts giving rise to the cause of action and three years from the date on which payment is made for our securities. The right of action for rescission is exercisable not later than 180 days from the date on which payment is made for our securities. If a purchaser elects to exercise the right of action for rescission, the purchaser will have no right of action for damages against us. In no case will the amount recoverable in any action exceed the price at which our securities were offered to the purchaser and if the purchaser is shown to have purchased the securities with knowledge of the misrepresentation, we will have no liability. In the case of an action for damages, we will not be liable for all or any portion of the damages that are proven to not represent the depreciation in value of our securities as a result of the misrepresentation relied upon. These rights are in addition to, and without derogation from, any other rights or remedies available at law to an Ontario purchaser.

(the “Company”) as of December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, and the related statements of operations, stockholders’ equity (deficit), and cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2022 and for the period from November 23, 2021 (inception) through December 31, 2021, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the “financial statements”). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2022 and for the period from November 23, 2021 (inception) through December 31, 2021, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\n\n**_Going Concern Matter_**\n\nThe accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As more fully described in Note 1 to the financial statements, the Company’s business plan is dependent on the completion of a business combination within a prescribed period of time and if not completed will cease all operations except for the purpose of liquidating. Additionally, the Company has a net capital deficiency. These conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. Management’s plans in regard to these matters are also described in Note 1. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.\n\n**_Correction of Misstatements_**\n\nAs discussed in Note 2 to the financial statements, the 2021 financial statements have been restated to correct certain misstatements.\n\n**_Basis for Opinion_**\n\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (“PCAOB”) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\n\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.\n\nOur audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\n\n_/s/ MaloneBailey, LLP_\n\nwww.malonebailey.com\n\nWe have served as the Company’s auditor since 2023\n\nHouston, Texas\n\nDecember 5, 2023\n\nF-2  \n---  \n  \n**IRON HORSE ACQUISITIONS CORP.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS**\n\n**Note 1 — Organization and Plan of Business Operations**\n\nIron Horse Acquisitions Corp. (the “Company”) was incorporated in Delaware on November 23, 2021 as a blank check company whose objective is to acquire, through a merger, share exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, recapitalization, reorganization or other similar business combination, one or more businesses or entities (a “Business Combination”).\n\nAt September 30, 2023, the Company had not yet commenced any operations. All activity from September 30, 2021 (inception) through September 30, 2023 relates to the Company’s formation and the proposed public offering described below. The Company has selected December 31 as its fiscal year-end.\n\nThe Company’s ability to commence operations is contingent upon obtaining adequate financial resources through a proposed public offering of up to 6,000,000 units at $10.00 per unit (or 6,900,000 units if the underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised in full) (“Units”), which is discussed in Note 3 (“Proposed Public Offering”). Simultaneously with the consummation of the Proposed Public Offering, Bengochea SPAC Sponsors I LLC (the “Sponsor”) will commit that it and/or its designees will purchase 2,457,000 warrants in a private placement at a price of $1.00 per warrant for an aggregate purchase price of $2,457,000 (or 2,533,500 private warrants for an aggregate purchase price of $2,533,500 if the underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised in full)) (“Private Warrants”). All of the proceeds the Company receives from the sale of Private Warrants will be used to fund operating expenses prior to a potential merger transaction and will not be place in the trust account described below. The Company’s management has broad discretion with respect to the specific application of the net proceeds of the sale of Private Warrants, although substantially all of the net proceeds are intended to be applied generally toward consummating a Business Combination. The Company intends to apply to have the Units listed on the Nasdaq Global Market (“NASDAQ”). Pursuant to the NASDAQ listing rules, the Company’s initial Business Combination must be with a target business or businesses whose collective fair market value is at least equal to 80% of the balance in the trust account at the time of the execution of a definitive agreement for such Business Combination (net of taxes payable and deferred underwriting commissions), although this may entail simultaneous acquisitions of several target businesses. There is no assurance that the Company will be able to effect a Business Combination successfully.\n\nUpon the closing of the Proposed Public Offering, management has agreed that certain of the proceeds from the Units sold in the Proposed Public Offering, will be held in a United States-based trust account (“Trust Account”) and held as cash items or invested in United States government treasury bills, bonds or notes, having a maturity of 185 days or less or in money market funds meeting certain conditions under Rule 2a-7 promulgated under the Investment Company Act until the earlier of (i) the consummation of the Company’s initial Business Combination (ii) the redemption of any shares of common stock included in the Units being sold in the Proposed Public Offering that have been properly tendered in connection with a stockholder vote to amend the Company’s certificate of incorporation to modify the substance or timing of its obligation to redeem 100% of such shares of common stock if it does not complete the Initial Business Combination within 12 months from the closing of the Proposed Public Offering (or 18 months from the closing of the Proposed Public Offering if the Company has executed a definitive agreement for a Business Combination within such 12-month period), provided that, pursuant to the terms of the amended and restated certificate of incorporation and the trust agreement to be entered into between the Company and the Trust Account, the only way to extend the time available for the Company to consummate its initial business combination in the absence of a charter amendment, is for the Sponsor, upon at least five days’ advance notice prior to the applicable deadline, to deposit into the trust account $199,800, or $229,700 if the underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised in full ($0.0333 per unit in either case), or an aggregate of $399,600, or $459,540 if the over-allotment option is exercised in full, for each three-month extension, on or prior to the date of the applicable deadline; and (iii) the Company’s failure to consummate a Business Combination within the prescribed time. If the Company is unable to consummate an initial business combination within such time period, the Company will redeem 100% of its outstanding public shares for a pro rata portion of the funds held in the trust account, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account including interest earned on the funds held in the trust account and not previously released to the Company for taxes (and less up to $100,000 of interest which can be used for liquidation expenses), divided by the number of then outstanding public shares, subject to applicable law and as further described herein, and then seek to dissolve and liquidate. Placing funds in the Trust Account may not protect those funds from third party claims against the Company. Although the Company will seek to have all vendors, service providers, prospective target businesses or other entities it engages, execute agreements with the Company waiving any claim of any kind in or to any monies held in the Trust Account, there is no guarantee that such persons will execute such agreements. The remaining net proceeds (not held in the Trust Account) may be used to pay for business, legal and accounting due diligence on prospective acquisitions and continuing general and administrative expenses. Additionally, certain interest earned on the Trust Account balance may be released to the Company to pay the Company’s tax obligations.\n\nThe Company, after signing a definitive agreement for the acquisition of a target business, is required to provide stockholders who acquired shares of common stock sold as part of the units in this offering (“Public Shares”) in the Proposed Public Offering (“Public Stockholders”) with the opportunity to convert their Public Shares for a pro rata share of the Trust Account. The holders of the Founder Shares will agree to vote any shares they then hold in favor of any proposed Business Combination and will waive any conversion rights with respect to these shares pursuant to letter agreements to be executed prior to the Proposed Public Offering.\n\nF-7  \n---  \n  \nIn connection with any proposed Business Combination, the Company will seek stockholder approval of an initial Business Combination at a meeting called for such purpose at which Public Stockholders may seek to convert their Public Shares, regardless of whether they vote for or against the proposed Business Combination. Alternatively, the Company may conduct a tender offer and allow conversions in connection therewith. If the Company seeks stockholder approval of an initial Business Combination, any Public Stockholder voting either for or against such proposed Business Combination or not voting at all will be entitled to demand that his Public Shares be converted into a full pro rata portion of the amount then in the Trust Account (initially $10.00 per share, plus any pro rata interest earned on the funds held in the Trust Account and not previously released to the Company or necessary to pay its taxes). Holders of warrants sold as part of the Units will not be entitled to vote on the Proposed Business Combination and will have no conversion or liquidation rights with respect to the shares of common stock underlying such warrants.\n\nIf the Company is unable to complete its initial Business Combination and expends all of the net proceeds from the sale of the Private Warrants not deposited in the Trust Account, without taking into account any interest earned on the Trust Account, the Company expects that the initial per-share redemption price for common stock will be $10.00. The proceeds deposited in the Trust Account could, however, become subject to claims of the Company’s creditors that are in preference to the claims of the Company’s stockholders. In addition, if the Company is forced to file a bankruptcy case or an involuntary bankruptcy case is filed against it that is not dismissed, the proceeds held in the Trust Account could be subject to applicable bankruptcy law, and may be included in its bankruptcy estate and subject to the claims of third parties with priority over the claims of the Company’s common stockholders. Therefore, the actual per-share redemption price may be less than approximately $10.00.\n\n**_Going Concern Consideration_**\n\nAs of September 30, 2023, the Company had no cash and a working capital deficit of $1,419,166 (excluding deferred offering costs). As of December 31, 2022, the Company had no cash and a working capital deficit of $847,041 (excluding deferred offering costs). The Company has incurred and expects to continue to incur significant costs in pursuit of its financing and acquisition plans. These conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. Management plans to address this uncertainty through a Proposed Public Offering as discussed in Note 3. There is no assurance that the Company’s plans to raise capital or to consummate a Business Combination will be successful within the Combination Period. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.\n\n**_Risks and Uncertainties_**\n\nManagement continues to evaluate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the industry and has concluded that while it is reasonably possible that the virus could have a negative effect on the Company’s financial position, results of its operations, close of the Proposed Public Offering and/or search for a target company, the specific impact is not readily determinable as of the date of these financial statements. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.\n\nIn February 2022, the Russian Federation and Belarus commenced a military action with the country of Ukraine. As a result of this action, various nations, including the United States, have instituted economic sanctions against the Russian Federation and Belarus. Further the impact of this actions and related sanctions on the world economy are not determinable as of the date of these financial statements and the specific impact on the Company’s financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows is also not determinable as of the date of these financial statements.\n\nF-8  \n---  \n  \n**Note 2 — Restatement of Previously Issued Financial Statements**\n\nIn the Company’s previously issued financial statements, the Company reported offering costs related to the Company and the ongoing process of completing the registration statement and the proposed public offering. However, upon closer examination of these costs, it was determined that various costs did not belong to the Company and as such needed to be removed.\n\nIn accordance with SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 99, “Materiality,” and SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 108, “Considering the Effects of Prior Year Misstatements when Quantifying Misstatements in Current Year Financial Statements;” the Company evaluated the changes and has determined that the related impacts were quantitively material to previously presented financial statements. Therefore, the Company concluded that its previously issued financial statements impacted should be restated to reflect the correct offering costs.\n\nAs a result, the Company restated its previously filed financial statements to correctly present the offering costs as of December 31, 2021 and for the period from November 23, 2021 (inception) through December 31, 2021. The Company is reporting the restatement of those periods in this report.\n\n**Impact of the Restatement**\n\nThe impact of the error of the booking of these offering costs, resulted in adjusted numbers on the Balance Sheet, Statement of Operations, Statement of Change in Stockholders Equity and the Statement of Cash Flows.\n\nAs Reported | Adjustment | As Restated  \n---|---|---  \nBalance Sheet as of December 31, 2021  \nDeferred offering costs | $| 266,315 | $| (68,288| ) | $| 198,027  \nTotal assets | 267,402 | (69,375| ) | 198,027  \nNotes payable to Stockholder | 106,103 | (56,911| ) | 49,192  \nTotal liabilities | 249,309 | (56,911| ) | 192,398  \nAccumulated deficit | (7,994| ) | (11,377| ) | (19,371| )  \nTotal stockholders equity | 18,093 | (12,464| ) | 5,629  \nAs Reported | Adjustment | As Restated  \n---|---|---  \nStatement of Operations for the period from November 23, 2021 (inception) to December 31, 2021  \nFormation and operational costs | $| 7,994 | $| 11,377 | $| 19,371  \nNet income (loss) | (7,994| ) | (11,377| ) | (19,371| )  \nAs Reported | Adjustment | As Restated  \n---|---|---  \nStatement of Changes in Stockholders Equity (Deficit) for the period from November 23, 2021 (inception) to December 31, 2021  \nAccumulated Deficit | $| (7,994| ) | $| (11,377| ) | $| (19,371| )  \nStockholders’ Equity (Deficit) | 18,093 | (12,464| ) | 5,629  \nAs Reported | Adjustment | As Restated  \n---|---|---  \nStatement of Cash Flows for the period from November 23, 2021 (inception) to December 31, 2021  \nNet loss | $| (7,994| ) | $| (11,377| ) | $| (19,371| )  \nPayment of operating expense made by Sponsor | — | 16,761 | 16,761  \nNet cash used in operating activities | (5,384| ) | 5,384 | —  \n  \n**Note 3 — Significant Accounting Policies Basis of Presentation**\n\nThe accompanying financial statements are presented in U.S. dollars in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”) and pursuant to the rules and regulations of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”).\n\nIn the opinion of the Company’s management, the unaudited interim financial statements as of September 30, 2023, and for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022, include all adjustments, necessary for a fair statement of the Company’s financial position as of September 30, 2023 and 2022 and its results of operations and cash flows for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022. The results of the operations for the interim periods are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the full fiscal year.\n\n**_Emerging Growth Company_**\n\nThe Company is an “emerging growth company,” as defined in Section 2(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, (the “Securities Act”), as modified by the Jumpstart our Business Startups Act of 2012, (the “JOBS Act”), and it may take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in its periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved.\n\nFurther, section 102(b)(1) of the JOBS Act exempts emerging growth companies from being required to comply with new or revised financial accounting standards until private companies (that is, those that have not had a Securities Act registration statement declared effective or do not have a class of securities registered under the Exchange Act) are required to comply with the new or revised financial accounting standards. The JOBS Act provides that a company can elect to opt out of the extended transition period and comply with the requirements that apply to non-emerging growth companies but any such election to opt out is irrevocable. The Company has elected not to opt out of such extended transition period which means that when a standard is issued or revised and it has different application dates for public or private companies, the Company, as an emerging growth company, can adopt the new or revised standard at the time private companies adopt the new or revised standard. This may make comparison of the Company’s financial statements with another public company which is neither an emerging growth company nor an emerging growth company which has opted out of using the extended transition period difficult or impossible because of the potential differences in accountant standards used.\n\n**_Use of Estimates_**\n\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Making estimates requires management to exercise significant judgment. It is at least reasonably possible that the estimate of the effect of a condition, situation or set of circumstances that existed at the date of the financial statements, which management considered in formulating its estimate, could change in the near-term due to one or more future confirming events. Accordingly, the actual results could differ from those estimates.\n\n**_Cash and Cash Equivalents_**\n\nThe Company considers all short-term investments with an original maturity of three months or less when purchased to be cash equivalents. As of September 30, 2023, December 31, 2022 and 2021, there were no cash or cash equivalents.\n\n**_Fair Value of Financial Instruments_**\n\nThe fair value of the Company’s assets and liabilities, which qualify as financial instruments under ASC Topic 820, “Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures,” approximates the carrying amounts represented in the accompanying balance sheet, primarily due to their short-term nature.\n\n**_Income Taxes_**\n\nThe Company accounts for income taxes under ASC 740 Income Taxes (“ASC 740”). ASC 740 requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for both the expected impact of differences between the financial statements and tax basis of assets and liabilities and for the expected future tax benefit to be derived from tax loss and tax credit carry forwards. ASC 740 additionally requires a valuation allowance to be established when it is more likely than not that all or a portion of deferred tax assets will not be realized. Deferred tax assets were deemed to be de minimus at September 30, 2023, December 31, 2022 and 2021.\n\nF-9  \n---  \n  \nASC 740 also clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise’s financial statements and prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement process for financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. For those benefits to be recognized, a tax position must be more-likely-than-not to be sustained upon examination by taxing authorities. ASC 740 also provides guidance on derecognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure and transition. The Company is required to file income tax returns in the United States (federal) and in various state and local jurisdictions. Based on the Company’s evaluation, it has been concluded that there are no significant uncertain tax positions requiring recognition in the Company’s financial statements. Since the Company was incorporated on November 23, 2021, the 2022 and 2021 tax years are subject to examination. The Company believes that its income tax positions and deductions would be sustained on audit and does not anticipate any adjustments that would result in a material change to its financial position.\n\nThe Company’s policy for recording interest and penalties associated with audits is to record such expense as a component of income tax expense. There were no amounts accrued for penalties or interest as of September 30, 2023, December 31, 2022 or 2021. Management is currently unaware of any issues under review that could result in significant payments, accruals or material deviations from its position.\n\nThe provision for income taxes was deemed to be de minimis for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022, for the year ended December 31, 2022, and for the period from November 23, 2021 (inception) through December 31, 2021.\n\n**_Net Loss per Common stock_**\n\nNet loss per share is computed by dividing net loss by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period, excluding shares of common stock subject to forfeiture. Weighted average shares were reduced for the effect of an aggregate of 252,000 shares of common stock that are subject to forfeiture if the over-allotment option is not exercised by the underwriters (see Note 7). At September 30, 2023, December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company did not have any dilutive securities and other contracts that could, potentially, be exercised or converted into common stock and then share in the earnings of the Company. As a result, diluted loss per share is the same as basic loss per share for the period presented.\n\n**_Deferred Offering Costs_**\n\nThe Company complies with the requirements of the ASC 340-10-S99 and SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin (“SAB”) Topic 5A – “Expenses of Offering”. Deferred offering costs consist of underwriting, legal, accounting and other expenses incurred through the balance sheet date that are directly related to the Proposed Public Offering and that will be charged to stockholders’ equity upon the completion of the Proposed Public Offering. Should the Proposed Public Offering prove to be unsuccessful, these deferred costs, as well as additional expenses to be incurred, will be charged to operations.\n\n**_Redeemable Share Classification_**\n\nThe Company’s common stock that will be sold as part of the Units in the Proposed Public Offering (“public common stock”) contain a redemption feature which allows for the redemption of such public shares in connection with the Company’s liquidation, or if there is a stockholder vote or tender offer in connection with the Company’s initial business combination. In accordance with ASC 480-10-S99, the Company classifies public common stock subject to redemption outside of permanent equity as the redemption provisions are not solely within the control of the Company. The public common stock sold as part of the Units in the Proposed Public Offering will be issued with other freestanding instruments (i.e., Public Warrants) and as such, the initial carrying value of public common stock classified as temporary equity will be the allocated proceeds determined in accordance with ASC 470-20. The public common stock are subject to ASC 480-10-S99 and are currently not redeemable as the redemption is contingent upon the occurrence of events mentioned above. According to ASC 480-10-S99-15, no subsequent adjustment is needed if it is not probable that the instrument will become redeemable.\n\nF-10  \n---  \n  \n**_Derivative Financial Instruments_**\n\nThe Company evaluates its financial instruments to determine if such instruments are derivatives or contain features that qualify as embedded derivatives in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 815, “Derivatives and Hedging”. Derivative instruments are initially recorded at fair value on the grant date and re-valued at each reporting date, with changes in the fair value reported in the statement of operations. The classification of derivative instruments, including whether such instruments should be recorded as liabilities or as equity, is evaluated at the end of each reporting period. Derivative assets and liabilities are classified in the balance sheet as current or non-current based on whether or not net-cash settlement or conversion of the instruments could be required within 12 months of the balance sheet date.\n\nThe over-allotment option is deemed to be a freestanding financial instrument indexed on the contingently redeemable shares and will be accounted for as a liability pursuant to ASC 480.\n\n**_Warrant Instruments_**\n\nThe Company will account for the Public Warrants and Private Warrants to be issued in connection with the Proposed Public Offering and the private placement in accordance with the guidance contained in FASB ASC Topic 815 “Derivatives and Hedging”, whereby under that provision, the warrants that do not meet the criteria for equity treatment must be recorded as liability. Accordingly, the Company evaluated and will classify the warrant instrument under equity treatment at its assigned value. There are no Public or Private Warrants currently outstanding as of September 30, 2023, December 31, 2022, and December 31, 2021.\n\n**_Recent Accounting Pronouncements_**\n\nIn August 2020, the FASB issued ASU No. 2020-06, Accounting for Convertible Instruments and Contracts in an Entity’s Own Equity. The update simplifies the accounting for convertible instruments by removing certain separation models in Subtopic 470-20, Debt—Debt with Conversion and Other Options for convertible instruments and introducing other changes. As a result of ASU No. 2020-06, more convertible debt instruments will be accounted for as a single liability measured at its amortized cost and more convertible preferred stock will be accounted for as a single equity instrument measured at its historical cost, as long as no features require bifurcation and recognition as derivatives. The amendments are effective for smaller reporting companies for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted, but no earlier than fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2020, including interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company adopted ASU No. 2020-06 as of January 1, 2022. The impact to our balance sheet, statement of operations and cash flows was not material.\n\nManagement does not believe that any recently issued, but not yet effective, accounting standards if currently adopted would have a material effect on the accompanying financial statements.\n\n**Note 4 — Proposed Public Offering**\n\nThe Proposed Public Offering calls for the Company to offer for public sale up to 6,000,000 Units at a proposed offering price of $10.00 per Unit. In addition, the Company has granted the underwriters a 45-day option to purchase up to an additional 900,000 Units at a price of $10.00 per Unit, solely to cover over-allotments, if any. Each Unit consists of one share of the Company’s common stock, $0.0001 par value, one redeemable warrant (the “Warrants”), and one right to one-fifth (1/5) of one share of common stock upon the consummation of the Company’s initial business combination, so you must hold rights in multiples of 5 in order to receive shares for all of your rights upon closing of a combination. Each Warrant offered in the Proposed Public Offering is exercisable to purchase one share of the Company’s common stock at an exercise price of $11.50.\n\nEach Warrant will become exercisable 30 days after the completion of the Company’s initial Business Combination and will expire five years after the completion of the Company’s initial Business Combination or earlier upon redemption or liquidation. However, if the Company does not complete its initial Business Combination on or prior to the 12-month period allotted (or up to 18 months if the Company extends the time to complete a business combination as described in this prospectus) to complete the Business Combination, the Warrants will expire at the end of such period. If the Company is unable to deliver registered shares of common stock to the holder upon exercise of the Warrants during the exercise period, there will be no net cash settlement of these Warrants and the Warrants will expire worthless, unless they may be exercised on a cashless basis in the circumstances described in the warrant agreement. Once the warrants become exercisable, the Company may redeem the outstanding warrants in whole and not in part at a price of $0.01 per warrant upon a minimum of 30 days’ prior written notice of redemption, only in the event that the last sale price of the Company’s shares of common stock equals or exceeds $18.00 per share for any 20 trading days within the 30-trading day period commencing at any time after the shares underlying the warrants have become exercisable and ending on the third trading day before the Company sends the notice of redemption to the warrant holders.\n\n**Note 5 — Private Placement Warrants**\n\nThe Sponsor will commit to purchase 2,457,000 Private Warrants (or 2,533,500 Private Warrants if the underwriter’s over-allotment option is exercised in full) at $1.00 per warrant, for an aggregate purchase price of $2,457,000 (or $2,533,500 if the underwriter’s over- allotment option is exercised in full) from the Company. These purchases will take place simultaneously with the consummation of the Proposed Public Offering. All of the proceeds received from the sale of the Private Warrants will be used to fund operating costs of the Company in advance of a Business Combination and will not be placed in the Trust Account. The Private Warrants will be identical to the warrants sold as a part of the Units being offered in the Proposed Public Offering. The holders have agreed not to transfer, assign or sell any of the Private Warrants or underlying securities (except to certain permitted transferees) until the completion of the initial Business Combination.\n\nF-11  \n---  \n  \n**Note 6 — Commitments and Contingencies**\n\n**_Registration Rights_**\n\nThe holders of the Founder Shares (as defined in Note 7), Representative Shares, and Private Placement Warrants (as defined below), as well as any warrants that may be issued in payment of Working Capital Loans made to Company, will be entitled to registration rights pursuant to an agreement to be signed prior to or on the effective date of the Proposed Public Offering. The holders of a majority of these securities are entitled to make up to three demands that the Company register such securities. The holders of the majority of the Founder Shares can elect to exercise these registration rights at any time commencing three months prior to the date on which these shares of common stock are to be released from escrow. The holders of a majority of the Representative Shares, Private Placement Warrants and warrants issued in payment of Working Capital Loans (or underlying securities) can elect to exercise these registration rights at any time after the Company consummates a Business Combination. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, EF Hutton may only make a demand on one occasion and only during the five-year period beginning on the effective date of the Proposed Public Offering. In addition, the holders have certain “piggy-back” registration rights with respect to registration statements filed subsequent to the consummation of a Business Combination; provided, however, that EF Hutton may participate in a “piggy-back” registration only during the seven-year period beginning on the effective date of the Proposed Public Offering. The Company will bear the expenses incurred in connection with the filing of any such registration statements.\n\n**_Underwriting Agreement_**\n\nThe Company will grant the underwriters a 45-day option from the date of Proposed Public Offering to purchase up to 900,000 additional Units to cover over-allotments, if any, at the Proposed Public Offering price less the underwriting discounts and commissions.\n\nThe underwriters will be entitled to a cash underwriting discount of 0.85% of the gross proceeds of the Proposed Public Offering, or $510,000 (or up to $600,000 if the underwriters’ over-allotment is exercised in full), payable upon the closing of the Proposed Public Offering. Additionally, the underwriters will be entitled to a deferred underwriting discount of 3.65% of the gross proceeds of the Proposed Public Offering, or $2,190,000 (or up to $2,505,000 if the underwriters’ over-allotment is exercised in full), payable upon the closing of an initial Business Combination.\n\nF-12  \n---  \n  \n**Note 7 — Related Party Transactions**\n\n**_Founder’s Shares_**\n\nIn November 2021, the Company issued an aggregate of 5,750,000 shares of common stock (the “Founder Shares”) for an aggregate purchase price of $25,000. In September 2022, 2,875,000 Founder Shares were returned to the Company for no consideration bringing the total issued Founder Shares to 2,875,000. In September 2023, 943,000 Founder Shares were returned to the Company for no consideration bringing the total issued Founder Shares to 1,932,000, as retrospectively presented in the financial statements. The Founder Shares include an aggregate of up to 252,000 shares subject to forfeiture by the holders to the extent that the underwriters’ over-allotment is not exercised in full or in part, so that the holders will collectively own 22% of the Company’s issued and outstanding shares after the Proposed Public Offering (assuming the initial stockholders do not purchase any Public Shares in the Proposed Public Offering. The holders of the Founder Shares will agree not to transfer, assign or sell any of the Founder Shares (except to certain permitted transferees) until (i) 180 days after the completion of a Business and (ii) if, subsequent to a Business Combination, the Company completes a liquidation, merger, share exchange or other similar transaction which results in all of the Company’s stockholders having the right to exchange their common stock for cash, securities or other property.\n\n**_Promissory Note — Related Party_**\n\nOn November 25, 2021, and as amended on July 11, 2022, November 1, 2022, May 15, 2023, June 30, 2023, and October 4, 2023, the Company issued a $1,500,000 (as amended), principal amount unsecured promissory note to the Sponsor, which is an affiliate of the Company’s Chief Executive Officer. This loan is non-interest bearing, unsecured and repayable upon either (a) the date on which the Company consummates its initial business transaction (such date, the “Maturity Date”) or, at the Company’s discretion, if funds allow, or (b) the date on which the Company consummates the Initial Public Offering. As of September 30, 2023, December 31, 2022 and 2021, there were $1,203,216, $670,780 and $49,192, respectively, outstanding under the promissory note.\n\n**_Administrative Service Agreement_**\n\nThe Company presently occupies office space provided by an entity controlled by Bengochea SPAC Sponsors I LLC. Such entity will agree that until the Company consummates a Business Combination, it will make such office space, as well as general and administrative services including utilities and administrative support, available to the Company as may be required by the Company from time to time. The Company will agree to pay a total of $12,000 per month to the sponsor in exchange for management support, administrative, office space, and other services. We will cease paying these monthly fees 12 months from the date of the close of this offering.\n\n**_Working Capital Loans_**\n\nIn order to finance transaction costs in connection with a Business Combination, the Initial Stockholders, the Sponsor, the Company’s officers and directors or their affiliates may, but are not obligated to, loan the Company funds from time to time or at any time, as may be required (“Working Capital Loans”). Each Working Capital Loan would be evidenced by a promissory note. The notes would either be paid upon consummation of our initial business combination, without interest, or, at holder’s discretion, if there are excess proceeds, upon consummation of this offering. In the event that the initial Business Combination does not close, we may use a portion of the working capital held outside the Trust Account to repay such loaned amounts, but no proceeds from our Trust Account would be used for such repayment. These loans would be repaid at completion of the initial Business Combination. As of September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022 and 2021, no Working Capital Loans were outstanding.\n\n**Note 8 — Stockholders’ Equity**\n\n**_Preferred Stock_**\n\nThe Company is authorized to issue 1,000,000 shares of preferred stock with a par value of $0.0001 per share with such designation, rights and preferences as may be determined from time to time by the Company’s board of directors.\n\nAs of September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022 and 2021, there are no shares of preferred stock issued and outstanding.\n\n**_Common Stock_**\n\nThe Company is authorized to issue 50,000,000 shares of common stock with a par value of $0.0001 per share. As of September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, and December 31, 2021, 1,932,000 shares of common stock were issued and outstanding. The issued and outstanding shares includes 252,000 of which are subject to forfeiture to the extent that the underwriters’ over-allotment option is not exercised in full so that the holders of the Founder Shares will represent approximately 22% of the issued and outstanding common stock after the Proposed Public Offering (assuming they do not purchase any units in this offering). All of these shares will be placed into an escrow account on the closing of the Proposed Public Offering. Subject to certain limited exceptions, these shares will not be transferred, assigned, sold, or released from escrow for a period ending on the 180-day anniversary of the date of the consummation of the initial business combination, or earlier if, subsequent to the initial business combination, the Company consummates a liquidation, merger, stock exchange or other similar transaction which results in all of the Company’s stockholders having the right to exchange their shares of common stock for cash, securities or other property.\n\n**_Rights_**\n\nEach holder of a right will receive one-fifth (1/5) of one share of common stock upon consummation of a Business Combination, even if the holder of such right redeemed all shares held by it in connection with a Business Combination. No fractional shares will be issued upon exchange of the rights. No additional consideration will be required to be paid by a holder of rights in order to receive its additional shares upon consummation of a Business Combination as the consideration related thereto has been included in the unit purchase price paid for by investors in the Proposed Public Offering. If the Company enters into a definitive agreement for a Business Combination in which the Company will not be the surviving entity, the definitive agreement will provide for the holders of rights to receive the same per share consideration the holders of the shares of common stock will receive in the transaction on an as- converted into common stock basis and each holder of a right will be required to affirmatively convert its rights in order to receive one-fifth (1/5) of one share underlying each right (without paying additional consideration).\n\nAdditionally, in no event will the Company be required to net cash settle the rights. If the Company is unable to complete a Business Combination within the Combination Period and the Company liquidates the funds held in the Trust Account, holders of rights will not receive any of such funds with respect to their rights, nor will they receive any distribution from the Company’s assets held outside of the Trust Account with respect to such rights. Accordingly, the rights may expire worthless.\n\nF-13  \n---  \n  \n**_Representative Shares_**\n\nThe Company has agreed to issue to EF Hutton and/or its designees in the Proposed Public Offering 35,000 Representative Shares at the time of the consummation of this offering. The holders of the Representative Shares have agreed not to transfer, assign or sell any such shares until the completion of a Business Combination. In addition, the holders have agreed they will (i) waive their redemption rights with respect to such shares in connection with the completion of a Business Combination and (ii) waive their rights to liquidating distributions from the Trust Account with respect to such shares if the Company fails to complete a Business Combination within the Combination Period.\n\nThe Representative Shares have been deemed compensation by FINRA and are therefore subject to a lock-up for a period of 180 days immediately following the effective date of the registration statement related to the Proposed Public Offering pursuant to Rule 5110(e)(1) of FINRA’s NASD Conduct Rules. Pursuant to FINRA Rule 5110(e)(1), these securities will not be the subject of any hedging, short sale, derivative, put or call transaction that would result in the economic disposition of the securities by any person for a period of 180 days immediately following the effective date of the registration statement related to the Proposed Public Offering, nor may they be sold, transferred, assigned, pledged or hypothecated for a period of 180 days immediately following the effective date of the registration statement related to the Proposed Public Offering except to any underwriter and selected dealer participating in the Proposed Public Offering and their bona fide officers or partners.\n\n**_Warrants_**\n\nPublic Warrants may only be exercised for a whole number of shares. No fractional Public Warrants will be issued upon separation of the Units and only whole Public Warrants will trade. The Public Warrants will become exercisable on the later of (a) 30 days after the completion of a Business Combination or (b) 12 months from the closing of the Proposed Public Offering; provided in each case that the Company has an effective registration statement under the Securities Act covering the shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of the Public Warrants and a current prospectus relating to them is available (or the Company permits holders to exercise their Public Warrants on a cashless basis and such cashless exercise is exempt from registration under the Securities Act). The Company has agreed that as soon as practicable, after the closing of the Business Combination, the Company will use its best efforts to file with the SEC a registration statement for the registration, under the Securities Act, of the common stock issuable upon exercise of the Public Warrants. The Company will use its best efforts to cause the same to become effective and to maintain the effectiveness of such registration statement, and a current prospectus relating thereto, until the expiration of the Public Warrants in accordance with the provisions of the public warrant agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Company’s common stock is at the time of any exercise of a warrant not listed on a national securities exchange such that it satisfies the definition of a “covered security” under the Securities Act, the Company, at its option, may require holders of Public Warrants who exercise their warrants to do so on a “cashless basis” in accordance with Section 3(a)(9) of the Securities Act and, in the event the Company so elects, the Company will not be required to file or maintain in effect a registration statement. The Public Warrants will expire five years after the completion of the Business Combination or earlier upon the Company’s redemption or liquidation.\n\nThe Company may redeem the Public Warrants:\n\n• | in whole and not in part;  \n---|---  \n• | at a price of $0.01 per warrant;  \n• | upon a minimum of 30 days’ prior written notice of redemption to each warrant holder; and  \n• | if, and only if, the last reported sale price (the “closing price”) of common stock equals or exceeds $18.00 per share (as adjusted) for any 20 trading days within a 30-trading day period commencing at any time after the shares underlying the warrants have become exercisable and ending on the third trading day prior to the date on which the Company sends the notice of redemption to the warrant holders.  \n  \nThe Company will not redeem the Public Warrants as described above unless a registration statement under the Securities Act covering the common stock issuable upon exercise of the Public Warrants is then effective and a current prospectus relating to those common stock is available throughout the 30-day redemption period. Any such exercise would not be on a cashless basis and would require the exercising warrant holder to pay the exercise price for each Public Warrant being exercised.\n\nF-14  \n---  \n  \nThe Warrants to be issued in the Private Placement (“Private Placement Warrants”) will be identical to the Public Warrants, except that the Private Placement Warrants and the common stock issuable upon exercise of the Private Placement Warrants will not be transferable, assignable or saleable until 30 days after the completion of the Business Combination, subject to certain limited exceptions.\n\nIn no event will the Company be required to net cash settle any warrant. If the Company is unable to complete a Business Combination within the Combination Period and the Company liquidates the funds held in the Trust Account, holders of warrants will not receive any of such funds with respect to their warrants, nor will they receive any distribution from the Company’s assets held outside of the Trust Account with the respect to such warrants. Accordingly, the warrants may expire worthless. As of September 30, 2023, December 31, 2022 and 2021, there were no warrants outstanding.\n\n**Note 9 — Subsequent Events**\n\nThe Company evaluated subsequent events and transactions that occurred after the balance sheet date up to the date the financial statements were issued. Based on this review, other than as described below, the Company did not identify any other subsequent events that would have required adjustment or disclosure in the financial statements.\n\nOn October 4, 2023, the Company entered into its fifth amendment to the Promissory Note dated November 30, 2021, to indicate the Note shall be repayable upon either (a) the date on which the Company consummates its initial business combination (such date, the “Maturity Date”) or, at the Company’s discretion, if funds allow, on (b) the date on which the Company consummates the Proposed Public Offering.\n\nOn October 17, 2023, a former vendor of the Company agreed to waive an outstanding invoice in the amount of $87,724. Accordingly, the Company’s accrued expenses for the fourth fiscal quarter of 2023 are expected to reflect a downward adjustment in the amount of $87,724.\n\nAs of the date of this filing, OMNIA Global, which had previously agreed to invest a portion of the funds needed to finance this offering in exchange for a minority equity stake in our sponsor, has not provided the funding required under the agreement.\n\nF-15  \n---  \n  \n**6,000,000 Units**\n\n**Iron Horse Acquisitions Corp.**\n\n**PRELIMINARY PROSPECTUS**\n\n**_Book-Running Manager_**\n\n**EF Hutton**\n\ndivision of Benchmark Investments, LLC\n\nUntil , 2023 (25 days after the date of this prospectus), all dealers that buy, sell or trade our common stock, whether or not participating in this offering, may be required to deliver a prospectus.

INDEMNIFICATION OF DIRECTORS AND OFFICERS.**\n\nOur certificate of incorporation provides that all directors, officers, employees and agents of the registrant shall be entitled to be indemnified by us to the fullest extent permitted by Section 145 of the Delaware General Corporation Law.\n\nSection 145 of the Delaware General Corporation Law concerning indemnification of officers, directors, employees and agents is set forth below.\n\n“Section 145. Indemnification of officers, directors, employees and agents; insurance.\n\n(a) | A corporation shall have power to indemnify any person who was or is a party or is threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending or completed action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative (other than an action by or in the right of the corporation) by reason of the fact that the person is or was a director, officer, employee or agent of the corporation, or is or was serving at the request of the corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, against expenses (including attorneys’ fees), judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred by the person in connection with such action, suit or proceeding if the person acted in good faith and in a manner the person reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the corporation, and, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, had no reasonable cause to believe the person’s conduct was unlawful. The termination of any action, suit or proceeding by judgment, order, settlement, conviction, or upon a plea of nolo contendere or its equivalent, shall not, of itself, create a presumption that the person did not act in good faith and in a manner which the person reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the corporation, and, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, had reasonable cause to believe that the person’s conduct was unlawful.  \n---|---  \n(b) | A corporation shall have power to indemnify any person who was or is a party or is threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending or completed action or suit by or in the right of the corporation to procure a judgment in its favor by reason of the fact that the person is or was a director, officer, employee or agent of the corporation, or is or was serving at the request of the corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise against expenses (including attorneys’ fees) actually and reasonably incurred by the person in connection with the defense or settlement of such action or suit if the person acted in good faith and in a manner the person reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the corporation and except that no indemnification shall be made in respect of any claim, issue or matter as to which such person shall have been adjudged to be liable to the corporation unless and only to the extent that the Court of Chancery or the court in which such action or suit was brought shall determine upon application that, despite the adjudication of liability but in view of all the circumstances of the case, such person is fairly and reasonably entitled to indemnity for such expenses which the Court of Chancery or such other court shall deem proper.  \n---|---  \n(c) | To the extent that a present or former director or officer of a corporation has been successful on the merits or otherwise in defense of any action, suit or proceeding referred to in subsections (a) and (b) of this section, or in defense of any claim, issue or matter therein, such person shall be indemnified against expenses (including attorneys’ fees) actually and reasonably incurred by such person in connection therewith.  \n---|---  \n(d) | Any indemnification under subsections (a) and (b) of this section (unless ordered by a court) shall be made by the corporation only as authorized in the specific case upon a determination that indemnification of the present or former director, officer, employee or agent is proper in the circumstances because the person has met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in subsections (a) and (b) of this section. Such determination shall be made, with respect to a person who is a director or officer at the time of such determination, (1) by a majority vote of the directors who are not parties to such action, suit or proceeding, even though less than a quorum, or (2) by a committee of such directors designated by majority vote of such directors, even though less than a quorum, or (3) if there are no such directors, or if such directors so direct, by independent legal counsel in a written opinion, or (4) by the stockholders.  \n---|---  \n(e) | Expenses (including attorneys’ fees) incurred by an officer or director in defending any civil, criminal, administrative or investigative action, suit or proceeding may be paid by the corporation in advance of the final disposition of such action, suit or proceeding upon receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of such director or officer to repay such amount if it shall ultimately be determined that such person is not entitled to be indemnified by the corporation as authorized in this section. Such expenses (including attorneys’ fees) incurred by former directors and officers or other employees and agents may be so paid upon such terms and conditions, if any, as the corporation deems appropriate.  \n---|---  \n  \nII-1  \n---  \n  \n(f) | The indemnification and advancement of expenses provided by, or granted pursuant to, the other subsections of this section shall not be deemed exclusive of any other rights to which those seeking indemnification or advancement of expenses may be entitled under any bylaw, agreement, vote of stockholders or disinterested directors or otherwise, both as to action in such person’s official capacity and as to action in another capacity while holding such office.  \n---|---  \n(g) | A corporation shall have power to purchase and maintain insurance on behalf of any person who is or was director, officer, employee or agent of the corporation, or is or was serving at the request of the corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise against any liability asserted against such person and incurred by such person in any such capacity, or arising out of such person’s status as such, whether or not the corporation would have the power to indemnify such person against such liability under this section.  \n---|---  \n(h) | For purposes of this section, references to “the corporation” shall include, in addition to the resulting corporation, any constituent corporation (including any constituent of a constituent) absorbed in a consolidation or merger which, if its separate existence had continued, would have had power and authority to indemnify its directors, officers, and employees or agents, so that any person who is or was a director, officer, employee or agent of such constituent corporation, or is or was serving at the request of such constituent corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, shall stand in the same position under this section with respect to the resulting or surviving corporation as such person would have with respect to such constituent corporation if its separate existence had continued.  \n---|---  \n(i) | For purposes of this section, references to “other enterprises” shall include employee benefit plans; references to “fines” shall include any excise taxes assessed on a person with respect to any employee benefit plan; and references to “serving at the request of the corporation” shall include any service as a director, officer, employee or agent of the corporation which imposes duties on, or involves services by, such director, officer, employee or agent with respect to an employee benefit plan, its participants or beneficiaries; and a person who acted in good faith and in a manner such person reasonably believed to be in the interest of the participants and beneficiaries of an employee benefit plan shall be deemed to have acted in a manner “not opposed to the best interests of the corporation” as referred to in this section.  \n---|---  \n(j) | The indemnification and advancement of expenses provided by, or granted pursuant to, this section shall, unless otherwise provided when authorized or ratified, continue as to a person who has ceased to be a director, officer, employee or agent and shall inure to the benefit of the heirs, executors and administrators of such a person.  \n---|---  \n(k) | The Court of Chancery is hereby vested with exclusive jurisdiction to hear and determine all actions for advancement of expenses or indemnification brought under this section or under any bylaw, agreement, vote of stockholders or disinterested directors, or otherwise. The Court of Chancery may summarily determine a corporation’s obligation to advance expenses (including attorneys’ fees).”  \n---|---  \nInsofar as indemnification for liabilities arising under the Securities Act may be permitted to our directors, officers, and controlling persons pursuant to the foregoing provisions, or otherwise, we have been advised that, in the opinion of the SEC, such indemnification is against public policy as expressed in the Securities Act and is, therefore, unenforceable. In the event that a claim for indemnification against such liabilities (other than the payment of expenses incurred or paid by a director, officer or controlling person in a successful defense of any action, suit or proceeding) is asserted by such director, officer or controlling person in connection with the securities being registered, we will, unless in the opinion of its counsel the matter has been settled by controlling precedent, submit to the court of appropriate jurisdiction the question whether such indemnification by it is against public policy as expressed in the Securities Act and will be governed by the final adjudication of such issue.  \n  \nParagraph B of Article Eighth of our certificate of incorporation provides:\n\n“The Corporation, to the full extent permitted by Section 145 of the GCL, as amended from time to time, shall indemnify all persons whom it may indemnify pursuant thereto. Expenses (including attorneys’ fees) incurred by an officer or director in defending any civil, criminal, administrative, or investigative action, suit or proceeding for which such officer or director may be entitled to indemnification hereunder shall be paid by the Corporation in advance of the final disposition of such action, suit or proceeding upon receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of such director or officer to repay such amount if it shall ultimately be determined that he is not entitled to be indemnified by the Corporation as authorized hereby.”\n\nPursuant to the Underwriting Agreement filed as Exhibit 1.1 to this Registration Statement, we have agreed to indemnify the Underwriter and the Underwriter has agreed to indemnify us against certain civil liabilities that may be incurred in connection with this offering, including certain liabilities under the Securities Act.\n\nWe will enter into indemnification agreements with each of our officers and directors a form of which is to be filed as an exhibit to this Registration Statement. These agreements will require us to indemnify these individuals to the fullest extent permitted under Delaware law against liabilities that may arise by reason of their service to us, and to advance expenses incurred as a result of any proceeding against them as to which they could be indemnified.\n\nII-2  \n---  \n  \n**ITEM 15. RECENT SALES OF UNREGISTERED SECURITIES.**\n\n(a) | During the past three years, we sold the following shares of common stock without registration under the Securities Act:  \n---|---  \n**Stockholders** | **Number of Shares**  \n---|---  \nBengochea SPAC Sponsors I LLC | 5,750,000   \nSuch shares were issued in November 2021 in connection with our organization pursuant to the exemption from registration contained in Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act as the shares were sold to an accredited investor. The shares issued were sold for an aggregate offering price of $25,000 at an average purchase price of approximately $0.004 per share. (Note that, as described elsewhere in this Registration Statement, in September 2022, the initial stockholders surrendered 2,875,000 shares of common stock resulting in there being an aggregate of 2,875,000 Founder’s Shares outstanding and then, in September 2023, the initial stockholders surrendered 943,000 shares of common stock for no consideration, resulting in there being an aggregate of 1,932,000 Founder’s Shares outstanding.)  \n---  \n  \nThe company has agreed to issued 35,000 Representative Shares to EF Hutton, the representative of the underwriters at the time of the consummation of this offering, for a nominal consideration pursuant to the exemption from registration contained in Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act as the shares were issued to accredited investors.\n\nThe Company’s sponsor has also committed that it and/or its designees will purchase 2,457,000 warrants at $1.00 per warrant (for an aggregate of $2,457,000).

UNDERTAKINGS.**\n\n(a) | The undersigned registrant hereby undertakes:  \n---|---  \n(1) | To file, during any period in which offers or sales are being made, a post-effective amendment to this registration statement:  \n---|---  \ni. | To include any prospectus required by Section 10(a)(3) of the Securities Act of 1933;  \n---|---  \nii. | To reflect in the prospectus any facts or events arising after the effective date of the registration statement (or the most recent post-effective amendment thereof) which, individually or in the aggregate, represent a fundamental change in the information set forth in the registration statement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any increase or decrease in volume of securities offered (if the total dollar value of securities offered would not exceed that which was registered) and any deviation from the low or high end of the estimated maximum offering range may be reflected in the form of prospectus filed with the Commission pursuant to Rule 424(b) if, in the aggregate, the changes in volume and price represent no more than 20 percent change in the maximum aggregate offering price set forth in the “Calculation of Registration Fee” table in the effective registration statement;  \n---|---  \niii. | To include any material information with respect to the plan of distribution not previously disclosed in the registration statement or any material change to such information in the registration statement.  \n---|---  \n(2) | That, for the purpose of determining any liability under the Securities Act of 1933, each such post-effective amendment shall be deemed to be a new registration statement relating to the securities offered therein, and the offering of such securities at that time shall be deemed to be the initial bona fide offering thereof.  \n---|---  \n(3) | To remove from registration by means of a post-effective amendment any of the securities being registered which remain unsold at the termination of the offering.  \n---|---  \n(4) | That for the purpose of determining any liability under the Securities Act of 1933 in a primary offering of securities of the undersigned registrant pursuant to this registration statement, regardless of the underwriting method used to sell the securities to the purchaser, if the securities are offered or sold to such purchaser by means of any of the following communications, the undersigned registrant will be a seller to the purchaser and will be considered to offer or sell such securities to such purchaser:  \n---|---  \n(i) | Any preliminary prospectus or prospectus of the undersigned registrant relating to the offering required to be filed pursuant to Rule 424;  \n---|---  \n(ii) | Any free writing prospectus relating to the offering prepared by or on behalf of the undersigned registrant or used or referred to by the undersigned registrant;  \n---|---  \n(iii) | The portion of any other free writing prospectus relating to the offering containing material information about the undersigned registrant or its securities provided by or on behalf of the undersigned registrant;
