Hovering over a tagged fact will highlight (shade) all content related to the tagged fact, and clicking on a tagged fact will reveal its tagging details in the Fact Review Window. Navigation, search and filter options are also provided to easily refine and identify specific types of tagged information.\n\n#####  Fact Review Window\n\nThe Fact Review Window shows the tagging details for the currently selected fact, which is highlighted with a solid blue border. There are four categories of fact detail which can be viewed; an \"N/A\" value indicates there is no available information for the item within the given category:\n\n  * Attributes - All primary information (as applicable) describing the tagged fact including period, sign, decimals, dimensional detail (axes and members), scale, measure and data type.\n  * Labels - Detailed documentation (definition) for the tag used, and other labels.\n  * References - Authoritative reference information (as applicable) for the selected tag.\n  * Calculation - Balance and calculation hierarchy details (numeric non-dimensioned items only).\n\n\n\n#####  Searching\n\nThere are two ways to search the document: FACTS AND SECTIONS. To search information, enter a keyword in a search box and select the magnifying glass icon to return matching results. Search operators \"and\" (via \"AND\" or \"&\") and \"or\" (via \"OR\" or \"|\") are available to further refine a search.\n\n**FACTS**\n\nThe Search Facts box can be used to find tagged facts matching entered keywords. By default, tag name, tag labels, and tagged content are included in Search. Tagged facts matching the search criteria are shown with a yellow-colored (default) shading on the page and appear in the Facts List. Select the \"X\" button to the left of the magnifying glass icon to clear the search.\n\nThe content included in Search can be increased to included tag definitions, dimensions, and authoritative references by selecting the cog / wheel icon to the left of the search box. See Settings for more information.\n\n**SECTIONS**\n\nThe Search Sections box can be used to filter the tagged sections of the financial statements.\n\n#####  Filters\n\nFilters change the number of highlighted facts and items in the fact list by providing several ways to review and pinpoint certain tagged information. Multiple filters can be used at once.\n\n**DATA FILTERS**\n\nThese filter options allow the user to refine the highlighted tagged facts by data type:\n\n  * All - Displays all tagged data (default)\n  * Amounts Only - Numeric facts only\n  * Text Only - Textual facts only\n  * Calculations Only - Numeric facts participating in a calculation only\n  * Negatives Only - Negative Numeric amounts only\n  * Additional Items Only - Tagged facts without a corresponding HTML presentation (i.e., hidden facts) only\n\n\n\n**TAGS FILTER**\n\nThese filters allow the user to refine the highlighted facts by tag type:\n\n  * All - Displays all tagged data (default)\n  * Standard Only- Facts with standard tags from a common taxonomy (e.g., US_GAAP, IFRS, DEI).\n  * Custom Only - Facts with extension \"custom\" tags unique to the entity's document.\n\n\n\n**MORE FILTERS**\n\nAdditional filters that allow user to further refine the highlighted facts:\n\n  * Periods - List of all used context years and reporting periods\n  * Measures - List of all used units of measure (e.g., US Dollars); as applicable\n  * Axis - List of all used axis (dimensions); as applicable (dimensions); as applicable\n  * Scale - List of all used scaled options (e.g., thousands, millions); as applicable\n  * Balance - Debit, credit; as applicable\n\n\n\nMultiple filters work in conjunction with each other. For example, selecting the \"Amounts Only\" Data filter and \"Custom Only\" Tags filter will highlight only numeric tagged facts using custom tags and list them in the fact list. Active filters are displayed in the Filter toolbar as they are selected. Active filters can be removed individually by unchecking or selecting ALL option for each filter, or all at once via the \"Reset All Filters\" option.\n\n#####  Facts List (Results)\n\nOn the toolbar, select the \"count\" to the right of the word Facts (e.g., Facts 234) to reveal the Facts List results - a navigable listing of all currently highlighted tagged facts. The count represents the current number of facts.\n\nBy default, all tagged facts are displayed in the Fact List Results. The list content and count reflects the currently highlighted facts (i.e., both Filters and Search criteria refine the list to match the highlighted tagged facts). Navigation controls are available to move through the list as well as move the current view to the corresponding highlighted fact location automatically. When a fact in the Facts Results List is selected, it will reveal the Fact Review Window.\n\nCertain letters may appear to the right of an item in the Fact Result list to indicate a certain property. If the letter \"A\" appears for a fact, it indicates the fact is additional data (i.e., hidden with potentially no corresponding HTML presentation). If the letter \"C\" appears, the fact is tagged with a custom tag. If the letter \"D\" appears, the fact is tagged with dimensional information.\n\n#####  Sections\n\nThe SECTIONS toolbar item provides a listing of the tagged sections of the Inline document. Sections are divided into three groups:\n\n  * Document & Entity Information\n  * Financial Statements\n  * Notes to the Financial Statements\n\n\n\nBy expanding a group and selecting a section item in the listing, Inline XBRL viewer will navigate to that section. When the Tagged Sections feature is open, the Search Sections box will additionally filter the list of sections to only those sections that match the entered criteria.\n\n#####  Menu\n\n**Information**\n\nThe Information menu item provides additional detail about the current Inline document and customizable viewer settings.\n\n  * Company and Document - Basic company and document information\n  * Tags - Fact and tag (standard and custom) information\n  * Files - Files used\n  * Additional Items - Additional hidden data that's been tagged but potentially does not have a corresponding location in the HTML\n\n\n\n**Save XBRL Instance**\n\nThe Save XBRL Instance menu item allows an XBRL instance document (*.xml) that is extracted from the Inline document to be saved locally for use by software supporting the XBRL format.\n\n**Save XBRL Zip**\n\nThe Save XBRL Zip menu item allows a zip file (*.zip) that contains the as-provided XBRL instance document and related custom taxonomy files to be saved locally.\n\n**Settings**\n\nThe Settings menu item provides the ability to customize Viewer features.\n\n**Tagged Fact Hover**\n\n  * On - Displays the hover fact review window for any tagged fact*\n  * Off - Hides the hover fact review window for any tagged fact (default)\n\n\n\n* May impact performance with certain web browsers.\n\n**Auto Scrolling Position**(This setting will have no effect on IE 10 or Safari) \n\n  * Top - Selecting a fact from the Sections Menu or the Fact Menu will automatically scroll that element to the Top of the Inline XBRL viewer window (default)\n  * Center - Selecting a fact from the Sections Menu or the Fact Menu will automatically scroll that element to the middle of the Inline XBRL viewer window\n\n\n\n**Highlight Colors** (Use the save and reset buttons to save the selected setting or reset to default) \n\n  * Tagged Data - Change the highlight color of the tagged fact border\n  * Search Results - Change the background color of tagged items matching the Search results\n  * Selected Fact - Change the color of highlight border used to identify the currently selected fact\n  * Tag Shading (hover) - Change the color of the shading applied to tagged data on hover\n\n\n\n**Search Options**\n\n  * Match Case - Matches the specific case of the entered Search keyword\n  * Include Labels - Extends Search to include tag labels\n  * Include Definitions - Extends Search to include tag definitions\n  * Include Dimensions - Extends Search to include dimensional detail\n  * Include References - Extends Search to include authoritative reference information. Optionally specify the reference parts to include in the search (e.g., topic, subtopic, section)\n\n\n\n**Help**(this content) \n\n**Version**\n\nIndicates the current build of the Inline XBRL viewer

Presentation_\n\nThe consolidated balance sheet of Geospace Technologies Corporation and its subsidiaries (the “Company”) at  _September 30, 2023_ was derived from the Company’s audited consolidated financial statements at that date. The consolidated balance sheet at  _December 31, 2023_ and the consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income (loss), stockholders’ equity and cash flows for the  _three_ months ended _December 31, 2023_ and _2022_ were prepared by the Company without audit. In the opinion of management, all adjustments, consisting of normal recurring adjustments, necessary to present fairly the consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows were made. All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated. The results of operations for the  _three_ months ended _December 31, 2023_ are _not_ necessarily indicative of the operating results for a full year or of future operations.\n\nCertain information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (\"U.S. GAAP\") were omitted pursuant to the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission. The accompanying consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes thereto contained in the Company’s Annual Report on Form _10_ -K for the Company’s fiscal year ended _September 30, 2023_.\n\n_Use of Estimates_\n\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. The Company considers many factors in selecting appropriate operational and financial accounting policies and controls, and in developing the estimates and assumptions that are used in the preparation of these financial statements. The Company continually evaluates its estimates, including those related to revenue recognition, bad debt reserves, collectability of rental revenue, inventory obsolescence reserves, self-insurance reserves, product warranty reserves, useful lives of long-lived assets, impairment of long-lived assets, impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets and deferred income tax assets. The Company bases its estimates on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. While management believes current estimates are reasonable and appropriate, actual results _may_ differ from these estimates under different conditions or assumptions.\n\n_Cash and Cash Equivalents_\n\nThe Company considers all highly liquid investments purchased with an original or remaining maturity at the time of purchase of _three_ months or less to be cash equivalents. At _December 31, 2023_ and _September 30, 2023_ , the Company had restricted cash of $0.2 million on deposit with a bank, which serves as collateral on employee issued credit cards. At _December 31, 2023_ , cash and cash equivalents included $3.3 million held by the Company’s foreign subsidiaries and branch offices, including $1.8 million held by its subsidiary in the Russian Federation. In response to sanctions imposed by the U.S. and others on Russia, the Russian government has imposed restrictions on companies' abilities to repatriate or otherwise remit cash from their Russian-based operations to locations outside of Russia. As a result, this cash can be used in our Russian operations, but the Company _may_ be unable to transfer it out of Russia without incurring substantial costs, if at all. In addition, if the Company were to repatriate the cash held by its Russian subsidiary, it would be required to accrue and pay taxes on any amount repatriated. During fiscal year _2023,_ in light of recent volatility in the financial markets, the Company entered into an IntraFi Cash Service (\"ICS\") Deposit Placement Agreement with IntraFi Network LLC through its primary bank, Woodforest National Bank. The ICS program offers access to unlimited Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (\"FDIC') insurance on the Company's domestically held cash in excess of $5.0 million, thereby mitigating its risk of falling outside of FDIC coverage limits.\n\n_Impairment of Long-lived Assets_\n\nThe Company's long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever an event or circumstance indicates that the carrying amount of an asset or group of assets _may_ _not_ be recoverable. The impairment review, if necessary, includes a comparison of the expected future cash flows (undiscounted and without interest charges) to be generated by an asset group with the associated carrying value of the related assets. If the carrying value of the asset group exceeds the expected future cash flows, an impairment loss is recognized to the extent that the carrying value of the asset group exceeds its fair value. During the quarter ended _December 31, 2023_ , _no_ events or changes in circumstances were identified indicating the carrying value of any of the Company's asset groups _may_ _not_ be recoverable.\n\n_Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements_\n\nIn _June 2016,_ the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the “FASB”) issued guidance surrounding credit losses for financial instruments that replaces the incurred loss impairment methodology in generally accepted accounting principles. The new impairment model requires immediate recognition of estimated credit losses expected to occur for most financial assets and certain other financial instruments. For available-for-sale debt securities with unrealized losses, credit losses will be recognized as allowances rather than reductions in the amortized cost of the securities. The Company adopted this standard on _October 1, 2023._ The adoption of this standard did _not_ have any material impact on its consolidated financial statements.\n\n_Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements_\n\nIn _November 2023,_ the FASB issued guidance which updates reportable segment disclosure requirements primarily through enhanced disclosures about significant segment expenses. The guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after _December 15, 2023,_ and for interim periods within fiscal years beginning after _December 15, 2024._ Early adoption is permitted. The guidance shall be applied retrospectively to all prior periods presented in the financial statements. The Company is currently evaluating the provisions of this guidance and the impact on its consolidated financial statements. \n\nAll other new accounting pronouncements that have been issued, but _not_ yet effective, are currently being evaluated and at this time are _not_ expected to have a material impact on the Company's financial position or results of operations.\n\n_8_\n\n**_2._ Revenue Recognition**\n\nIn accordance with ASC Topic _606,_ _Revenue from Contracts with Customers_ (“ASC _606”_), the Company recognizes revenue when performance of contractual obligations are satisfied, generally when control of the promised goods or services is transferred to its customers, in an amount that reflects the consideration it expects to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services.\n\nThe Company primarily derives product revenue from the sale of its manufactured products. Revenue from these product sales, including the sale of used rental equipment, is recognized when obligations under the terms of a contract are satisfied, control is transferred and collectability of the sales price is probable. The Company records deferred revenue when customer funds are received prior to shipment or delivery or performance has _not_ yet occurred. The Company assesses collectability during the contract assessment phase. In situations where collectability of the sales price is _not_ probable, the Company recognizes revenue when it determines that collectability is probable or when non-refundable cash is received from its customers and there is _not_ a significant right of return. Transfer of control generally occurs with shipment or delivery, depending on the terms of the underlying contract. The Company’s products are generally sold without any customer acceptance provisions, and the Company’s standard terms of sale do _not_ allow customers to return products for credit.\n\nRevenue from engineering services is recognized as services are rendered over the duration of a project, or as billed on a per hour basis. Field service revenue is recognized when services are rendered and is generally priced on a per day rate.\n\nThe Company also generates revenue from short-term rentals under operating leases of its manufactured products. Rental revenue is recognized as earned over the rental period if collectability of the rent is reasonably assured. Rentals of the Company’s equipment generally range from daily rentals to minimum rental periods of up to _one_ year. The Company has determined that ASC _606_ does _not_ apply to rental contracts, which are within the scope of ASC Topic _842,_ _Leases_.\n\nAs permissible under ASC _606,_ sales taxes and transaction-based taxes are excluded from revenue. The Company does _not_ disclose the value of unsatisfied performance obligations for contracts with an original expected duration of _one_ year or less. Additionally, the Company expenses costs incurred to obtain contracts when incurred because the amortization period would have been _one_ year or less. These costs are recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses.\n\nThe Company has elected to treat shipping and handling activities in a sales transaction after the customer obtains control of the goods as a fulfillment cost and _not_ as a promised service. Accordingly, fulfillment costs related to the shipping and handling of goods are accrued at the time of shipment. Amounts billed to a customer in a sales transaction related to reimbursable shipping and handling costs are included in revenue and the associated costs incurred by the Company for reimbursable shipping and handling expenses are reported in cost of revenue.\n\nAt _December 31, 2023_ , the Company had deferred contract liabilities of $1.3 million and no deferred contract cost. At _September 30, 2023_ , the Company had deferred liabilities of $0.7 million and no deferred contract costs. During the _three_ months ended _December 31, 2023_ , revenue of $45,000 was recognized from deferred contract liabilities and no cost of revenue was recognized from deferred contract costs. During the _three_ months ended _December 31, 2022_ , no revenue was recognized from deferred contract liabilities and no cost of revenue was recognized from deferred contract costs. At _December 31, 2023_ , all contracts had an original expected duration of _one_ year or less.\n\nFor each of the Company’s operating segments, the following table presents revenue (in thousands) only from the sale of products and the performance of services under contracts with customers. Therefore, the table excludes all revenue earned from rental contracts.\n\n**__Three Months Ended__**  \n---  \n**_December 31, 2023_** |  **_December 31, 2022_**  \n**Oil and Gas Markets**  \nTraditional exploration product revenue | $| 1,762| $| 2,755  \nWireless exploration product revenue | 31,869| 5,759  \nReservoir product revenue | 73| 155  \nTotal revenue | 33,704| 8,669  \n**Adjacent Markets**  \nIndustrial product revenue | 6,443| 7,930  \nImaging product revenue | 3,333| 2,856  \nTotal revenue | 9,776| 10,786  \n**Emerging Markets**  \nRevenue | 234| 93  \n**Total** | $| 43,714| $| 19,548  \n  \nSee Note _12_ for more information on the Company’s operating segments.\n\n_9_\n\nFor each of the geographic areas where the Company operates, the following table presents revenue (in thousands) from the sale of products and services under contracts with customers.

Available-for-sale securities are carried at fair market value with net unrealized gains and losses reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss in stockholders’ equity. \n\nThe Company’s short-term investments were composed of the following (in thousands):\n\n**____As of December 31, 2023____**  \n---  \n**_Amortized Cost_** |  **_Unrealized Gains_** |  **_Unrealized Losses_** |  **_Estimated Fair Value_**  \nShort-term investments:  \nCorporate bonds | $| 11,375| $| 2| $| —| $| 11,377  \nU.S. treasury securities and securities of U.S. government-sponsored agency | 3,672| 2| —| 3,674  \n**Total** | $| 15,047| $| 4| $| —| $| 15,051  \n**____As of September 30, 2023____**  \n---  \n**_Amortized Cost_** |  **_Unrealized Gains_** |  **_Unrealized Losses_** |  **_Estimated Fair Value_**  \nShort-term investments:  \nCorporate bonds | $| 11,310| $| —| $| (15| )| $| 11,295  \nU.S. treasury securities and securities of U.S. government-sponsored agency | 3,622| 4| —| 3,626  \n**Total** | $| 14,932| $| 4| $| (15| )| $| 14,921  \n  \nThe Company had no securities in a material unrealized loss position at _December 31, 2023_ and _September 30, 2023_ and does _not_ believe these securities represent credit losses based on the evaluation of evidence, which includes an assessment of whether it is more likely than _not_ it will be required to sell or intend to sell the investment before recovery of the investments amortized cost basis. No gains or losses were realized during the  _three_ months ended _December 31, 2023_ and _2022_ from the sale of short-term investments. \n\n**_4._ Fair Value of Financial Instruments**\n\nThe Company’s financial instruments generally include cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, trade accounts and notes receivable and accounts payable. Due to the short-term maturities of cash and cash equivalents, trade accounts and notes receivable and accounts payable, the carrying amounts of these financial instruments are deemed to approximate their fair value on the respective balance sheet dates. The Company measures its short-term investments at fair value on a recurring basis.\n\nThe following tables present the fair value of the Company’s short-term investments and contingent consideration by valuation hierarchy and input (in thousands):\n\n**____As of December 31, 2023____**  \n---  \n**_Quoted Prices in_** |  **_Significant_**  \n**_Active Markets for_** |  **_Other_** |  **_Significant_**  \n**_Identical Assets_** |  **_Observable_** |  **_Unobservable_**  \n**_(Level 1)_** |  **_(Level 2)_** |  **_(Level 3)_** |  **_Totals_**  \nShort-term investments:  \nCorporate bonds | $| —| $| 11,377| $| —| $| 11,377  \nU.S. treasury securities and securities of U.S. government-sponsored agency | 3,674| 3,674  \nTotal assets | $| —| $| 15,051| $| —| $| 15,051  \n**____As of September 30, 2023____**  \n---  \n**_Quoted Prices in_** |  **_Significant_**  \n**_Active Markets for_** |  **_Other_** |  **_Significant_**  \n**_Identical Assets_** |  **_Observable_** |  **_Unobservable_**  \n**_(Level 1)_** |  **_(Level 2)_** |  **_(Level 3)_** |  **_Totals_**  \nShort-term investments:  \nCorporate bonds | $| —| $| 11,295| $| —| $| 11,295  \nU.S. treasury securities and securities of U.S. government-sponsored agency | _—_|  3,626|  _—_|  3,626  \nTotal assets | $| —| $| 14,921| $| —| $| 14,921  \n  \n**_5._ Trade Accounts and Notes Receivable**\n\nTrade accounts receivable, net (excluding notes receivable) are reflected in the following table (in thousands):\n\n**_December 31, 2023_** |  **_September 30, 2023_**  \n---|---  \nTrade accounts receivable | $| 41,755| $| 20,282  \nAllowance for credit losses | (92| )| (125| )  \nTotal | 41,663| 20,157  \nLess current portion | (40,153| )| (20,157| )  \nNon-current trade accounts receivable | $| 1,510| $| —  \n  \nTrade accounts receivable at _December 31, 2023_ included $30.0 million from a single customer related to a product sale in _December 2023,_ of which $28.5 million is backed by letters of credit from the customer and due in _February 2024._ The remaining $1.5 million of this receivable is classified as non-current and is due in _December 2025._ Credit quality indicators used for the non-current portion of this receivable consisted of historical collection experience, internal credit risk grades and collateral. The Company determines the allowance for credit losses through a review of several factors, including historical collection experience, customer credit worthiness, current aging of customer accounts and current financial conditions of its customers. Trade accounts receivable balances are charged off against the allowance whenever it is probable that the receivable balance will _not_ be recoverable.\n\nAllowance for credit losses related to trade accounts receivable are reflected in the following table (in thousands):\n\n**__Three Months Ended__**  \n---  \n**_December 31, 2023_** |  **_December 31, 2022_**  \nAllowance for credit losses:  \n**Beginning of period** | 125| 591  \nProvision for credit losses | 43| 286  \nRecoveries | (72| )| (166| )  \nWrite-offs | (7| )| (6| )  \nCurrency translation | 3| (16| )  \n**End of period** | $| 92| $| 689  \n  \nThe Company had _one_ note receivable from a customer at _December 31, 2023_ and _September 30, 2023_ with balances of $0.3 million and $1.2 million, respectively. The note originated during the _second_ quarter of fiscal year _2020_ in connection with a $12.5 million product sale with the customer. The note bears interest at 7.0% per year and requires monthly principal and interest payments of $0.3 million. The note was paid in _January 2024._\n\n**_6._ Inventories**\n\nInventories consist of the following (in thousands):\n\n**_December 31, 2023_** |  **_September 30, 2023_**  \n---|---  \nFinished goods | $| 17,895| $| 18,555  \nWork in process | 8,122| 11,992  \nRaw materials | 27,551| 26,832  \nObsolescence reserve (net realizable value adjustment) | (11,697| )| (14,061| )  \n41,871| 43,318  \nLess current portion | 21,839| 18,430  \nNon-current portion | $| 20,032| $| 24,888  \n  \nInventory obsolescence expense was $20,000 and $1.4 million for the  _three_ months ended _December 31, 2023_ and _2022_. Raw materials include semi-finished goods and component parts that totaled approximately $9.9 million and $10.6 million at _December 31, 2023_ and _September 30, 2023_ , respectively. \n\n_10_\n\n**_7._ Rental Equipment**\n\nThe Company leases equipment to customers which generally range from daily rentals to minimum rental periods of up to one year. All of the Company’s current leasing arrangements, which the Company acts as lessor, are classified as operating leases. The majority of the Company’s rental revenue is generated from its marine-based wireless seismic data acquisition systems.\n\nThe Company regularly evaluates the collectability of its lease receivables on a lease-by-lease basis. The evaluation primarily consists of reviewing past due account balances and other factors such as the credit quality of the customer, historical trends of the customer and current economic conditions. The Company suspends revenue recognition when the collectability of amounts due are _no_ longer probable and concurrently records a direct write-off of the lease receivable to rental revenue and limits future rental revenue recognition to cash received. As of _December 31, 2023_ , the Company’s trade accounts receivables included lease receivables of $5.0 million.\n\nRental revenue related to leased equipment for the _three_ months ended _December 31, 2023_ was $6.2 million and $11.5 million, respectively.\n\nFuture minimum lease obligations due from the Company’s leasing customers on operating leases executed as of  _December 31, 2023_ were $6.4 million, all of which is expected to be due within the next _12_ months.\n\nRental equipment consisted of the following (in thousands):\n\n**_December 31, 2023_** |  **_September 30, 2023_**  \n---|---  \nRental equipment, primarily wireless recording equipment | $| 77,571| $| 82,926  \nAccumulated depreciation and impairment | (62,329| )| (61,339| )  \n$| 15,242| $| 21,587  \n  \n**_8._ Long-Term Debt**\n\nThe Company had no long-term debt outstanding at _December 31, 2023_ and _September 30, 2023_.\n\nOn _July 26, 2023,_ the Company entered into a credit agreement (“the Agreement”) with Woodforest National Bank, as sole lender. The Agreement refinanced the Company's credit agreement dated _May 6, 2022,_ with Amerisource Funding, Inc., as administrative agent and as a lender, and Woodforest National Bank, as a lender. The Agreement provides a revolving credit facility with a maximum availability of $15 million. Availability under the Agreement is determined based upon a borrowing base comprised of certain of the Company’s domestic assets which include (i) 80% of eligible accounts, plus (ii) 90% of eligible foreign insured accounts, plus (iii) 25% of eligible inventory plus (iv) 50% of the orderly liquidation value of eligible equipment, in each case subject to certain limitations and adjustments. Interest shall accrue on outstanding borrowings at a rate equal to Term SOFR (Secured Overnight Financing Rate) plus a margin equal to 3.25% per annum. The Company is required to make monthly interest payments on borrowed funds. The Agreement is secured by substantially all of the Company's assets, except for certain excluded property. The Agreement requires the Company to maintain a minimum (i) consolidated tangible net worth of $100 million, (ii) liquidity of $5 million, and (iii) current ratio _no_ less than 2.00 to _1.00,_ in each case tested quarterly. The Agreement also requires the Company to maintain a springing minimum interest coverage ratio of 1.50 to _1.00,_ tested quarterly whenever there is an outstanding balance on the revolving credit facility. The Agreement expires in _July 2025._ At _December 31, 2023_ the Company's borrowing availability under the Agreement was $14.9 million after consideration of a $0.1 million outstanding letter of credit. At _December 31, 2023_ , the Company was in compliance with all covenants under the Agreement.\n\n**_9._ Stock-Based Compensation**\n\nDuring the _three_ months ended _December 31, 2023_ , the Company issued 188,000 restricted stock units (“RSUs”) under its _2014_ Long Term Incentive Plan, as amended. The RSUs issued include both time-based and performance-based vesting provisions. The weighted average grant date fair value of each RSU was $11.77 per unit. The grant date fair value of the RSUs was $2.2 million, which will be charged to expense over the next four years as the restrictions lapse. Compensation expense for the RSUs was determined based on the closing market price of the Company’s stock on the date of grant applied to the total number of units that are anticipated to fully vest. Each RSU represents a contingent right to receive _one_ share of the Company’s common stock upon vesting.\n\nAs of _December 31, 2023_ , there were 421,373 RSUs outstanding. As of _December 31, 2023_ , the Company had unrecognized compensation expense of $3.2 million relating to RSUs that is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 3.1 years.\n\n_11_\n\n**_10._ Earnings (Loss) Per Common Share**\n\nThe following table summarizes the calculation of net earnings (loss) and weighted average common shares and common equivalent shares outstanding for purposes of the computation of earnings (loss) per share (in thousands, except share and per share data):\n\n**__Three Months Ended__**  \n---  \n**_December 31, 2023_** |  **_December 31, 2022_**  \nNet income (loss) | $| 12,679| $| (97| )  \nLess: Income allocable to unvested restricted stock | —| —  \nIncome (loss) attributable to common shareholders for diluted earnings (loss) per share | $| 12,679| $| (97| )  \nWeighted average number of common share equivalents:  \nCommon shares used in basic earnings (loss) per share | 13,251,360| 13,067,991  \nCommon share equivalents outstanding related to RSUs | 209,156| —  \nTotal weighted average common shares and common share equivalents used in diluted earnings (loss) per share | 13,460,516| 13,067,991  \nEarnings (loss) per share:  \nBasic | $| 0.96| $| (0.01| )  \nDiluted | $| 0.94| $| (0.01| )  \n  \nFor the calculation of diluted earnings per share for the _three_ months ended _December 31, 2023_ and _2022_ , there were 212,217 and 382,111 non-vested RSUs, respectively, excluded from the calculation of weighted average shares outstanding since their impact on diluted earnings per share were antidilutive.\n\n**_11._ Commitments and Contingencies**\n\n_Contingent Compensation Costs_\n\nIn connection with the acquisition of Aquana, LLC (“Aquana”) in _July 2021,_ the Company is subject to additional contingent cash payments to the former members of Aquana over a six-year earn-out period. The contingent payments, if any, will be derived from certain eligible revenue generated during the earn-out period from products and services sold by Aquana. There is _no_ maximum limit to the contingent cash payments that could be made. The merger agreement with Aquana requires the continued employment of a certain key employee and former member of Aquana for the _first_ four years of the six year earn-out period in order for any of Aquana’s former members to be eligible for any earn-out payments. Due to the continued employment requirement, _no_ liability has been recorded for the estimated fair value of earn-out payments for this transaction. Earn-outs achieved, if any, will be recorded as compensation expense when incurred. No eligible revenue has been generated to date.\n\n_Legal Proceedings_\n\nThe Company is involved in various pending legal actions in the ordinary course of its business. Management is unable to predict the ultimate outcome of these actions, because of the inherent uncertainty of such actions. However, management believes that the most probable, ultimate resolution of current pending matters will _not_ have a material adverse effect on the Company’s consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.\n\n**_12._ Segment Information**\n\nThe Company reports and evaluates financial information for three operating business segments: Oil and Gas Markets, Adjacent Markets and Emerging Markets. The Oil and Gas Markets segment's products include wireless seismic data acquisition systems, reservoir characterization products and services, and traditional seismic exploration products such as geophones, hydrophones, leader wire, connectors, cables, marine streamer retrieval and steering devices and various other seismic products. The Adjacent Markets segment's products include imaging equipment, water meter products, remote shut-off valves and Internet of Things (IoT) platform, as well as and seismic sensors used for vibration monitoring and geotechnical applications such as mine safety applications and earthquake detection. The Emerging Markets segment designs and markets seismic products targeted at the border and perimeter security markets.\n\nThe following table summarizes the Company’s segment information (in thousands):\n\n**__Three Months Ended__**  \n---  \n**_December 31, 2023_** |  **_December 31, 2022_**  \nRevenue:  \nOil and Gas Markets | $| 39,909| $| 20,148  \nAdjacent Markets | 9,815| 10,822  \nEmerging Markets | 234| 93  \nCorporate | 74| 46  \nTotal | $| 50,032| $| 31,109  \nIncome (loss) from operations:  \nOil and Gas Markets | $| 14,563| $| 2,406  \nAdjacent Markets | 2,034| 1,747  \nEmerging Markets | (625| )| (1,213| )  \nCorporate | (3,135| )| (3,219| )  \nTotal | $| 12,837| $| (279| )  \n  \n_12_\n\n**_13._ Income Taxes**\n\nConsolidated income tax expense for the  _three_ months ended _December 31, 2023_ and _2022_ was $0.1 million and $30,000, respectively. The primary difference between the Company's effective tax rate of 1.4% for the  _three_ months ended _December 31, 2023_ and the statutory rate of 21% is adjustments to the valuation allowance against deferred tax assets.\n\n**_14._ Risks and Uncertainties **\n\n_Concentration of Credit Risk_\n\nAs of _December 31, 2023_ , the Company had combined trade accounts and notes receivable from two customers of $33.6 million and $2.4 million, respectively. $28.7 million of the $33.6 million receivable is backed by letters of credit from the customer and is due in _February 2024._ During the _three_ months ended  _December 31, 2023_ , revenue recognized from these two customers was $31.4 million and $3.5 million, respectively. During the _three_ months _December 31, 2022_ revenue recognized from these two customers was $1.7 million and $2.7 million, respectively.\n\n_COVID-_19_ Pandemic_\n\nThe ongoing COVID-_19_ pandemic has negatively impacted worldwide economic activity and continues to create challenges in the Company’s markets. The COVID-_19_ pandemic and the related mitigation measures have disrupted the Company’s supply chain, resulting in longer lead times in materials available from suppliers and extended the shipping time for these materials to reach the Company’s facilities. The occurrence or a resurgence of global or regional health events such as the _COVID–19_ pandemic, and the related government responses, could result in a material adverse effect on the Company's business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. As such, we continue to closely monitor COVID-_19_ and will continue to reassess our strategy and operational structure on a regular, ongoing basis.\n\n_Oil Commodity Price Levels_\n\nDemand for many of the Company’s products and the profitability of its operations depend primarily on the level of worldwide oil and gas exploration activity. Prevailing oil and gas prices, with an emphasis on crude oil prices, and market expectations regarding potential changes in such prices significantly affect the level of worldwide oil and gas exploration activity. During periods of improved energy commodity prices, the capital spending budgets of oil and natural gas operators tend to expand, which results in increased demand for our customers services leading to increased demand in the Company’s products. Conversely, in periods when these energy commodity prices deteriorate, capital spending budgets of oil and natural gas operators tend to contract causing demand for the Company’s products to weaken. Historically, the markets for oil and gas have been volatile and are subject to wide fluctuations in response to changes in the supply of and demand for oil and gas, market uncertainty and a variety of additional factors that are beyond its control. These factors include the level of consumer demand, regional and international economic conditions, weather conditions, domestic and foreign governmental regulations (including those related to climate change), price and availability of alternative fuels, political conditions, the war between Russia and Ukraine, instability and hostilities in the Middle East and other significant oil-producing regions, increases and decreases in the supply of oil and gas, the effect of worldwide energy conservation measures and the ability of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (\"OPEC') to set and maintain production levels and prices of foreign imports.\n\nCrude oil prices held above $70 per barrel throughout _2023,_ which _may_ result in higher cash flows for exploration and production companies. Any material changes in oil and gas prices or other market trends, like slowing growth of the global economy, could adversely impact seismic exploration activity and would likely affect the demand for the Company's products and could materially and adversely affect its results of operations and liquidity.\n\nGenerally, imbalances in the supply and demand for oil and gas will affect oil and gas prices and, in such circumstances, demand for the Company’s oil and gas products _may_ be adversely affected when world supplies exceed demand.\n\n_13_\n\n_Armed Conflict Between Russia and Ukraine_\n\nA portion of the Company's oil and gas product manufacturing is conducted through its wholly-owned subsidiary Geospace Technologies Eurasia LLC (\"GTE\"), which is based in the Russian Federation. In _February 2022,_ the Russian Federation launched a full-scale military invasion of Ukraine, and Russia and Ukraine continue to engage in active and armed conflict. Although the length and impact of the ongoing military conflict is highly unpredictable, the conflict in Ukraine could lead to market disruptions, including significant volatility in commodity prices, credit and capital markets, as well as supply chain interruptions in addition to any direct impact on the Company's operations in Russia. As a result of the invasion, the governments of several western nations, including the U.S., Canada, the United Kingdom and the European Union, implemented new and/or expanded economic sanctions and export restrictions against Russia, Russian-backed separatist regions in Ukraine, certain banks, companies, government officials, and other individuals in Russia and Belarus. The implementation of these sanctions and exports restrictions, in combination with the withdrawal of numerous private companies from the Russian market, has had, and is likely to continue to have, a negative impact on the Company's business in the region. During fiscal year _2023_ the Company imported $3.8 million of products from GTE for resale elsewhere in the world and since then has imported $0.5 million of products during the _three_ months of fiscal year _2024._ The rapid changes in rules and implementation of new rules on imports and exports of goods involving Russia has also led to material delays in getting goods to or from Russia as port authorities struggle to keep up with the changing environment. If imports of these products from the Russian Federation are restricted by government regulation, the Company _may_ be forced to find other sources for the manufacturing of these products at potentially higher costs. Likewise, restrictions on the Company's ability to send products to GTE, _may_ force our subsidiary to have to find other sources for the manufacturing of these products at potentially higher costs. However, the Company's exports to GTE have historically been limited. Boycotts, protests, unfavorable regulations, additional governmental sanctions and other actions in the region could also adversely affect the Company's ability to operate profitably. Delays in obtaining governmental approvals can affect the Company's ability to timely deliver its products pursuant to contractual obligations, which could result in the Company being liable to its customers for damages. The risk of doing business in the Russian Federation and other economically or politically volatile areas could adversely affect the Company's operations and earnings. It is possible that increasing sanctions, export controls, restrictions on access to financial institutions, supply and transportation challenges, or other circumstances or considerations could necessitate a reduction, or even discontinuation, of operations by GTE or other business in Russia.\n\nThe Company is actively monitoring the situation in Ukraine and Russia and assessing its impact on its business, including GTE. The net carrying value of GTE on the Company's consolidated balance sheet at _December 31, 2023_ was $5.7 million, including cash of $1.8 million. In response to sanctions imposed by the U.S. and others on Russia, the Russian government has imposed restrictions on companies' abilities to repatriate or otherwise remit cash from their Russian-based operations to locations outside of Russia. As a result, this cash can be used in our Russian operations, but we _may_ be unable to transfer it out of Russia without incurring substantial costs, if at all. In addition to the products the Company imported from GTE, the subsidiary generated $1.8 million in revenue from domestic sales in fiscal year _2023_ and has generated $0.3 million from domestic sales during the _first_ _three_ months of fiscal year _2024._ The Company has _no_ way to predict the duration, progress or outcome of the military conflict in Ukraine. The extent and duration of the military action, sanctions, and resulting market disruptions could be significant and could potentially have substantial impact on the global economy and the Company's business for an unknown period of time.\n\n14 \n\n**[](# \"item2\")Item 2. Management** ’**s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations**\n\nThe following is management’s discussion and analysis of the major elements of our consolidated financial statements. You should read this discussion and analysis together with our consolidated financial statements, including the accompanying notes, and other detailed information appearing elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended September 30, 2023. \n\n**Forward-Looking Statements**\n\nThis Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and the documents incorporated by reference herein contain “forward-looking” statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”). These forward-looking statements can be identified by terminology such as “may”, “will”, “should”, “could”, “intend”, “expect”, “plan”, “budget”, “forecast”, “anticipate”, “believe”, “estimate”, “predict”, “potential”, “continue”, “evaluating” or similar words. Statements that contain these words should be read carefully because they discuss our future expectations, contain projections of our future results of operations or of our financial position or state other forward-looking information. Examples of forward-looking statements include, among others, statements that we make regarding our expected operating results, the timing, adoption, results and success of our rollout of our Aquana smart water valves and cloud-based control platform, future demand for our Quantum security solutions, the adoption and sale of our products in various geographic regions, potential tenders for permanent reservoir monitoring systems, future demand for OBX rental equipment, the adoption of Quantum's SADAR®product monitoring of subsurface reservoirs, the completion of new orders for channels of our GCL system, the fulfillment of customer payment obligations, the impact of and the recovery from the impact of the coronavirus (or COVID-19) pandemic, the impact of the current armed conflict between Russia and Ukraine, our ability to manage changes and the continued health or availability of management personnel, volatility and direction of oil prices, anticipated levels of capital expenditures and the sources of funding therefor, and our strategy for growth, product development, market position, financial results and the provision of accounting reserves. These forward-looking statements reflect our current judgment about future events and trends based on the information currently available to us. However, there will likely be events in the future that we are not able to predict or control. The factors listed under the caption “Risk Factors” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023, as well as other cautionary language in such Annual Report and this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, provide examples of risks, uncertainties and events that may cause our actual results to differ materially from the expectations we describe in our forward-looking statements. Such examples include, but are not limited to, the failure of the Quantum and OptoSeis® or Aquana technology transactions to yield positive operating results, decreases in commodity price levels, the continued adverse impact of COVID-19 which could reduce demand for our products, the failure of our products to achieve market acceptance (despite substantial investment by us), our sensitivity to short term backlog, delayed or cancelled customer orders, product obsolescence resulting from poor industry conditions or new technologies, bad debt write-offs associated with customer accounts, inability to collect on promissory notes, lack of further orders for our OBX rental equipment, failure of our Quantum products to be adopted by the border and security perimeter market or a decrease in such market due to governmental changes, and infringement or failure to protect intellectual property. The occurrence of the events described in these risk factors and elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial position, and actual events and results of operations may vary materially from our current expectations. We assume no obligation to revise or update any forward-looking statement, whether written or oral, that we may make from time to time, whether as a result of new information, future developments or otherwise.\n\n**Business Overview**\n\nUnless otherwise specified, the discussion in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q refers to Geospace Technologies Corporation and its subsidiaries. We principally design and manufacture seismic instruments and equipment. These seismic products are marketed to the oil and gas industry and used to locate, characterize and monitor hydrocarbon producing reservoirs. We also market our seismic products to other industries for vibration monitoring, border and perimeter security and various geotechnical applications. We design and manufacture other products of a non-seismic nature, including water meter products, imaging equipment, remote shutoff water valves and Internet of Things (\"IoT\") platform and provide contract manufacturing services. We report and categorize our customers and products into three different segments: Oil and Gas Markets, Adjacent Markets and Emerging Markets. In recent years, the revenue contribution from our Adjacent Markets segment has grown to represent nearly half of our total revenue. This revenue growth is reflective of both our diversification strategy as well a downturn in the Oil and Gas Markets segment at the time.\n\nDemand for our seismic products targeted at customers in our Oil and Gas Markets segment has been, and will likely continue to be, vulnerable to downturns in the economy and the oil and gas industry in general. For more information, please refer to the risks discussed under the heading “Risk Factors” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023.\n\n**Available Information**\n\nWe file annual, quarterly and current reports, proxy statements and other information with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”). Our SEC filings are available to the public over the internet at the SEC’s website at www.sec.gov. Our SEC filings are also available to the public on our website at www.geospace.com. From time to time, we may post investor presentations on our website under the “Investor Relations” tab. Please note that information contained on our website, whether currently posted or posted in the future, is not a part of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q or the documents incorporated by reference in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.\n\n**Products and Product Development**\n\n**Oil and Gas Markets**\n\nOur Oil and Gas Markets business segment has historically accounted for the majority of our revenue. Geoscientists use seismic data primarily in connection with the exploration, development and production of oil and gas reserves to map potential and known hydrocarbon bearing formations and the geologic structures that surround them. This segment’s products include wireless seismic data acquisition systems, reservoir characterization products and services, and traditional seismic exploration products such as geophones, hydrophones, leader wire, connectors, cables, marine streamer retrieval and steering devices and various other seismic products. We believe that our Oil and Gas Markets products are among the most technologically advanced instruments and equipment available for seismic data acquisition.\n\n_Traditional Products_\n\nAn energy source and a data recording system are combined to acquire seismic data. We provide many of the components of seismic data recording systems, including geophones, hydrophones, multi-component sensors, leader wire, geophone strings, connectors, seismic telemetry cables and other seismic related products. On land, our customers use geophones, leader wire, cables and connectors to receive and measure seismic reflections resulting from an energy source into data recording units, which store the seismic information for subsequent processing and analysis. In the marine environment, large ocean-going vessels tow long seismic cables known as “streamers” containing hydrophones that are used to detect pressure changes. Hydrophones transmit electrical impulses back to the vessel’s data recording unit where the seismic data is stored for subsequent processing and analysis. Our marine seismic products also help steer streamers while being towed and help recover streamers if they become disconnected from the vessel.\n\nOur seismic sensor, cable and connector products are compatible with most major competitive seismic data acquisition systems currently in use. Revenue from these products results primarily from seismic contractors purchasing our products as components of new seismic data acquisition systems or to repair and replace components of seismic data acquisition systems already in use.\n\n_Wireless Products_\n\nWe have developed multiple versions of a land-based wireless (or nodal) seismic data acquisition system. Rather than utilizing interconnecting cables as required by most traditional land data acquisition systems, each of our wireless stations operate as an independent data collection system, allowing for virtually unlimited channel configurations. As a result, our wireless systems require less maintenance, which we believe allows our customers to operate more effectively and efficiently because of its reduced environmental impact, lower weight and ease of operation. Each wireless station is available in a single-channel or three-channel configuration.\n\nWe have also developed a marine-based wireless seismic data acquisition system called the OBX. Similar to our land-based wireless systems, the marine OBX system may be deployed in virtually unlimited channel configurations and does not require interconnecting cables between each station. We have two versions of OBX nodal stations: a shallow water version that can be used in depths up to 750 meters and a deepwater version that can be deployed in depths of up to 3,450 meters. Through December 31, 2023, we have sold 13,000 OBX stations and we currently have 24,000 OBX stations in our rental fleet.\n\nIn 2022, we announced the release of a new seismic acquisition product known as Mariner™, a continuous, cable-free, four channel autonomous, shallow water ocean bottom recorder. Mariner is the next generation node designed for extended duration seabed ocean bottom seismic data acquisition. The slim profile nodes, which are part of our shallow water stations, are ideally deployed as deep as 750 meters. The device continuously records for up to 70 days and offers more rapid recharging times. Its slim profile creates space savings on seismic survey vessels, allowing contractors to fit up to 25% more nodes into a download/charge container. Through December 31, 2023, we have sold 7600 Mariner™ nodes.\n\n_Reservoir Products_\n\nSeismic surveys repeated over selected time intervals show dynamic changes within a producing oil and gas reservoir, and operators can use these surveys to monitor the effects of oil and gas development and production. This type of reservoir monitoring requires special purpose or custom designed systems in which portability becomes less critical and functional reliability assumes greater importance. This reliability factor helps assure successful operations in inaccessible locations over a considerable period of time. Additionally, reservoirs located in deep water or harsh environments require special instrumentation and new techniques to maximize recovery. Reservoir monitoring also requires high-bandwidth, high-resolution seismic data for engineering project planning and reservoir management. Utilizing these reservoir monitoring tools, producers can enhance the recovery of oil and gas deposits over the life of a reservoir.\n\nWe have developed permanently installed high-definition reservoir monitoring systems for land and ocean-bottom applications in producing oil and gas fields. Our electrical reservoir monitoring systems are currently installed on numerous offshore reservoirs in the North Sea and elsewhere. Through our acquisition of the OptoSeis® fiber optic sensing technology, we now offer both electrical and fiber optic reservoir monitoring systems. These high-definition seismic data acquisition systems have a flexible architecture allowing them to be configured as a subsurface system for both land and marine reservoir-monitoring projects. The scalable architecture of these systems enables custom designed configuration for applications ranging from low-channel engineering and environmental-scale surveys requiring a minimum number of recording channels to high-channel surveys required to efficiently conduct permanent reservoir monitoring (“PRM”). The modular architecture of these products allows virtually unlimited channel expansion for these systems.\n\nIn the spring of 2023, we released a derivative of the OptoSeis® technology for high temperature downhole applications. The product known as Insight by OptoSeis offers a passive, all-optical downhole sensor network - no electronics downhole - resulting in years long operational lifetime at 150 °C.\n\nIn addition, we produce seismic borehole acquisition systems that employ a fiber optic augmented wireline capable of very high data transmission rates. These systems are used for several reservoir monitoring applications, including an application pioneered by us allowing operators and service companies to monitor and measure the results of hydraulic fracturing operations.\n\nWe believe our reservoir characterization products make seismic acquisition a cost-effective and reliable process for reservoir monitoring. Our multi-component seismic product developments also include an omni-directional geophone for use in reservoir monitoring, a compact marine three-component or four-component gimbaled sensor and special-purpose connectors, connector arrays and cases.\n\nWe have maintained active discussions with potential clients for future PRM systems. During 2022, in coordination with a potential client, we concluded a successful demonstration of our OptoSeis® fiber optic PRM technology in real-world field conditions. This demonstration was a pre-requisite step toward future contract consideration. We have also held discussions and received requests for information from other major oil and gas producers regarding PRM systems. We have not received any orders for a large-scale seabed PRM system since November 2012.\n\n**Adjacent Markets**\n\nOur Adjacent Markets businesses leverage upon existing manufacturing facilities and engineering capabilities utilized by our Oil and Gas Markets businesses. Many of the seismic products in our Oil and Gas Markets segment, with little or no modification, have direct application to other industries.\n\nOur business diversification strategy has centered largely on translating expertise in ruggedized engineering and manufacturing into expanded customer markets. To bolster the solid market share we have established in the water utility market for water meter cables, in fiscal year 2021, we acquired the smart water IoT company, Aquana.\n\n_Industrial Products_\n\nOur industrial products include water meter products, remote shut-off water valves and IoT Platform, contract manufacturing services and seismic sensors used for vibration monitoring.\n\nOur water meter products support the global smart meter connectivity water utility market. Our products provide our customers with highly reliable automated meter-reading and automated meter infrastructure with our robust water-proof connectors. Our field splice kits allow for accelerated repairs once identified.\n\nOur remote disconnect values and water IoT platform allows customers that manage multi-family and commercial properties to monitor their properties for leak and burst events, with real-time notifications, complimented with our remote-shut off to stop water damage. These products also allow water utilities to control and monitor water use remotely, discontinue or limit service without placing its employees in potential harm or danger.\n\nOur robust manufacturing capabilities have allowed us to provide specialized contract manufacturing services for printed circuit board manufacturing, cabling and harnesses, machining, injection molding and electronic system assembly.\n\n15 \n\nOur seismic sensors provide unique high definition, low frequency sensing that allows for vibration monitoring in industrial machinery, mine safety and earthquake detection.\n\n_Imaging Products_\n\nOur imaging products include electronic pre-press products that employ direct thermal imaging, direct-to-screen printing systems, and digital inkjet printing technologies targeted at the commercial graphics, industrial graphics, textile and flexographic printing industries.\n\n**Emerging Markets**\n\nOur Emerging Markets business segment consists entirely of our Quantum business. Quantum’s product line includes a proprietary detection system called SADAR®, which detects, locates and tracks items of interest in real-time. Using the SADAR® technology, Quantum designs and sells products used for border and perimeter security surveillance, cross-border tunneling detection and other products targeted at movement monitoring, intrusion detection and situational awareness. SADAR's technology also provides passive seismic real-time monitoring in emerging energy applications such as Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) and geothermal energy. Quantum's customers include various agencies of the U.S. government including the Department of Defense, Department of Energy, Department of Homeland Security and other agencies as well as energy companies needing real-time monitoring of seismic data.\n\n**Consolidated Results of Operations**\n\nWe report and evaluate financial information for three segments: Oil and Gas Markets, Adjacent Markets and Emerging Markets. Summary financial data by business segment follows (in thousands):\n\n**Three Months Ended**  \n---  \n**December 31, 2023** |  **December 31, 2022**  \n**Oil and Gas Markets**  \nTraditional exploration product revenue | $ | 1,763 | $ | 2,755  \nWireless exploration product revenue | 38,073 | 17,238  \nReservoir product revenue | 73 | 155  \nTotal revenue | 39,909 | 20,148  \nOperating income | 14,563 | 2,406  \n**Adjacent Markets**  \nIndustrial product revenue | 6,443 | 7,930  \nImaging product revenue | 3,372 | 2,892  \nTotal revenue | 9,815 | 10,822  \nOperating income | 2,034 | 1,747  \n**Emerging Markets**  \nRevenue | 234 | 93  \nOperating loss | (625 | ) | (1,213 | )  \n**Corporate**  \nRevenue | 74 | 46  \nOperating loss | (3,135 | ) | (3,219 | )  \n**Consolidated Totals**  \nRevenue | 50,032 | 31,109  \nOperating income (loss) | 12,837 | (279 | )  \n  \n**Overview**\n\nAlthough in an already depressed oil and gas industry, demand further decreased in February 2020 because of the oversupply of crude oil due to failed OPEC negotiations that led to a dramatic drop in crude oil prices when combined with the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. These declines in the demand for oil and gas have caused oil and gas exploration and production companies to experience a significant reduction in cash flows, which have resulted in reductions in their capital spending budgets for oil and gas exploration-focused activities, including seismic data acquisition activities. Crude oil prices held above $70 per barrel throughout 2023; however, a lag in time typically occurs between higher oil prices and greater demand for our Oil and Gas Markets segment products. We believe this lag is the result of exploration and production (“E&P”) companies allocating their cash flow towards shareholder reward initiatives, such as stock buy-back programs and dividend payments, or in debt reduction. We believe this lag is a short-term trend that will continue until E&P companies decide to reinvest capital into exploration activities. As this lag persists, we expect the reduced levels of demand for our Oil and Gas Markets segment products. We also expect our land-based traditional and wireless products will continue to experience low levels of product demand until our customers consume their excess levels of underutilized equipment. As discussed below, we had a $30.0 million wireless product sale to a customer in the first quarter of fiscal year 2024. However, we do not currently anticipate another product sale this large for the remainder of fiscal year 2024.\n\nIn light of current market conditions, the inventory balances in our Oil and Gas Markets business segment at December 31, 2023 continued to exceed levels we consider appropriate for the current level of product demand. We are continuing to work aggressively to reduce these legacy inventory balances; however, we are also adding new inventories for new wireless product developments and for other product demand in our Adjacent Markets segment. During periods of excessive inventory levels, our policy has been, and will continue to be, to record obsolescence expense as we experience reduced product demand and as our inventories continue to age. Although the Oil and Gas Markets segment is seeing a recovery after experiencing difficult market conditions, we have been recording additional expenses for inventory obsolescence and will continue to do so in the future until product demand and/or resulting inventory turnover return to acceptable levels.\n\n16 \n\n**_Armed Conflict Between Russia and Ukraine_**\n\nA portion of our oil and gas product manufacturing is conducted by Geospace Technologies Eurasia LLC, our wholly-owned subsidiary based in the Russian Federation. Consequently, our oil and gas business could be directly affected by the current war between Russia and Ukraine. See Note 14 in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for more information.\n\n**_Coronavirus (COVID-19)_**\n\nThe ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has negatively impacted worldwide economic activity and continues to create challenges in our markets. The COVID-19 pandemic and the related mitigation measures have disrupted our supply chain, resulting in longer lead times in materials available from suppliers and extended shipping time for these materials to reach our facilities. The occurrence or resurgence of global or regional health events such as the COVID-19 pandemic, and the related government responses, could result in a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. As such, we will continue to closely monitor COVID-19 and will continue to reassess our strategy and operational structure on a regular, ongoing basis.\n\n_Three months ended December 31, 2023 compared to the three months ended December 31, 2022_\n\nConsolidated revenue for the three months ended December 31, 2023 was $50.0 million, an increase of $18.9 million, or 60.8%, from the corresponding period of the prior fiscal year. The increase was largely due to a $30.0 million sale of our Mariner™ shallow water ocean bottom nodes, which replaced a rental contract with the customer. The increase was partially offset by (i) a decrease in rental revenue due to lower utilization of our OBX rental fleet and (ii) a decrease in demand for our industrial products from our Adjacent Markets segment. We do not expect this increase in revenue to continue for the remaining three quarters of of fiscal year 2024.\n\nConsolidated gross profit for the three months ended December 31, 2023 was $22.2 million, an increase of $11.7 million, or 111.1%, from the corresponding period of the prior fiscal year. The increase was primarily due to gross profit on its Mariner™ sale. The increase in gross profit was partially offset by (i) the decrease in utilization of our OBX rental fleet and (ii) a higher warranty accrual, primarily related to the Mariner™ sale.\n\nConsolidated operating expenses for the three months ended December 31, 2023 were $9.4 million, a decrease of $1.4 million, or 13.1%, from the corresponding period of the prior fiscal year. The decrease was primarily due to lower personnel costs attributable to our workforce reduction in first quarter of fiscal year 2023, which included $0.4 million in employee termination costs. The decrease was also due to lower research and development project expenditures.\n\nConsolidated other expense for the three months ended December 31, 2023 was $(0.1) million, compared to other income of $0.2 million from the corresponding period of the prior year. The decrease in other income was primarily due to net foreign currency transaction losses. The decrease was partially offset by an increase in interest income attributable to short-term investments.\n\n**Segment Results of Operations**\n\n**Oil and Gas Markets**\n\n_Revenue_\n\nRevenue from our Oil and Gas Markets products for the three months ended December 31, 2023 increased $19.8 million, or 98.1%, from the corresponding period of the prior fiscal year. The components of this increase were as follows:\n\n● |  _Traditional Exploration Product Revenue_ – For the three months ended December 31, 2023, revenue from our traditional products was $1.8 million, a decrease of $1.0 million from the corresponding period of the prior fiscal year. The decrease was primarily due to lower demand for our sensor products.  \n---|---  \n● |  _Wireless Exploration Product Revenue_ – For the three months ended December 31, 2023, revenue from our wireless exploration products increased $20.8 million, or 120.9%, from the corresponding period of the prior fiscal year. The increase was primarily due to a $30.0 million sale of our Mariner™ shallow water ocean bottom nodes, which replaced a rental contract with the customer. The increase was partially offset by a decrease in rental revenue attributable to lower utilization of our OBX rental fleet. We do not expect this increase in revenue to continue for the remaining three quarters of fiscal year 2024.  \n---|---  \n  \n_Operating Income_\n\nOperating income associated with our Oil and Gas Markets products for the three months ended December 31, 2023 was $14.6 million, an increase of $12.2 million from the corresponding period of the prior fiscal year. The increase in operating income was related to gross profits related to the Mariner™ sale. The income was partially offset by lower wireless rental revenue and related gross profits due to a decrease in the utilization of our OBX rental fleet.\n\n**Adjacent Markets**\n\n_Revenue_\n\nRevenue from our Adjacent Markets products for the three months ended December 31, 2023 decreased $1.0 million, or 9.3%, from the corresponding period of the prior fiscal year. The components of this change was as follows:\n\n● |  _Industrial Product Revenue and Services_ – For the three months ended December 31, 2023, revenue from our industrial products decreased $1.5 million, or 18.8%, from the corresponding period of the prior fiscal year. The decrease was primarily due to lower demand for both our water meter products and industrial sensor products.  \n---|---  \n● |  _Imaging Product Revenue_ – For the three months ended December 31, 2023, revenue from our imaging products increased $0.5 million, or 16.6%, from the corresponding period of the prior fiscal year. The increase was primarily due to higher demand for our film products and imaging equipment.  \n---|---  \n  \n_Operating Income_\n\nOperating income from our Adjacent Markets products for the three months ended December 31, 2023 was $2.0 million, a increase of $0.3 million, or 16.4%, from the corresponding period of the prior fiscal year. The increase in operating income was primarily due to margin improvements on both our industrial and imaging products. \n\n17 \n\n**Emerging Markets**\n\n_Revenue_\n\nRevenue from our Emerging Markets products was $0.2 million for three months ended December 31, 2023 compared to $0.1 million from the corresponding period of the prior fiscal year. The increase in revenue primarily due to higher on-going service and maintenance related to our completed contract with the U.S. Customs and Border Protection.\n\n_Operating Loss_\n\nOperating loss from our Emerging Markets products for the three months ended December 31, 2023 was $0.6 million, a decrease of $0.6 million, or 48.5%, from the corresponding period in the prior fiscal year. The decrease was primarily attributable to lower personnel costs attributable to our workforce reduction in the first quarter of fiscal year 2023. \n\n**Liquidity and Capital Resources**\n\nAt December 31, 2023, we had $34.0 million in cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments. For the three months ended December 31, 2023, we generated $2.7 million of cash from operating activities. Sources of cash included our net income of $12.7 million and net non-cash charges of $4.5 million resulting from deferred income taxes, depreciation, amortization, accretion, inventory obsolescence, stock-based compensation and provision for credit losses. Other sources of cash included a (i) $8.0 million decrease in trade accounts and notes receivable payable primarily due to the timing of collections from customers and (ii) $1.2 million increase in other liabilities due to increases in customer deposits and our product warranty accrual, partially offset by lower accrued employee compensation costs. These sources of cash were partially offset by (i) the removal of $19.4 million gross profit from the sale of rental equipment is included in investing activities, (ii) a $0.5 million decrease in accounts payable due to timing of payments to our suppliers and (iii) $4.1 million increase in inventories to meet an increase in demand for our products. \n\nFor the three months ended December 31, 2023, we used cash of $2.7 million in investing activities. Uses of cash included (i) $2.6 million for additions to our equipment rental fleet and (ii) $0.8 million for additions to our property, plant and equipment. Offsetting these uses of cash was $0.6 million of proceeds from the sale of rental equipment. We expect cash investments into our rental fleet will be approximately $5 million in fiscal year 2024. We expect our cash investments in our property, plant and equipment will be approximately $2 million in fiscal year 2024. Our capital expenditures are expected to be funded from our cash on hand, internal cash flows, cash flows from our rental contracts or, if necessary, borrowings under our new credit agreement.\n\nFor the three months ended December 31, 2023 we had no cash flows from financing activities.\n\nOur available cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments was $34.0 million at December 31, 2023, which included $3.3 million of cash and cash equivalents held by our foreign subsidiaries and branch offices, of which $1.8 million was held by our subsidiary in the Russian Federation. In response to sanctions imposed by the U.S. and other countries on the Russian Federation, the Russian government has imposed restrictions on companies' abilities to repatriate or otherwise remit cash from their Russian-based operations to locations outside of Russia. As a result, this cash can be used in our Russian operations, but we may be unable to transfer it out of Russia without incurring substantial costs, if at all. In addition, if we were to repatriate the cash held by our Russian subsidiary, we would be required to accrue and pay taxes on any amount repatriated. During fiscal year 2023, in light of recent volatility in the financial markets, we entered into an IntraFi Cash Service (\"ICS\") Deposit Placement Agreement with IntraFi Network LLC through our primary bank, Woodforest National Bank. The ICS program offers us access to unlimited Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (\"FDIC\") insurance on domestically held cash in excess of $5.0 million, thereby mitigating our risk of falling outside of FDIC coverage limits.\n\nOn July 26, 2023, we entered into a credit agreement (“the Agreement”) with Woodforest National Bank, as sole lender. The Agreement refinanced our credit agreement dated May 6, 2022, with Amerisource Funding, Inc., as administrative agent and as a lender, and Woodforest National Bank, as a lender. The Agreement provides a revolving credit facility with a maximum availability of $15 million. Availability under the Agreement is determined based upon a borrowing base comprised of certain of our domestic assets which include (i) 80% of eligible accounts receivable, plus (ii) 90% of eligible foreign insured accounts, plus (iii) 25% of eligible inventory plus (iv) 50% of the orderly liquidation value of eligible equipment, in each case subject to certain limitations and adjustments. Interest shall accrue on outstanding borrowings at a rate equal to Term SOFR (Secured Overnight Financing Rate) plus a margin equal to 3.25% per annum. We are required to make monthly interest payments on borrowed funds. The Agreement is secured by substantially all of our assets, except for certain excluded property. The Agreement requires us to maintain a minimum (i) consolidated tangible net worth of $100 million, (ii) liquidity of $5 million, and (iii) current ratio no less than 2.00 to 1.00, in each case tested quarterly. The Agreement also requires us to maintain a springing minimum interest coverage ratio of 1.50 to 1.00, tested quarterly whenever there is an outstanding balance on the revolving credit facility. The Agreement expires in July 2025.\n\nAt December 31, 2023 we had no outstanding borrowings under the Agreement and our borrowing base availability under the Agreement was $14.9 million after consideration of a $0.1 million outstanding letter of credit. We were in compliance with all covenants under the Agreement. We do not currently anticipate the need to borrow under the Agreement, however, we may decide to do so in the future, if needed.\n\nOur total available cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments did not significantly change during the three months ended December 31, 2023. Our current accounts receivable includes $28.7 related to our first quarter 2024 Mariner™ sale. We expect to receive these funds in the second quarter of fiscal year 2024. In the absence of future profitable results of operations, we may need to rely on other sources of liquidity to fund our future operations, including executed rental contracts, available borrowings under the Agreement through its expiration in July 2025, leveraging or sales of real estate assets, sales of rental assets and other liquidity sources which may be available to us. We currently believe that our cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments will be sufficient to finance any future operating losses and planned capital expenditures through the next twelve months.\n\nWe do not have any obligations which meet the definition of an off-balance sheet arrangement and which have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial statements or the items contained therein that are material to investors.\n\n18 \n\n**Contractual Obligations**\n\n_Contingent Compensation Costs_\n\nIn connection with the acquisition of Aquana in July 2021, we are subject to additional contingent cash payments to the former members of Aquana over a six-year earn-out period. The contingent payments, if any, will be derived from certain eligible revenue generated during the earn-out period from products and services sold by Aquana. There is no maximum limit to the contingent cash payments that could be made. The merger agreement with Aquana requires the continued employment of a certain key employee and former member of Aquana for the first four years of the six year earn-out period for any of Aquana’s former members to be eligible to any earn-out payments. In accordance with ASC 805, _Business Combination_ s, due to the continued employment requirement, no liability has been recorded for the estimated fair value of contingent earn-out payments for this transaction. Earn-outs achieved, if any, will be recorded as compensation expense when incurred.\n\nSee Note 13 to our consolidated financial statements in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for more information on our contractual contingencies.\n\n**Critical Accounting Estimates**\n\nDuring the three months ended December 31, 2023, there has been no material change to our critical accounting estimates discussed in Item 7 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023.\n\n**Recent Accounting Pronouncements**\n\nPlease refer to Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements.\n\n**[](# \"item3\")Item 3.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, there can be no assurance that our disclosure controls and procedures will detect or uncover all failures of persons within our Company and consolidated subsidiaries to report material information otherwise required to be set forth in our reports.\n\nIn connection with the preparation of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, we carried out an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including the CEO and CFO, as of December 31, 2023, of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures, as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act. Based on that evaluation, the CEO and CFO concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of December 31, 2023.\n\n**Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting**\n\nThere were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act) during the fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2023 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.\n\n19 \n\n**[](# \"part2\")PART II - OTHER INFORMATION**\n\n**[](# \"item6\")Item 6.

Hovering over a tagged fact will highlight (shade) all content related to the tagged fact, and clicking on a tagged fact will reveal its tagging details in the Fact Review Window. Navigation, search and filter options are also provided to easily refine and identify specific types of tagged information.\n\n#####  Fact Review Window\n\nThe Fact Review Window shows the tagging details for the currently selected fact, which is highlighted with a solid blue border. There are four categories of fact detail which can be viewed; an \"N/A\" value indicates there is no available information for the item within the given category:\n\n  * Attributes - All primary information (as applicable) describing the tagged fact including period, sign, decimals, dimensional detail (axes and members), scale, measure and data type.\n  * Labels - Detailed documentation (definition) for the tag used, and other labels.\n  * References - Authoritative reference information (as applicable) for the selected tag.\n  * Calculation - Balance and calculation hierarchy details (numeric non-dimensioned items only).\n\n\n\n#####  Searching\n\nThere are two ways to search the document: FACTS AND SECTIONS. To search information, enter a keyword in a search box and select the magnifying glass icon to return matching results. Search operators \"and\" (via \"AND\" or \"&\") and \"or\" (via \"OR\" or \"|\") are available to further refine a search.\n\n**FACTS**\n\nThe Search Facts box can be used to find tagged facts matching entered keywords. By default, tag name, tag labels, and tagged content are included in Search. Tagged facts matching the search criteria are shown with a yellow-colored (default) shading on the page and appear in the Facts List. Select the \"X\" button to the left of the magnifying glass icon to clear the search.\n\nThe content included in Search can be increased to included tag definitions, dimensions, and authoritative references by selecting the cog / wheel icon to the left of the search box. See Settings for more information.\n\n**SECTIONS**\n\nThe Search Sections box can be used to filter the tagged sections of the financial statements.\n\n#####  Filters\n\nFilters change the number of highlighted facts and items in the fact list by providing several ways to review and pinpoint certain tagged information. Multiple filters can be used at once.\n\n**DATA FILTERS**\n\nThese filter options allow the user to refine the highlighted tagged facts by data type:\n\n  * All - Displays all tagged data (default)\n  * Amounts Only - Numeric facts only\n  * Text Only - Textual facts only\n  * Calculations Only - Numeric facts participating in a calculation only\n  * Negatives Only - Negative Numeric amounts only\n  * Additional Items Only - Tagged facts without a corresponding HTML presentation (i.e., hidden facts) only\n\n\n\n**TAGS FILTER**\n\nThese filters allow the user to refine the highlighted facts by tag type:\n\n  * All - Displays all tagged data (default)\n  * Standard Only- Facts with standard tags from a common taxonomy (e.g., US_GAAP, IFRS, DEI).\n  * Custom Only - Facts with extension \"custom\" tags unique to the entity's document.\n\n\n\n**MORE FILTERS**\n\nAdditional filters that allow user to further refine the highlighted facts:\n\n  * Periods - List of all used context years and reporting periods\n  * Measures - List of all used units of measure (e.g., US Dollars); as applicable\n  * Axis - List of all used axis (dimensions); as applicable (dimensions); as applicable\n  * Scale - List of all used scaled options (e.g., thousands, millions); as applicable\n  * Balance - Debit, credit; as applicable\n\n\n\nMultiple filters work in conjunction with each other. For example, selecting the \"Amounts Only\" Data filter and \"Custom Only\" Tags filter will highlight only numeric tagged facts using custom tags and list them in the fact list. Active filters are displayed in the Filter toolbar as they are selected. Active filters can be removed individually by unchecking or selecting ALL option for each filter, or all at once via the \"Reset All Filters\" option.\n\n#####  Facts List (Results)\n\nOn the toolbar, select the \"count\" to the right of the word Facts (e.g., Facts 234) to reveal the Facts List results - a navigable listing of all currently highlighted tagged facts. The count represents the current number of facts.\n\nBy default, all tagged facts are displayed in the Fact List Results. The list content and count reflects the currently highlighted facts (i.e., both Filters and Search criteria refine the list to match the highlighted tagged facts). Navigation controls are available to move through the list as well as move the current view to the corresponding highlighted fact location automatically. When a fact in the Facts Results List is selected, it will reveal the Fact Review Window.\n\nCertain letters may appear to the right of an item in the Fact Result list to indicate a certain property. If the letter \"A\" appears for a fact, it indicates the fact is additional data (i.e., hidden with potentially no corresponding HTML presentation). If the letter \"C\" appears, the fact is tagged with a custom tag. If the letter \"D\" appears, the fact is tagged with dimensional information.\n\n#####  Sections\n\nThe SECTIONS toolbar item provides a listing of the tagged sections of the Inline document. Sections are divided into three groups:\n\n  * Document & Entity Information\n  * Financial Statements\n  * Notes to the Financial Statements\n\n\n\nBy expanding a group and selecting a section item in the listing, Inline XBRL viewer will navigate to that section. When the Tagged Sections feature is open, the Search Sections box will additionally filter the list of sections to only those sections that match the entered criteria.\n\n#####  Menu\n\n**Information**\n\nThe Information menu item provides additional detail about the current Inline document and customizable viewer settings.\n\n  * Company and Document - Basic company and document information\n  * Tags - Fact and tag (standard and custom) information\n  * Files - Files used\n  * Additional Items - Additional hidden data that's been tagged but potentially does not have a corresponding location in the HTML\n\n\n\n**Save XBRL Instance**\n\nThe Save XBRL Instance menu item allows an XBRL instance document (*.xml) that is extracted from the Inline document to be saved locally for use by software supporting the XBRL format.\n\n**Save XBRL Zip**\n\nThe Save XBRL Zip menu item allows a zip file (*.zip) that contains the as-provided XBRL instance document and related custom taxonomy files to be saved locally.\n\n**Settings**\n\nThe Settings menu item provides the ability to customize Viewer features.\n\n**Tagged Fact Hover**\n\n  * On - Displays the hover fact review window for any tagged fact*\n  * Off - Hides the hover fact review window for any tagged fact (default)\n\n\n\n* May impact performance with certain web browsers.\n\n**Auto Scrolling Position**(This setting will have no effect on IE 10 or Safari) \n\n  * Top - Selecting a fact from the Sections Menu or the Fact Menu will automatically scroll that element to the Top of the Inline XBRL viewer window (default)\n  * Center - Selecting a fact from the Sections Menu or the Fact Menu will automatically scroll that element to the middle of the Inline XBRL viewer window\n\n\n\n**Highlight Colors** (Use the save and reset buttons to save the selected setting or reset to default) \n\n  * Tagged Data - Change the highlight color of the tagged fact border\n  * Search Results - Change the background color of tagged items matching the Search results\n  * Selected Fact - Change the color of highlight border used to identify the currently selected fact\n  * Tag Shading (hover) - Change the color of the shading applied to tagged data on hover\n\n\n\n**Search Options**\n\n  * Match Case - Matches the specific case of the entered Search keyword\n  * Include Labels - Extends Search to include tag labels\n  * Include Definitions - Extends Search to include tag definitions\n  * Include Dimensions - Extends Search to include dimensional detail\n  * Include References - Extends Search to include authoritative reference information. Optionally specify the reference parts to include in the search (e.g., topic, subtopic, section)\n\n\n\n**Help**(this content) \n\n**Version**\n\nIndicates the current build of the Inline XBRL viewer application.\n\nFacts\n\nSelect Page\n\nLoading.\n\nCopy and Paste Below Content.\n\nPrevious Next\n\nSettings\n\nHover over Fact for quick information.

Much of this persists even today as high inflation, weakened supply chains, and military conflicts continue across\nthe globe. Yet, despite such headwinds, the year brought forth some remarkable accomplishments for Geospace. It’s a\ntrue pleasure to report to our shareholders that revenue of $124.5 million for the year reached its highest recorded figure\nsince 2014. As a result, the year ended with an overall net income of $12.2 million, reflecting positive earnings of $0.92 per\nshare.\nLast year, we set forward on an ambitious path toward profitability, outlining multiple key aspects of the plan to\nshareholders. This included the decommissioning and divestiture of older manufacturing equipment, increasing factory\nautomation to meet growing customer demands, consolidating our Houston-based operations into a single location,\nand carefully reducing expenses without compromising operational efficiency. Because of the stellar performance of\nour dedicated employees, focused on these goals, and improved market conditions for our products, we’re incredibly\npleased to have accelerated the execution and implementation of this plan.\nFinancial and Operational Leadership Guided a Profitable Fiscal Year\nIn a direct comparison to last year, revenue of $124.5 million in fiscal year 2023 reflected an impressive increase of almost\n40% over last year’s figure. Fully complementing this operational success were substantive gains on the company’s\nbalance sheet. Not only did we increase stockholder equity by more than $11 million, but we also ended fiscal year 2023\nwith a total of $33.7 million in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments. Combining this with an unused credit\nfacility that holds $13.1 million of available borrowing , our total liquidity, as of September 30, 2023, was $46.8 million.\nOcean Bottom Node Products Prove a Powerful Revenue Generator\nOver the course of the year, our Oil and Gas Markets segment garnered nearly 60% of the company’s total revenue, bringing\nin $74 million. This was primarily achieved through increased utilization and rentals of our ocean bottom nodes. In fact,\nthe company’s total revenue from rentals more than doubled in fiscal year 2023 from last year’s figure. It is very rewarding\nto see the value these products bring to our customers. Similarly, we’ve been pleased with the industry’s reception to our\nnew generation and most innovative seabed nodes, the Mariner™ and the Aquanaut™, for respective shallow water and\ndeep water deployments.\nGEOSPACE TECHNOLOGIES ANNUAL REPORT 2023\n223311220066__GGEEOOSS__IINNSSEERRTT..iinndddd 11 1122//1155//2233 44::5533 PPMM\nDiversification through Adjacent Markets Enriches the Bottomline\nOur Adjacent Markets segment had a record-setting year, generating $49 million in revenue. This represents an overall\nincrease of 25% over last year, where growing sales of our proprietary smart water meter cables and connectors led the\nway. This is one area where our focused efforts to increase automation and factory capacity have yielded significant\nbenefits to our ongoing strategy for revenue diversification. The success of this segment underscores the effectiveness\nof the strategy, which leverages the core engineering and manufacturing competencies into new markets. In the coming\nyears, we expect to see further penetration and expansion into a growing smart city movement and “Industrial Internet\nof Things” (IIOT) product space. The groundwork for this expansion is already underway as exemplified through our\ninvestment in Aquana and its smart water meter valves and peripheral products.\nEmerging Markets Requires Patience\nOur Emerging Markets segment progressed slower than expected, but we remain committed to this path in our\ndiversification strategy. Revenue from this segment increased 70% over last year, reaching $1.2 million through a\ncombination of new and existing government and defense related contracts. At the end of September 2023, a backlog\nof business for the segment stood at nearly $2 million. We’re pleased to support the important technical research taking\nplace with the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), through the application of our Quantum SADAR®\ntechnology. In another application, we believe energy transition efforts will require permanent reliable, robust, and\npersistent monitoring of induced and passive seismic activity in such fields as carbon storage and geothermal energy.\nOur Quantum subsidiary is working closely with our Oil and Gas Markets segment team to offer comprehensive solutions\nto this growing market.\nOffering Gratitude\nWhile the year was fully uplifting and a commercial success, we did experience personal sadness near the end of the year\nwith the passing of our longtime board director, Tina M. Langtry. Serving alongside fellow board members for more than\na decade, Tina’s advice and counsel has been instrumental in our successful strategy and navigation through industry\n2023\nchallenges and emergent victories. Tina’s work ethic, attention to detail, and sharp instincts elevated all who collaborated\nwith her. Well beyond her professional contributions, Tina brought warmth, generosity of spirit, and clever wit into the\nlives she forever gratefully touched.\nConclusion\nAs our new fiscal year begins, we’re enthusiastic about the plans and the paths taken to continue our profitability. We\nbelieve our strong balance sheet and technological leadership will be pivotal to our success in fiscal year 2024. Beyond our\ntechnological endeavors to bolster profitability, we are also dedicated to maintain an innovative and diverse workforce\nat Geospace. This year we saw firsthand how vital our employees were in accelerating our sustained path to profitability.\nWe plan to continue investing in the people behind the products of Geospace to ensure the future of our company and\nprovide the best value to our shareholders.\nWalter “Richard” Wheeler\nPresident & Chief Executive Officer\nGEOSPACE TECHNOLOGIES ANNUAL REPORT 2023\n223311220066__GGEEOOSS__IINNSSEERRTT..iinndddd 22 1122//1155//2233 44::5533 PPMM\n2023\ngrowth\ndiversity\nquality\n223311220066__GGEEOOSS__IINNSSEERRTT..iinndddd 33 1122//1155//2233 44::5533 PPMM\n223311220066__GGEEOOSS__IINNSSEERRTT..iinndddd 44 1122//1155//2233 44::5533 PPMM\nUNITED STATES\nSECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION\nWashington, D.C. 20549\nFORM 10-K\n☒ Annual Report Pursuant to Section 13 or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 for the Fiscal Year Ended\nSeptember 30, 2023\nOR\n☐ Transition Report Pursuant to Section 13 or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934\nCommission file number 001-13601\nGEOSPACE TECHNOLOGIES CORPORATION\n(Exact Name of Registrant as Specified in Its Charter)\nTexas 76-0447780\n(State or Other Jurisdiction of Incorporation or Organization) (I.R.S.

Business\nBusiness Overview\nUnless otherwise specified, the discussion in this Annual Report on Form 10-K refers to Geospace Technologies\nCorporation and its subsidiaries. We principally design and manufacture seismic instruments and equipment. These seismic\nproducts are marketed to the oil and gas industry and used to locate, characterize and monitor hydrocarbon producing\nreservoirs. More recently, we’ve begun marketing our seismic products for energy transition applications such as carbon\nstorage, geothermal and mining. We also market our seismic products to other industries for vibration monitoring, border\nand perimeter security and various geotechnical applications. We design and manufacture other products of a non-seismic\nnature, including water meter products, imaging equipment, offshore cables, remote shutoff water valves and Internet of\nThings (\"IoT\") platform. Additionally, we provide contract manufacturing services, which leverage our capabilities and\nmanufacturing resources. We report and categorize our customers and products into three different segments: Oil and Gas\nMarkets, Adjacent Markets and Emerging Markets. In recent years, the revenue contribution from our Adjacent Markets\nsegment has grown to represent nearly half of our total revenue. This revenue growth in this segment is largely attributable\nto the rise in water utility modernization which includes our waterproof meter connector cable series of products.\nDemand for our seismic products targeted at customers in our Oil and Gas Markets segment has been, and will likely\ncontinue to be, vulnerable to downturns in the economy and the oil and gas industry in general. For more information, please\nrefer to the risks discussed under the heading “Risk Factors.”\nSegment and Geographical Information\nWe report and evaluate financial information for our three business segments: Oil and Gas Markets, Adjacent Markets\nand Emerging Markets. For a discussion of the products sold and markets served by each of our segments, see “Products and\nProduct Development” below. For a discussion of financial information by segment and geographic area, see Note 19 to the\nconsolidated financial statements contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nProducts and Product Development\nOil and Gas Markets\nOur Oil and Gas Markets business segment has historically accounted for the majority of our revenue. Geoscientists use\nseismic data primarily in connection with the exploration, development and production of oil and gas reserves to map potential\nand known hydrocarbon bearing formations and the geologic structures that surround them. This segment’s products include\nwireless seismic data acquisition systems, reservoir characterization products and services, and traditional seismic exploration\nproducts such as geophones, hydrophones, leader wire, connectors, cables, marine streamer retrieval and steering devices and\nvarious other seismic products. We believe that our Oil and Gas Markets' products are among the most technologically\nadvanced instruments and equipment available for seismic data acquisition.\nTraditional Products\nAn energy source and a data recording system are combined to acquire seismic data. We provide many of the components\nof seismic data recording systems, including geophones, hydrophones, multi-component sensors, leader wire, geophone\nstrings, connectors, seismic telemetry cables and other seismic related products. On land, our customers use geophones, leader\nwire, cables and connectors to receive and measure seismic reflections resulting from an energy source into data recording\nunits, which store the seismic information for subsequent processing and analysis. In the marine environment, large ocean-\ngoing vessels tow long seismic cables known as “streamers” containing hydrophones that are used to detect pressure changes.\nHydrophones transmit electrical impulses back to the vessel’s data recording unit where the seismic data is stored for\nsubsequent processing and analysis. Our marine seismic products also help steer streamers while being towed and help\nrecover streamers if they become disconnected from the vessel.\nOur seismic sensor, cable and connector products are compatible with most major competitive seismic data acquisition\nsystems currently in use. Revenue from these products results primarily from seismic contractors purchasing our products as\ncomponents of new seismic data acquisition systems or to repair and replace components of seismic data acquisition systems\nalready in use.\nWireless Products\nWe have developed multiple versions of a land-based wireless (or nodal) seismic data acquisition system. Rather than\nutilizing interconnecting cables as required by most traditional land data acquisition systems, each of our wireless stations\noperate as an independent data collection system, allowing for virtually unlimited channel configurations. As a result, our\n2\nwireless systems require less maintenance, which we believe allows our customers to operate more effectively and efficiently\nbecause of its reduced environmental impact, lower weight and ease of operation. Each wireless station is available in a\nsingle-channel or three-channel configuration.\nWe have also developed a marine-based wireless seismic data acquisition system called the OBX. Similar to our land-\nbased wireless systems, the marine OBX system may be deployed in virtually unlimited channel configurations and does not\nrequire interconnecting cables between each station. We have two versions of OBX nodal stations: A shallow water version\nthat can be used in depths up to 750 meters and a deepwater version that can be deployed in depths of up to 3,450 meters.\nThrough September 30, 2023, we have sold 13,000 OBX stations and we currently have 28,000 OBX stations in our rental\nfleet.\nIn August 2022, we announced the release of a new seismic acquisition product known as Mariner™, a continuous, cable-\nfree, four channel autonomous, shallow water ocean bottom recorder. Mariner is the next generation node designed for\nextended duration seabed ocean bottom seismic data acquisition. The slim profile nodes, which are part of our shallow water\nstations, are ideally deployed as deep as 750 meters. The device continuously records for up to 70 days and offers more rapid\nrecharging times. Its slim profile creates space savings on seismic survey vessels, allowing contractors to fit up to 25% more\nnodes into a download/charge container.\nIn August 2023, we announced the latest in our ocean bottom node product line known as Aquanaut™, a deepwater,\nwireless seismic acquisition node capable of operating for 200 days in water as deep at 3,450 meters.\nReservoir Products\nSeismic surveys repeated over selected time intervals show dynamic changes within a producing oil and gas reservoir,\nand operators can use these surveys to monitor the effects of oil and gas development and production. This type of reservoir\nmonitoring requires special purpose or custom designed systems in which portability becomes less critical and functional\nreliability assumes greater importance. This reliability factor helps assure successful operations in inaccessible locations over\na considerable period of time. Additionally, reservoirs located in deep water or harsh environments require special\ninstrumentation and new techniques to maximize recovery. Reservoir monitoring also requires high-bandwidth, high-\nresolution seismic data for engineering project planning and reservoir management. Utilizing these reservoir monitoring tools,\nproducers can enhance the recovery of oil and gas deposits over the life of a reservoir.\nWe have developed permanently installed high-definition reservoir monitoring systems for land and ocean-bottom\napplications in producing oil and gas fields. Our electrical reservoir monitoring systems are currently installed on numerous\noffshore reservoirs in the North Sea and elsewhere. Through our acquisition of the OptoSeis® fiber optic sensing technology,\nwe now offer both electrical and fiber optic reservoir monitoring systems. These high-definition seismic data acquisition\nsystems have a flexible architecture allowing them to be configured as a subsurface system for both land and marine reservoir-\nmonitoring projects. The scalable architecture of these systems enables custom designed configuration for applications\nranging from low-channel engineering and environmental-scale surveys requiring a minimum number of recording channels\nto high-channel surveys required to efficiently conduct permanent reservoir monitoring (“PRM”). The modular architecture\nof these products allows virtually unlimited channel expansion for these systems.\nIn the spring of 2023, we released a derivative of the OptoSeis® technology for high temperature downhole\napplications. The product know as Insight by OptoSeis offers a passive, all-optical downhole sensor network – no electronics\ndownhole - resulting in years long operational lifetime @ 150 °C.\nIn addition, we produce seismic borehole acquisition systems that employ a fiber optic augmented wireline capable of\nvery high data transmission rates. These systems are used for several reservoir monitoring applications, including an\napplication pioneered by us allowing operators and service companies to monitor and measure the results of hydraulic\nfracturing operations.\nWe believe our reservoir characterization products make seismic acquisition a cost-effective and reliable process for\nreservoir monitoring. Our multi-component seismic product developments also include an omni-directional geophone for use\nin reservoir monitoring, a compact marine three-component or four-component gimbaled sensor and special-purpose\nconnectors, connector arrays and cases.\nWe have maintained active discussions with potential clients for future PRM systems. During 2022, in coordination with\na potential client, we concluded a successful demonstration of our OptoSeis fiber optic PRM technology in real-world field\nconditions. This demonstration was a prerequisite step toward future contract consideration. We have also held discussions\n3\nand received requests for information from other major oil and gas producers regarding PRM systems. We have not received\nany orders for a large-scale seabed PRM system since November 2012.\nAdjacent Markets\nOur Adjacent Markets businesses leverage upon existing manufacturing facilities and engineering capabilities utilized by\nour Oil and Gas Markets businesses. Many of the seismic products in our Oil and Gas Markets segment, with little or no\nmodification, have direct application to other industries.\nOur business diversification strategy has centered largely on translating expertise in ruggedized engineering and\nmanufacturing into expanded customer markets. To bolster the solid market share we’ve established in the water utility market\nfor water meter connectors, in fiscal year 2021, we acquired the smart water IoT company Aquana, LLC (\"Aquana\").\nIndustrial Products\nOur industrial products include water meter products, remote disconnect shut-off water valves and IoT Platform, contract\nmanufacturing services and seismic sensors used for vibration monitoring.\nOur water meter products support the global smart meter connectivity water utility market. Our products provide our\ncustomers with highly reliable automated meter-reading and automated meter infrastructure with our robust water-proof\nconnectors.\nOur remote disconnect values and water IoT platform allows customers that manage multi-family and commercial\nproperties to monitor their properties for leak and burst events, with real-time notifications, complimented with our remote-\nshut off to stop water damage. These products also allow water utilities to re-claim non-revenue water at a lower energy and\nfield service cost through remote control of water service without placing its employees in potential harm or danger.\nOur robust manufacturing capabilities have allowed us to provide specialized contract manufacturing services for printed\ncircuit board manufacturing, cabling and harnesses, machining, injection molding and electronic system assembly.\nOur seismic sensors provide unique high definition, low frequency sensing that allows for vibration monitoring in\nindustrial machinery, mine safety and earthquake detection.\nImaging Products\nOur imaging products include electronic pre-press products that employ direct thermal imaging, direct-to-screen printing\nsystems, and digital inkjet printing technologies targeted at the commercial graphics, industrial graphics, textile and\nflexographic printing industries.\nEmerging Markets\nOur Emerging Markets business segment consists entirely of our Quantum business. Quantum’s product line includes a\nproprietary detection system called SADAR®, which detects, locates and tracks items of interest in real-time. Using the\nSADAR technology, Quantum designs and sells products used for border and perimeter security surveillance, cross-border\ntunneling detection and other products targeted at movement monitoring, intrusion detection and situational awareness.\nQuantum’s customers include various agencies of the U.S. government including the Department of Defense, Department of\nEnergy, Department of Homeland Security and other agencies as well as energy companies needing real-time monitoring of\nseismic data.\nBusiness Strategy\nWe have adopted what we think is a conservative and prudent business strategy which places a focus on sound financial\nmanagement practices, as outlined below. We have not changed our primary focus on continued investment in product\nresearch and development, selective acquisitions and joint ventures.\n● Continue Investment in Product Research and Development – Past periods of revenue growth were primarily\ndriven through our internal development of new products for the oil and gas industry. In past years, our oil and\ngas product innovations included the introduction of borehole seismology tools, land and seabed PRM systems\nand wireless data acquisition systems for both land and marine applications. These innovative technologies are\n4\nthe result of our unceasing investment in research and development initiatives. A majority of our product\nresearch and development cost relates to our product engineers. Our engineering staff have been key to our past\nsuccess, and we intend to continue our tradition of retaining and attracting quality engineering staff by providing\nappropriate compensation and benefits. Going forward, we intend to continue significant investments in product\nresearch and development of new oil and gas technologies as well as products for our other business segments\nin order to diversify and grow our revenue base.\n● Selectively Pursue Acquisitions of Businesses with Technological and Engineering Overlap – The oil and gas\nindustry periodically experiences volatile business cycles requiring us to rapidly increase and decrease our\nbusiness activities to meet the industry’s demand for our products. This industry generally offers equipment\nmanufacturers like us limited visibility into new orders creating challenges for us to manage our manufacturing\ncapacity, workforce, inventories and other working capital challenges. While our primary growth initiative is to\nexpand our oil and gas seismic product offerings, as seen with our acquisition of the OptoSeis® fiber optic\nsensing technology in fiscal year 2019, we may also seek out other business opportunities in adjacent markets\nand emerging markets which complement our existing oil and gas seismic products, engineering and\nmanufacturing capabilities, and company-wide culture. In order to diversify our revenue base and expose us to\ndifferent markets with different business cycles, we have directed these efforts toward businesses outside the\noil and gas industry, as seen with our acquisition of Quantum in fiscal year 2018 and Aquana in fiscal year\n2021.\n● Financial Management – Due to the cyclicality of the oil and gas industry, we have historically managed our\nfinancial risk by limiting or eliminating debt leverage in our balance sheet. While we are not opposed to\nmoderate amounts of short-term debt during favorable business cycles, we choose to minimize our exposure to\nlong-term debt obligations which, in our view, restrict our ability to operate during periodic difficult business\ncycles in the oil and gas industry similar to the recent business environment. We believe this strategy has allowed\nus to continue operations through difficult business cycles without disruption for debt and equity restructuring\nas has been seen among our peers, many of whom have significant long-term debt burdens. In addition, we have\nlimited our investments in capital assets and have liquidated, and made appropriate reserves for, significant\namounts of our inventories and rental fleet assets. We also believe that the value of our common shares\noutstanding will be best served in the long-term by retaining our cash to fund future cash outflows as they\nbecome necessary. In this regard, we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future,\nhowever, during fiscal years 2021 and 2022 we repurchased 841,992 shares of our common stock in open market\ntransactions completing a $7.5 million stock-buy-back program authorized by our board of directors.\nCompetition\nOil and Gas Products\nWe are one of the world’s largest designers and manufacturers of seismic products used in the oil and gas industry. The\nprincipal competitors for many of our traditional seismic products are Sercel (a division of CGG) and INOVA. Furthermore,\nentities in China affiliated with Sercel, as well as other Chinese manufacturers produce low-cost oil and gas seismic products,\nwhich compete with our traditional seismic products.\nThe primary competitors for our land wireless data acquisition systems are SmartSolo, Sercel, INOVA, STRYDE,\nGeophysical Technologies and numerous smaller entities who have introduced similar versions of wireless data acquisition\nsystems. We believe the primary competitors for our marine nodal data acquisition systems are Magseis Fairfield ASA (a\ndivision of TGS), Sercel and InApril AS each of whom utilizes their own proprietary nodal technology.\nMost oil and gas seismic products are price sensitive, so the ability to manufacture these products at a low cost is essential\nto maintain market share. While price is an important factor in a customer’s decision to purchase a land or marine wireless\ndata acquisition system, we believe customers also place a high value on a product’s historical performance and the ongoing\nengineering and field support provided by the product’s manufacturer.\nThe principal keys for success in the seismic instruments and equipment market are technological superiority, product\ndurability under harsh field conditions, reliability, size, weight and customer support. Product deliverability is always an\nimportant consideration for our customers.\n5\nIn general, most customers prefer to standardize data acquisition systems, geophones and hydrophones, particularly if\nthey are used by seismic companies that have multiple crews which are able to support each other. This standardization makes\nit difficult for competitive manufacturers to gain market share from other manufacturers with existing customer relationships.\nOur primary competitors for the rental of our traditional and land wireless seismic equipment are STRYDE, SmartSolo,\nINOVA, and Geophysical Technologies.\nOur primary competitor for our seabed PRM systems is Alcatel-Lucent. Our primary competitors for high-definition\nborehole seismic data acquisition systems are Avalon Sciences Ltd and Sercel.\nOur primary competitors for the new energy or energy transition market are Microseismic, Inc., Namometrics, ISTI and\nESG.\nAdjacent Markets Products\nOur industrial and imaging products face competition from numerous domestic and international specialty product\nmanufacturers.\nEmerging Markets Products\nThe border and perimeter security marketplace is dominated by large integrated system providers such as Boeing, General\nDynamics, Lockheed Martin, Raytheon, Elbit Systems and others. Systems provided by these competitors are generally\nmultifaceted and may include numerous integrated surveillance technologies, including the geophysical sensor and software\nsystems that we have developed. Our sensing technology does not rely on line-of-sight motion detection, which is required\nby cameras and other visual and radio frequency technologies, and thus enables motion-sensing such devices would miss.\nCompetitive geophysical technologies utilizing fiber optic sensing techniques are provided by OptaSense, Fibersensys, Future\nFiber Technologies and other specialty sensor manufacturing firms.\nSuppliers\nWe purchase raw materials from a variety of suppliers located in various countries. We typically have multiple suppliers\nfor our critical materials. In our oil and gas seismic business segment, certain models of our marine wireless products use a\ntiming device manufactured by a single supplier. We currently do not possess the ability to manufacture this component and\nhave no other reliable source for this device. In our Adjacent Markets business segment, we purchase all of our thermal\nimaging film from a single supplier. Beyond this film supplier, we know of no other source for thermal film that performs as\nwell in our imaging equipment. For a discussion of the risks related to our reliance on these suppliers, see “Risk Factors –\nWe Rely on Key Suppliers for Certain Components Used in Our Products.”\nCOVID-19 has disrupted the Company’s supply chain, resulting in longer lead times in materials available from suppliers\nand extended the shipping time for these materials to reach the Company’s facilities. These disruptions could constrain our\nability to provide products to our customers in the time frame they require.\nProduct Manufacturing and Assembly\nOur manufacturing and product assembly operations consist of machining, molding or cabling the necessary component\nparts, configuring these parts along with components received from various vendors and assembling a final product. We\nmanufacture many of our oil and gas seismic products to the specifications required by our customers. For example, we\nassemble geophone strings based on a number of customer choices such as length, gauge, tolerance and color of molded parts.\nUpon completion of our manufacturing and assembly operations, we test our final products to the functional and\nenvironmental extremes of product specifications and inspect the products for quality assurance. Consistent with industry\npractice, we normally manufacture our products based on firm customer orders, anticipated customer orders and historical\nproduct demand. As a result of the steep decline in product demand that began in fiscal year 2014, further accentuated by the\nCOVID-19 pandemic creating a global decline in the demand for oil and gas, also aggravated by global supply shortages of\nelectronic components, we currently hold more than twelve months supply of inventory.\nMarkets and Customers\nOur principal customers for our traditional and wireless seismic products are seismic contractors and, to a lesser extent,\nmajor independent and government-owned oil and gas companies that either operate their own seismic crews or specify\n6\nseismic instrument and equipment preferences to contractors. For our deepwater PRM products, our customers are generally\nlarge international oil and gas companies that operate long-term offshore oil and gas producing properties. Our industrial\nproduct customers consist of specialty manufacturers, research institutions and industrial product distributors. Our imaging\ncustomers primarily consist of direct users of our equipment as well as specialized resellers that focus on the screen-printing\nand flexographic printing industries. Our border and perimeter security customers are primarily government agencies. Our\nsmart water connectivity customers include municipalities, water utilities, water meter manufacturing companies as well as\nasset management firms such as multifamily property owners.\nTwo customers comprised 26.7% and 11.7% of our revenue during fiscal year 2023. One customer comprised 29.3% of\nour revenue during fiscal year 2022. The following table describes our revenue by product type (in thousands):\nYEAR ENDED SEPTEMBER 30,\n2023 2022\nTraditional seismic exploration product revenue ................................................ $ 12,183 $ 6,597\nWireless seismic exploration product revenue .................................................... 60,848 40,667\nSeismic reservoir product revenue ...................................................................... 962 1,877\nIndustrial product revenue ................................................................................... 36,859 25,640\nImaging product revenue ..................................................................................... 12,180 13,531\nBorder & perimeter security product revenue ..................................................... 1,234 711\nCorporate revenue ............................................................................................... 243 230\nTotal revenue ....................................................................................................... $ 124,509 $ 89,253\nIntellectual Property\nWe seek to protect our intellectual property by means of patents, trademarks, trade secrets and other measures. We hold\npatents on geophones, micro-geophones, piezo-electric sensors, seismic data acquisition, in-line retrieval devices and water\nmeter connectors, and we have pending applications on related technology. We do not consider any single patent essential to\nour success. Our patents are scheduled to expire at various dates through 2039. We are not able to predict the effect of any\npatent expiration. We protect our proprietary rights to our technology through a variety of methods, including confidentiality\nagreements and proprietary information agreements with suppliers, employees, consultants and others who may have access\nto proprietary information.\nResearch and Development\nWe expect to incur significant future research and development expenditures aimed at the development of additional\nproducts for each of our business segments. We have incurred company-sponsored research and development expenses of\n$16.0 million and $18.1 million during the fiscal years ended September 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nHuman Capital, Environmental and Social\nIn order to continue to produce the most technologically advanced instruments and equipment available for the industrial,\nborder and perimeter security and seismic data acquisition markets, it is crucial that we continue to attract and retain top\ntalent. To attract and retain talented employees, we strive to make Geospace Technologies Corporation a diverse and safe\nworkplace, with opportunities for our employees to receive educational benefits, cross-function skill-development to grow\nand develop their careers, all supported by competitive compensation and benefits.\nWorkforce Composition - At September 30, 2023, we employed 681 people predominantly on a full-time basis, of which\n451 were employed in the United States, 209 in the Russian Federation and the remainder in the United Kingdom, Canada,\nChina and Colombia. Our professional staff includes geoscientists, electrical and mechanical engineers, accountants,\ncomputer and data scientists, marketing and human resource professionals. 65% of our global workforce is employed in\nmanufacturing, 14% in engineering and 17% in sales and administration. The majority of our employees in the Russian\nFederation belong to a regional union for machine manufacturers. Our remaining employees are not unionized. We have\nnever experienced a work stoppage.\nAs a global manufacturer of high-tech offerings, we believe that a diverse workforce benefits everyone, from our skilled\nworkforce, to our valued clients, to our trusted shareholders and our society. Our domestic workforce make-up includes 29%\nwhite, 34% Asian, 24% Hispanic or Latino, 11% Black or African American, and 2% two or more races. Women in\nmanagerial roles represent 3% of our domestic workforce. We proudly employ veterans of the US Armed Forces, who make\nup 3% of our domestic workforce.\n7\nHealth, Safety and Wellness - The success of our business is fundamentally connected to the well-being of our people.\nAccordingly, we are committed to the health and safety of our employees. We provide our full-time employees and their\nfamilies with access to healthcare programs. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we implemented significant changes\nthat we determined were in the best interest of our employees, as well as the communities in which we operate, and which\ncomply with government regulations. This includes having employees work from home, while implementing additional safety\nmeasures for employees continuing critical on-site work.\nCompensation and Benefits - We provide competitive compensation and benefits programs to help meet the needs of our\nemployees. In addition to salaries, these programs (which vary by country/region and employment classification) include an\nincentive compensation plan, a 401(k) Plan, healthcare and insurance benefits, health savings and flexible spending accounts,\npaid time off, family leave, tuition assistance and on-site services, among others. We use targeted equity-based grants with\nvesting conditions to facilitate retention of personnel, particularly those with critical skills and experience.\nTalent Development - We invest resources to develop the talent needed to remain a leading manufacturer and developer\nof industrial, border and perimeter security and seismic data acquisition products. We provide our employees training\nopportunities and educational benefits to assist in career and skill development. We focus on continuous learning and provide\nfeedback to assist in the development of talent.\nCompany Culture – Our Board of Directors established a Code of Business Conduct applicable to all our employees,\ndirectors and officers and a Code of Ethics for Senior Financial Officers in accordance with applicable U.S. federal securities\nlaws and the NASDAQ Listed Company Manual. The Code of Business Conduct provides guidance on corporate policies\nsuch as anti-harassment, anti-corruption, substance abuse, anti-trust, conflict minerals compliance, international trade\nrestrictions as well as policies against insider trading, conflict of interest and hedging of our common stock. We offer a\nWhistle Blower program designed to protect any employee who reports valid suspicions related to our financial accounting,\ninternal controls or like matters to management without fear of termination or similar repercussions.\nHuman Rights – This year, we introduced a Human Rights Policy Statement which demonstrates our commitment to\nsupporting and promoting human rights that benefit all our stakeholders, including our customers, employees, shareholders,\ninvestors, and the communities in which we live and operate. Our approach is applied in our business operations, across our\nsupply chain and through ethical business conduct. This policy statement promotes a safe and healthy workplace, diversity\nand inclusion, non-discrimination and anti-harassment as well as addresses forced labor, human trafficking, and child labor.\nThe Human Rights Policy Statement is posted to our corporate website and is adhered through our Business Code of Conduct\nand through responsible sourcing practices.\nOur values and ethics serve as the guiding force through which we proactively maintain the highest standards of business\nconduct. Our Core Values guide our corporate policies and practices and promote ethical business conduct and compliance\nwith the law. Our employees understand the importance of applying our Core Values toward their daily best practices.\nAnnually, we hold an internal Core Values survey to inform leadership on the values in action and opportunities to improve.\nGovernance – We pride ourselves on the highly ethical and transparent standards through the governance under our Board\nof Directors.\nBoard Composition - Our Board of Directors is chaired by a highly experienced, independent Director whose position is\nwholly separate and divided from the role of the Chief Executive Officer. Unlike organizations where the two leadership\nroles are intertwined, this distinction helps ensure varying viewpoints designed to deliver improved returns for the\nshareholders we serve and the communities in which we operate.\nBoard Charter Reviews - Every twelve-months, we conduct a Board and Board Committee assessment review to review\nand ensure that the highest quality standards are met.\nExecutive Sessions Without Management - In order to ensure original and independent thought, non-management Board\nmembers meet throughout the year.\nAudit Policies – Our Audit Committee is comprised of trusted members who ensure the integrity of our financial\nstatements, internal controls, compliance with legal and regulatory requirements, as well as the performance of our\nindependent auditor.\n8\nEnterprise Risk Management (\"ERM\") – Our Board of Directors takes an enterprise-wide approach to reviewing each of\nour business segments, which encompass Oil & Gas, Adjacent Markets, and Emerging Markets operations which include our\nSecurity & Surveillance sector. Board members meet regularly to oversee and ensure that company objectives are met,\nshareholder concerns are addressed and ERM policies are maintained.\nEnvironmental – We are committed to zero harm to people, property and the environment. We have an ISO 14001 certified\nenvironmental management system, employed over many health, safety and environmental programs. We do not exist in\nisolation. We strive to pursue a strategy of responsibility that not only encompasses all our activities but addresses the needs\nof our employees, customers, suppliers and our stakeholders. We operate in communities, which have placed their trust in us.\nIn doing this, we aim to better our impact on the environment and society, not only of our business but all businesses and\norganizations with whom we interact. We integrate responsible and sustainable practices throughout our organization. Our\nproducts are designed to not harm individuals, communities or the environment. We pledge to conduct ourselves in a most\nresponsible manner in each community.\nAs a manufacturer, we have a responsibility to reuse or recycle waste materials from our operations. Over the last three\nyears, we have recycled more than 263 tons of recyclable materials. Year to date 2023, we have recycled over 174 tons of\nmanufacturing waste materials. This includes production recyclable materials (aluminum, brass, copper, stainless steel, steel,\nand titanium as well as armored cable, film, lithium batteries, PCB boards and solder paste) plus paper, plastic, cardboard\nand e-waste (electronics).\nWe produce an Environmental, Society and Governance (ESG) report annually which is made public on our website.\nFinancial Information by Segment and Geographic Area\nFor a discussion of financial information by segment and geographic area, see Note 19 to the consolidated financial\nstatements contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. For a description of risks attendant to our foreign operations,\nplease see “Risk Factors - Our Foreign Subsidiaries and Foreign Marketing Efforts Are Subject to Additional Political,\nEconomic, Legal and Other Uncertainties Not Generally Associated with Domestic Operations and The Ongoing Armed\nConflict Between Russia and Ukraine Could Adversely Affect Our Business, Financial Condition, and Results of Operations\".\nAvailable Information\nWe file annual, quarterly and special reports, proxy statements and other information with the Securities and Exchange\nCommission (“SEC”). Our SEC filings are available to the public over the internet at the SEC’s website at www.sec.gov. Our\nSEC filings are also available to the public free of charge on our website at www.geospace.com. Please note that information\ncontained on our website, whether currently posted or posted in the future, is not a part of this Annual Report on Form 10-K\nor the documents incorporated by reference in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nItem 1A. Risk Factors\nIn evaluating the Company’s business, you should consider the following discussion of risk factors, in addition to other\ninformation contained in this report and in the Company’s other public filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange\nCommission. Any such risks could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations,\ncash flow and prospects. However, the risks described below are not the only risks facing us. Additional risks and\nuncertainties not currently known to us or those we currently view to be immaterial may also materially and adversely affect\nour business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and prospects.\nExternal Factors that Could Adversely Affect Us\nThe Ongoing COVID-19 Pandemic Has Significantly Impacted Worldwide Economic Conditions and Could Have a\nMaterial Adverse Effect on Our Operations and Business.\nThe ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has negatively impacted worldwide economic activity and continues to create\nchallenges in our markets. The COVID-19 pandemic and the related mitigation measures have disrupted our supply chain,\nresulting in longer lead times in materials available from suppliers and extended shipping time for these materials to reach\nour facilities. The occurrence or resurgence of global or regional health events such as the COVID-19 pandemic, and the\nrelated government responses, could result in a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of\n9\noperations and liquidity. As such, we will continue to closely monitor COVID-19 and will continue to reassess our strategy\nand operational structure on a regular, ongoing basis.\nOil Commodity Price Levels Could Affect Demand for Our Oil and Gas Products, Which Could Materially and Adversely\nAffect Our Results of Operations and Liquidity.\nDemand for many of our products and the profitability of our operations depend primarily on the level of worldwide oil\nand gas exploration activity. Prevailing oil and gas prices, with an emphasis on crude oil prices, and market expectations\nregarding potential changes in such prices significantly affect the level of worldwide oil and gas exploration activity. During\nperiods of improved energy commodity prices, the capital spending budgets of oil and natural gas operators tend to expand,\nwhich results in increased demand for our customers services leading to increased demand in our products. Conversely, in\nperiods when these energy commodity prices deteriorate, capital spending budgets of oil and natural gas operators tend to\ncontract causing demand for our products to weaken. Historically, the markets for oil and gas have been volatile and are\nsubject to wide fluctuations in response to changes in the supply of and demand for oil and gas, market uncertainty and a\nvariety of additional factors that are beyond our control. These factors include the level of consumer demand, regional and\ninternational economic conditions, weather conditions, domestic and foreign governmental regulations (including those\nrelated to climate change), price and availability of alternative fuels, political conditions, the war between Russia and Ukraine,\ninstability and hostilities in the Middle East and other significant oil-producing regions, increases and decreases in the supply\nof oil and gas, the effect of worldwide energy conservation measures and the ability of the Organization of Petroleum\nExporting Countries (\"OPEC\") to set and maintain production levels and prices of foreign imports.\nCrude oil prices held above $65 per barrel throughout 2022 and through September 2023, which may result in higher cash\nflows for exploration and production companies. Any material changes in oil and gas prices or other market trends, like\nslowing growth of the global economy, could adversely impact seismic exploration activity and would likely affect the\ndemand for the Company's products and could materially and adversely affect its results of operations and liquidity.\nGenerally, imbalances in the supply and demand for oil and gas will affect oil and gas prices and, in such circumstances,\ndemand for our oil and gas products may be adversely affected when world supplies exceed demand.\nThe Ongoing Armed Conflict Between Russia and Ukraine Could Adversely Affect Our Business, Financial Condition,\nand Results of Operations, including our ability to repatriate cash from Russia.\nA portion of our oil and gas product manufacturing is conducted through our wholly-owned subsidiary, Geospace\nTechnologies Eurasia LLC (\"GTE\"), which is based in the Russian Federation. In February 2022, the Russian Federation\nlaunched a full-scale military invasion of Ukraine, and Russia and Ukraine continue to engage in active and armed conflict\nas of November 2022. Although the length and impact of the ongoing military conflict is highly unpredictable, the conflict\nin Ukraine could lead to market disruptions, including significant volatility in commodity prices, credit and capital markets,\nas well as supply chain interruptions in addition to any direct impact on our operations in Russia. As a result of the invasion,\nthe governments of several western nations, including the U.S., Canada, the United Kingdom and the European Union,\nimplemented new and/or expanded economic sanctions and export restrictions against Russia, Russian-backed separatist\nregions in Ukraine, certain banks, companies, government officials, and other individuals in Russia and Belarus. The\nimplementation of these sanctions and export restrictions, in combination with the withdrawal of numerous private companies\nfrom the Russian market, has had, and is likely to continue to have, a negative impact on the company’s business in the\nregion. During fiscal year 2023, we imported $3.8 million of products from GTE for resale elsewhere in the world. The rapid\nchanges in rules and implementation of new rules on imports and exports of goods involving Russia has also led to serious\ndelays in getting goods to or from Russia as port authorities struggle to keep up with the changing environment. If imports of\nthese products from the Russian Federation are restricted by government regulation, we may be forced to find other sources\nfor the manufacturing of these products at potentially higher costs. Likewise, restrictions on our ability to send products to\nour subsidiary in Russia may force our subsidiary to have to find other sources for the manufacturing of these products at\npotentially higher costs; however, our exports to GTE have historically been limited. Boycotts, protests, unfavorable\nregulations, additional governmental sanctions and other actions in the region could also adversely affect our ability to operate\nprofitably. Delays in obtaining governmental approvals can affect our ability to timely deliver our products pursuant to\ncontractual obligations, which could result in us being liable to our customers for damages. The risk of doing business in the\nRussian Federation and other economically or politically volatile areas could adversely affect our operations and earnings. It\nis possible that increasing sanctions, export controls, restrictions on access to financial institutions, supply and transportation\nchallenges, or other circumstances or considerations could necessitate a reduction, or even discontinuation, of operations by\nGTE or other business in Russia.\n10\nWe are actively monitoring the situation in Ukraine and Russia and assessing its impact on our business, including GTE.\nThe net carrying value of GTE on our consolidated balance sheet at September 30, 2023 was $5.8 million, including cash of\n$2.5 million. In response to sanctions imposed by the U.S. and others on Russia, the Russian government has imposed\nrestrictions on companies’ abilities to repatriate or otherwise remit cash from their Russian-based operations to locations\noutside of Russia. As a result, this cash can be used in our Russian operations, but we may be unable to transfer it out of\nRussia without incurring substantial costs, if at all. In addition to the $3.8 million of products we imported from GTE in\nfiscal year 2023, the subsidiary generated $1.8 million in revenue from domestic sales in fiscal year 2023. We have no way\nto predict the duration, progress or outcome of the military conflict in Ukraine. The extent and duration of the military action,\nsanctions, and resulting market disruptions could be significant and could potentially have substantial impact on the global\neconomy and our business for an unknown period of time.\nOur Foreign Subsidiaries and Foreign Marketing Efforts Are Subject to Additional Political, Economic, Legal and Other\nUncertainties Not Generally Associated with Domestic Operations.\nBased on customer billing data, revenue to customers outside the United States accounted for approximately 50% of our\nrevenue during fiscal year 2023; however, we believe the percentage of revenue outside the United States is likely higher\nsince many of our products are first delivered to a domestic location and ultimately shipped to a foreign location. We again\nexpect revenue outside of the United States to represent a substantial portion of our revenue for fiscal year 2024 and\nsubsequent years.\nForeign revenue is subject to special risks inherent in doing business outside of the United States, including the risk of\nwar, terrorist activities, civil disturbances, embargo and government activities, shifting foreign attitudes about conducting\nbusiness activities with the United States, restrictions of the movement and exchange of funds, inhibitions of our ability to\ncollect accounts receivable or repossess our rental equipment, international sanctions, expropriation and nationalization of\nour assets or those of our customers, currency fluctuations, devaluations and conversion restrictions, confiscatory taxation or\nother adverse tax policies and governmental actions that may result in the deprivation of our contractual rights, all of which\nmay disrupt markets or our operations.\nForeign revenue is also generally subject to the risk of compliance with additional laws, including tariff regulations and\nimport and export restrictions. International revenue transactions for our products containing hydrophones require prior U.S.\ngovernment approval in the form of an export license, which may be withheld by the U.S. government based upon factors\nwhich we cannot predict.\nWe may experience difficulties in connection with future foreign revenue. Additionally, due to foreign laws and\nrestrictions, should we experience substantial growth in certain foreign markets, for example in the Russian Federation, we\nmay not be able to transfer cash balances to the United States to assist with debt servicing or other obligations.\nIncreases in Tariffs, Trade Restrictions or Taxes on our Products Could Have an Adverse Impact on our Operations.\nIn fiscal year 2023, customers outside the United States accounted for approximately 50% of our revenues. We also\npurchase a portion of our raw materials from suppliers in China and other foreign countries. The commerce we conduct in\nthe international marketplace makes us subject to tariffs, trade restrictions and other taxes when the raw materials we\npurchase, and the products we ship, cross international borders. Trade tensions between the United States and China, as well\nas those between the U.S. and Canada, Mexico and other countries have been escalating in recent years. Trade tensions have\nled to a series of tariffs imposed by the U.S. on imports from China, as well as retaliatory tariffs imposed by China on imports\nfrom the U.S. If the U.S. and China are able to negotiate the issues to restore a mutually advantageous and fair trading regime,\nthe increased tariffs could be eliminated. Certain raw materials we purchase from China are subject to these tariffs which has\nincreased our manufacturing costs. Products we sell into certain foreign markets could also become subject to similar\nretaliatory tariffs, making the products we sell uncompetitive to similar products not subjected to such import tariffs. Further\nchanges in U.S. trade policies, tariffs, taxes, export restrictions or other trade barriers, or restrictions on raw materials\nincluding rare earth minerals, may limit our ability to produce products, increase our manufacturing costs, decrease our profit\nmargins, reduce the competitiveness of our products, or inhibit our ability to sell products or purchase raw materials, which\ncould have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial conditions.\nClimate Change and Legislation Designed to Reduce Climate Change\nThe physical and regulatory effects of climate change could have a negative impact on our operations, our customers’\noperations and the overall demand for our customers’ products and, accordingly, our services. There is an increasing focus\nof local, state, regional, national and international regulatory bodies on Greenhouse Gas (\"GHG\") emissions and climate\n11\nchange issues. Legislation to regulate GHG emissions has periodically been introduced in the U.S. Congress, and there has\nbeen a wide-ranging policy debate, both in the United States and internationally, regarding the impact of these gases and\npossible means for their regulation. These efforts have included consideration of cap-and-trade programs, carbon taxes, GHG\nreporting and tracking programs and regulations that directly limit GHG emissions from certain sources. Some of the\nproposals would require industries to meet stringent new standards that would require substantial reductions in carbon\nemissions. Those reductions could be costly and difficult to implement. In the absence of federal GHG-limiting legislation,\nthe EPA has determined that GHG emissions present a danger to public health and the environment and has adopted\nregulations that, among other things, establish construction and operating permit reviews for GHG emissions from certain\nlarge stationary sources, require the monitoring and annual reporting of GHG emissions from certain oil and natural gas\nsystem sources, implement Clean Air Act emission standards directing the reduction of methane emissions from certain new,\nmodified, or reconstructed facilities in the oil and natural gas sector, and together with the DOT, implement GHG emissions\nlimits on vehicles manufactured for operation in the United States.\nIn April 2016, the United States signed the Paris Agreement, which requires countries to review and “represent a\nprogression” in their nationally determined contributions, which set emissions reduction goals, every five years. Under the\nParis Agreement, the Biden Administration has committed the United States to reducing its greenhouse gas emissions by 50-\n52% from 2005 levels by 2030. In November 2021, the Unites States and other countries entered into the Glasgow Climate\nPact, which includes a range of measures designed to address climate change, including, but not limited to the phase-out of\nfossil fuel subsidies, reducing methane emissions 30% by 2030, and cooperating toward the advancement of the development\nof clean energy. Several states and geographic regions in the United States have also adopted legislation and regulations to\nreduce emissions of GHGs, including cap and trade regimes and commitments to contribute to meeting the goals of the Paris\nAgreement.\nGovernmental, scientific, and public concern over the threat of climate change arising from GHG emissions has resulted\nin increasing political risks in the United States. President Biden and Congress have identified climate change as a priority,\nand it is likely that additional executive orders, regulatory action, and/or legislation targeting greenhouse gas emissions, or\nprohibiting or restricting oil and gas development activities in certain areas, will be proposed and/or promulgated during the\nBiden Administration. President Biden issued an executive order imposing a moratorium on new oil and gas leasing on federal\nlands and offshore waters pending completion of a comprehensive review and reconsideration of federal oil and gas permitting\nand leasing practices. President Biden’s order also establishes climate change as a primary foreign policy and national security\nconsideration, affirms that achieving net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by or before midcentury is a critical priority, affirms\nthe Biden Administration’s desire to establish the United States as a leader in addressing climate change, generally further\nintegrates climate change and environmental justice considerations into government agencies’ decision-making, and\neliminates fossil fuel subsidies, among other measures. Other actions impacting oil and natural gas production activities that\ncould be pursued by the Biden administration may include more restrictive requirements for the establishment of pipeline\ninfrastructure or the permitting of liquified natural gas export facilities.\nIt is not possible at this time to predict the timing and effects of climate change or whether additional climate-related\nlegislation, regulations or other measures will be adopted at the local, state, regional, national and international levels.\nHowever, continued efforts by governments and non-governmental organizations to reduce GHG emissions appear likely,\nand additional legislation, regulation or other measures that control or limit GHG emissions or otherwise seek to address\nclimate change could adversely affect our customers and our business. Because our business depends on the level of oil\nexploration, existing or future laws or regulations related to GHGs and climate change, including incentives to conserve\nenergy or use alternative energy sources, our business could be negatively impacted if such laws or regulations reduce demand\nfor our customers’ products and, accordingly, our services.\nThese political, litigation, and financial risks may result in our customers restricting or cancelling exploration or\nproduction activities which also could reduce demand for our products and services. In addition to regulatory impacts, the\noccurrence of weather events caused or exacerbated by climate change could impact local, national or global commodity\ndemand or availability in ways that could be material to our business and/or the business of our customers.\nWe Operate in Highly Competitive Markets and Our Competitors May Be Able to Provide Newer or Better Products Than\nWe Are Able to Provide\nThe markets for most of our products are highly competitive. Many of our existing and potential competitors have\nsubstantially greater marketing, financial and technical resources than we do. Some competitors currently offer a broader\nrange of instruments and equipment for sale than we do and may offer financing arrangements to customers on terms that we\nmay not be able to match. In addition, new competitors may enter the market and competition could intensify.\n12\nRevenue from our products may not continue at current volumes or prices if current competitors or new market entrants\nintroduce new products with better features, performance, price or other characteristics than our products. Competitive\npressures or other factors may also result in significant price competition that could have a material adverse effect on our\nresults of operations.\nA General Downturn in the Economy in Future Periods May Adversely Affect Our Business.\nEconomic slowdowns, currently or in the future, in the United States, China or India, could adversely affect our business\nin ways that we cannot predict. During times of economic slowdown, our customers may reduce their capital expenditures\nand defer or cancel pending projects and product orders. Such developments occur even among customers that are not\nexperiencing financial difficulties. During times of economic slowdowns, some of our customers have (and other customers\nmay have) undergone restructuring or bankruptcy that has or could adversely impact our revenues and profitability. Any\neconomic downturn may adversely affect the demand for oil and gas generally or cause volatility in oil and gas commodity\nprices and, therefore, adversely affect the demand for delivery of our oil and gas products. It could also adversely affect the\ndemand for consumer and industrial products, which could in turn adversely affect our Adjacent Markets business segment.\nTo the extent these factors adversely affect other companies in the industries we serve, there could be an oversupply of\nproducts and services and downward pressure on pricing for our products and services, which could adversely affect us.\nAdditionally, bankruptcies or financial difficulties among our oil and gas customers could reduce our cash flows and\nadversely impact our liquidity and profitability. For a discussion of the customers of our oil and gas products, see “The\nLimited Market for Our Oil and Gas Products Can Affect Our Revenue,” below.\nRisks Associated with Our Business Strategy and Operations\nOur New Products Require a Substantial Investment by Us in Research and Development Expense and May Not Achieve\nMarket Acceptance.\nOur outlook and assumptions are based on various macro-economic factors and internal assessments, and actual market\nconditions could vary materially from those assumed. In recent years, we have incurred significant expenditures to fund our\nresearch and development efforts, and we intend to continue those expenditures in the future. However, research and\ndevelopment is by its nature speculative, and we cannot assure that these expenditures will result in the development of new\nproducts or services or that any new products and services we have developed recently or may develop in the future will be\ncommercially marketable or profitable to us. In particular, we have incurred substantial expenditures to develop our oil and\ngas nodal seismic data acquisition systems, as well as other products for PRM applications. In addition, we try to use some\nof our capabilities to supply products to new adjacent and emerging markets. We cannot assure that we will realize our\nexpectations regarding acceptance of and revenue generated by our new products and services in existing or new markets.\nThe Short-Term Nature of Our Order Backlog for Sales of Our Oil and Gas Products and Delayed or Canceled Customer\nOrders May Cause Us to Experience Fluctuations in Quarterly Results of Operations.\nHistorically, the rate of new orders for the sale of our oil and gas products has varied substantially from quarter to quarter.\nMoreover, we typically operate, and expect to continue operating, on the basis of orders in-hand for our products before we\ncommence substantial manufacturing “runs.” The short-term nature of our order backlog for most of our oil and gas products\ngenerally does not allow us to predict with any accuracy demand for our products more than approximately three months in\nadvance. Thus, our ability to replenish orders and the completion of orders, particularly large orders for deep water PRM\nprojects, can significantly impact our operating results and cash flow for any quarter, and results of operations for any one\nquarter may not be indicative of results of operations for future quarters.\nAdditionally, customers can delay or even cancel orders and rental contracts before product delivery occurs. For larger\norders which generally require us to make a substantial capital investment in our inventories or rental fleet, we attempt to\nnegotiate for a non-refundable deposit or cancellation penalties depending on our relationship with the customer. However,\nsuch deposits or penalties, even when obtained, may not fully compensate us for our inventory investment and forgone profits\nif the order is ultimately cancelled.\nThese periodic fluctuations in our operating results and the impact of any order delays/cancellations could adversely affect\nour stock price.\n13\nOur Credit Risk Could Increase and We May Incur Bad Debt Write-Offs If Our Customers Continue to Face Difficult\nEconomic Circumstances.\nWhile we believe that our allowance for bad debts is adequate in light of known circumstances, additional amounts\nattributable to uncollectible accounts and notes receivable and bad debt write-offs may have a material adverse effect on our\nfuture results of operations. Many of our oil and gas customers are not well capitalized and as a result cannot always pay our\ninvoices when due. We have in the past incurred write-offs in our accounts and notes receivable due to customer credit\nproblems. We have found it necessary from time to time to extend trade credit, including promissory notes, to long-term\ncustomers and others where some risks of non-payment exist. Many of our oil and gas customers continue to experience\nsignificant liquidity difficulties, which increase those credit risks, due to prolonged periods of low crude oil prices. An\nincrease in the level of bad debts and any deterioration in our credit risk could adversely affect the price of our stock. In\naddition, we rent equipment to our oil and gas customers who utilize such equipment in various countries around the world.\nIf these customers experience financial difficulties, it could be difficult or impossible to retrieve our rental equipment from\nforeign countries.\nThe Industries in Which We Operate are Characterized by Rapid Technological Development and Product Obsolescence,\nWhich May Affect Our Ability to Provide Product Enhancements or New Products on a Timely and Cost-Effective Basis.\nOur instruments and equipment are constantly undergoing rapid technological improvement. Our future success depends\non our ability to continue to:\n● improve our existing product lines,\n● address the increasingly sophisticated needs of our customers,\n● maintain a reputation for technological leadership,\n● maintain market acceptance of our products,\n● anticipate changes in technology and industry standards,\n● respond to technological developments on a timely basis and\n● develop new markets for our products and capabilities.\nCurrent competitors or new market entrants may develop new technologies, products or standards that could render our\nproducts obsolete. We cannot assure you that we will be successful in developing and marketing, on a timely and cost-\neffective basis, product enhancements or new products that respond to technological developments, that are accepted in the\nmarketplace or that comply with new industry standards. Additionally, in anticipation of customer product orders, from time\nto time we acquire substantial quantities of inventories, which if not sold or integrated into products within a reasonable\nperiod of time, could become obsolete. In such case, we would be required to impair the value of such inventories on our\nbalance sheet.\nThe Limited Market for Our Oil and Gas Markets and Emerging Markets' Products Can Affect Our Revenue.\nIn our Oil and Gas Markets segment, we generally market many of our products to seismic service contractors. We\nestimate that fewer than 30 oil and gas seismic contracting companies are currently operating in countries other than those\noperating in the Russian Federation and the former Soviet Union, India, the People’s Republic of China and certain Eastern\nEuropean countries, where such information is difficult to verify. We estimate that fewer than 15 seismic contractors are\nengaged in marine seismic exploration activities. Due to these market factors, a relatively small number of customers, some\nof whom are experiencing financial difficulties, account for most of our oil and gas product revenue. From time to time, these\ncontractors have sought to vertically integrate and acquire our competitors, which has influenced their supplier decisions\nbefore and after such transactions. In addition, consolidation among our customers may further concentrate our business to a\nlimited number of customers and expose us to increased risks related to dependence on a small number of customers. We\nmarket our seabed PRM systems' products to large oil and gas companies. Since this product’s introduction in 2002, we have\nreceived system orders from three offshore oil and gas operators: BP, Shell and Equinor, which have accounted for a\nsignificant portion of our revenue in fiscal year 2014 and prior fiscal years. We have not received any orders for large-scale\nseabed PRM systems since November 2012. Our emerging markets segment primarily sells its products to a small number of\nagencies within the U.S. government. The loss of a small number of these customers, and particularly our oil and gas\ncustomers, could materially and adversely impact our future revenues.\n14\nWe Cannot Be Certain of the Effectiveness of Patent Protection on Our Products.\nWe hold and from time to time apply for certain patents relating to some of our products. We cannot assure you that our\npatents will prove enforceable or free of challenge, that any patents will be issued for which we have applied or that\ncompetitors will not develop functionally similar technology outside the protection of any patents we have or may obtain.\nOur Strategy of Renting Our Oil and Gas Seismic Products Exposes Us to Additional Risks Relating to Equipment\nRecovery, Rental Renewals, Technological Obsolescence and Impairment of Assets.\nOur rental fleet of oil and gas seismic equipment represents a significant portion of our assets and accounts for a significant\nportion of our revenue. Equipment we rent to our customers is frequently located in foreign countries where retrieval of the\nequipment after the termination of the rental agreement is difficult or impossible if the customer does not return the\nequipment. The costs associated with retrieving this equipment or the loss of equipment that is not retrieved could be\nsignificant and could adversely affect our operations and earnings.\nThe advancement of seismic technology having a significant competitive advantage over the equipment in our rental fleet\ncould have an adverse effect on our ability to profitably rent and/or sell this equipment. Significant improvements in\ntechnology may also require us to record asset impairment charges to write-down the value of our rental fleet investment and\nto invest significant sums to upgrade or replace our rental fleet with newer equipment demanded by our customers. In addition,\nrental contracts may not be renewed for equipment in our rental fleet. Significant technology improvements by our\ncompetitors could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and earnings.\nOur equipment rental business has high fixed costs, which primarily consist of depreciation expenses. In periods of\ndeclining rental revenue, these fixed costs generally do not decline. As a result, any significant decline in rental revenue\ncaused by reduced demand could adversely affect our results of operations.\nOur Expansion into the Border and Perimeter Security Market May Not Be Successful.\nWe have not previously operated in the border and perimeter security marketplace prior to our 2018 acquisition of\nQuantum. Quantum is also a relatively recent entrant into this marketplace, and Quantum was not cash-flow positive when\nwe acquired it. In fiscal year 2021, we completed our first contract with the U.S. Customs and Border Protection (“CBP”),\nexcept for on-going service and maintenance. While we will continue to devote management time and resources, financial\nand otherwise, to develop our business in this marketplace, our lack of experience in this market makes it difficult to estimate\nour financial returns from this business. In addition, some of the customers for this business will be governmental entities\nand contracting with those entities can be difficult, costly, and unpredictable. We do not have extensive experience in\ngovernment contracting, and so we may not win, retain, or perform under such future contracts in a manner that is profitable.\nIf we are not successful in this emerging market segment, it will negatively impact our financial performance and could\nnegatively impact our reputation and harm our other business segments.\nCybersecurity Breaches and Other Disruptions of Our Information Technology Network and Systems Could Adversely\nAffect Our Business.\nWe rely on information technology networks and systems, some of which are owned and operated by third parties, to\nprocess, transmit and store electronic information. In particular, we depend on our information technology infrastructure for\na variety of functions, including worldwide financial reporting, inventory management, procurement, invoicing and email\ncommunications. Any of these systems may be susceptible to outages due to fire, floods, power loss, telecommunications\nfailures, terrorist attacks and similar events. Despite the implementation of network security measures, our systems and those\nof third parties on which we rely may also be vulnerable to computer viruses, break-ins, malware and similar disruptions.\nMalware, if surreptitiously installed on our systems and not timely detected and removed, could collect and disclose sensitive\ninformation relating to our customers, employees or others, exposing us to legal liability and causing us to suffer reputational\ndamage. It could also lead to disruptions in critical systems or the corruption or destruction of critical data. If we are unable\nto prevent such outages and breaches, these events could damage our reputation and lead to financial losses from remedial\nactions, loss of business or potential liability.\nWe Rely on Key Suppliers for Certain Components Used in Our Products.\nCertain models of our oil and gas marine wireless products require a timing device we purchase from a United States\nmanufacturer. We currently do not possess the ability to manufacture this component and have no other reliable source for\nthis device. If this manufacturer were to discontinue its production of this timing device, were to become unwilling to contract\n15\nwith us on competitive terms or were unable to supply the component in sufficient quantities to meet our requirements, our\nability to compete in the marine wireless marketplace could be impaired, which could adversely affect our financial\nperformance.\nFor our imaging products, we purchase all of our thermal film from one manufacturer. Except for the film sold to us by\nthis manufacturer, we know of no other source for thermal film that performs as well in our imaging equipment. If the\nmanufacturer were to discontinue producing thermal film, were to become unwilling to contract with us on competitive terms\nor were unable to supply thermal film in sufficient quantities to meet our requirements, our ability to compete in the direct\nthermal imaging marketplace could be impaired, which could adversely affect our financial performance.\nOur Success Depends Upon a Limited Number of Key Personnel.\nOur success depends on attracting and retaining highly skilled professionals. A number of our employees are highly-\nskilled engineers and other professionals. In addition, our success depends to a significant extent upon the abilities and efforts\nof the members of our senior management team. If we fail to continue to attract and retain such professionals, our ability to\ncompete in the industry could be adversely affected.\nWe Have a Minimal Disaster Recovery Program at Our Houston Facilities.\nDue to its proximity to the Texas Gulf Coast, our facilities in Houston, Texas are annually subject to the threat of\nhurricanes, and the aftermath that follows. Hurricanes may cause, among other types of damage, the loss of electrical power\nfor extended periods of time. If we lost electrical power at our Pinemont facility, or if a fire or other natural disaster occurred,\nwe would be unable to continue our manufacturing operations during the power outage because we do not own a generator\nor any other back-up power source large enough to provide for our manufacturing power consumption needs. Additionally,\nwe do not have an alternative manufacturing or operating location in the United States. Therefore, a significant disruption in\nour manufacturing operations could materially and adversely affect our business operations during an extended period of a\npower outage, fire or other natural disaster. We have a back-up generator to provide power for our information technology\noperations. We store our back-up data offsite and we replicate our mission critical data to an alternative cloud-based data\ncenter on a real-time basis. In the event of a major service interruption in our data center, we believe we would be able to\nactivate our mission critical applications within less than 24 hours.\nOur Credit Agreement Imposes Restrictions on Our Business.\nWe and several of our subsidiaries domiciled in the United States are parties to a credit agreement. Amounts available for\nborrowing under the credit agreement are determined by a borrowing base, which is determined based upon certain of our\ndomestic assets. Borrowings under the credit agreement will be secured by substantially all of our domestic assets, except for\ncertain excluded property. The credit agreement limits the incurrence of additional indebtedness, contains a covenant that\nrequires us to maintain a certain amount of consolidated tangible net worth and liquidity, and contains other covenants\ncustomary in agreements of this type. Our ability to comply with these restrictions may be affected by events beyond our\ncontrol, including, but not limited to, prevailing economic, financial and industry conditions and continuing declines in our\nproduct revenue. The breach of any of these covenants or restrictions, as well as any failure to make a payment of interest or\nprincipal when due, could result in a default under the credit agreement. Such a default would permit our lender to declare\nany amounts borrowed from it to be due and payable, together with accrued and unpaid interest, and our ability to borrow\nunder the credit agreement could be terminated. If we are unable to repay any debts owed to our lender, the lender could\nproceed against the collateral securing such debt. While we intend to seek alternative sources of cash in such a situation, there\nis no guarantee that any alternative cash source would be available or would be available on terms favorable to us.\nReliance on Third Party Subcontractors Could Adversely Affect Our Results of Operations and Reputation.\nWe may rely on subcontractors to complete certain projects. The quality and timing of production and services by our\nsubcontractors is not totally under our control. Reliance on subcontractors gives us less control over a project and exposes us\nto significant risks, including late delivery, substandard quality and high costs. The failure of our subcontractors to deliver\nquality products or services in a timely manner could adversely affect our profitability and reputation.\nThe High Fixed Costs of Our Operations Could Adversely Affect Our Results of Operations.\nWe have a high fixed cost structure primarily consisting of (i) depreciation expenses associated with our rental equipment\nand (ii) fixed manufacturing costs including salaries and benefits, taxes, insurance, maintenance, depreciation and other fixed\nmanufacturing costs. In regards to our rental equipment, large declines in the demand for rental equipment could result in\n16\nsubstantial operating losses due to the on-going fixed nature of rental equipment depreciation expense. Concerning our\nproduct manufacturing costs, in periods of low product demand our fixed costs generally do not decline or may decline only\nin modest increments. Therefore, lower demand for our rental equipment and manufactured products could adversely affect\nour results of operations.\nLegal and Compliance Risks\nOur Global Operations Expose Us to Risks Associated with Conducting Business Internationally, Including Failure to\nComply with U.S. Laws Which Apply to International Operations, Such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and U.S.\nExport Control Laws, as Well as the Laws of Other Countries\nWe have offices in Brazil, Colombia, Canada, the Russian Federation, Kazakhstan and the United Kingdom, in addition\nto our offices in the United States. In addition to the risks that are inherent in conducting business internationally, we are also\nliable for compliance with international and U.S. laws and regulations that apply to our international operations. These laws\nand regulations include data privacy requirements, labor relations laws, tax laws, anti-competition regulations, import and\ntrade restrictions, export control laws, U.S. laws such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar laws in other countries\nwhich also prohibit certain payments to governmental officials or certain payments or remunerations to customers. Many of\nour products are subject to U.S. export law restrictions that limit the destinations and types of customers to which our products\nmay be sold, or require an export license in connection with revenue transactions outside the United States. Given the high\nlevel of complexity of these laws, there is a risk that some provisions may be inadvertently breached, for example through\nthe negligent or the unauthorized intentional behavior of individual employees, our failure to comply with certain formal\ndocumentation requirements or otherwise. Additionally, we may be held liable for actions taken by our local dealers and\npartners. Violations of these laws and regulations could result in fines, criminal sanctions against us, our officers or our\nemployees, and prohibitions on the conduct of our business. Any such violations could include prohibitions on our ability to\noffer our products in one or more countries and could materially damage our reputation, our brands, our international\nexpansion efforts, our ability to attract and retain employees, our business and our operating results.\nBecause We Have No Plans to Pay Any Dividends for the Foreseeable Future, Investors Must Look Solely to Stock\nAppreciation for a Return on Their Investment in Us.\nWe have not paid cash dividends on our common stock since our incorporation and do not anticipate paying any cash\ndividends in the foreseeable future. Any payment of cash dividends in the future will be dependent on the amount of funds\nlegally available, our financial condition, capital requirements, loan covenants and other factors that our Board of Directors\nmay deem relevant. Accordingly, investors must rely on sales of their common stock after price appreciation, which may\nnever occur, as the only way to realize any future gains on their investment.\nWe Have a Relatively Small Public Float, and Our Stock Price May be Volatile.\nAt September 30, 2023, we have approximately 12.2 million shares outstanding held by non-affiliates. This limited\nnumber of shares outstanding results in a relatively limited market for our common stock. Our daily trading volume for the\nyear ended September 30, 2023 averaged approximately 41,000 shares. Our small float and daily trading volumes have in the\npast caused, and may in the future result in, significant volatility in our stock price.\nFinancial and Accounting Risks\nUnfavorable Currency Exchange Rate Fluctuations Could Adversely Affect Our Results of Operations.\nSubstantially all of our third-party revenue from the United States is invoiced in U.S. dollars, though from time to time\nwe may invoice revenue transactions in foreign currencies including intercompany sales. As a result, we may be subject to\nforeign currency fluctuations on our revenue. The reporting currency for our financial statements is the U.S. dollar. However,\nthe assets, liabilities, revenue and costs of our Russian, Canadian and United Kingdom subsidiaries and our Brazilian,\nColombian, and Kazakhstan branch offices are denominated in currencies other than U.S. dollars. To prepare our consolidated\nfinancial statements, we must translate those assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses into U.S. dollars at then-applicable\nexchange rates. Consequently, increases and decreases in the value of the U.S. dollar versus these other currencies will affect\nthe amount of these items in our consolidated financial statements, even if their value has not changed in their original\ncurrency. These translations could result in significant changes to our results of operations from period to period. For the\nfiscal year ended September 30, 2023, approximately 5% of our consolidated revenue was related to the operations of our\nforeign subsidiaries and branches.\n17\nOur Long-Lived Assets May be Subject to Impairment.\nWe periodically assess our long-lived assets for impairment. Significant sustained future decreases in crude oil and natural\ngas prices may require us to write down the value of our long-lived assets in our Oil and Gas Markets business segment,\nincluding our manufacturing facilities, manufacturing equipment and rental equipment if future cash flows anticipated to be\ngenerated from these assets fall below the asset’s net book value. Furthermore, we may be required to write down the value\nof other intangible assets related to our acquisitions of Quantum, the OptoSeis® fiber optic sensing technology or the goodwill\nand other intangible assets related to our Aquana acquisition if sufficient cash flows are not generated to recover the carrying\nvalue of such assets. If we are forced to write down the value of our long-lived assets, these noncash asset impairments could\nadversely affect our results of operations.\nShould We Fail to Maintain an Effective System of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting, We May Not Be Able to\nAccurately Report Our Financial Results and Prevent Material Fraud, Which Could Adversely Affect the Value of Our\nCommon Stock.\nEffective internal control over financial reporting is necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports and effectively\nprevent and detect material fraud. If we cannot provide reliable financial reports or prevent or detect material fraud, our\noperating results could be misstated. There can be no assurances that we will be able to prevent control deficiencies from\noccurring which could cause us to incur unforeseen costs, negatively impact our results of operations, cause the market price\nof our common stock to decline, or have other potential adverse consequences.\nItem 1B.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following is management’s discussion and analysis of the major elements of our consolidated financial statements.\nYou should read this discussion and analysis together with our consolidated financial statements, including the accompanying\nnotes, and other detailed information appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including under the heading\n“Risk Factors.” The discussion of our financial condition and results of operations includes various forward-looking\nstatements about our markets, the demand for our products and services and our future plans and results. These statements\nare based on assumptions that we consider to be reasonable, but that could prove to be incorrect. For more information\nregarding our assumptions, you should refer to the section entitled “Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\nand Assumptions” below.\nCautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements and Assumptions\nThis Annual Report on Form 10-K and the documents incorporated by reference herein, if any, contain “forward-looking”\nstatements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities\nExchange Act of 1934, as amended. These forward-looking statements can be identified by terminology such as “may”,\n“will”, “should”, “intend”, “expect”, “plan”, “budget”, “forecast”, “anticipate”, “believe”, “estimate”, “predict”, “potential”,\n“continue”, “evaluating” or similar words. Statements that contain these words should be read carefully because they discuss\nour future expectations, contain projections of our future results of operations or of our financial position or state other\nforward-looking information. Examples of forward-looking statements include, among others, statements that we make\nregarding our expected operating results, the adoption, results and success of our rollout of our Aquana smart water valves\nand cloud-based control platform, future demand for our Quantum security solutions, the adoption and sale of our products\nin various geographic regions, potential tenders for PRM systems, future demand for OBX rental equipment, the adoption of\nQuantum's SADAR® product monitoring of subsurface reservoirs, the completion of new orders for our channels of our GCL\nsystem, the fulfillment of customer payment obligations, the impact of and the recovery from the impact of the coronavirus\n(or COVID-19) pandemic, the impact of the current armed conflict between Russia and Ukraine, our ability to manage\nchanges and the continued health or availability of management personnel, volatility and direction of oil prices, anticipated\nlevels of capital expenditures and the sources of funding therefor, and our strategy for growth, product development, market\nposition, financial results and the provision of accounting reserves. These forward-looking statements reflect our current\njudgment about future events and trends based on the information currently available to us. However, there will likely be\nevents in the future that we are not able to predict or control. The factors listed under the caption “Risk Factors”, as well as\ncautionary language in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, provide examples of risks, uncertainties and events that may cause\nour actual results to differ materially from the expectations we describe in our forward-looking statements. Such examples\ninclude, but are not limited to, the failure of the Quantum or OptoSeis® or Aquana technology transactions to yield positive\noperating results, decreases in commodity price levels and continued adverse impact of COVID-19 which could reduce\ndemand for our products, the failure of our products to achieve market acceptance (despite substantial investment by us) our\nsensitivity to short term backlog, delayed or cancelled customer orders, product obsolescence resulting from poor industry\nconditions or new technologies, bad debt write-offs associated with customer accounts, inability to collect on promissory\nnotes, lack of further orders for our OBX rental equipment, failure of our Quantum products to be adopted by the border and\nperimeter security market, or a decrease in such market due to governmental changes, and infringement or failure to protect\nintellectual property. The occurrence of the events described in these risk factors and elsewhere in this Annual Report on\nForm 10-K could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial position, and actual events\nand results of operations may vary materially from our current expectations. We assume no obligation to revise or update any\nforward-looking statement, whether written or oral, that we may make from time to time, whether as a result of new\ninformation, future developments or otherwise.\nBackground\nWe design and manufacture seismic instruments and equipment and primarily market these products to the oil and gas\nindustry to locate, characterize and monitor hydrocarbon producing reservoirs. We also market our seismic products to other\nindustries for vibration monitoring, border and perimeter security and various geotechnical applications. We design and\nmanufacture other products of a non-seismic nature, including water meter products, imaging equipment and provide contract\nmanufacturing services. For further information on the nature of our operations, see the information under the heading\n“Business” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n22\nConsolidated Results of Operations\nAs we have reported in the past, our revenue and operating profits have varied significantly from quarter-to-quarter, and\neven year-to-year, and are expected to continue that trend in the future, especially when our quarterly or annual financial\nresults are impacted by the presence or absence of relatively large, but somewhat erratic, sales of our oil and gas PRM systems\nand/or wireless seismic data acquisition systems for land and marine applications.\nWe report and evaluate financial information for three segments: Oil and Gas Markets, Adjacent Markets and Emerging\nMarkets. Summary financial data by business segment follows (in thousands):\nYEAR ENDED SEPTEMBER 30,\n2023 2022\nOil and Gas Markets\nTraditional exploration product revenue ........................................................... $ 12,183 $ 6,597\nWireless exploration product revenue .............................................................. 60,848 40,667\nReservoir product revenue ................................................................................ 962 1,877\nTotal revenue .................................................................................................... 73,993 49,141\nOperating income (loss) .................................................................................... 15,759 (7,539)\nAdjacent Markets\nIndustrial product revenue ................................................................................ 36,859 25,640\nImaging product revenue .................................................................................. 12,180 13,531\nTotal revenue .................................................................................................... 49,039 39,171\nOperating income .............................................................................................. 11,490 6,021\nEmerging Markets\nRevenue ............................................................................................................ 1,234 711\nOperating loss ...................................................................................................

These declines in the demand for oil and gas have caused oil and gas exploration and\nproduction companies to experience a significant reduction in cash flows, which have resulted in reductions in their capital\nspending budgets for oil and gas exploration-focused activities, including seismic data acquisition activities. Crude oil prices\nheld above $65 per barrel throughout 2022 and through September 2023; however, a lag in time typically occurs between\nhigher oil prices and greater demand for our Oil and Gas Markets segment products. We believe this lag is the result of\nexploration and production (“E&P”) companies allocating their cash flow towards shareholder reward initiatives, such as\nstock buy-back programs and dividend payments, or in debt reduction. We believe this lag is a short-term trend that will\ncontinue until E&P companies decide to reinvest capital into exploration activities. As this lag persists, we expect the reduced\nlevels of demand for our Oil and Gas Markets segment products. We also expect our land-based traditional and wireless\nproducts will continue to experience low levels of product demand until our customers consume their excess levels of\nunderutilized equipment. During the third quarter of fiscal year 2022, we began to experience an increase in rental demand\nfor our marine nodal products in the form of additional rental contracts and requests for quotes from existing and new\ncustomers. The increase in demand has led to near full utilization of our marine wireless rental fleet, yet we continue to\nexperience low levels of demand for our land-based wireless products.\nDuring the first quarter of fiscal year 2023, we implemented a plan to discontinue the manufacture of certain low margin,\nlow revenue products and reconfigure our production facilities to lower our costs and raise efficiencies. As part of the plan,\nreductions were made to our workforce which are expected to yield an annual savings of more than $2 million. In connection\nwith the plan, we incurred costs of $0.6 million in the first quarter of fiscal year 2023, primarily termination costs related to\nthe workforce reduction. The costs were recorded both to cost of revenue and operating expenses in the consolidated statement\nof operations. No significant future costs are expected.\n23\nIn light of current market conditions, the inventory balances in our Oil and Gas Markets business segment at September\n30, 2023 continued to exceed levels we consider appropriate for the current level of product demand. We are continuing to\nwork aggressively to reduce these legacy inventory balances; however, we are also adding new inventories for new wireless\nproduct developments and for other product demand in our Adjacent Markets segment. During periods of excessive inventory\nlevels, our policy has been, and will continue to be, to record obsolescence expense as we experience reduced product demand\nand as our inventories continue to age. Although the Oil and Gas Markets segment is seeing a recovery after experiencing\ndifficult market conditions, we have been recording additional expenses for inventory obsolescence and will continue to do\nso in the future until product demand and/or resulting inventory turnover return to acceptable levels.\nArmed Conflict Between Russia and Ukraine\nA portion of our oil and gas product manufacturing is conducted through GTE, which is based in the Russian Federation.\nConsequently, our oil and gas business could be directly affected by the current war between Russia and Ukraine. Please see\n“Part I—Item 1A.—Risk Factors” for more information.\nCoronavirus (COVID-19)\nThe ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has negatively impacted worldwide economic activity and continues to create\nchallenges in our markets. The COVID-19 pandemic and the related mitigation measures have disrupted our supply chain,\nresulting in longer lead times in materials available from suppliers and extended shipping time for these materials to reach\nour facilities. The occurrence or resurgence of global or regional health events such as the COVID-19 pandemic, and the\nrelated government responses, could result in a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of\noperations and liquidity. As such, we will continue to closely monitor COVID-19 and will continue to reassess our strategy\nand operational structure on a regular, ongoing basis.\nFiscal Year 2023 Compared to Fiscal Year 2022\nConsolidated revenue for fiscal year 2023 was $124.5 million, an increase of $35.3 million, or 39.5%, from fiscal year\n2022. The increase in revenue was largely due to higher rental revenue from our Oil and Gas Markets segment due to increased\nutilization of our OBX rental fleet and an increase in demand for our industrial products from our Adjacent Markets\nsegment. The increase was partially offset by a decrease in sales of wireless exploration products. Wireless exploration\nproduct revenue for fiscal year 2023 also included $4.0 million from a rental customer as compensation for lost OBX nodes.\nConsolidated gross profit for fiscal year 2023 was $51.7 million, an increase of $33.6 million, or 186.5%, from fiscal year\n2022. The increase in gross profit was primarily due to higher gross profits from the increased utilization of our OBX rental\nfleet and the increase in industrial product revenue and related gross profits. The increase was partially offset by the decrease\nin wireless exploration product revenue and related gross profits.\nConsolidated operating expenses for fiscal year 2023 were $41.7 million, an increase of $0.5 million, or 1.2%, from fiscal\nyear 2022. The increase was primarily due to a (i) $5.0 million favorable non-cash adjustment reported in the prior year\nperiod resulting from a change in the estimated fair value of contingent consideration related to our Quantum and OptoSeis®\nacquisitions and (ii) an increase in incentive compensation attributable to the increase in revenue. The increase in operating\nexpenses were partially offset by a (i) $4.3 million non-cash goodwill impairment charge reported in the prior fiscal year\nrelated to our Quantum acquisition, (ii) reduction in personnel costs attributable to our workforce reduction, (iii) lower\nresearch and development project expenditures and (iv) decrease in bad debt expense resulting from collections of previously\nreserved past due receivables.\nIn February 2023, we sold our real property located at 7310 Langfield Road in Houston, Texas for a cash sales price of\n$3.7 million, net of closing costs of $0.3 million. We recognized a gain of $1.3 million from the sale of this property in the\nsecond quarter of fiscal year 2023. The sale was part of our plan to streamline operations and reduce costs.\nConsolidated other income for fiscal year 2023 was $1.2 million compared to $0.5 million from fiscal year 2022. The\nincrease in other income was primarily due to a increase in net foreign currency transaction gains. The increase was partially\noffset by a decrease in interest income attributable to lower note receivable balances between periods.\n24\nSegment Results of Operations\nFiscal Year 2023 Compared to Fiscal Year 2022\nOil and Gas Markets\nRevenue\nRevenue from our Oil and Gas Markets products for fiscal year 2023 increased $24.9 million, or 50.6%, from fiscal year\n2022. The components of this increase were as follows:\n● Traditional Exploration Product Revenue – Revenue from our traditional products increased $5.6 million,\nor 84.7% from the prior fiscal year. The increase primarily reflects higher demand for our sensor and marine\nproducts.\n● Wireless Exploration Product Revenue – Revenue from our wireless exploration products increased $20.2\nmillion, or 49.6%, from the prior fiscal year. The increase was primarily due to increased rental revenue\nattributable to higher utilization of our OBX rental fleet. The increase was partially offset by a decrease in\nwireless product sales. Wireless product revenue for fiscal year 2023 also included the $4.0 million from a\nrental equipment customer as compensation for lost OBX nodes.\nOperating Income (Loss)\nOperating income associated with our Oil and Gas Markets products for fiscal year 2023 was $15.8 million, compared to\nan operating loss of $(7.5) million from the prior fiscal year. The increase in operating income was primarily due to higher\nwireless rental revenue and related gross profits due to improved utilization of our OBX rental fleet. The improvement in\noperating income was partially offset by a (i) decrease in wireless product revenue and related gross profits and (ii) $4.4\nmillion favorable non-cash adjustment reported in the prior fiscal year related to the estimated fair value of contingent\nconsideration related to our OptoSeis® acquisition.\nAdjacent Markets\nRevenue\nRevenue from our Adjacent Markets products for fiscal year 2023 increased $9.9 million, or 25.2%, from the prior fiscal\nyear. The components of this increase were as follows:\n● Industrial Product Revenue and Services – Revenue from our industrial products increased $11.2 million, or\n43.8%, from the prior fiscal year. The increase was primarily due to higher demand for our water meter products.\n● Imaging Product Revenue – Revenue from our imaging products decreased $1.4 million, or 10.0%, from the\nprior fiscal year. The decrease was primarily due to lower demand for our imaging equipment.\nOperating Income\nOperating income from our Adjacent Markets products for fiscal year 2023 was $11.5 million, an increase of $5.5 million,\nor 90.8% from the prior fiscal year. The increase in operating income was primarily due to the increase in revenue and related\ngross profits. The increase was partially offset by (i) an increase in operating expenses resulting from the increased revenue\nand (ii) higher research and development expense. Operating income for the prior fiscal year included a $0.4 million\nimpairment charge on our manufacturing equipment.\nEmerging Markets\nRevenue\nRevenue from our Emerging Markets products for fiscal year 2023 was $1.2 million, compared to $0.7 million from the\nprior fiscal year. The increase in revenue was primarily due to revenue of $0.7 million recognized on a security related\ncontract completed with a commercial customer.\n25\nOperating Loss\nOperating loss from our Emerging Markets products for fiscal year 2023 was $4.0 million, compared to $9.1 million\nfrom the prior fiscal year. The decrease in operating loss for fiscal year 2023 was primarily due a (i) non-cash goodwill\nimpairment charge of $4.3 million reported in the prior fiscal year and (ii) lower personnel costs attributable to our workforce\nreduction. The decrease in operating loss was partially offset by a $0.7 million decrease to a favorable non-cash adjustment\nto the estimated fair value of contingent consideration related to our Quantum acquisition when compared to the same period\nof the prior fiscal year.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nFiscal Year 2023\nAt September 30, 2023, we had approximately $33.7 million in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments. For\nthe fiscal year ended September 30, 2023, we generated $15.6 million of cash from operating activities. Sources of cash\nincluded our net income of $12.2 million and net non-cash charges of $19.6 million resulting from deferred income taxes,\ndepreciation, amortization, accretion, inventory obsolescence, stock-based compensation and bad debt recovery. Other\nsources of cash included a (i) $5.4 million increase in other liabilities due to an increase in customer deposits on rental\ncontracts and accrued employee compensation costs and (ii) $1.3 million decrease in other assets. These sources of cash\nwere partially offset by (i) a $5.6 million increase in trade accounts and notes receivable primarily due to our increase in\nrevenue and the timing of collections from customers, (ii) a $11.0 million increase in inventories to meet an increase in\ndemand for our products, (iii) the removal of $4.4 million gross profit from the sale of used rental equipment and (iv) a $1.1\nmillion of gain from the sale of property and equipment since they are included in investing activities.\nFor the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023, we used cash of $11.9 million in investing activities. Uses of cash included\n(i) $4.0 million for additions to our property, plant and equipment, (ii) $9.9 million for additions to our equipment rental fleet\nand (iii) net disbursements of $13.9 million for purchases of short-term investments. These uses of cash were partially offset\nby proceeds of (i) $11.5 million from the sale of used rental equipment and (ii) $4.4 million from the sale of property and\nequipment. We expect fiscal year 2024 cash investments into our rental fleet will be approximately $9 million. We expect\nfiscal year 2024 cash investments in our property, plant and equipment will be approximately $4 million. Our capital\nexpenditures are expected to be funded from our cash on hand, internal cash flows, cash flows from our rental contracts or,\nif necessary, borrowings under our new credit agreement.\nFor the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023, we used cash of $0.5 million from financing activities consisting of (i)\n$0.4 million for debt issuance costs related to our new credit agreement and (ii) $0.2 million for final contingent consideration\npayments to the former shareholders of Quantum.\nOur available cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments was $33.7 million at September 30, 2023, which\nincluded $3.8 million of cash and cash equivalents held by our foreign subsidiaries and branch offices, of which $2.5 million\nwas held by our subsidiary in the Russian Federation. In response to sanctions imposed by the U.S. and other countries on\nthe Russian Federation, the Russian government has imposed restrictions on companies' abilities to repatriate or otherwise\nremit cash from their Russian-based operations to locations outside of Russia. As a result, this cash can be used in our Russian\noperations, but we may be unable to transfer it out of Russia without incurring substantial costs, if at all. In addition, if we\nwere to repatriate the cash held by our Russian subsidiary, we would be required to accrue and pay taxes on any amount\nrepatriated. During fiscal year 2023, in light of recent volatility in the financial markets, we entered into an IntraFi Cash\nService (\"ICS\") Deposit Placement Agreement with IntraFi Network LLC through our primary bank, Woodforest National\nBank. The ICS program offers us access to unlimited Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (\"FDIC\") insurance on\ndomestically held cash in excess of $5.0 million, thereby mitigating our risk of falling outside of FDIC coverage limits.\nIn July 2023, we entered into a credit agreement (“the Agreement”) with Woodforest National Bank, as sole lender. The\nAgreement refinanced our credit agreement dated May 6, 2022, with Amerisource Funding, Inc., as administrative agent and\nas a lender, and Woodforest National Bank, as a lender. The Agreement provides a revolving credit facility with a maximum\navailability of $15 million. Availability under the Agreement is determined based upon a borrowing base comprised of\ncertain of our domestic assets which include (i) 80% of eligible accounts receivable, plus (ii) 90% of eligible foreign insured\naccounts, plus (iii) 25% of eligible inventory plus (iv) 50% of the orderly liquidation value of eligible equipment, in each\ncase subject to certain limitations and adjustments. Interest shall accrue on outstanding borrowings at a rate equal to Term\nSOFR (Secured Overnight Financing Rate) plus a margin equal to 3.25% per annum. We are required to make monthly\ninterest payments on borrowed funds. The Agreement is secured by substantially all of our assets, except for certain excluded\nproperty. The Agreement requires us to maintain a minimum (i) consolidated tangible net worth of $100 million, (ii) liquidity\n26\nof $5 million, and (iii) current ratio no less than 2.00 to 1.00, in each case tested quarterly. The Agreement also requires us\nto maintain a springing minimum interest coverage ratio of 1.50 to 1.00, tested quarterly whenever there is an outstanding\nbalance. The Agreement expires in July 2025.\nAt September 30, 2023, we had no outstanding borrowings under the Agreement and our borrowing base availability\nunder the Agreement was $13.1 million after consideration of a $0.1 million outstanding letter of credit. We were in\ncompliance with all covenants under the Agreement. We do not currently anticipate the need to borrow under the Agreement;\nhowever, we may decide to do so in the future, if needed.\nOur available cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments increased $17.0 million during fiscal year 2023. In the\nabsence of future profitable results of operations, we may need to rely on other sources of liquidity to fund our future\noperations, including executed rental contracts, available borrowings under the Agreement through its expiration in July 2025,\nleveraging or sales of real estate assets, sales of rental assets and other liquidity sources which may be available to us. We\ncurrently believe that our cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to finance any future operating losses and planned\ncapital expenditures through the next twelve months.\nWe do not have any obligations which meet the definition of an off-balance sheet arrangement and which have or are\nreasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial statements or the items contained therein that are material\nto investors.\nContractual Obligations\nContingent Compensation Costs\nIn connection with the acquisition of Aquana in July 2021, we are subject to additional contingent cash payments to the\nformer members of Aquana over a six-year earn-out period. The contingent payments, if any, will be derived from certain\neligible revenue generated during the earn-out period from products and services sold by Aquana. There is no maximum limit\nto the contingent cash payments that could be made. The merger agreement with Aquana requires the continued employment\nof a certain key employee and former member of Aquana for the first four years of the six year earn-out period in order for\nany of Aquana’s former members to be eligible to receive any earn-out payments. In accordance with ASC 805, Business\nCombinations, due to the continued employment requirement, no liability has been recorded for the estimated fair value of\ncontingent earn-out payments for this transaction. Earn-outs achieved, if any, will be recorded as compensation expense when\nincurred.\nSee Note 17 to our consolidated financial statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information on our\ncontractual contingencies.\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States\nof America requires the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and\naccompanying notes. We consider many factors in selecting appropriate operational and financial accounting policies and\ncontrols and in developing the estimates and assumptions that are used in the preparation of these financial statements. We\ncontinually evaluate our estimates, including those related to revenue recognition, bad debt reserves, inventory obsolescence\nreserves, goodwill and long-lived asset impairment. We base our estimates on historical experience and various other factors,\nincluding the impact from the current economic conditions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual\nresults may differ from these estimates under different conditions or assumptions.\nOur normal credit terms for trade receivables are 30 days. In certain situations, credit terms for trade receivables may be\nextended to 60 days or longer and such receivables generally do not require collateral. Additionally, we provide long-term\nfinancing in the form of promissory notes and sales-type leases when competitive conditions require such financing and, in\nsuch cases, we may require collateral. We perform ongoing credit evaluations of our accounts and financing receivables, and\nallowances are recognized for potential credit losses.\nOur long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever an event or change in circumstances indicates the carrying\namount of an asset or group of assets may not be recoverable. The impairment review, if necessary, includes a comparison\nof expected future cash flows (undiscounted and without interest charges) to be generated by an asset group with the\nassociated carrying value of the related assets. If the carrying value of the asset group exceeds the expected future cash flows,\nan impairment loss is recognized to the extent that the carrying value of the asset group exceeds its fair value.\n27\nWe conduct our evaluation of goodwill at the reporting unit level on an annual basis as of September 30 and more\nfrequently if events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value. The guidance\non the testing of goodwill for impairment provides the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine if the fair value\nof a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount. If, based on the qualitative assessment of events or circumstances, an entity\ndetermines it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is more than its carrying amount, then it is not\nnecessary to perform a quantitative assessment. However, if an entity concludes otherwise, then a quantitative assessment\nmust be performed. If, based on the quantitative assessment, we determine that the fair value of a reporting unit is less that\nits carrying amount, a goodwill impairment is recognized equal to the difference between the carrying amount of the reporting\nunit and its fair value, not to exceed the carrying amount of the goodwill.\nWe record a write-down of our inventories when the cost basis of any manufactured product, including any estimated\nfuture costs to complete the manufacturing process, exceeds its net realizable value. Inventories are stated at the lower of cost\nor net realizable value. Cost is determined on a first-in, first-out method, except that our subsidiaries in the Russian Federation\nand the United Kingdom use an average cost method to value their inventories.\nWe periodically review the composition of our inventories to determine if market demand, product modifications,\ntechnology changes, excessive quantities on-hand and other factors hinder our ability to recover our investment in such\ninventories. Management’s assessment is based upon historical product demand, estimated future product demand and various\nother judgments and estimates. Inventory obsolescence reserves are recorded when such assessments reveal that portions or\ncomponents of our inventory investment will not be realized in our operating activities.\nThe value of our inventories not expected to be realized in cash, sold or consumed during our next operating cycle are\nclassified as non-current assets in our consolidated balance sheets.\nWe recognize revenue from product sales and services in accordance with ASC Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with\nCustomers. This standard applies to contracts for the sale of products and services and does not apply to contracts for the\nrental or lease of products. Under this standard, we recognize revenue when performance of contractual obligations are\nsatisfied, generally when control of the promised goods or services is transferred to our customers, in an amount that reflects\nthe consideration we expect to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. Revenue from product sales is recognized\nwhen obligations under the terms of a contract are satisfied, control is transferred and collectability of the sales price is\nreasonably assured. Transfer of control generally occurs with shipment or delivery, depending on the terms of the underlying\ncontract. Our products are generally sold without any customer acceptance provisions, and our standard terms of sale do not\nallow customers to return products for credit. Most of our products do not require installation assistance or sophisticated\ninstruction. We offer a standard product warranty, which obligates us to repair or replace our products having manufacturing\ndefects. We maintain a reserve for future warranty costs based on historical experience or, in the absence of historical\nexperience, management estimates. Revenue from engineering services is recognized as services are rendered over the\nduration of a project or as billed on a per hour basis. Field service revenue is recognized when services are rendered and is\ngenerally priced on a per day rate. We recognize rental revenue as earned over the rental period. Rentals of our equipment\ngenerally range from daily rentals to rental periods of up to six months or longer.\nWe recognize rental revenue in accordance with ASC Topic 842, Leases. In the event collectability of lease payments is\nnot probable at the lease commencement date, we recognize revenue when payments are received. We regularly evaluate the\ncollectability of our lease receivables on a lease-by-lease basis. The evaluation primarily consists of reviewing past due\naccount balances and other factors such as the credit quality of the customer, historical trends of the customer and current\neconomic conditions. We suspend the recognition of rental revenue when the collectability of amounts due are no longer\nprobable and record a direct write-off of the lease receivable to rental revenue.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nPlease refer to Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements contained in this Annual Report for a discussion of recent\naccounting pronouncements.\nManagement’s Current Outlook and Assumptions\nAs further discussed above, there remains uncertainties regarding the duration and to what extent the COVID-19 pandemic\nwill ultimately impact the demand for our products and services or with our supply chain.\nRegarding our Oil and Gas Markets business segment, demand for our products are subject to volatile fluctuations in\ncrude oil prices. As a result of substantial declines in crude oil prices in recent years combined with the recent reduced global\n28\ndemand for oil and gas as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, oil and gas exploration and production companies experienced\na significant reduction in cash flows resulting in sharp reductions in their capital spending budgets for oil and gas exploration-\nfocused activities including seismic data acquisition activities. While we have experienced stronger marine nodal rental\nactivity in fiscal year 2023, the need for new seismic equipment, particularly land-based equipment, remains restrained due\nto our customers’ (i) limited capital resources, (ii) lack of visibility into future demand for their seismic services and (iii) in\nsome cases, under-utilized legacy equipment. Crude oil prices have rebounded; however, lasting higher levels of oil and gas\ncommodity pricing may not stabilize in the long term, thus continuing the challenging industry conditions we have\nexperienced in previous fiscal years.\nMany of our land-based traditional seismic products can be damaged, destroyed or otherwise consumed during our\ncustomer’s field operations. We expect fiscal year 2024 demand for our land-based traditional seismic products may increase\nslightly over fiscal year 2023 levels.\nThe vast majority of our oil and gas rental revenue in fiscal year 2023 was derived from short-term rentals of our OBX\nocean-bottom recorder. We believe our OBX rental revenue will increase in fiscal year 2024 as a result of rental contracts\nexecuted during fiscal year 2023 and anticipated new rental contracts, but we can make no assurance in this regard.\nWe expect that fiscal year 2024 revenue from our oil and gas reservoir products, and principally our borehole tools and\nservices, will increase slightly over fiscal year 2023 levels. We have not received any orders for a large-scale seabed PRM\nsystem since November 2012, although we do believe opportunities for PRM orders do exist in today's market. If a large\nscale PRM order were received in fiscal year 2024, revenue would likely not be recognized until fiscal year 2025 and 2026.\nWe expect fiscal year 2024 revenue from our Adjacent Markets products to increase over fiscal year 2023 levels due to\nour acquisition of Aquana and intergration of Aquana's products into our business and optimism that demand for our\nindustrial, imaging products and contract manufacturing services will continue to increase in fiscal year 2024.\nWe expect fiscal year 2024 revenue from our Emerging Markets products to increase over 2023 levels largely due to\noptimism of obtaining new security-related contracts and opportunities with oil and gas industry customers.\nItem 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk\nNot required.\nItem 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\nOur consolidated financial statements, including the reports thereon, the notes thereto and supplementary data begin at\npage F-1 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K and are incorporated herein by reference.\nItem 9. Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure\nNone.\nItem 9A. Controls and Procedures\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining a system of disclosure controls and procedures that are\ndesigned to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed under the Exchange Act is recorded,\nprocessed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified under SEC’s rules and forms, and that such information\nis accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”) and Chief Financial\nOfficer (“CFO”). Notwithstanding the foregoing, there can be no assurance that our disclosure controls and procedures will\ndetect or uncover all failures of persons within the Company and its consolidated subsidiaries to report material information\notherwise required to be set forth in our reports.\n29\nIn connection with the preparation of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we carried out an evaluation under the\nsupervision and with the participation of our management, including the CEO and CFO, as of September 30, 2023 of the\neffectiveness of the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures, as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)\nunder the Exchange Act. Based on that evaluation, the CEO and CFO concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures\nare effective as of September 30, 2023.\nManagement’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting (as\ndefined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act). Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over\nfinancial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future\nperiods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of\ncompliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nOur management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2023. In\nmaking this assessment, we used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway\nCommission (\"COSO\") in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013). Based on this assessment, our management\nconcluded that, as of September 30, 2023, our internal control over financial reporting is effective based on those criteria.\nChanges in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nThere have not been any changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) and 15d-\n15(f) of the Exchange Act) during the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2023 that have materially affected, or are reasonably\nlikely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.\nItem 9B.

F-33\nF-1\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nTo the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of Geospace Technologies Corporation\nOpinion on the Financial Statements\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Geospace Technologies Corporation and its subsidiaries\n(the Company) as of September 30, 2023 and 2022, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive\nincome, stockholders’ equity and cash flows for the years then ended, and the related notes to the consolidated financial\nstatements (collectively, the financial statements). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material\nrespects, the financial position of the Company as of September 30, 2023 and 2022, and the results of its operations and its\ncash flows for the years then ended, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of\nAmerica.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion\non the Company’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public\nCompany Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the\nCompany in accordance with U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and\nExchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform\nthe audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether\ndue to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control\nover financial reporting. As part of our audits we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial\nreporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over\nfinancial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.\nOur audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether\ndue to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test\nbasis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the\naccounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation\nof the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matters\nThe critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements\nthat were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or\ndisclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective or complex\njudgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements,\ntaken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the\ncritical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.\nInventory Valuation\nAs described in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company’s consolidated inventories balance, which is\nstated at lower of cost or net realizable value, was $43.3 million as of September 30, 2023. The valuation of inventories is\nbased on the Company’s periodic review of the composition of its inventories to determine if market demand, product\nmodifications, technology changes, excessive quantities on-hand and other factors hinder its ability to recover its investment\nin such inventories. The Company’s assessment is based upon historical product demand, estimated future product demand\nand various other judgments and estimates. Inventory obsolescence reserves are recorded when such assessments reveal\nthat portions or components of the Company’s investment will not be realized in its operating activities.\nF-2\nWe identified the valuation of inventories at the lower of cost or net realizable value as a critical audit matter due to the\nsignificant judgment and estimates required by management. Determining whether a decline in value has occurred requires\nmanagement to make complex judgments related to (i) historical and estimated future product demand in relation to\nquantities on hand and (ii) obsolescence of certain products based on changes in technology and demand. Auditing these\njudgments is especially challenging and involved significant auditor judgment due to fluctuations in sales trends and\nevolving customer demands.\nOur audit procedures related to the Company’s valuation of inventory included the following, among others:\n● We evaluated management’s calculation of the inventory valuation reserve by testing the mathematical accuracy\nof the calculation.\n● We tested the completeness, accuracy, and relevance of the reports and inputs used in the Company’s analysis.\n● We evaluated the appropriateness and consistency of management’s methods and assumptions used in\ndeveloping their estimate of the inventory valuation reserve, which included consideration of recent changes in\nhistorical usage information.\n● We evaluated management’s process for subsequent adjustments to net realizable value by performing a\nretrospective review on an individual item basis to test for subsequent changes in the inventory values after the\nnet realizable value had been established.\n● We compared actual purchases and sales data on an individual item basis for all inventory items and aggregated\nto perform an independent assessment of the net realizable value of inventory.\nValuation of Long-lived Assets for impairment – Emerging Markets Asset Group\nAs discussed in Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company assessed $3.3 million of long-lived assets\nassociated with its Emerging Markets asset group for recoverability. As part of their quantitative assessment, the Company\nperformed a recoverability assessment in which its carrying value was compared to estimated undiscounted cash flows over\nthe remaining useful life of the asset group’s primary asset, its developed technology. Key assumptions in the analyses\ninclude revenue projections, including the probability of obtaining new contracts, and cash flow projections. Estimated\nfuture cash flows of the Company’s Emerging Markets asset group include the Company’s ability to obtain an additional\ncontract with its significant customer.\nWe identified the valuation of long-lived assets for the Emerging Market’s asset group as a critical audit matter because of\nthe significant assumptions management makes in determining the estimate, including revenue and cash flow projections.\nAuditing management’s assumptions of revenue and cash flow projections involved a high degree of auditor judgment and\nincreased audit effort, and changes in these assumptions could have a significant impact on the fair value of the Emerging\nMarket’s asset group and potential impairment charges.\nOur audit procedures related to the Company’s valuation of long-lived assets for the Emerging Markets asset group included\nthe following, among others:\n● We evaluated the reasonableness of management’s revenue and cash flow projections by comparing to historical\nresults, inquiry of management of the asset group regarding additional contracts with its significant customer,\nreview of publicly available industry information, and testing the completeness and accuracy of the data used in\nthe projections.\nWe have served as the Company’s auditor since 2018.\n/s/ RSM US LLP\nHouston, Texas\nNovember 17, 2023\nF-3\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nTo the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of Geospace Technologies Corporation\nOur audits of the consolidated financial statements referred to in our report dated November 17, 2023, (included elsewhere\nin this Annual Report on Form 10-K) also included the financial statement schedule of Geospace Technologies Corporation\nand its subsidiaries, listed in Item 15(a) of this Form 10-K. This schedule is the responsibility of Geospace Technologies\nCorporation's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion based on our audits of the consolidated financial\nstatements.\nIn our opinion, the financial statement schedule, when considered in relation to the basic consolidated financial statements\ntaken as a whole, presents fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein.\n/s/ RSM US LLP\nHouston, Texas\nNovember 17, 2023\nF-4\nGeospace Technologies Corporation and Subsidiaries\nConsolidated Balance Sheets\n(In thousands, except share amounts)\nAS OF SEPTEMBER 30,\n2023 2022\nASSETS\nCurrent assets:\nCash and cash equivalents ........................................................................................... $ 18,803 $ 16,109\nShort-term investments ................................................................................................ 14,921 894\nTrade accounts and notes receivable, net ..................................................................... 21,373 20,886\nInventories, net ............................................................................................................ 18,430 19,995\nPrepaid expenses and other current assets ................................................................... 2,251 2,077\nTotal current assets ................................................................................................... 75,778 59,961\nNon-current inventories, net ............................................................................................ 24,888 12,526\nRental equipment, net ...................................................................................................... 21,587 28,199\nProperty, plant and equipment, net .................................................................................. 24,048 26,598\nOperating right-of-use assets ........................................................................................... 714 957\nGoodwill .......................................................................................................................... 736 736\nOther intangible assets, net .............................................................................................. 4,805 5,573\nOther non-current assets .................................................................................................. 486 506\nTotal assets ............................................................................................................... $ 153,042 $ 135,056\nLIABILITIES AND STOCKHOLDERS’ EQUITY\nCurrent liabilities:\nAccounts payable trade ................................................................................................ $ 6,659 $ 5,595\nContingent consideration ............................................................................................. — 175\nOperating lease liabilities ............................................................................................. 257 241\nOther current liabilities ................................................................................................ 12,882 6,616\nTotal current liabilities ............................................................................................. 19,798 12,627\nNon-current operating lease liabilities ............................................................................. 512 769\nDeferred tax liabilities, net .............................................................................................. 16 13\nTotal liabilities ......................................................................................................... 20,326 13,409\nCommitments and contingencies (Note 17)\nStockholders’ equity:\nPreferred stock, 1,000,000 shares authorized, no shares issued and outstanding ........ — —\nCommon stock, $.01 par value, 20,000,000 shares authorized, 14,030,481 and\n13,863,233 shares issued, respectively; and 13,188,489 and 13,021,241 shares\noutstanding, respectively .......................................................................................... 140 139\nAdditional paid-in capital ............................................................................................ 96,040 94,667\nRetained earnings ......................................................................................................... 61,860 49,654\nAccumulated other comprehensive loss .......................................................................

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies:\nThe Company\nGeospace Technologies Corporation (“Geospace”) designs and manufactures instruments and equipment used by the oil\nand gas industry to acquire seismic data in order to locate, characterize and monitor hydrocarbon producing reservoirs.\nGeospace also designs and manufactures Adjacent Markets products including industrial products, imaging equipment, and\nprovides contract manufacturing services, and Emerging Market products consisting of border and perimeter security\nproducts. Geospace and its subsidiaries are referred to collectively as the “Company”.\nBasis of Presentation\nThe accompanying financial statements present the consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows\nof the Company in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (\"U.S. GAAP\").\nAll significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires the use of estimates and assumptions that\naffect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. The Company considers many factors in\nselecting appropriate operational and financial accounting policies and controls and in developing the estimates and\nassumptions that are used in the preparation of these financial statements. The Company continually evaluates its estimates,\nincluding those related to revenue recognition, bad debt reserves, collectability of rental revenue, inventory obsolescence\nreserves, self-insurance reserves, product warranty reserves, useful lives of long-lived assets, impairment of long-lived assets,\nimpairment of goodwill and other intangible assets, contingent consideration and deferred income tax assets. The Company\nbases its estimates on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the\ncircumstances. While management believes current estimates are reasonable and appropriate, actual results may differ from\nthese estimates under different conditions or assumptions.\nCash and Cash Equivalents\nThe Company considers all highly liquid investments purchased with an original or remaining maturity at the time of\npurchase of three months or less to be cash equivalents. At September 30, 2023 and 2022, the Company had restricted cash\nof $0.2 million on deposit with a bank, which serves as collateral on employee issued credit cards. At September 30, 2023,\ncash and cash equivalents included $3.8 million held by the Company’s foreign subsidiaries and branch offices, including\n$2.5 million held by its subsidiary in the Russian Federation. In response to sanctions imposed by the United States and others\non Russia, the Russian government has imposed restrictions on companies' abilities to repatriate or otherwise remit cash from\ntheir Russian-based operations to locations outside of Russia. As a result, this cash can be used in our Russian operations, but\nthe Company may be unable to transfer it out of Russia without incurring substantial costs, if at all. In addition, if the Company\nwere to repatriate the cash held by its Russian subsidiary, it would be required to accrue and pay taxes on any amount\nrepatriated. During fiscal year 2023, in light of recent volatility in the financial markets, the Company entered into an IntraFi\nCash Service (\"ICS\") Deposit Placement Agreement with IntraFi Network LLC through its primary bank, Woodforest\nNational Bank. The ICS program offers access to unlimited Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (\"FDIC') insurance on\nthe Company's domestically held cash in excess of $5.0 million, thereby mitigating its risk of falling outside of FDIC coverage\nlimits.\nConcentrations of Risk\nCredit\nThe Company maintains its cash in bank deposit accounts that, at times, exceed federally insured limits. Management of\nthe Company believes that the financial strength of the financial institutions holding such deposits minimizes the credit risk\nof such deposits.\nF-10\nGeospace Technologies Corporation and Subsidiaries\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements—(Continued)\nThe Company sells products to customers throughout the United States and various foreign countries. The Company’s\nnormal credit terms for trade receivables are 30 days. In certain situations, credit terms may be extended to 60 days or longer.\nThe Company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers and generally does not require collateral for its trade\nreceivables. Additionally, the Company provides long-term financing in the form of promissory notes and sales-type leases\nwhen competitive conditions require such financing. In such cases, the Company may require collateral. Allowances are\nrecognized for potential credit losses. Two customers comprised 26.7% and 11.7% of the Company’s revenue during fiscal\nyear 2023. At September 30, 2023, the Company had trade accounts and financing receivables from these customers of $3.5\nmillion and $4.8 million, respectively. One customer comprised 29.3% of the Company’s revenue during fiscal year 2022.\nAt September 30, 2022, the Company had trade accounts and financing receivables from this customer of $5.5 million.\nSupplier\nCertain models of the Company’s oil and gas marine wireless products require a timing device it purchases from a United\nStates manufacturer. The Company currently does not possess the ability to manufacture this component and has no other\nreliable source for this device. If this manufacturer were to discontinue its production of this timing device, were to become\nunwilling to contract with the Company on competitive terms or were unable to supply the component in sufficient quantities\nto meet its requirements, the Company’s ability to compete in the marine wireless marketplace could be impaired, which\ncould adversely affect its financial performance. The device is used in certain models of the Company’s rental equipment.\nProduct sales requiring this device represented approximately 4% and 11% of the Company's revenue in fiscal year 2023\nand 2022, respectively.\nThe Company purchases all of its thermal film from one manufacturer for its imaging products. Except for the film sold\nto the Company by this manufacturer, the Company knows of no other source for thermal film that performs as well in its\nimaging equipment. If the manufacturer were to discontinue producing thermal film, were to become unwilling to contract\nwith the Company on competitive terms or were unable to supply thermal film in sufficient quantities to meet its requirements,\nthe Company’s ability to compete in the direct thermal imaging marketplace could be impaired, which could adversely affect\nits financial performance. Thermal film sales represented approximately 5% and 8% of the Company’s revenue in fiscal year\n2023 and 2022, respectively.\nArmed Conflict Between Russia and Ukraine\nA portion of the Company's oil and gas product manufacturing is conducted through its wholly-owned subsidiary\nGeospace Technologies Eurasia LLC, (\"GTE\") which is based in the Russian Federation. In February 2022, the Russian\nFederation launched a full-scale military invasion of Ukraine. Although the length and impact of the ongoing military conflict\nis highly unpredictable, the conflict in Ukraine could lead to market disruptions, including significant volatility in commodity\nprices, credit and capital markets, as well as supply chain interruptions in addition to any direct impact on the Company's\noperations in Russia. As a result of the invasion, the governments of several western nations, including the United States,\nCanada, the United Kingdom, the European Union, implemented new and/or expanded economic sanctions and export\nrestrictions against Russia, Russian-backed separatist regions in Ukraine, certain banks, companies, government officials,\nand other individuals in Russia and Belarus. The implementation of theses sanctions and exports restrictions, in combinations\nwith the withdrawal of numerous private companies from the Russian market, which has had, and is likely to continue to\nhave, a negative impact on the Company's business in the region. The rapid changes in rules and implementation of new\nrules on imports and exports of goods involving Russia has also led to serious delays in getting goods to or from Russia as\nport authorities struggle to keep up with the changing environment. If imports of these products from the Russian Federation\nare restricted by government regulation, the Company may be forced to find other sources for the manufacturing of these\nproducts at potentially higher costs. Likewise, restrictions on the Company's ability to send products to GTE, may force our\nsubsidiary to have to find other sources for the manufacturing of these products at potentially higher costs. However, the\nCompany's exports to GTE have historically been limited. The risk of doing business in the Russian Federation and other\neconomically or politically volatile areas could adversely affect the Company's operations and earnings.\nThe Company is actively monitoring the situation in Ukraine and Russia and assessing its impact on its business, including\nGTE. The net carrying value of GTE on the Company's consolidated balance sheet at September 30, 2023 was $5.8 million.\nGTE generated $1.8 million in revenue from domestic sales and the Company imported $3.8 million of products from GTE\nin fiscal year 2023. The Company has no way to predict the duration, progress or outcome of the military conflict in Ukraine.\nThe extent and duration of the military action, sanctions, and resulting market disruptions could be significant and could\npotentially have substantial impact on the global economy and the Company's business for an unknown period of time.\nF-11\nGeospace Technologies Corporation and Subsidiaries\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements—(Continued)\nInventories\nThe Company records a write-down of its inventories when the cost basis of any manufactured product, including any\nestimated future costs to complete the manufacturing process, exceeds its net realizable value. Inventories are stated at the\nlower of cost or net realizable value. Cost is determined on the first-in, first-out method, except that certain of the Company’s\nforeign subsidiaries use an average cost method to value their inventories.\nThe Company periodically reviews the composition of its inventories to determine if market demand, product\nmodifications, technology changes, excessive quantities on-hand and other factors hinder our ability to recover its investment\nin such inventories. The Company’s assessment is based upon historical product demand, estimated future product demand\nand various other judgments and estimates. Inventory obsolescence reserves are recorded when such assessments reveal that\nportions or components of the Company’s inventory investment will not be realized in its operating activities.\nThe Company reviews it inventories for classification purposes. The value of inventories not expected to be realized in\ncash, sold or consumed during its next operating cycle are classified as non-current assets.\nProperty, Plant and Equipment and Rental Equipment\nProperty, plant and equipment and rental equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation expense is calculated using the\nstraight-line method over the following estimated useful lives:\nYears\nRental equipment ................................................................................................................................... 2 - 5\nProperty, plant and equipment:\nMachinery and equipment ................................................................................................................. 3 - 15\nBuildings and building improvements ............................................................................................... 10 - 50\nOther .................................................................................................................................................. 5 - 10\nExpenditures for renewals and betterments are capitalized. Repairs and maintenance expenditures are charged to expense\nas incurred. The cost and accumulated depreciation of assets sold or otherwise disposed of are removed from the accounts\nand any gain or loss thereon is reflected in the statements of operations.\nImpairment of Long-lived Assets\nThe Company’s long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever an event or change in circumstances indicates\nthe carrying amount of an asset or group of assets may not be recoverable. The impairment review, if necessary, includes a\ncomparison of expected future cash flows (undiscounted and without interest charges) to be generated by an asset group with\nthe associated carrying value of the related assets. If the carrying value of the asset group exceeds the expected future cash\nflows, an impairment loss is recognized to the extent that the carrying value of the asset group exceeds its fair value.\nAt September 30, 2023, in light of the Company's historical operating losses on its Emerging Markets reporting unit, the\nCompany assessed the carrying value of the long-lived assets of its Emerging Markets asset group and determined that the\nundiscounted cash flows exceeded the carrying value. As a result, no impairment charges were necessary to the Company's\nlong-lived assets of this asset group.\nGoodwill\nThe Company conducts its evaluation of goodwill at the reporting unit level on an annual basis as of September 30 and\nmore frequently if events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value. The\nguidance on the testing of goodwill for impairment provides the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine if the\nfair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount. If, based on the qualitative assessment of events or circumstances,\nan entity determines it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is more than its carrying amount then it is\nnot necessary to perform a quantitative assessment. However, if an entity concludes otherwise, then a quantitative assessment\nmust be performed. If, based on the quantitative assessment, the Company determines that the fair value of a reporting unit\nis less that its carrying amount, a goodwill impairment is recognized equal to the difference between the carrying amount of\nthe reporting unit and its fair value, not to exceed the carrying amount of the goodwill.\nF-12\nGeospace Technologies Corporation and Subsidiaries\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements—(Continued)\nOther Intangible Assets\nIntangible assets are carried at cost, net of accumulated amortization. The estimated useful life of the Company’s other\nintangible assets are evaluated each reporting period to determine whether events or circumstances warrant a revision to the\nremaining amortization period. If the estimate of an intangible asset’s remaining useful life is changed, the amortization\nperiod should be changed prospectively. Amortization expense is calculated using the straight-line method over the following\nestimated useful lives:\nYears\nDeveloped technology .............................................................................................................................. 18\nTrade names ............................................................................................................................................. 5\nCustomer relationships ............................................................................................................................. 4\nNon-compete agreements ......................................................................................................................... 4\nRevenue Recognition\nSee Note 2 to these consolidated financial statements.\nResearch and Development Costs\nThe Company expenses research and development costs as incurred. Research and development costs include salaries,\nemployee benefit costs, department supplies, direct project costs and other related costs.\nProduct Warranties\nMost of the Company’s products do not require installation assistance or sophisticated instructions. The Company offers\na standard product warranty obligating it to repair or replace equipment with manufacturing defects. The Company maintains\na reserve for future warranty costs based on historical experience or, in the absence of historical product experience,\nmanagement’s estimates. Reserves for future warranty costs are included within other current liabilities on the consolidated\nbalance sheets.\nChanges in the product warranty reserve are reflected in the following table (in thousands):\nBalance at October 1, 2021 ................................................................................................................... $ 379\nAccruals for warranties issued during the year...................................................................................... 1,431\nSettlements made (in cash or in kind) during the year .......................................................................... (1,286)\nBalance at September 30, 2022 ............................................................................................................. 524\nAccruals for warranties issued during the year...................................................................................... 1,655\nSettlements made (in cash or in kind) during the year .......................................................................... (1,521)\nBalance at September 30, 2023 ............................................................................................................. $ 658\nStock-Based Compensation\nThe Company accounts for stock-based compensation, including grants of restricted awards and unqualified stock options\nin accordance with Accounting Standards Codification Topic 718, which requires that all share-based payments (to the extent\nthat they are compensatory) be recognized as an expense in the Company’s consolidated statements of operations based on\ntheir fair values on the award date and the estimated number of shares it ultimately expects to vest.\nThe Company recognizes stock-based compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period of\nthe award. The Company’s stock-based compensation plan and awards are more fully described in Note 14 to these\nconsolidated financial statements.\nF-13\nGeospace Technologies Corporation and Subsidiaries\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements—(Continued)\nForeign Currency Gains and Losses\nThe assets and liabilities of the Company’s foreign subsidiaries and branch offices that have a foreign currency as their\nfunctional currency have been translated into U.S. dollars using the exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date. Results\nof operations have been translated using the average exchange rates during the year. Resulting translation adjustments have\nbeen recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss in stockholders’ equity. Foreign currency transaction\ngains and losses are included in the statements of operations as they occur. Transaction gains and losses on intra-entity foreign\ncurrency transactions and balances, including advances and demand notes payable on which settlement is not planned or\nanticipated in the foreseeable future, are recorded in “accumulated other comprehensive loss” on our consolidated balance\nsheets.\nFair Value\nFair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or the amount paid to transfer a liability in an orderly\ntransaction between market participants (an exit price) at the measurement date. U.S. GAAP has established a fair value\nhierarchy which prioritizes the inputs to the valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three levels. These levels\nare determined based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement. Level 1 represents unadjusted\nquoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities. Level 2 represents quoted prices for similar assets and\nliabilities in active markets (other than those included in Level 1) which are observable, either directly or indirectly. Level 3\nrepresents valuations derived from valuation techniques in which one or more significant inputs or significant value drivers\nare unobservable. Also see Note 4 to these consolidated financial statements.\nIncome Taxes\nIncome taxes are presented in accordance with the Accounting Standards Codification Topic 740 (“Topic 740”) guidance\nfor accounting for income taxes. The estimated future tax effects of temporary differences between the tax basis of assets and\nliabilities and amounts reported in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets, as well as operating loss and tax credit\ncarrybacks and carryforwards are recorded. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between\nfinancial reporting and tax basis of assets and liabilities (temporary differences) and are measured using the enacted tax rates\nand laws that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse. The Company periodically reviews the\nrecoverability of tax assets recorded on the balance sheet and provides valuation allowances if it is more likely than not that\nsuch assets will not be realized.\nThe Company follows the guidance of Topic 740 to analyze all tax positions that are less than certain. Topic 740 prescribes\na recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position\ntaken or expected to be taken in a tax return. In accordance with Topic 740, the Company recognizes in its financial statements\nthe impact of a tax position if that position is “more likely than not” to be sustained on audit, based on the technical merits of\nthe position. The Company’s estimate of the potential outcome of any uncertain tax issue is subject to management’s\nassessment of relevant risks, facts, and circumstances existing at that time. The Company classifies interest and penalties\nassociated with the payment of income taxes, if any, in the Other Income (Expense) section of its consolidated statements of\noperations.\nRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements\nIn June 2016, the FASB issued guidance surrounding credit losses for financial instruments that replaces the incurred loss\nimpairment methodology in U.S. GAAP. The new impairment model requires immediate recognition of estimated credit\nlosses expected to occur for most financial assets and certain other financial instruments. For available-for-sale debt securities\nwith unrealized losses, credit losses will be recognized as allowances rather than reductions in the amortized cost of the\nsecurities. As a smaller reporting company, the Company must adopt this standard on October 1, 2023. The standard’s\nprovisions will be applied as a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of the first effective\nreporting period. The Company will adopt this standard on October 1, 2023 and does not expect the adoption of this standard\nto have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements.\nF-14\nGeospace Technologies Corporation and Subsidiaries\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements—(Continued)\n2. Revenue Recognition\nIn accordance with ASC Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (“ASC 606”), the Company recognizes\nrevenue when performance of contractual obligations are satisfied, generally when control of the promised goods or services\nis transferred to its customers, in an amount that reflects the consideration it expects to be entitled to in exchange for those\ngoods or services.\nThe Company primarily derives product revenue from the sale of its manufactured products. Revenue from these product\nsales, including the sale of used rental equipment, is recognized when obligations under the terms of a contract are satisfied,\ncontrol is transferred and collectability of the sales price is probable. The Company records deferred revenue when customer\nfunds are received prior to shipment or delivery or performance has not yet occurred. The Company assesses collectability\nduring the contract assessment phase. In situations where collectability of the sales price is not probable, the Company\nrecognizes revenue when it determines that collectability is probable or when non-refundable cash is received from its\ncustomers and there is not a significant right of return. Transfer of control generally occurs with shipment or delivery,\ndepending on the terms of the underlying contract. The Company’s products are generally sold without any customer\nacceptance provisions, and the Company’s standard terms of sale do not allow customers to return products for credit.\nRevenue from engineering services is recognized as services are rendered over the duration of a project, or as billed on a\nper hour basis. Field service revenue is recognized when services are rendered and is generally priced on a per day rate.\nThe Company also generates revenue from short-term rentals under operating leases of its manufactured products. Rental\nrevenue is recognized as earned over the rental period if collectability of the rent is reasonably assured. Rentals of the\nCompany’s equipment generally range from daily rentals to minimum rental periods of up to one year. The Company has\ndetermined that ASC 606 does not apply to rental contracts, which are within the scope of ASC Topic 842, Leases.\nAs permissible under ASC 606, sales taxes and transaction-based taxes are excluded from revenue. The Company does\nnot disclose the value of unsatisfied performance obligations for contracts with an original expected duration of one year or\nless. Additionally, the Company expenses costs incurred to obtain contracts when incurred because the amortization period\nwould have been one year or less. These costs are recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses.\nThe Company has elected to treat shipping and handling activities in a sales transaction after the customer obtains control\nof the goods as a fulfillment cost and not as a promised service. Accordingly, fulfillment costs related to the shipping and\nhandling of goods are accrued at the time of shipment. Amounts billed to a customer in a sales transaction related to\nreimbursable shipping and handling costs are included in revenue, and the associated costs incurred by the Company for\nreimbursable shipping and handling expenses are reported in cost of revenue. The Company incurred shipping and handling\nexpenses of $0.5 million and $0.6 million, respectively, for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nAt September 30, 2023, the Company had deferred contract liabilities of $0.7 million and no deferred contract costs. At\nSeptember 30, 2022, the Company had no deferred contract liabilities or deferred contract cost. During the fiscal years ended\nSeptember 30, 2023 and 2022, no revenue was recognized from deferred contract liabilities and no cost of revenue was\nrecognized from deferred contract costs. At September 30, 2023, all contracts had an original duration of one year or less.\nF-15\nGeospace Technologies Corporation and Subsidiaries\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements—(Continued)\nFor each of the Company’s operating segments, the following table presents revenue only from the sale of products and\nthe performance of services under contracts with customers (in thousands).

Investments\nShort-term Investments\nThe Company classifies its short-term investments as available-for-sale securities. Available-for-sale securities are carried\nat fair market value with net unrealized gains and losses reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss\nin stockholders’ equity. No gains or losses were realized from the sale of short-term investments for the fiscal year ended\nSeptember 30, 2023. The Company realized losses of $22,000 from the sale of short-term investments for the fiscal year\nended September 30, 2022.\nThe Company’s short-term investments were composed of the following (in thousands):\nAS OF SEPTEMBER 30, 2023\nAmortized Unrealized Unrealized Estimated Fair\nCost Gains Losses Value\nShort-term investments:\nCorporate bonds ................................................ $ 11,310 $ — $ (15 ) $ 11,295\nU.S. treasury securities and securities of U.S.\ngovernment-sponsored agency ...................... 3,622 4 — 3,626\nTotal .................................................................. $ 14,932 $ 4 $ (15 ) $ 14,921\nAS OF SEPTEMBER 30, 2022\nAmortized Unrealized Unrealized Estimated Fair\nCost Gains Losses Value\nShort-term investments:\nCorporate bonds ................................................ $ 909 $ — $ (15 ) $ 894\nTotal .................................................................. $ 909 $ — $ (15 ) $ 894\nThe Company’s short-term investments have contractual maturities ranging from January 2024 to September 2024.\nF-17\nGeospace Technologies Corporation and Subsidiaries\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements—(Continued)\n4. Fair Value of Financial Instruments\nThe Company’s financial instruments generally include cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, trade accounts,\nfinancing receivables and accounts payable. Due to the short-term maturities of cash and cash equivalents, trade accounts\nreceivable, financing receivables and accounts payable, the carrying amounts approximate fair value on the respective balance\nsheet dates. The valuation technique used to measure the fair value of the contingent consideration was derived from models\nutilizing market observable inputs.\nThe Company measures its short-term investments and contingent consideration at fair value on a recurring basis.\nThe following tables present the fair value of the Company’s short-term investments and contingent consideration by\nvaluation hierarchy and input (in thousands):\nAS OF SEPTEMBER 30, 2023\nQuoted\nPrices in\nActive\nMarkets for Significant\nIdentical Other Significant\nAssets Unobservable Unobservable\n(Level 1) (Level 2) (Level 3) Totals\nShort-term investments: .\nCorporate bonds ........................................................ $ — $ 11,295 $ — $ 11,295\nU.S. treasury securities and securities of U.S.\ngovernment-sponsored agency .............................. 3,626 3,626\nTotal assets ............................................................... $ — $ 14,921 $ — $ 14,921\nAS OF SEPTEMBER 30, 2022\nQuoted\nPrices in\nActive\nMarkets for Significant\nIdentical Other Significant\nAssets Unobservable Unobservable\n(Level 1) (Level 2) (Level 3) Totals\nShort-term investments:\nCorporate bonds ........................................................ $ — $ 894 $ — $ 894\nTotal assets ............................................................... $ — $ 894 $ — $ 894\nContingent consideration liabilities:\nContingent consideration liabilities .......................... — — 175 175\nTotal liabilities .......................................................... $ — $ — $ 175 $ 175\nAssets and Liabilities Measured on a Nonrecurring Basis\nThe measurements utilized to determine the implied fair value of the Company's Emerging Markets reporting unit as of\nSeptember 30, 2022 represented significant unobservable inputs (Level 3).

The majority of the Company’s rental revenue is generated from its marine-based wireless seismic data acquisition\nsystem.\nThe Company regularly evaluates the collectability of its lease receivables on a lease-by-lease basis. The evaluation\nprimarily consists of reviewing past due account balances and other factors such as the credit quality of the customer,\nhistorical trends of the customer and current economic conditions. The Company suspends revenue recognition when the\ncollectability of amounts due are no longer probable and concurrently records a direct write-off of the lease receivable to\nrental revenue to limit rental revenue recognized to the cash collections received. As of September 30, 2023, the Company’s\ntrade accounts receivables included lease receivables of $9.0 million.\nF-21\nGeospace Technologies Corporation and Subsidiaries\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements—(Continued)\nRental revenue related to leased equipment for fiscal years 2023 and 2022 was $51.0 million and $24.9 million,\nrespectively.\nFuture minimum lease obligations due from the Company's leasing customers as of September 30, 2023 were $29.6\nmillion, the majority of which is due within the next 12 months.\nRental equipment consisted of the following (in thousands):\nAS OF SEPTEMBER 30,\n2023 2022\nRental equipment, primarily wireless recording equipment ......................... $ 82,926 $ 83,153\nAccumulated depreciation and impairment ..................................................

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets\nAt September 30, 2023, the Company had goodwill of $0.7 million and other intangible assets, net of $0.5 million\nattributable to its Adjacent Markets reporting unit; other intangible assets, net of $3.0 million attributable to its Emerging\nMarkets reporting unit; and other intangible assets, net of $1.3 million attributable to its Oil and Gas Markets reporting unit.\nGoodwill represents the excess cost of a business acquired over the fair market value of identifiable net assets at the date of\nacquisition.\nAt September 30, 2023, in light of the Company's historical losses on its Emerging Markets reporting unit, the Company\npreformed a recoverability assessment on the long-lived assets of its Emerging Markets asset group in which its carrying\nvalue was compared to estimated undiscounted cash flows over the remaining useful life of the asset group's primary asset,\nits developed technology. The Company determined that no impairment was necessary as the future undiscounted cash flows\nexceeded the carrying value. Key assumptions used in the analysis include revenue, gross margin and cash flow\nprojections. The estimated cash flows include obtaining additional contracts with CBP and other current customers. The\nEmerging Markets asset group could incur impairment charges in the future to its other intangible assets if it is unable to\nobtain additional contracts from the CBP or other customers.\nAt September 30, 2022, the Company assessed the goodwill associated with both its Adjacent Markets and Emerging\nMarkets reporting units for impairment. As a result of the assessment, the Company determined that the fair value of its\nEmerging Markets reporting unit was less than its carrying amount and recorded an impairment charge of $4.3 million for\nthe entire goodwill associated with this reporting unit for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022. No impairment charge\nto the Adjacent Markets asset group was necessary for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022 as its future undiscounted\ncash flows exceeded the carrying value.\nAlso see Note 1 to these consolidated financial statements.\nF-23\nGeospace Technologies Corporation and Subsidiaries\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements—(Continued)\nThe Company’s consolidated goodwill and other intangible assets consisted of the following (in thousands):\nWeighted-\nAverage\nRemaining\nUseful Lives\n(in years) AS OF SEPTEMBER 30,\n2023 2022\nGoodwill:\nEmerging Markets reporting unit ................................... $ 4,336 $ 4,336\nAdjacent Markets reporting unit .................................... 736 736\nTotal goodwill ................................................................... 5,072 5,072\nAccumulated impairment losses ........................................

Stockholders’ Equity\nIn February 2014, the board of directors and stockholders approved the 2014 Long Term Incentive Plan, as amended (the\n“2014 Plan”). Under the 2014 Plan, an aggregate of 3,000,000 shares of common stock may be issued. The Company is\nauthorized to issue nonqualified and incentive stock options to purchase common stock, restricted stock awards (“RSAs”)\nand restricted stock units (“RSUs”) to key employees, directors and consultants under the 2014 Plan.

The exercise price of any option may not\nbe less than the fair market value of the common stock on the date of grant. In the case of incentive stock options granted to\nan employee owning ten percent or more of the outstanding shares of common stock, the exercise price of such option may\nnot be less than 110% of the fair market value of the common stock on the date of grant. An RSU represents a contingent\nF-25\nGeospace Technologies Corporation and Subsidiaries\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements—(Continued)\nright to receive one share of the common stock upon vesting. Under the 2014 Plan, the Company may issue RSAs and RSUs\nto employees for no payment by the employee or for a payment below the fair market value on the date of grant.

On September 30, 2023, the\nCompany had $3.8 million of cash and cash equivalents held by its foreign subsidiaries. On September 30, 2023 and 2022,\nthe temporary difference related to undistributed earnings for which no deferred taxes have been provided was approximately\n$8.2 million and $6.9 million, respectively.\nThe Company is subject to taxation in the United States as well as various states and foreign jurisdictions. Tax years that\nremain subject to examination by significant tax jurisdictions are the United States for tax years ending after 2016, Russia for\ntax years ending after 2020, the United Kingdom for tax years ending after 2021, and Canada for tax years ending after 2019.\nAs of September 30, 2023, the Company had net operating loss (“NOL”) carry-forwards of approximately $78.2 million\nin the United States, $18.9 million in Canada and $0.7 million in Russia which are available to offset future taxable income\nin those jurisdictions. The NOL carry-forwards for Canada and Russia begin to expire in 2033 and 2026, respectively. The\nNOL carry-forward for the United States which originated prior to the 2017 Tax Act of $32.6 million begins to expire in 2029\nand those originating after the 2017 Tax Act of $45.6 million do not expire.\nManagement of the Company has concluded that it was not more-likely-than-not that its U.S., Canadian and Russian net\ndeferred tax assets will be realized in accordance with U.S. GAAP. On September 30, 2023 and September 30, 2022, the\nCompany had a valuation allowance against its U.S. net deferred tax assets of $33.7 million and $35.5 million, respectively.\nOn September 30, 2023 and September 30, 2022, the Company had a valuation allowance against its Canadian net deferred\ntax assets of $4.8 million and $5.2 million, respectively. On September 30, 2023 and September 30, 2022, the Company had\na valuation allowance against its Russian net deferred tax assets of $0.4 million and $0.7 million, respectively.\nF-28\nGeospace Technologies Corporation and Subsidiaries\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements—(Continued)\n16. Income (Loss) Per Common Share\nBasic earnings (loss) per share is computed by dividing net income (loss) available to common stockholders by the\nweighted average number of common shares used in basic earnings (loss) per share during the period. Diluted earnings (loss)\nper share is determined on the assumption that outstanding RSUs have been exchanged for common stock and outstanding\ndilutive stock options have been exercised and the aggregate proceeds as defined were used to reacquire common stock using\nthe average price of such common stock for the period.\nThe following table summarizes the calculation of net income (loss) and weighted average common shares and common\nequivalent shares outstanding for purposes of the computation of earnings (loss) per share (in thousands, except share and\nper share amounts):\nYEAR ENDED SEPTEMBER 30,\n2023 2022\nNet income (loss) ................................................................................................ $ 12,206 $ (22,856)\nLess: Income allocable to unvested restricted stock ............................................ — —\nIncome (loss) attributable to common shareholders for diluted earnings (loss)\nper share ........................................................................................................... $ 12,206 $ (22,856)\nWeighted average number of common share equivalents:\nCommon shares used in basic earnings (loss) per share .................................. 13,146,085 12,987,996\nCommon share equivalents outstanding related to RSUs .................................... 68,981 —\nTotal weighted average common shares and common share equivalents used in\ndiluted earnings (loss) per share ...................................................................... 13,215,066 12,987,996\nEarnings (loss) per share:\nBasic ................................................................................................................ $ 0.93 $ (1.76)\nDiluted ............................................................................................................. $ 0.92 $ (1.76)\nFor the calculation of diluted earnings (loss) per share for fiscal years 2023 and 2022, RSUs of 308,568 and 323,859,\nrespectively, were excluded in the calculation of weighted average shares outstanding as a result of their impact being\nantidilutive.\n17. Commitments and Contingencies\nContingent Compensation Costs\nIn connection with the acquisition of Aquana, LLC (\"Aquana\") in July 2021, the Company is subject to additional\ncontingent cash payments to the former members of Aquana over a six-year earn-out period. The contingent payments, if\nany, will be derived from certain eligible revenue generated during the earn-out period from products and services sold by\nAquana. There is no maximum limit to the contingent cash payments that could be made. The merger agreement with Aquana\nrequires the continued employment of a certain key employee and former member of Aquana for the first four years of the\nsix year earn-out period in order for any of Aquana’s former members to be eligible to any earn-out payments. Due to the\ncontinued employment requirement, no liability has been recorded for the estimated fair value of contingent earn-out\npayments for this transaction. Earn-outs achieved, if any, will be recorded as compensation expense when incurred. No\neligible revenue has been generated to date.\nLegal Proceedings\nThe Company is involved in various pending legal actions in the ordinary course of its business. Management is unable\nto predict the ultimate outcome of these actions, because of the inherent uncertainty of such actions. However, management\nbelieves that the most probable, ultimate resolution of current pending matters will not have a material adverse effect on the\nCompany’s consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.\nF-29\nGeospace Technologies Corporation and Subsidiaries\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements—(Continued)\n18.

Exit and Disposal Activities\nDuring the first quarter of fiscal year 2023, the Company implemented a plan to discontinue the manufacture of certain\nlow margin, low revenue products and reconfigure our production facilities to lower our costs and raise efficiencies. As part\nof the plan, reductions were made to the Company's workforce which are expected to yield an annual savings of more than\n$2 million. In connection with the plan, the Company incurred costs of $0.6 million in the first quarter of fiscal year 2023,\nprimarily termination costs related to the workforce reduction. The costs were recorded both to cost of revenue and operating\nexpenses in the consolidated statement of operations. No significant future costs are expected.

Statements that contain these words should be\nread carefully because they discuss our future expectations, contain projections of our future results of operations or of our financial position or\nstate other forward-looking information. Examples of forward-looking statements include, among others, statements that we make regarding our\nexpected operating results, the adoption, results and success of our rollout of our Aquana smart water valves and cloud-based control platform,\nfuture demand for our Quantum security solutions, the adoption and sale of our products in various geographic regions, potential tenders for\nPRM systems, future demand for OBX systems, the completion of new orders for our channels of our GCL system, the fulfillment of customer\npayment obligations, the impact of and the recovery from the impact of the coronavirus (or COVID-19) pandemic, the impact of the current armed\nconflict between Russia and Ukraine, our ability to manage changes and the continued health or availability of management personnel, volatility\nand direction of oil prices, anticipated levels of capital expenditures and the sources of funding therefor, and our strategy for growth, product\ndevelopment, market position, financial results and the provision of accounting reserves. These forward-looking statements reflect our current\njudgment about future events and trends based on the information currently available to us. However, there will likely be events in the future that\nwe are not able to predict or control. The factors listed under the caption “Risk Factors”, as well as cautionary language in this Annual Report on\nForm 10-K, provide examples of risks, uncertainties and events that may cause our actual results to differ materially from the expectations we\ndescribe in our forward-looking statements. Such examples include, but are not limited to, the failure of the Quantum or OptoSeis® or Aquana\ntechnology transactions to yield positive operating results, decreases in commodity price levels and continued adverse impact of COVID-19\nwhich could reduce demand for our products, the failure of our products to achieve market acceptance (despite substantial investment by us)\nour sensitivity to short term backlog, delayed or cancelled customer orders, product obsolescence resulting from poor industry conditions or\nnew technologies, bad debt write-offs associated with customer accounts, inability to collect on promissory notes, lack of further orders for our\nOBX systems, failure of our Quantum products to be adopted by the border and perimeter security market, or a decrease in such market due to\ngovernmental changes, and infringement or failure to protect intellectual property. The occurrence of the events described in these risk factors\nand elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial\nposition, and actual events and results of operations may vary materially from our current expectations. We assume no obligation to revise or\nupdate any forward-looking statement, whether written or oral, that we may make from time to time, whether as a result of new information,\nfuture developments or otherwise, except as required by applicable securities laws and regulations.\nGROWTH. DIVERSITY. QUALITY.\nDear Fellow Shareholders,\nThis year, we came out of a tumultuous and unpredictable time following\na global pandemic to find the world still struggling with supply chain\nRick Wheeler\nlimitations and rising costs on goods and services. Given the continued\nuncertainty that exists for businesses worldwide, I’m incredibly grateful for the\ndedication of our employees, the loyalty of our valued customers, and the strong support and confidence\ngiven by our board of directors and shareholders.\nReflecting on the past year, our company has truly seen the fruits of the guiding strategies we implemented\nnearly a decade ago and continue fostering today. We set out to diversify into non-oil and gas businesses,\npreserve the strength of our balance sheet and maintain a core focus on innovation. Record setting growth\nin our Adjacent Markets segment illustrates our diversification successes, culminating in our Exile graphic\nimaging products, water meter cables and connectors, and contract manufacturing services each setting\nnew full-year records of their own.\nOur predilection for innovation spans our market diversification as well. This fall, we introduced the\nMariner™, a slim profile ocean bottom node to meet the growing needs of our E&P customers. Additionally,\nwe introduced our Aquana Smart Water Valve to both the municipal utilities market as well as the\ncommercial and residential building control market. Lastly, we transitioned Quantum’s SADAR offering to\na solution applicable to the emerging carbon storage and microseismic monitoring markets.\nFinancial Results\nOur total revenue in fiscal year 2022 reached just over $89 million, reflecting a reduction of 6% from last\nyear’s figure. This led to a loss of $1.76 per share. However, at the close of the year, the Company’s total\nliquidity stood at $25.5 million, which included $17.0 million in cash, cash equivalents and short-term\ninvestments. This amount was augmented by an additional borrowing availability of $8.5 million under\nour bank credit agreement which remained untapped with no borrowings outstanding. Adding further\nstrength to our balance sheet is the Company’s ownership of unencumbered property and real estate in\nboth domestic and international locations. Maintaining a balance sheet for a decade with no debt serves\nas a testament to our focus on conservative management of resources.\nOil & Gas Markets\nOur Oil & Gas Markets segment saw a modest decrease in revenue of 6% from last year. The slight reduction\nis attributed to lower demand for the purchase of our land and marine wireless products. However, this\nwas partially offset by greater utilization of our marine wireless rental fleet and higher demand for our\nseismic sensors. As the year concluded, we saw a noticeable, steady rise in the utilization of our OBX ocean\nbottom node recording systems, which drove a 38% year-over-year increase in revenue for the final quarter\nof the fiscal year. As an industry trend, we’re observing how many E&P companies strive to achieve lower\ncosts by exploring and finding new resources near producing fields, allowing them to leverage existing\noffshore assets. Our OBX systems provide a powerful tool in this search. As a result, the world’s increasing\ndemand for oil and natural gas is expected to create additional demand for our OBX systems in 2023.\nGEOSPACE TECHNOLOGIES ANNUAL REPORT 2022\nAdjacent Markets\nOur Company’s Adjacent Markets segment reported full-year revenue of $39.2 million, which represents an increase of 21%\nover last year. This growth highlights the ever strengthening sales of the Company’s smart water meter cable and connector\nproducts. Additional contributions came from higher demand for contract manufacturing services, greater sales of seismic\nsensors to industrial customers, and increased demand for imaging products. Each of these product groups and services\nset records for revenue generation in fiscal year 2022.\nEmerging Markets\nThe Emerging Markets segment generated $0.7 million in revenue in fiscal year 2022. At year-end, a standard accounting\nreview resulted in the decision to record a non-cash charge of $4.3 million for the impairment of goodwill related to our 2018\nacquisition of Quantum. Past performance of our Quantum acquisition has not met the necessary expectations required to\nsupport its goodwill on the balance sheet. However, our confidence in the technology and its potential for future revenue,\nincluding additional sales of our border and perimeter security products, remains positive. Having emerged from the delays\nassociated with COVID, Congressional budget challenges, and continuous turnover within the Department of Homeland\nSecurity, we anticipate an improvement in future opportunities.\nOther Events\nAs we prepare for fiscal year 2023 and beyond, reducing our costs and increasing our capacities to meet the growing\ndemands of certain products is top of mind. To this end, we began the elimination and disposal of machinery associated\nwith the manufacture of low revenue generating products, which will allow us to move our OBX rental operations to our main\nPinemont campus. Consolidating and streamlining these operations within our Pinemont facility is expected to improve\nefficiency and reduce costs. Separately, we will continue the enhancement of automation and tooling in our manufacturing\nand production lines to facilitate increased sales and revenue from our high demand growth Adjacent Markets products.\nConclusion\nIn conjunction with the successful expansion of our Adjacent Markets products we will continue to develop and deliver high\ntechnology products to our Oil & Gas Markets and Emerging Markets customers. Combining this with our moves to achieve\ngreater capacities and efficiencies, our confidence in the future is bolstered for increasing revenue, maintaining a strong\nbalance sheet, and providing profitable returns for our shareholders.\nWalter “Richard” Wheeler\nPresident & Chief Executive Officer\nGEOSPACE TECHNOLOGIES ANNUAL REPORT 2022\ngrowth\ndiversity\nquality\n\nUNITED STATES\nSECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION\nWashington,D.C.20549\nFORM 10-K\n☒☒ AnnualReportPursuanttoSection13or15(d)oftheSecuritiesExchangeActof1934fortheFiscalYear\nEndedSeptember30,2022\nOR\n☐☐ TransitionReportPursuanttoSection13or15(d)oftheSecuritiesExchangeActof1934\nCommissionfilenumber001-13601\nGEOSPACE TECHNOLOGIES CORPORATION\n(ExactNameofRegistrantasSpecifiedinItsCharter)\nTexas 76-0447780\n(StateorOtherJurisdictionof (I.R.S.

Geoscientists use seismic\ndata primarily in connection with the exploration, development and production of oil and gas reserves to map potential and known\nhydrocarbonbearingformationsandthegeologicstructuresthatsurroundthem. Thissegment’sproductsincludewirelessseismicdata\nacquisitionsystems,reservoircharacterizationproductsandservices,andtraditionalseismicexplorationproductssuchasgeophones,\nhydrophones,leaderwire, connectors, cables,marine streamerretrieval andsteeringdevicesandvariousotherseismic products.

Weprovidemanyofthecomponentsofseismic\ndata recording systems, including geophones, hydrophones, multi-component sensors, leader wire, geophone strings, connectors,\nseismictelemetrycablesandotherseismicrelatedproducts. Onland,ourcustomersusegeophones,leaderwire,cablesandconnectors\ntoreceiveandmeasureseismicreflectionsresultingfromanenergysourceintodatarecordingunits,whichstoretheseismicinformation\nfor subsequent processing and analysis. In the marine environment, large ocean-going vessels tow long seismic cables known as\n“streamers” containing hydrophones that are used to detect pressure changes. Hydrophones transmit electrical impulses back to the\nvessel’sdatarecordingunitwheretheseismicdataisstoredforsubsequentprocessingandanalysis. Ourmarineseismicproductsalso\nhelpsteerstreamerswhilebeingtowedandhelprecoverstreamersiftheybecomedisconnectedfromthevessel.\nOur seismic sensor, cable and connector products are compatible with most major competitive seismic data acquisition systems\ncurrently in use. Revenue from these products results primarily from seismic contractors purchasing our products as components of\nnewseismicdataacquisitionsystemsortorepairandreplacecomponentsofseismicdataacquisitionsystemsalreadyinuse.\nWirelessProducts\nWe have developed multiple versions of a land-based wireless (or nodal) seismic data acquisition system. Rather than utilizing\ninterconnecting cables as required by most traditional land data acquisition systems, each of our wireless stations operate as an\nindependentdatacollectionsystem,allowingforvirtuallyunlimitedchannelconfigurations. Asaresult,ourwirelesssystemsrequire\nless maintenance, which we believe allows our customers to operate more effectively and efficiently because of its reduced\nenvironmental impact, lower weight and ease of operation. Each wireless station is available in a single-channel or three-channel\n2\nconfiguration.

As a result, we have adopted what we think is a\nconservativeandprudentbusinessstrategywhichplacesafocusonsoundfinancialmanagementpractices,asoutlinedbelow. Wehave\nnotchangedourprimaryfocusoncontinuedinvestmentinproductresearchanddevelopment,selectiveacquisitionsandjointventures.\n• Continue Investment in Product Research and Development – Past periods of revenue growth were primarily driven\nthrough our internal development of new products for the oil and gas industry. In past years, our oil and gas product\ninnovations included the introduction of borehole seismology tools, land and seabed PRM systems and wireless data\nacquisitionsystemsforbothlandandmarineapplications.

Goingforward,we\nintendtocontinuesignificantinvestmentsinproductresearchanddevelopmentofnewoilandgastechnologiesaswellas\nproductsforourotherbusinesssegmentsinordertodiversifyandgrowourrevenuebase.\n• Selectively Pursue Acquisitions of Businesses with Technological and Engineering Overlap – The oil and gas industry\nperiodically experiences volatile business cycles requiring us to rapidly increase and decrease our business activities to\nmeet the industry’s demand for our products. This industry generally offers equipment manufacturers like us limited\nvisibility into new orders creating challenges for us to manage our manufacturing capacity, workforce, inventories and\nother working capital challenges. While our primary growth initiative is to expand our oil and gas seismic product\nofferings,asseenwithouracquisitionoftheOptoSeis®fiberopticsensingtechnologyinfiscalyear2019,wemayalso\nseekoutotherbusinessopportunitiesinadjacentmarketsandemergingmarketswhichcomplementourexistingoiland\n4\ngas seismic products, engineering and manufacturing capabilities, and company-wide culture. In order to diversify our\nrevenue base and expose us to different markets with different business cycles, we have directed these efforts toward\nbusinesses outside the oil and gas industry, as seen with our acquisition of Quantum in fiscal year 2018 and Aquana in\nfiscalyear2021.\n• FinancialManagement–Industryconditionssincefiscalyear2014haverequiredustoplaceincreasedemphasisoncash\nmanagementandpreservation.

Recently, crude oil prices have rebounded and held above February\n2020levels;however,alagintimetypicallyoccursbetweenhigheroilpricesandgreaterdemandforourOilandGasMarketssegment\nproducts.

Statements that contain these words should be\nread carefully because they discuss our future expectations, contain projections of our future results of operations or of our financial position or\nstate other forward-looking information. Examples of forward-looking statements include, among others, statements that we make regarding\nour expected operating results, the results and success of our transaction with Aquana, LLC, future demand for our Quantum security solutions,\nthe adoption and sale of our products in various geographic regions, potential tenders for PRM systems, future demand for OBX systems, the\ncompletion of new orders for our channels of our GCL system, the fulfillment of customer payment obligations, the impact of and the recovery\nfrom the impact of the coronavirus (or COVID-19) pandemic, the Company’s ability to manage changes and the continued health or availability of\nmanagement personnel, volatility and direction of oil prices, anticipated levels of capital expenditures and the sources of funding therefore, and\nour strategy for growth, product development, market position, financial results and the provision of accounting reserves. These forward-looking\nstatements reflect our current judgment about future events and trends based on the information currently available to us. However, there will\nlikely be events in the future that we are not able to predict or control. The factors listed under the caption “Risk Factors”, as well as cautionary\nlanguage in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, provide examples of risks, uncertainties and events that may cause our actual results to differ\nmaterially from the expectations we describe in our forward-looking statements. Such examples include, but are not limited to, the failure of the\nQuantum or OptoSeis® or Aquana technology transactions to yield positive operating results, decreases in commodity price levels and continued\nadverse impact of COVID-19 which could reduce demand for our products, the failure of our products to achieve market acceptance (despite\nsubstantial investment by us) our sensitivity to short-term backlog, delayed or cancelled customer orders, product obsolescence resulting from\npoor industry conditions or new technologies, bad debt write-offs associated with customer accounts, inability to collect on promissory notes,\nlack of further orders for our OBX systems, failure of our Quantum products to be adopted by the border and perimeter security market, or a\ndecrease in such market due to governmental changes, and infringement or failure to protect intellectual property. The occurrence of the events\ndescribed in these risk factors and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of\noperations and financial position, and actual events and results of operations may vary materially from our current expectations. We assume no\nobligation to revise or update any forward-looking statement, whether written or oral, that we may make from time to time, whether as a result of\nnew information, future developments or otherwise, except as required by applicable securities laws and regulations.\non our\nFOCUSING FUTURE\nDear Fellow Shareholders,\nWithin Geospace, we often reflect on our core values to guide our strategies and\ninfluence our decisions. Following a year of upheaval brought on by COVID-19, this\nwas never more critical than in 2021. Both domestic and global commerce experienced a\nrevolving door of shutdowns and re-openings related to virus variants and mandates. Through\nit all, our bedrock values kept us focused on improving our future… and that remains true today.\nThe year’s unpredictability touched all our business segments, with our oil & gas product\nlines being the most affected. But navigating volatile market conditions and instabilities is\nsomething with which we at Geospace are familiar, having successfully served the needs\nof the oil & gas industry for decades. By providing the industry’s best-in-class seismic\ninstruments in conjunction with attentive customer service, we maximize our commercial\nopportunities even in a depressed oil & gas market. Additionally, through execution of our\nlong-held strategy and commitment to expand our technology into diversified markets, we\ncreate credible and effective means to help mitigate the ups and downs of any one segment.\nPlus, our broad in-house manufacturing capabilities benefit all our business segments\nby giving us much better control over would-be supply chain issues that problematically\nRick Wheeler\nplague so many.\nAdvantaged by such strong operational foundations, the year demonstrated several notable accomplishments. We were\nvery pleased that despite the ongoing impact of COVID-19, we set a new all-time record for revenue from products in our\nAdjacent Markets segment. In addition, the year marked the beginning of meaningful revenue from our Quantum Technology\nSciences subsidiary, comprising our Emerging Markets segment. Together, revenue from our non-oil & gas related products\nrepresented 45% of the year’s total, giving undeniable credence that our market diversification efforts are bringing value to\nour shareholders. At year’s end, our revenue had grown 8% over last year, nearly matching the pre-pandemic figure of 2019.\nThe depth of our diversification strategy is demonstrated front and center with our acquisition of Aquana and its smart water\nmanagement products. Further, our announced partnership with Carbon Management Canada shows our interest in evolving\nand diversifying our oil & gas segment as well. Both ventures highlight our active pursuit to better the environment, through\nmore efficient management of water resources in one case, and helping industry reduce atmospheric CO2 in the other.\nFinancial Results\nIn defiance of COVID-19’s unrelenting impact, total revenue in fiscal year 2021 grew 8% to almost $95 million and produced\na gross profit of over $16 million. While this progress was not enough to generate positive earnings, we were able to\nnarrow our loss to $1.05 per share, an improvement of 26% compared to last year. Furthermore, we ended the year on firm\nfinancial footing, with a balance sheet comprising no debt and almost $24 million of cash, cash equivalents, and short-term\ninvestments. On top of this, we invested $2.1 million in our rental equipment as well as $3.2 million in property, plant, and\nequipment, all of which was partially offset by $10.6 million of proceeds from the sale of rental equipment. We also returned\n$7.5 million to our shareholders in the form of a stock repurchase plan. Under this program, which was fully completed\nshortly after year end, we returned meaningful value to our shareholders through the repurchase of nearly 842,000 shares of\nour common stock. In laying out our plans for the future, we estimate capital spending for property, plant, and equipment\nin fiscal year 2022 will be approximately $4 million, directed primarily toward factory modernization and automation.\nDepending on demand for our OBX marine rental equipment, we expect fiscal year 2022 cash investments into our rental\nfleet will be approximately $3 million.\nGEOSPACE TECHNOLOGIES ANNUAL REPORT 2021\nOil & Gas Markets\nOur Oil & Gas Markets segment saw revenues decrease by 15% from last year. The largest reduction stemmed from fewer\nrentals of our OBX ocean bottom recording systems, although lower demand for our traditional marine products was also\na factor. As global economies emerge from the pandemic, oil & gas will play a vital role in their recovery, raising demand\nand prices for these fuels. In turn, this will likely create higher demand for our oil & gas segment products. As an example,\nthe last two quarters of fiscal year 2021 saw rentals of our OBX marine systems increase, which suggests demand for these\nsystems is improving as new and earlier stalled projects move forward. Presently, many exploration and production (E&P)\ncompanies are directing major portions of their cash flow toward debt reduction, as well as to shareholders in the form of\nstock buybacks and dividends. In that regard, our oil & gas markets segment will likely continue to face challenges until E&P\noperators begin to re-invest capital in exploration and production.\nAdjacent Markets\nOur Company’s Adjacent Markets segment reported revenue of $32.4 million. This is a 27% increase over last year and\nsets a new company record for revenue from this segment. This positive improvement came from increased sales of our\nsmart water meter cable and connector products and higher demand for our specialized contract manufacturing services.\nHigher sales of our graphic imaging products also boosted revenue in this segment. These products, which are used in\nmerchandise and textile printing, have seen growing demand with the reopening of sporting, entertainment, and other\nsocial events and gatherings.\nEmerging Markets\nIn fiscal year 2021, our Quantum Technology Sciences subsidiary marked a major milestone in its achievement of meaningful\nrevenue for our Emerging Markets segment. For the full year, we recorded over $10 million for this segment, primarily\nassociated with our contract to provide the U.S. Border Patrol with an advanced high-tech border security solution. We\nfirmly believe the value of actionable information that our Quantum solutions provide will lead to future contracts across\nmultiple U.S. government entities.\nOther Events\nWith our core values at top of mind, we were very pleased this year to publish our first annual Environmental, Societal,\nand Governance (ESG) Report. In the creation of this report, we’ve taken the opportunity to better outline the policies,\npractices, and platforms that have guided the company’s corporate strategy throughout the years. In the report, we strive\nto underscore our commitments to environmental and social responsibilities, as well as to our goals for preserving and\nmaintaining the health and safety of our employees. Playing a positive role in the communities in which we operate will\nalways have an important place in our roadmap to the future.\nConclusion\nAs the world adapts to and overcomes this global pandemic, Geospace stands poised and ready to advance toward a bright\nfuture. By leveraging our key pillars of strength – dedicated employees, technical innovation, manufacturing excellence, and\nsolid financial stewardship – our future is indeed bright. As we execute our vision, the combination of these strengths places\nus in a most favorable pposition for bringing value to all our stakeholders in the years to come.\nWalter “Richard” Wheeler\nPresident & Chief Executive Officer\nGEOSPACE TECHNOLOGIES ANNUAL REPORT 2021\n10-K\n2021\nUNITED STATES\nSECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION\nWashington,D.C.20549\nFORM 10-K\n☒ AnnualReportPursuanttoSection13or15(d)oftheSecuritiesExchangeActof1934fortheFiscalYear\nEndedSeptember30,2021\nOR\n☐ TransitionReportPursuanttoSection13or15(d)oftheSecuritiesExchangeActof1934\nCommissionfilenumber001-13601\nGEOSPACE TECHNOLOGIES CORPORATION\n(ExactNameofRegistrantasSpecifiedinItsCharter)\nTexas 76-0447780\n(StateorOtherJurisdictionof (I.R.S.

For a discussion of the products sold and markets served by each of our segments, see “Products and Product\nDevelopment” below. For a discussion of financial information by segment and geographic area, see Note 20 to the consolidated\nfinancialstatementscontainedinthisAnnualReportonForm10-K.\nProductsandProductDevelopment\nOilandGasMarkets\nOur Oil and Gas Markets business segment has historically accounted for the majority of our revenue. Geoscientists use\nseismic data primarily in connection with the exploration, development and production of oil and gas reserves to map potential and\nknown hydrocarbon bearing formations and the geologic structures that surround them. This segment’s products include wireless\nseismicdataacquisitionsystems,reservoircharacterizationproductsandservices,andtraditionalseismicexplorationproductssuchas\ngeophones, hydrophones, leader wire, connectors, cables, marine streamer retrieval and steering devices and various other seismic\nproducts. WebelievethatourOilandGasMarketsproductsareamongthemosttechnologicallyadvancedinstrumentsandequipment\navailableforseismicdataacquisition.\nTraditionalProducts\nAnenergysourceandadatarecordingsystemarecombinedtoacquireseismicdata. Weprovidemanyofthecomponentsof\nseismic data recording systems, including geophones, hydrophones, multi-component sensors, leader wire, geophone strings,\nconnectors, seismic telemetry cables and other seismic related products. On land, our customers use geophones, leader wire, cables\nand connectors to receive and measure seismic reflections resulting from an energy source into data recording units, which store the\nseismic information for subsequent processing and analysis. In the marine environment, large ocean-going vessels tow long seismic\ncables known as “streamers” containing hydrophones that are used to detect pressure changes. Hydrophones transmit electrical\nimpulsesbacktothevessel’sdatarecordingunitwheretheseismicdataisstoredforsubsequentprocessingandanalysis. Ourmarine\nseismicproductsalsohelpsteerstreamerswhilebeingtowedandhelprecoverstreamersiftheybecomedisconnectedfromthevessel.\n2\nOur seismic sensor, cable and connector products are compatible with most major competitive seismic data acquisition\nsystems currently in use. Revenue from these products results primarily from seismic contractors purchasing our products as\ncomponentsofnewseismicdataacquisitionsystemsortorepairandreplacecomponentsofseismicdataacquisitionsystemsalready\ninuse.\nWirelessProducts\nWe have developed multiple versions of a land-based wireless (or nodal) seismic data acquisition system. Rather than\nutilizing interconnecting cables as required by most traditional land data acquisition systems, each of our wireless stationsoperate as\nan independent data collection system, allowing for virtually unlimited channel configurations. As a result, our wireless systems\nrequire less maintenance, which we believe allows our customers to operate more effectively and efficiently because of its reduced\nenvironmental impact, lower weight and ease of operation. Each wireless station is available in a single-channel or three-channel\nconfiguration. Since its introduction in 2008 and through September 30, 2021, we have sold 486,000 land-based wireless channels\nandwecurrentlyhave74,000land-basedwirelesschannelsinourrentalfleet.\nWehavealsodevelopedamarine-basedwirelessseismicdataacquisitionsystemcalledtheOBX. Similartoourland-based\nwireless systems, the marine OBX system may be deployed in virtually unlimited channel configurations and does not require\ninterconnecting cables between each station. Our deepwater versions of the OBX system can be deployed in depths of up to 3,450\nmeters. Through September 30, 2021, we have sold 8,400 OBX stations and we currently have 27,000 OBX stations in our rental\nfleet.\nReservoirProducts\nSeismic surveys repeated over selected time intervals show dynamic changes within a producing oil and gas reservoir, and\noperators can use these surveys to monitor the effects of oil and gas development and production. This type of reservoir monitoring\nrequires special purpose or custom designed systems in which portability becomes less critical and functional reliability assumes\ngreater importance. This reliability factor helps assure successful operations in inaccessible locations over a considerable period of\ntime. Additionally, reservoirs located in deep water or harsh environments require special instrumentation and new techniques to\nmaximizerecovery. Reservoirmonitoringalsorequireshigh-bandwidth,high-resolutionseismicdataforengineeringprojectplanning\nandreservoirmanagement. Utilizingthesereservoirmonitoringtools,producerscanenhancetherecoveryofoilandgasdepositsover\nthelifeofareservoir.\nWe have developed permanently installed high-definition reservoir monitoring systems for land and ocean-bottom\napplicationsinproducingoilandgasfields. Ourelectricalreservoirmonitoringsystemsarecurrentlyinstalledonnumerousoffshore\nreservoirs in the North Sea and elsewhere. Through our acquisition of the OptoSeis® fiber optic sensing technology, we now offer\nboth electrical and fiber optic reservoir monitoring systems. These high-definition seismic data acquisition systems have a flexible\narchitecture allowing them to be configured as a subsurface system for both land and marine reservoir-monitoring projects. The\nscalable architecture of these systems enables custom designed configuration for applications ranging from low-channel engineering\nand environmental-scale surveys requiring a minimum number of recording channels to high-channel surveys required to efficiently\nconduct permanent reservoir monitoring (“PRM”). The modular architecture of these products allows virtually unlimited channel\nexpansionforthesesystems.\nIn addition, we produce seismic borehole acquisition systems that employ a fiber optic augmented wireline capable of very\nhighdatatransmissionrates.

DemandfortheseproductshasalsobeenadverselyaffectedbyCOVID-19andtheresultinglowerglobaldemandforoiland\ngas. Many ocean-bottom nodal projects have been delayed and rescheduled due to the pandemic and uncertainty in oil and gas\ncommodity prices, reducing rental demand for our ocean-bottom nodal products used to gather seismic data on the ocean-bottom.\nWhile wehave recently been invited toparticipate in atenderforalarge-scaleseabedPRMsystem, depresseddemandcontinuesfor\nour traditional seismic products and our land nodal seismic products. As a result, we have adopted what we think is a conservative\nandprudentbusinessstrategywhichplacesafocusonsoundfinancialmanagementpractices. Wehavenotchangedourprimaryfocus\noncontinuedinvestmentinproductresearchanddevelopment,selectiveacquisitionsandjointventures.\n• Continue Investment in Product Research and Development – Past periods of revenue growth were primarily driven\nthrough our internal development of new products for the oil and gas industry. In past years, our oil and gas product\ninnovations included the introduction of borehole seismology tools, land and seabed PRM systems and wireless data\nacquisitionsystemsforbothlandandmarineapplications.

This industry generally offers equipment manufacturers like us limited\nvisibility into new orders creating challenges for us to manage our manufacturing capacity, workforce, inventories and\nother working capital challenges. While our primary growth initiative is to expand our oil and gas seismic product\nofferings, as seen with our acquisition of the OptoSeis® fiber optic sensing technology, we may also seek out other\nbusiness opportunities in adjacent markets and emerging markets which complement our existing oil and gas seismic\nproducts,engineeringandmanufacturingcapabilities,andcompany-wideculture.

Due to the cyclicality of the oil and gas industry, we have historically managed our\nfinancial risk by limiting or eliminating debt leverage in our balance sheet. While we are not opposed to moderate\namounts of short-term debt during favorable business cycles, we choose to minimize our exposure to long-term debt\nobligations which, in our view, restrict our ability to operate during periodic difficult business cycles in the oil and gas\nindustry similar to the recent business environment. We believe this strategy has allowed us to continue operations\nthroughdifficultbusinesscycleswithoutdisruptionfordebtandequityrestructuringashasbeenseenamongourpeers,\nmany of whom have significant long-term debt burdens. In addition, we have limited our investments in capital assets\nand have liquidated, and made appropriate reserves for, significant amounts of our inventories and rental fleet assets.\nWe also believe that the value of our common shares outstanding will be best served in the long-term by retaining our\ncash to fund future cash outflows as they become necessary. In this regard, we do not anticipate paying any cash\ndividends in the foreseeable future, however, our board of directors authorized a stock buy-back program in fiscal year\n2021 which authorized us to repurchase up to $7.5 million of our common stock in open market transactions. As of\nSeptember30,2021,wehadrepurchasedatotalof769,429sharesofourcommonstockatacostof$6.8million.\nCompetition\nOilandGasProducts\nWe are one of the world’s largest designers and manufacturers of seismic products used in the oil and gas industry. The\nprincipal competitors for many of our traditional seismic products are Sercel (a division of CGG) and INOVA (an independent joint\nventure between ION Geophysical Corporation and BGP, Inc., a subsidiary of China National Petroleum Company).

Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or those we\ncurrentlyviewtobeimmaterialmayalsomateriallyandadverselyaffectourbusiness,financialcondition,resultsofoperations,cash\nflowandprospects.\nExternalFactorsthatCouldAdverselyAffectUs\nThe Ongoing COVID-19 Pandemic Has Significantly Impacted Worldwide Economic Conditions and Could Have a Material\nAdverseEffectonOurOperationsandBusiness.\nThe ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has spread across the globe and has negatively impacted worldwide economic activity,\nincluding the global demand for oil and natural gas, and continues to create challenges in our markets. In addition to measures we\nhave taken voluntarily, the government authorities in our markets have taken actions to mitigate the spread of COVID-19, including\ntravelrestrictions,borderclosings,restrictionsonpublicgatherings,stay-at-homeordersandotherquarantineandisolationmeasures.\nFollowing the initial outbreak of the virus, we have experienced disruptions in our supply chain, a reduction in demand for certain\nproducts, cancellation of rental contracts and difficulty with field employees and salespeople traveling domestically and abroad to\nconduct our business. COVID-19 continues to pose the risk that we or our employees, contractors, suppliers and customers may be\npreventedfromconductingbusinessactivitiesforanindefiniteperiodoftime. Theefforttovaccinatetheglobalpopulationappearsto\nbe reducing the effects of COVID-19, but new mutations of the virus and the global unvaccinated population has allowed the\ncontinued spread of COVID-19. COVID-19 and the related mitigation measures have disrupted the Company’s supply chain,\nresulting in longer lead times in materials available from suppliers and extended the shipping time for these materials to reach the\nCompany’s facilities. If COVID–19 continues to spread or the response to contain the COVID–19 pandemic is unsuccessful, we\ncould experience a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. Additionally, on\nSeptember 4, 2021, OSHA issued a previously announced emergency temporary standard (“ETS”) requiring employers with 100 or\nmore employees to require vaccination of their employees or, alternatively, require weekly COVID-19 testing and wearing of face\ncoverings for employees. The ETS requires that unvaccinated employee wear face masks on the job by December 5, 2021. By\nJanuary 4, 2022, employees must be vaccinated or have weekly COVID-19 tests. Employers must also provide paid time off for\nemployeestogetthevaccine.

Prevailing oil and gas prices, with an emphasis on crude oil prices, and market expectations regarding\npotential changes in such prices significantly affect the level of worldwide oil and gas exploration activity. During periods of\nimproved energy commodity prices, the capital spending budgets of oil and natural gas operators tend to expand, which results in\nincreaseddemandforourcustomersservicesleadingtoincreaseddemandinourproducts. Conversely,inperiodswhentheseenergy\ncommodity prices deteriorate, capital spending budgets of oil and natural gas operators tend to contract causing demand for our\nproducts to weaken. Historically, the markets for oil and gas have been volatile and are subject to wide fluctuations in response to\nchangesinthesupplyofanddemandforoilandgas,marketuncertaintyandavarietyofadditionalfactorsthatarebeyondourcontrol.\nThese factors include the level of consumer demand, regional and international economic conditions, weather conditions, domestic\nand foreign governmental regulations (including those related to climate change), price and availability of alternative fuels, political\nconditions, instability and hostilities in the Middle East and other significant oil-producing regions, increases and decreases in the\nsupply of oil and gas, the effect of worldwide energy conservation measures and the ability of OPEC to set and maintain production\nlevelsandpricesofforeignimports.\nSustained low oil prices or the failure of oil prices to rise in the future and the resulting downturns or lack of growth in the\nenergy industry and energy-related business, could have a negative impact on our results of operations and financial condition. In\nlight of the decline in oil prices caused by the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, oil and gas exploration and production companies\nexperienced a significant reduction in cash flows, which resulted in reductions in their capital spending budgets for oil and gas\nexploration-focused activities, including seismic data acquisition activities. Demand for the sale of our seismic products targeted at\ncustomers in our Oil and Gas Markets segment, which has historically accounted for the majority of our revenue, significantly\ndeclined during fiscal year 2020 and both product sales and rental revenue diminished during the first half of fiscal year 2021 as a\nresult of significant uncertainty in the outlook for oil and gas exploration. Specifically, we expect these challenging industry\n9\nconditions to result in decreased demand forourmarine wireless nodal products and our land-based seismic products, asthe demand\nfor such products has been, and will likely continue to be, vulnerable to downturns in the economy and the oil and gas industry in\ngeneral. In addition to the negative effects of slowdowns in the United States economy, slowing economic growth in growing\neconomies like those in China and India could lead to a decline in demand for crude oil and natural gas.

We again expect revenue\noutsideoftheUnitedStatestorepresentasubstantialportionofourrevenueforfiscalyear2022andsubsequentyears.\nForeign revenue is subject to special risks inherent in doing business outside of the United States, including the risk of war,\nterrorist activities, civil disturbances, embargo and government activities, shifting foreign attitudes about conducting business\nactivities with the United States, restrictions of the movement and exchange of funds, inhibitions of our ability to collect accounts\nreceivable or repossess our rental equipment, international sanctions, expropriation and nationalization of our assets or those of our\ncustomers, currency fluctuations, devaluations and conversion restrictions, confiscatory taxation or other adverse tax policies and\ngovernmentalactionsthatmayresultinthedeprivationofourcontractualrights,allofwhichmaydisruptmarketsorouroperations.\nA portion of our oil and gas product manufacturing is conducted through our wholly-owned subsidiary Geospace\nTechnologiesEurasiaLLC,whichisbasedintheRussianFederation. Ouroilandgasbusinesscouldbedirectlyaffectedbypolitical\nand economic conditions in the Russian Federation, including the current geopolitical instability involving the Russian Federation,\nUkraine and Syria. United States sanctions against Russia have been expanded to preclude the export of oil and gas equipment\nanywhere in the world that involve persons designated under the sanctions and to include projects in which persons subject to the\nsanctions have a 33% ownership interest or a majority of voting interests. Together, these changes make it more difficult for us to\nsupport projects that have the potential to produce oil involving Russian energy companies. Furthermore, if an exporter is unable to\ndeterminewhetheritsequipmentwillbeusedinsuchprojects,theexportisprohibited. Infiscalyear2021,weimported$1.2million\nof products from Geospace Technologies Eurasia LLC for resale elsewhere in the world. If imports of these products from the\nRussian Federation are restricted by government regulation, we may be forced to find other sources for the manufacture of these\nproductsatpotentiallyhighercosts.

The risk of doing business in the Russian Federation and other economically or politically volatile areas could adversely\naffectouroperationsandearnings.\nForeign revenue is also generally subject to the risk of compliance with additional laws, including tariff regulations and\nimport and export restrictions. International revenue transactions for our products containing hydrophones require prior U.S.\ngovernment approval in the form of an export license, which may be withheld by the U.S. government based upon factors which we\ncannotpredict.\n10\nWemayexperiencedifficultiesinconnectionwithfutureforeignrevenue.

Certainraw\nmaterials we purchase from China are subject to these tariffs which has increased our manufacturing costs. Products we sell into\ncertain foreign markets could also become subject to similar retaliatory tariffs, making the products we sell uncompetitive to similar\nproducts not subjected to such import tariffs.

Anyeconomicdownturnmayadversely\naffect the demand for oil and gas generally or cause volatility in oil and gas commodity prices and, therefore, adversely affect the\ndemand for delivery of our oil and gas products.

We are currently in negotiations with multiple lenders for a new\ncredit facility arrangement; however, we may not be successful in obtaining a new credit facility or obtaining one on terms that are\nfavorable to us. The lack of a credit facility could negatively impact our liquidity and could have a material adverse impact on our\nfutureoperations,financialcondition,growth,andotheraspectsofourbusiness.\nRelianceonThirdPartySubcontractorsCouldAdverselyAffectOurResultsofOperationsandReputation\nWe may rely on subcontractors to complete certain projects. The quality and timing of production and services by our\nsubcontractors is not totally under our control. Reliance on subcontractors gives us less control over a project and exposes us to\nsignificant risks, including late delivery, substandard quality and high costs. The failure of our subcontractors to deliver quality\nproductsorservicesinatimelymannercouldadverselyaffectourprofitabilityandreputation.\nTheHighFixedCostsofOurOperationsCouldAdverselyAffectOurResultsofOperations\nWe have a high fixed cost structure primarily consisting of (i) depreciation expenses associated with our rental equipment\nand (ii) fixed manufacturing costs including salaries and benefits, taxes, insurance, maintenance, depreciation and other fixed\nmanufacturingcosts. Inregardstoourrentalequipment,largedeclinesinthedemandforrentalequipmentcouldresultinsubstantial\noperating losses due to the on-going fixed nature of rental equipment depreciation expense.

In addition to the risks that are inherent in conducting business internationally, we are also liable for\ncompliance with international and U.S. laws and regulations that apply to our international operations. These laws and regulations\ninclude data privacy requirements, labor relations laws, tax laws, anti-competition regulations, import and trade restrictions, export\ncontrol laws, U.S. laws such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar laws in other countries which also prohibit certain\npayments to governmental officials or certain payments or remunerations to customers. Many of our products are subject to U.S.\nexport law restrictions that limit the destinations and types of customers to which our products may be sold, or require an export\nlicenseinconnectionwithrevenuetransactionsoutsidetheUnitedStates. Giventhehighlevelofcomplexityoftheselaws,thereisa\nrisk that some provisions may be inadvertently breached, for example through the negligent or the unauthorized intentional behavior\nof individual employees, our failure to comply with certain formal documentation requirements or otherwise. Additionally, we may\nbe held liable for actions taken by our local dealers and partners. Violations of these laws and regulations could result in fines,\ncriminal sanctions against us, our officers or our employees, and prohibitions on the conduct of our business. Any such violations\ncould include prohibitions on our ability to offer our products in one or more countries and could materially damage our reputation,\nourbrands,ourinternationalexpansionefforts,ourabilitytoattractandretainemployees,ourbusinessandouroperatingresults.\nBecause We Have No Plans to Pay Any Dividends for the Foreseeable Future, Investors Must Look Solely to Stock Appreciation\nforaReturnonTheirInvestmentinUs\nWe have not paid cash dividends on our common stock since our incorporation and do not anticipate paying any cash\ndividends in the foreseeable future. Any payment of cash dividends in the future will be dependent on the amount of funds legally\navailable, our financial condition, capital requirements, loan covenants and other factors that our Board of Directors may deem\nrelevant. Accordingly, investors must rely on sales of their common stock after price appreciation, which may never occur, as the\nonlywaytorealizeanyfuturegainsontheirinvestment.\nWeHaveaRelativelySmallPublicFloat,andOurStockPriceMaybeVolatile\nAtSeptember30,2021,wehaveapproximately12.4millionsharesoutstandingheldbynon-affiliates. Thislimitednumber\nof shares outstanding results in a relatively limited market for our common stock. Our daily trading volume for the year ended\nSeptember 30, 2021 averaged approximately 64,000 shares. Our small float and daily trading volumes have in the past caused, and\nmayinthefutureresultin,significantvolatilityinourstockprice.\nFinancialandAccountingRisks\nUnfavorableCurrencyExchangeRateFluctuationsCouldAdverselyAffectOurResultsofOperations\nSubstantially all of our third-party revenue from the United States is invoiced in U.S. dollars, though from time to time we\nmay invoice revenue transactions in foreign currencies including intercompany sales. As a result, we may be subject to foreign\ncurrency fluctuations on our revenue. The reporting currency for our financial statements is the U.S. dollar. However, the assets,\nliabilities, revenue and costs of our Russian, Canadian and United Kingdom subsidiaries and our Brazilian, Chinese and Colombian\nbranch offices are denominated in currencies other than U.S. dollars. To prepare our consolidated financial statements, we must\ntranslate those assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses into U.S. dollars at then-applicable exchange rates. Consequently, increases\nand decreases in the value of the U.S. dollar versus these other currencies will affect the amount of these items in our consolidated\nfinancial statements, even if their value has not changed in their original currency. These translations could result in significant\nchanges to our results of operations from period to period. For the fiscal year ended September 30, 2021, approximately 6% of our\nconsolidatedrevenuerelatedtotheoperationsofourforeignsubsidiariesandbranches.\n15\nOurLong-LivedAssetsMaybeSubjecttoImpairment\nWe periodically assess our long-lived assets for impairment. Significant sustained future decreases in crude oil and natural\ngaspricesmayrequireustowritedownthevalueofourlong-livedassetsinourOilandGasMarketsbusinesssegment,includingour\nmanufacturing facilities, manufacturing equipment and rental equipment if future cash flows anticipated to be generated from these\nassets fall below the asset’s net book value. Furthermore, we may be required to write down the value of goodwill and/or other\nintangible assets if our acquisition of Quantum, the OptoSeis® fiber optic sensing technology or Aquana does not generate sufficient\ncash flows to recover the carrying value of such assets. If we are forced to write down the value of our long-lived assets, these\nnoncashassetimpairmentscouldadverselyaffectourresultsofoperations.\nIncreased or Inaccurate Estimation of Contingent Earn-Out Liabilities Could Result in Increased Charge-Offs or Losses and\nDefaultsUnderOurCreditAgreement\nAs further discussed below, we have contingent earn-out liabilities associated with our acquisitions of Quantum and\nOptoSeis®. We have utilized the services of an independent valuation consultant to assist us with the estimation of the contingent\nearn-outliabilityineachcase. Weexpecttocontinuetoutilizesimilarconsultingservicestohelpusestimatethecontingentearn-out\nliability in future periods. If we, or our independent valuation consultant, have incorrectly estimated such potential earn-out liability\norifsuchestimatesprovetobeinaccurateduetotheinherentunpredictabilityofthesize,scope,andoccurrenceofthecontractsthat\nmight be subject to such earn-outs, and we are required to pay an amount of consideration in excess of our estimate, we may incur\nincreased charges to our consolidated statement of operations associated with that increased liability. If we receive substantial\nrevenue from Quantum or OptoSeis® and if such revenue is subject to the applicable earn-out, the attendant increase in contingent\nliability could also be substantial. Further, in certain instances, if the increases in contingent earn-out liability are of a large enough\nmagnitude, they may cause us to default on certain financial covenants in our credit agreement. These increased losses, potential\ndefaults,andothernegativerepercussionsfromsuchincreasedliabilitycouldadverselyaffectourfinancialperformanceandresultsof\noperations.\nShouldWeFailtoMaintainanEffectiveSystemofInternalControlOverFinancialReporting,WeMayNotBeAbletoAccurately\nReportOurFinancialResultsandPreventMaterialFraud,WhichCouldAdverselyAffecttheValueofOurCommonStock\nEffective internal control over financial reporting is necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports and effectively\nprevent and detect material fraud.

Demand for new land-based seismic equipment in recent fiscal years has\nremained restrained due to capital limitations affecting many of our customers, along with their excess levels of underutilized\nequipment. As a result, revenue from the sale and rental of our land-based traditional and wireless products has remained lowdue to\nthe reduced investment in exploration-focused seismic activities. Policies implemented by the Biden administration in the United\nStates could also result in decreased demand for our products. President Biden has announced climate change as a core focus of his\nadministration and that he intends to set the United States on a path to net-zero carbon emissions by 2050. In January of 2021,\nPresident Biden implemented a hold on issuing new drilling permits and new oil and gas leasing for federal lands and waters. The\nadministrationmayalsoimplementneworamendedrulesandregulationsconcerninghydraulicfracturingandemissionsfromoiland\ngas sector operations. Crude oil prices have recently rebounded above February 2020 levels; however, a lag in time typically occurs\nbetween higher oil prices and greater demand for our Oil and Gas Markets segment products. Lasting higher levels of oil and gas\ncommodity pricing may not stabilize in the long term, thus continuing the challenging industry conditions we have experienced in\nprevious fiscal years. We only expect improved market conditions when we see lasting stabilization of higher crude oil commodity\nprices,whichshouldresultinhigherrevenuefromourOilandGasMarketssegmentproducts.\nIn light of current market conditions, the inventory balances in our Oil and Gas Markets business segment at September 30,\n2021continuedtoexceedlevelsweconsiderappropriateforthecurrentlevelofproductdemand. Whileweareaggressivelyworking\nto reduce these legacy inventory balances, we are also adding new inventories for new wireless product developments and for other\nproduct demand in our Adjacent Markets segment. During periods of excessive inventory levels, our policy has been, and will\ncontinue to be, to record obsolescence expense as we experience reduced product demand and as our inventories continue to age. If\ndifficult market conditions continue for the products in our Oil and Gas Markets segment, we expect to record additional inventory\nobsolescence expense in fiscal year 2022 and beyond until product demand and/or resulting inventory turnover return to acceptable\nlevels.\n21\nCoronavirus(COVID-19)\nThe ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has spread across the globe and has negatively impacted worldwide economic activity,\nincludingtheglobaldemandforoilandnaturalgas,andcontinuestocreatechallengesinourmarkets.

The decrease was due to (i) a $4.6 million net non-cash decrease in the estimated fair value of contingent earn-out\nconsideration related to our Quantum and OptoSeis® acquisitions, (ii) a $1.5 million decrease in personnel costs primarily related to\nourcostreductionprograminitiatedinthethirdquarteroffiscalyear2020,(iii)a$0.7millionreductioninresearchanddevelopment\nprojectcosts,(iv)a$0.8millionreductioninothergeneralbusinessexpensesand(v)a$0.7millionreductioningoodwillimpairment\ncharges.\nConsolidated other income for fiscal year 2021 was $3.4 million compared to $1.4 million from fiscal year 2020.

Our product and rental revenue in this segment was negatively impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic and its impact on\nworldwidedemandforcrudeoil. Thecomponentsofthisdecreaseincludedthefollowing:\n• Traditional Exploration Product Revenue – Revenue from our traditional products decreased $2.1 million, or 32.1%\nfrom the prior fiscal year. The decrease primarily reflects lower demand for our marine products and lower rental\nutilization of our traditional products. The decrease was partially offset by an increase in demand for our sensor\nproducts.\n• Wireless Exploration Product Revenue – Revenue from our wireless exploration products decreased $8.3 million, or\n15.4%,fromthepriorfiscalyear. Thedecreasewasprimarilyduetoa$35.5milliondecreaseinrentalrevenuefromour\nOBX marine nodal products due to lower utilization of our OBX rental fleet caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.

The components of\nthisincreaseincludedthefollowing:\n• IndustrialProductRevenueandServices–Revenuefromourindustrialproductsincreased$5.7million,or36.6%,from\nthe prior fiscal year.

We expect our cash investments in\nproperty, plant and equipment during fiscal year 2022 to be approximately $4 million. Depending on demand for our OBX marine\nrental equipment, we expect fiscal year 2022 cash investments into our rental fleet to be approximately $3 million. Our capital\nexpenditures are expected to be funded from our cash on hand, internal cash flows, cash flows from our rental contracts or, if\nnecessary,borrowingsunderapotentialnewcreditfacilityarrangement,ifany.\nFor fiscal year 2021, we used $6.8 million from financing activities for the purchase of treasury stock pursuant to a stock\nbuy-back program authorized by our board of directors. The program authorizes us to repurchase up to $7.5 million of our common\nstock in open market transactions. At September 30, 2021, approximately $0.7 million of our common stock remains available for\nrepurchasesundertheprogram.\nOn July 13, 2020, we received an interest in a senior secured bond from an international seismic marine customer.

As a result of substantial declines in crude oil prices in recent years combined with the recent reduced global demand for\noil and gas as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, oil and gas exploration and production companies experienced a significant\nreduction in cash flows resulting in sharp reductions in their capital spending budgets for oil and gas exploration-focused activities\nincluding seismic data acquisition activities. While wehave experienced strongmarine nodal rental activity in recent years including\nfiscalyear2020,theneedfornewseismicequipment,particularlyland-basedequipment,remainsrestrainedduetoourcustomers’(i)\nlimited capital resources, (ii) lack of visibility into future demand for their seismic services and (iii) in some cases, under-utilized\n27\nlegacyequipment.Crudeoilpriceshaverecentlyrebounded;however,lastinghigherlevelsofoilandgascommoditypricingmaynot\nstabilizeinthelongterm,thuscontinuingthechallengingindustryconditionswehaveexperiencedinpreviousfiscalyears.\nMany of our land-based traditional seismic products can be damaged, destroyed or otherwise consumed during our\ncustomer’sfieldoperations.

It is uncertain what revenue impact the GCL will have during fiscal year 2022 in light of the tepid market\ndemand for oil and gas seismic services and equipment. We do not expect our land-based wireless product revenue to exceed the\nlevelsachievedinfiscalyear2021.\nThe vast majority of our oil and gas rental revenue in fiscal year 2021 was derived from short-term rentals of our OBX\nocean-bottom recorder. We believe our OBX rental revenue will increase substantially in fiscal year 2022 as a result of rental\ncontractsexecutedduringfiscalyear2021andanticipatednewrentalcontracts,butwecanmakenoassuranceinthisregard.\nWe believe that fiscal year 2022 revenue from our oil and gas reservoir products, and principally our borehole tools and\nservices,toincreaseslightlyoverfiscalyear2021levels.

In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the\nCompany as of September 30, 2021 and 2020, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the years then ended, in\nconformitywithaccountingprinciplesgenerallyacceptedintheUnitedStatesofAmerica.\nBasisforOpinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the\nCompany’sfinancialstatementsbasedonouraudits.WeareapublicaccountingfirmregisteredwiththePublicCompanyAccounting\nOversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with U.S.\nfederalsecuritieslawsandtheapplicablerulesandregulationsoftheSecuritiesandExchangeCommissionandthePCAOB.\nWeconductedourauditsinaccordancewiththestandardsofthePCAOB.Thosestandardsrequirethatweplanandperformtheaudit\ntoobtainreasonableassuranceaboutwhetherthefinancialstatementsarefreeofmaterialmisstatement,whetherduetoerrororfraud.\nTheCompanyisnotrequiredtohave,norwereweengagedtoperform,anauditofitsinternalcontroloverfinancialreporting.Aspart\nof our audits we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of\nexpressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no\nsuchopinion.\nOur audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to\nerror or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence\nregarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used\nandsignificantestimatesmadebymanagement,aswellasevaluatingtheoverallpresentationofthefinancialstatements.Webelieve\nthatourauditsprovideareasonablebasisforouropinion.\nCriticalAuditMatters\nThe critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were\ncommunicatedorrequiredtobecommunicatedtotheauditcommitteeandthat:(1)relatetoaccountsordisclosuresthatarematerial\nto the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective or complex judgments.

The valuation of inventories is based on the\nCompany’s periodic review ofthe composition of its inventories to determine if market demand, product modifications, technology\nchanges,excessivequantitieson-handandotherfactorshinderitsabilitytorecoveritsinvestmentinsuchinventories.TheCompany’s\nassessment is based upon historical product demand, estimated future product demand and various other judgments and estimates.\nInventoryobsolescencereservesarerecordedwhensuchassessmentsrevealthatportionsorcomponentsoftheCompany’sinvestment\nwillnotberealizedinitsoperatingactivities.\nWe identified the valuation of inventories at the lower of cost or net realizable value as acritical audit matterdue to the significant\njudgmentandestimatesrequiredbymanagement.Determiningwhetheradeclineinvaluehasoccurredrequiresmanagementtomake\ncomplexjudgmentsrelatedto(i)historicalandestimatedfutureproductdemandinrelationtoquantitiesonhandand(ii)obsolescence\nof certain products based on changes in technology and demand.

The fair value of the reporting unit was estimated by management using the\nexpected present value of future cash flows and judgments, market data and using estimates, judgments and assumptions that\nmanagementbelieveareappropriateinthecircumstances.Keyassumptionsintheimpairmentanalysisincluderevenueandcashflow\nprojections, discount rates, long-term growth rates, and the effective tax rate. In determining the fair value of the Company’s\nEmerging Markets reporting unit, estimated future cash flows include the Company’s ability to obtain an additional contract with its\nsignificantcustomer.\nWe identified the valuation of goodwill for the Emerging Market's reporting unit as a critical audit matter because of the significant\nassumptions management makes in determining the estimate, including revenue and cash flow projections and the discount rate\nutilized. Auditing management’s assumptions of revenue and cash flow projections and the discount rate involved a high degree of\nauditor judgment and increased audit effort, including the use of valuation specialists, as changes in these assumptions could have a\nsignificantimpactonthefairvalueoftheEmergingMarket'sreportingunitandpotentialimpairmentcharges.\nOurauditproceduresrelatedtotheCompany’svaluationofgoodwillfortheEmergingMarketsreportingunitincludedthefollowing,\namongothers:\n• We evaluated the reasonableness of management’s revenue and cash flow projections by comparing management’s prior\nforecaststohistoricalresultsfortheCompany.\n• We evaluated management’s revenue projections by comparing to historical results and inquiry of management of the\nreportingunitregardingadditionalcontractswithitssignificantcustomer.\n• With the assistance of our valuation specialists, we evaluated the reasonableness of the Company’s valuation methodology\nandthediscountratesutilizedbycomparingthemtocomparablecompaniesandmarketdata.\nValuationofContingentConsiderationOptoSeis\nAs described in Note 18 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company recognized contingent consideration related to the\nacquisitionoftheOptoSeisfiberopticsensingtechnologybusinessinNovember2018.TheCompanyrecordedtheinitialfairvalueof\nthe contingent consideration as a liability on the acquisition date.

Statements that contain these words should be\nread carefully because they discuss our future expectations, contain projections of our future results of operations or of our financial position or\nstate other forward-looking information. Examples of forward-looking statements include, among others, statements that we make regarding\nour expected operating results, the results and success of our transactions with Quantum and the OptoSeis® technology, the adoption and\nsale of our products in various geographic regions, potential tenders for PRM systems, future demand for OBX systems, the completion of new\norders for our channels of our GCL system, the fulfillment of customer payment obligations, the impact of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic,\nthe Company’s ability to manage changes and continued health or availability of management personnel, volatility and development, market\nposition, financial results and the provision of accounting reserves. These forward-looking statements reflect our current judgment about future\nevents and trends based on the information currently available to us. However, there will likely be events in the future that we are not able\nto predict or control. The factors listed under the caption “Risk Factors”, as well as cautionary language in this Annual Report on Form 10-K,\nprovide examples of risks, uncertainties and events that may cause our actual results to differ materially from the expectations we describe in our\nforward-looking statements.

The occurrence of the events described in these risk factors and elsewhere in this Annual Report on\nForm 10-K could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial position, and actual events and results of\noperations may vary materially from our current expectations. We assume no obligation to revise or update any forward-looking statement,\nwhether written or oral, that we may make from time to time, whether as a result of new information, future developments or otherwise.\nDear Fellow Shareholders,\nNavigating Adversity\nThe events of 2020 undoubtedly surpass the wildest fiction author’s imagination, uprooting virtually\nall sense of normalcy and convention. The novel coronavirus exacted an incalculable toll on global\nhumanity, disrupting all forms of commerce and threatening millions of lives Geospace was not\nRick Wheeler\nexempted from COVID-19’s impact. Oil prices, already low due to oversupply, suffered unprecedented\nvolatility, even dipping negative, as demand for energy plummeted driven by a worldwide hiatus on travel and entire sectors of\nnational economies shut down. This translated to lower demand for many of our products in the oil & gas segment as well as\nsome of our adjacent market products. Of notable exception was an increase in rentals of our OBX ocean bottom nodal recording\nsystems. This was driven by the desire of oil & gas companies to cut costs by finding and producing from additional reservoirs\nnearby existing offshore infrastructure and by enhancing the output of producing fields through better seismic imaging.\nIn many ways, the pandemic further galvanized Geospace’s strategy to strengthen its commerce and enlarge its space of\nopportunities through diversification, across new markets as well as within existing markets. More than just a slogan, our concept\nof “Navigating Adversity Through Diversity” is foundational to leveling out the ups and downs of cyclical markets, and yes, even\nsome variabilities induced by a pandemic. The variety of cultivated industries utilizing our products and manufacturing services\ninclude oil & gas, textile printing, packaging, municipal utility, government security, medical, and a host of others. Although each\nhas faced unique challenges in the wake of the pandemic, an element of stability is derived from this broad base. In another\nhallmark of diversification, our Quantum subsidiary was awarded a $10 million contract from the U.S. Border Patrol for a border\nand perimeter security system utilizing our revolutionary advanced technologies. While no appreciable revenue was recognized\nfrom this contract in fiscal year 2020, it will be in fiscal year 2021.\nFinancial Results\nTotal revenue in fiscal year 2020 was $87.8 million, producing a gross profit of $23.4 million. Revenue and profits would have been\nhigher were it not for unpaid debts of one of our longstanding marine seismic rental customers. Like many other oil & gas service\nproviders, depressed industry conditions financially overwhelmed this customer, which led to the restructuring of amounts owed us\ninto a marketable debt security traded on the Oslo exchange. We are hopeful of recovering these amounts, but there is no certainty\nthat we will. Last year at this time, fiscal year 2019 had achieved a 26% increase in revenue over 2018. And despite the negative\neconomic effects of COVID-19 and a distressed customer, revenue in fiscal year 2020 came to within 8% of this figure. Although this\nresulted in a net loss of ($1.42) per share in fiscal year 2020, we nonetheless ended the year on firm financial footing, with no debt on\nour balance sheet, almost $33 million in cash and cash equivalents, and an untapped available borrowing base of nearly $18 million.\nDuring the year, we invested $5.5 million in our rental equipment and an additional $2.9 million in property, plant, and equipment,\nall of which was partially offset by $4.1 million of proceeds from the sale of rental equipment. For fiscal year 2021, we estimate capital\nspending for property, plant, and equipment to be approximately $5 million, directed primarily toward factory modernization and\nautomation. Any investments in our rental fleet in the coming year will be highly dependent on supportive market conditions.\nOil and Gas Markets Segment\nFiscal year 2020 started off strong for our oil & gas markets segment, with first quarter revenue increasing 77% from the prior year.\nBut soon after, disputes between Russia and Saudi Arabia over production quotas exacerbated an oversupply of oil. Then came\nCOVID-19, where shuttered economies and a moratorium on travel all but destroyed the demand for oil & gas. As a result, most\nexploration for new resources was curtailed, reducing the demand for many of our seismic products to historic lows. However,\nincreased rental of our OBX marine systems defied this trend, generating the highest amount of revenue ever from these products.\nWe are likely to see lower rental revveennuuee ffrroomm oouurr OOBBXX ssyysstteemmss iinn ffiissccaall yyeeaarr 220021, although customer interest in purchasing some\n1\nGEOSPACE TECHNOLOGIES ANNUAL REPORT 2020\nof this equipment, and new inquiries for our deep-water OBX are developing. Fiscal year 2021 should also see a continuation of the\ndiscussions that began in fiscal year 2020 with oil & gas companies interested in permanent reservoir monitoring (PRM) systems.\nAs the massive disruptions of 2020 subside and demand for energy rebounds, our products will continue to provide oil & gas\ncustomers with the utmost in efficiency and advanced technology for seismic imaging.\nAdjacent Markets Segment\nReacting to curb the spread of COVID-19, most events involving social gatherings or groups were suspended, often by mandate,\nincluding those for sports, schools, and entertainment. Customers using our graphic imaging products for printing merchandise,\npackaging, and promotional items for such events were severely impacted, which reduced demand for those products. Customers\nusing our manufacturing services and industrial sensors were also negatively impacted by idled economies, thus reducing our\nsales of such products and services. At the end of fiscal year 2020, our adjacent markets had produced $25.4 million, a 16%\nreduction from the year before. However, we expect these products to fully regain the former levels of sales and growth that\nexisted prior to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nEmerging Markets Segment\nOur emerging markets segment focuses on border and perimeter security products that provide deep awareness and real-\ntime intelligence of any activity occurring in proximity to an area or asset of interest. These products process seismic-acoustic\ninformation using sophisticated analytics developed by our Quantum group. Even though very little revenue was generated from\nthese products in fiscal year 2020, the year heralded major advances in our integration of Quantum software and our hardened\ndigital systems. Based on the accolades our demonstrations of this technology have received from targeted customers, we fully\nexpect meaningful and sustainable revenue from this segment in the foreseeable future.\nOther Events\nIn a culmination of governance initiatives that began in fiscal year 2020, we added two new Directors to our board in the first\nquarter of fiscal year 2021. With focus on our market diversification strategy and the overall benefits of board refreshment, we were\nexuberant when Margaret “Sid” Ashworth and Kenneth Asbury accepted our invitations to serve as Geospace Directors. They each\nbring overwhelming credentials and business acumen that will help Geospace provide maximum value to its shareholders. Not\nonly will their familiarity with major government contracts and funding align with the expansion of our emerging markets segment,\nwhich we believe will be a growing component of our business, but in addition, their unique career experience and perspectives\nwill undoubtedly translate to fresh ideas and new approaches that benefit all of our business segments. In the first fiscal quarter,\nour Board also implemented a stock repurchase plan, authorizing the purchase of up to $5 million of our outstanding shares. All\nof these actions have the clear intention of returning maximum value to our shareholders.\nConclusion\nThe unforeseen nature of 2020 will pass into history. As the world begins the process of recovery, travel will resume, and the\nengines of nation economies will again run. Demand for energy will consequently return, and we believe the high technology\nproducts we’ve created for our oil & gas markets’ customers will remain the optimum industry tools for managing existing reserves\nand exploring for new ones. Consumption of the products and services offered to our adjacent markets’ customers should also\nreturn, and we expect the channels of earlier growth for these products to continue. And the inventive solutions offered through\nour Quantum subsidiary provide featured capabilities that never before existed, and we believe the expansion of this emerging\nmarket is just beginning. The combination of our broad technological offerings, manufacturing expertise, and solid financial\nstrength pplace us in aa mmoost favorable position for bringing value to all of our stakeholders in the years to come.\nRRiicckk WWhheeeelleerr\nPresident & Chief Executive Officer\nGEOSPACE TECHNOLOGIES ANNUAL REPORT

          "content": "ANNUALREPORT2019\nFORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS:\nThis Annual Report on Form 10-K contains “forward-looking” statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange\nAct of 1934, as amended. These forward-looking statements can be identified by terminology such as “may”, “will”, “should”, “intend”, “expect”, “plan”, “budget”, “forecast”, “anticipate”, “believe”,\n“estimate”, “predict”, “potential”, “continue”, “evaluating” or similar words. Statements that contain these words should be read carefully because they discuss our future expectations, contain pro-\njections of our future results of operations or of our financial position or state other forward-looking information. Examples of forward-looking statements include, among others, statements that we\nmake regarding our expected operating results, the results and success of our transactions with Quantum and the OptoSeis® technology, the adoption and sale of our products in various geographic\nregions, potential tenders for permanent reservoir monitoring systems, future demand for OBX systems, the completion of new orders for our channels of our GCL system, the fulfillment of customer\npayment plans, anticipated levels of capital expenditures and the sources of funding therefor, and our strategy for growth, product development, market position, financial results and the provision\nof accounting reserves. These forward-looking statements reflect our current judgment about future events and trends based on the information currently available to us. However, there will likely\nbe events in the future that we are not able to predict or control. The factors listed under the caption “Risk Factors”, as well as cautionary language in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, provide\nexamples of risks, uncertainties and events that may cause our actual results to differ materially from the expectations we describe in our forward-looking statements. Such examples include, but are\nnot limited to, the failure of the Quantum or OptoSeis® technology transactions to yield positive operating results, decreases in commodity price levels, which could reduce demand for our products,\nthe failure of our products to achieve market acceptance, despite substantial investment by us, our sensitivity to short term backlog, delayed or cancelled customer orders, product obsolescence\nresulting from poor industry conditions or new technologies, bad debt write-offs associated with customer accounts, lack of further orders for our OBX systems, failure of our Quantum products\nto be adopted by the border and perimeter security markets, infringement or failure to protect intellectual property. The occurrence of the events described in these risk factors and elsewhere in\nthis Annual Report on Form 10-K could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial position, and actual events and results of operations may vary materially\nfrom our current expectations. We assume no obligation to revise or update any forward-looking statement, whether written or oral, that we may make from time to time, whether as a result of new\ninformation, future developments or otherwise.\nDear Fellow Shareholder,\nGeospace Leveraging Technology\nAsk someone familiar with Geospace, and the first things that will likely come to mind are\nwell defined, high quality technology, and client-oriented attention focused on customers’\nsuccess. Since the company’s inception, these principles have defined us, driven our growth,\nand guided us through both good and bad market conditions. Fiscal year 2019 was filled with\nactivities strengthening our technology and positioning our company and its shareholders\nfor a next phase of prosperity and opportunity. With the invention of our GCL recorder, we’ve\nestablished a new pinnacle for land seismic instruments. With our acquisition of OptoSeis®\nRick Wheeler\nfiber-optic sensing technology, we can now provide oil and gas companies the broadest\nspectrum of available products for permanent reservoir monitoring (PRM). And by combining\nour digital seismic systems with the groundbreaking algorithms and analytic software of\nQuantum Technology Sciences, we’ve created a new breed of border and perimeter security\nsolutions featuring unparalleled capability.\nDefying a fifth straight year of record low spending for global oil and gas exploration, we grew\nrevenue by 26% in fiscal year 2019 over last year. In fact, our fourth fiscal quarter which ended\nSeptember 30, 2019 recorded the highest quarterly revenue and gross profit in over five\nyears. This improved performance was driven by strong rental demand for our OBX ocean-\nbottom nodal seismic recording systems. In today’s world, many offshore focused oil and gas\ncompanies are realizing significant savings through finding and producing new hydrocarbon\nresources nearby existing infrastructure. Our proven OBX technology helps this goal become\na reality with superior subsurface imaging quality. It’s no wonder why the list of world-wide\nprojects and customers utilizing our OBX systems continues to grow.\nFinancial Results\nTotal revenue in fiscal year 2019 climbed to almost $96 million, producing a gross profit\nof over $31 million. If we set aside beneficial amounts related to a gain on the sale of non-\nessential real estate and a favorable net reduction in contingent earn-out liabilities, our net\nloss for the year shrank to $0.70 per share – less than half that of the year before. And with\nthese beneficial amounts included in our financial results, our net loss for fiscal year 2019\ndrops to just $0.01 per share. Over the course of the year, our capital expenditures amounted\nto $36 million and were mostly targeted at the expansion of our OBX rental fleet. We\naccomplished all of this while maintaining a strong balance sheet that at year’s end remained\ndebt free with a total liquidity of almost $46 million, including nearly $19 million in cash\nand equivalents. Looking into the future, we anticipate capital spending in fiscal year 2020\nto be about one-third of last year’s figure, with approximately half being allocated toward\nadditional OBX rental equipment. The remainder of these investments are targeted toward\nexpanded factory automation, maintenance, and other improvements.\nOil and Gas Markets Segment\nLast year, our hopes for fiscal year 2019 were to see a diminished stranglehold on energy\nexploration spending. These hopes were somewhat realized as reflected by the increase in\nrevenue from our oil and gas market segment of almost 45% over last year. Faced with lower\nrevenue from our traditional and reservoir seismic products, the improvement was entirely\ndriven by our wireless products, where demand for our marine OBX equipment pushed rental\nrevenue to record levels. Although new oil and gas discoveries in recent years are woefully\nGEOSPACE TECHNOLOGIES ANNUAL REPORT 2019 1\nshort of replacing produced reserves, the overwhelming majority of these limited finds have been\noffshore. Our success with the OBX highlights our ability to place innovative technologies wherever\ndemand is highest in an otherwise difficult market. Likewise, our latest GCL land seismic recorder\noffers best-in-class technology for land seismic operations. While this portion of the market remains\nchallenged, recent sales of our GCL demonstrate our preparedness to fulfill any demand that may\nsimilarly arise in the onshore market.\nAdjacent Markets Segment\nProducts in our adjacent markets segment generated revenue of just over $30 million in fiscal year\n2019. Although this represents an increase of less than 1% over last year, we continue to believe that\nthis segment has significant opportunity for expansion and growth. For the full year, this segment\ncontributed almost one-third of the company’s total revenue, directly emphasizing its strategic\nimportance in partially diffusing volatility from our oil and gas market segment. In fiscal year 2020, we\nintend to continue identifying new ways and means to expand this segment’s revenue contribution.\nEmerging Markets Segment\nOur emerging markets segment focuses on border and perimeter security products that provide deep\nawareness and real-time intelligence of any activity occurring in proximity to an area or asset of interest.\nThese products process seismic-acoustic information using sophisticated algorithms and analytics\ndeveloped by our Quantum group. Even though very little revenue was generated from these products\nin fiscal year 2019, the year heralded major advances in our integration of Quantum software and our\nhardened digital systems. Based on the accolades our demonstrations of this technology have received\nfrom targeted customers, we fully expect meaningful and sustainable revenue from this segment in the\nforeseeable future.\nConclusion\nFor Geospace Technologies, fiscal year 2019 can be summed up as a year of multi-faceted\nachievement. While this certainly includes financial metrics such as our growth in revenue, higher\ngross profit, and preservation of a rock-solid balance sheet, it also describes many behind the scenes\naccomplishments in engineering innovation and product diversification. Improvements in our\nOBX marine recorder and the invention of our GCL land seismic recorder have each maximized our\nopportunity for commerce in an improved seismic exploration market. And by incorporating OptoSeis\nfiber-optic sensing technology into our largescale system designs and manufacturing capabilities,\nwe’ve significantly increased our chances of landing any future contracts for PRM systems. On top of\nthis, the full integration of Quantum’s intelligent analytics software with our field proven systems has\ncreated a remarkable new potential for future revenue. Our goal in fiscal year 2020 is to exploit all of the\nrich opportunities we have created, thus giving our employees, our customers, and our shareholders\ntthhee hhiigghheesstt ppoossssiibbllee vvaalluuee tthat can be attained.\nRick Wheeler\nPresident & Chief Executive Officer\nGEOSPACE TECHNOLOGIES ANNUAL REPORT 2019\n2\n10-K\n2019\n\nUNITED STATES\nSECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION\nWashington, D.C. 20549\nFORM 10-K\n☒ Annual Report Pursuant to Section 13 or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 for the Fiscal Year\nEnded September 30, 2019\nOR\n☐ Transition Report Pursuant to Section 13 or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934\nCommission file number 001-13601\nGEOSPACE TECHNOLOGIES CORPORATION\n(Exact Name of Registrant as Specified in Its Charter)\nTexas 76-0447780\n(State or Other Jurisdiction of (I.R.S.

Business\nBusiness Overview\nGeospace Technologies Corporation reincorporated as a Texas corporation on April 16, 2015. We originally incorporated as\na Delaware corporation on September 27, 1994. Unless otherwise specified, the discussion in this Annual Report on Form 10-K refers\nto Geospace Technologies Corporation and its subsidiaries. We principally design and manufacture seismic instruments and\nequipment. These seismic products are marketed to the oil and gas industry and used to locate, characterize and monitor hydrocarbon\nproducing reservoirs. We also market our seismic products to other industries for vibration monitoring, border and perimeter security\nand various geotechnical applications. We design and manufacture other products of a non-seismic nature, including water meter\nproducts, imaging equipment and offshore cables. We report and categorize our customers and products into three different segments:\nOil and Gas Markets, Adjacent Markets and Emerging Markets.\nDemand for our seismic products targeted at customers in our Oil and Gas Markets segment has been, and will likely\ncontinue to be, vulnerable to downturns in the economy and the oil and gas industry in general. For more information, please refer to\nthe risks discussed under the heading “Risk Factors.”\nBusiness Acquisitions\nOptoSeis® fiber optic sensing technology\nOn November 13, 2018, we acquired all of the intellectual property and related assets of the OptoSeis® fiber optic sensing\ntechnology business. The operations of the OptoSeis® business are included in our Oil and Gas Markets business segment. The\nacquisition purchase price consisted of cash payments at closing of approximately $1.8 million and contingent earn-out payments of\nup to $23.2 million during the five-and-a-half year period. The contingent earn-out payments will be derived from eligible revenue\ngenerated during the earn-out period from products and services utilizing the OptoSeis® fiber optic technology. There were no earn-\nout obligation payments made during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2019.\nQuantum Technology Sciences, Inc.\nOn July 27, 2018, we acquired Quantum Technology Sciences, Inc., a Florida-based tactical security and surveillance\nsystems solutions provider (“Quantum”) through a merger of the Company’s subsidiary with and into Quantum, with Quantum as the\nsurviving corporation. The acquisition purchase price consisted of a cash down payment at closing of approximately $4.4 million and\ncontingent earn-out payments of up to $23.5 million over a four-year period. The contingent earn-out payments, if any, which may be\npaid in the form of cash or Company stock, will be derived from certain eligible revenue that may be generated during the four-year\nearn-out period. There were no earn-out obligation payments made during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2019.\nThe Quantum acquisition represents the Company’s strategy to expand its product revenues, as well as its engineering and\nmanufacturing competencies, to markets outside the oil and gas industry. The operations of Quantum are included in our Emerging\nMarkets business segment.\nSegment and Geographical Information\nEffective September 30, 2018, we began reporting and evaluating financial information for three business segments: Oil and\nGas Markets, Adjacent Markets and Emerging Markets. The Oil and Gas Markets segment was previously referred to as our Seismic\nsegment. Our Adjacent Markets segment was previously referred to as our Non-Seismic segment. The Emerging Markets segment\nwas added in conjunction with the acquisition of Quantum in July 2018, which designs and markets seismic products targeted at the\nborder and perimeter security markets. Because we have simply renamed our two original segments and added a new segment, we\nhave not restated any previous financial statements. For a discussion of the products sold and markets served by each of our segments,\nsee “Products and Product Development” below. For a discussion of financial information by segment and geographic area, see Note\n21 to the consolidated financial statements contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nProducts and Product Development\nOil and Gas Markets\nOur Oil and Gas Markets business segment has historically accounted for the majority of our revenue. Geoscientists use\nseismic data primarily in connection with the exploration, development and production of oil and gas reserves to map potential and\nknown hydrocarbon bearing formations and the geologic structures that surround them. This segment’s products include wireless\nseismic data acquisition systems, reservoir characterization products and services, and traditional seismic exploration products such as\ngeophones, hydrophones, leader wire, connectors, cables, marine streamer retrieval and steering devices and various other seismic\n1\nproducts. We believe that our Oil and Gas Markets products are among the most technologically advanced instruments and equipment\navailable for seismic data acquisition.\nTraditional Products\nAn energy source and a data recording system are combined to acquire seismic data. We provide many of the components of\nseismic data recording systems, including geophones, hydrophones, multi-component sensors, leader wire, geophone strings,\nconnectors, seismic telemetry cables and other seismic related products. On land, our customers use geophones, leader wire, cables\nand connectors to receive and measure seismic reflections resulting from an energy source into data recording units, which store the\nseismic information for subsequent processing and analysis. In the marine environment, large ocean-going vessels tow long seismic\ncables known as “streamers” containing hydrophones that are used to detect pressure changes. Hydrophones transmit electrical\nimpulses back to the vessel’s data recording unit where the seismic data is stored for subsequent processing and analysis. Our marine\nseismic products also help steer streamers while being towed and help recover streamers if they become disconnected from the vessel.\nOur seismic sensor, cable and connector products are compatible with most major competitive seismic data acquisition\nsystems currently in use. Revenue from these products results primarily from seismic contractors purchasing our products as\ncomponents of new seismic data acquisition systems or to repair and replace components of seismic data acquisition systems already\nin use.\nWireless Products\nWe have developed multiple versions of a land-based wireless (or nodal) seismic data acquisition system. Rather than\nutilizing interconnecting cables as required by most traditional land data acquisition systems, each of our wireless stations operate as\nan independent data collection system, allowing for virtually unlimited channel configurations. As a result, our wireless systems\nrequire less maintenance, which we believe allows our customers to operate more effectively and efficiently because of its reduced\nenvironmental impact, lower weight and ease of operation. Each wireless station is available in a single-channel or three-channel\nconfiguration. Since its introduction in 2008 and through September 30, 2019, we have sold 441,000 wireless channels and we\ncurrently have 84,000 wireless channels in our rental fleet.\nWe have also developed a marine-based wireless seismic data acquisition system called the OBX. Similar to our land-based\nwireless systems, the marine OBX system may be deployed in virtually unlimited channel configurations and does not require\ninterconnecting cables between each station. Our deepwater versions of the OBX system can be deployed in depths of up to 3,450\nmeters. At September 30, 2019, we had 31,000 OBX stations in our rental fleet, and additional OBX stations under construction in\norder to meet contracted rental demand. We expect fiscal year 2020 capital investments into our wireless product rental fleet to be $6\nmillion based on the current level of demand.\nReservoir Products\nSeismic surveys repeated over selected time intervals show dynamic changes within a producing oil and gas reservoir, and\noperators can use these surveys to monitor the effects of oil and gas development and production. This type of reservoir monitoring\nrequires special purpose or custom designed systems in which portability becomes less critical and functional reliability assumes\ngreater importance. This reliability factor helps assure successful operations in inaccessible locations over a considerable period of\ntime. Additionally, reservoirs located in deep water or harsh environments require special instrumentation and new techniques to\nmaximize recovery. Reservoir monitoring also requires high-bandwidth, high-resolution seismic data for engineering project planning\nand reservoir management. Utilizing these reservoir monitoring tools, producers can enhance the recovery of oil and gas deposits over\nthe life of a reservoir.\nWe have developed permanently installed high-definition reservoir monitoring systems for land and ocean-bottom\napplications in producing oil and gas fields. Our electrical reservoir monitoring systems are currently installed on numerous offshore\nreservoirs in the North Sea and elsewhere. Through our recent acquisition of the OptoSeis® fiber optic sensing technology, we now\noffer both electrical and fiber optic reservoir monitoring systems. These high-definition seismic data acquisition systems have a\nflexible architecture allowing them to be configured as a subsurface system for both land and marine reservoir-monitoring projects.\nThe scalable architecture of these systems enable custom designed configuration for applications ranging from low-channel\nengineering and environmental-scale surveys requiring a minimum number of recording channels to high-channel surveys required to\nefficiently conduct permanent reservoir monitoring (“PRM”). The modular architecture of these products allows virtually unlimited\nchannel expansion for these systems.\nIn addition, we produce seismic borehole acquisition systems that employ a fiber optic augmented wireline capable of very\nhigh data transmission rates. These systems are used for several reservoir monitoring applications, including an application pioneered\nby us allowing operators and service companies to monitor and measure the results of hydraulic fracturing operations.\n2\nWe believe our reservoir characterization products make seismic acquisition a cost-effective and reliable process for reservoir\nmonitoring. Our multi-component seismic product developments also include an omni-directional geophone for use in reservoir\nmonitoring, a compact marine three-component or four-component gimbaled sensor and special-purpose connectors, connector arrays\nand cases.\nWe have not received any orders for large-scale seabed PRM systems since November 2012 and we currently do not have\nany indication that such an order will be received in fiscal year 2020, although we do believe opportunities for PRM orders exist in\ntoday’s market.\nAdjacent Markets\nOur Adjacent Markets businesses leverage upon existing manufacturing facilities and engineering capabilities utilized by our\nOil and Gas Markets businesses. Many of the seismic products in our Oil and Gas Markets segment, with little or no modification,\nhave direct application to other industries.\nIndustrial Products\nOur industrial products include water meter products, contract manufacturing products, offshore cables, and seismic sensors\nused for vibration monitoring and geotechnical applications such as mine safety applications and earthquake detection.\nImaging Products\nOur imaging products include electronic pre-press products that employ direct thermal imaging and digital inkjet printing\ntechnologies targeted at the commercial graphics, industrial graphics, textile and flexographic printing industries.\nEmerging Markets\nOur Emerging Markets business segment consists of our recent acquisition of Quantum. Quantum’s product line includes a\nproprietary detection system called SADAR®, which detects, locates and tracks items of interest in real-time. Using the SADAR\ntechnology, Quantum designs and sells products used for border and perimeter security surveillance, cross-border tunneling detection\nand other products targeted at movement monitoring, intrusion detection and situational awareness. Quantum’s customers include\nvarious agencies of the U.S. government including the Department of Defense, Department of Energy, Department of Homeland\nSecurity and other agencies.\nBusiness Strategy\nWe have experienced several years of very low demand for most of the products we sell and rent into our Oil and Gas\nMarkets. We are now seeing some signs of increased oil and gas exploration activities brought about by improving market prices for\ncrude oil. Specifically, we are seeing significant rental demand for some of our oil and gas products used to gather seismic data on the\nocean-bottom and we are allocating capital resources to the production of these products. Conversely, depressed demand continues\nfor our marine PRM systems and many of our land-focused seismic products. As a result, we have adopted what we think is a\nconservative and prudent business strategy which places a focus on sound financial management practices. We have not changed our\nprimary focus on continued investment in product research and development, selective acquisitions and joint ventures.\n• Continue Investment in Product Research and Development – Past periods of revenue growth were primarily driven\nthrough our internal development of new products for the oil and gas industry. In past years, our oil and gas product\ninnovations included the introduction of borehole seismology tools, land and seabed PRM systems and wireless data\nacquisition systems for both land and marine applications. These innovative technologies are the result of our unceasing\ninvestment in research and development initiatives. A majority of our product research and development cost relates to\nour product engineers. Our engineering staff has been key to our past success, and we intend to continue our tradition of\nretaining and attracting quality engineering staff by providing appropriate compensation and benefits. Going forward,\nwe intend to continue significant investments in product research and development of new oil and gas technologies as\nwell as products for our other business segments in order to diversify and grow our revenue base.\n• Selectively Pursue Acquisitions of Businesses with Technological and Engineering Overlap – The oil and gas industry\nperiodically experiences volatile business cycles requiring us to rapidly increase and decrease our business activities to\nmeet the industry’s demand for our products. This industry generally offers equipment manufacturers like us limited\nvisibility into new orders creating challenges for us to manage our manufacturing capacity, workforce, inventories and\nother working capital challenges. While our primary growth initiative is to expand our oil and gas seismic product\nofferings, as seen recently with our acquisition of the OptoSeis® fiber optic sensing technology, we may also seek out\nother business opportunities in adjacent markets and emerging markets which complement our existing oil and gas\n3\nseismic products, engineering and manufacturing capabilities, and company-wide culture. In order to diversify our\nrevenue base and expose us to different markets with different business cycles, we may direct these efforts toward\nbusinesses outside the oil and gas industry, as seen with our acquisition of Quantum in fiscal year 2018.\n• Financial Management – Industry conditions since fiscal year 2014 have required us to place increased emphasis on cash\nmanagement and preservation. Due to the cyclicality of the oil and gas industry, we have historically managed our\nfinancial risk by limiting or eliminating debt leverage in our balance sheet. While we are not opposed to moderate\namounts of short-term debt during favorable business cycles, we choose to minimize our exposure to long-term debt\nobligations which, in our view, restrict our ability to operate during periodic difficult business cycles in the oil and gas\nindustry similar to the recent business environment. We believe this strategy has allowed us to continue operations\nthrough difficult business cycles without disruption for debt and equity restructuring as has been seen among our peers,\nmany of whom have significant long-term debt burdens. In addition, we have limited our investments in capital assets\nand have liquidated, and made appropriate reserves for, significant amounts of our inventories and rental fleet assets.\nWe also believe that the value of our common shares outstanding will be best served in the long-term by retaining our\ncash and short-term investments to fund future cash outflows as they become necessary. In this regard, we do not\nanticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future, nor do we expect to initiate any buy-back program to\nrepurchase our common stock.\nCompetition\nOil and Gas Products\nWe are one of the world’s largest designers and manufacturers of seismic products used in the oil and gas industry. The\nprincipal competitors for many of our traditional seismic products are Sercel (a division of CGG) and INOVA (a joint venture formed\nin 2009 between ION Geophysical and Bureau of Geophysical Prospecting, a subsidiary of China National Petroleum Company).\nFurthermore, entities in China affiliated with Sercel, as well as other Chinese manufacturers produce low-cost oil and gas seismic\nproducts.\nThe primary competitors for our land wireless data acquisition systems are Sercel, INOVA and numerous smaller entities\nwho have introduced similar versions of wireless data acquisition systems. We believe the primary competitors for our marine nodal\ndata acquisition systems are Magseis Fairfield ASA and Seabed Geosolutions (a joint venture formed between Fugro and CGG), each\nof whom utilizes their own proprietary nodal technology.\nMost oil and gas seismic products are price sensitive, so the ability to manufacture these products at a low cost is essential to\nmaintain market share. While price is an important factor in a customer’s decision to purchase a land or marine wireless data\nacquisition system, we believe customers also place a high value on a product’s historical performance and the ongoing engineering\nand field support provided by the product’s manufacturer.\nThe principal keys for success in the seismic instruments and equipment market are technological superiority, product\ndurability under harsh field conditions, reliability and customer support. Product deliverability is always an important consideration\nfor our customers.\nIn general, most customers prefer to standardize data acquisition systems, geophones and hydrophones, particularly if they\nare used by seismic companies that have multiple crews which are able to support each other. This standardization makes it difficult\nfor competitive manufacturers to gain market share from other manufacturers with existing customer relationships.\nOur primary competitors for the rental of our traditional and wireless seismic equipment are Mitcham Industries, Inc. and\nSeismic Equipment Solutions.\nOur primary competitor for our seabed PRM systems is Alcatel-Lucent. Our primary competitors for high-definition\nborehole seismic data acquisition systems are Avalon Sciences Ltd and Sercel.\nAdjacent Markets Products\nOur industrial and imaging products face competition from numerous domestic and international specialty product\nmanufacturers.\nEmerging Markets Products\nThe border and perimeter security marketplace is dominated by large integrated system providers such as Boeing, General\nDynamics, Lockheed Martin, Raytheon, Elbit Systems and others. Systems provided by these competitors are generally multifaceted\nand may include numerous integrated surveillance technologies, including the geophysical sensor and software systems that we have\ndeveloped. Our sensing technology does not rely on line-of-sight motion detection, which is required by cameras and other optical\n4\ntechnologies enabling motion-sensing a camera would miss. Competitive geophysical technologies utilizing fiber optic sensing\ntechniques are provided by OptaSense, Fibersensys, Future Fiber Technologies and other specialty sensor manufacturing firms.\nSuppliers\nWe purchase raw materials from a variety of suppliers located in various countries. We typically have multiple suppliers for\nour critical materials. In our oil and gas seismic business segment, certain models of our marine wireless products use a timing device\nmanufactured by a single supplier. We currently do not possess the ability to manufacture this component and have no other reliable\nsource for this device. In our Adjacent Markets business segment, we purchase all of our imaging thermal film from a single supplier.\nBeyond this film supplier, we know of no other source for thermal film that performs as well in our imaging equipment. For a\ndiscussion of the risks related to our reliance on these suppliers, see “Risk Factors – We Rely on Key Suppliers for Certain\nComponents Used in Our Products.”\nWe do not currently experience any significant difficulties in obtaining raw materials from our suppliers for the production of\nour products.\nProduct Manufacturing and Assembly\nOur manufacturing and product assembly operations consist of machining, molding or cabling the necessary component\nparts, configuring these parts along with components received from various vendors and assembling a final product. We manufacture\nmany of our oil and gas seismic products to the specifications required by our customers. For example, we can armor cables for use in\nmultiple deep water applications. We assemble geophone strings based on a number of customer choices such as length, gauge,\ntolerance and color of molded parts. Upon completion of our manufacturing and assembly operations, we test our final products to the\nfunctional and environmental extremes of product specifications and inspect the products for quality assurance. Consistent with\nindustry practice, we normally manufacture our products based on firm customer orders, anticipated customer orders and historical\nproduct demand. As a result of the steep decline in product demand that began in fiscal year 2014, aggravated by the decline in crude\noil prices, we currently hold significant levels of inventories.\nMarkets and Customers\nOur principal customers for our traditional and wireless seismic products are seismic contractors and, to a lesser extent, major\nindependent and government-owned oil and gas companies that either operate their own seismic crews or specify seismic instrument\nand equipment preferences to contractors. For our deep water PRM products, our customers are generally large international oil and\ngas companies that operate long-term offshore oil and gas producing properties. Our industrial product customers consist of specialty\nmanufacturers, research institutions and industrial product distributors. Our imaging customers primarily consist of direct users of\nour equipment as well as specialized resellers that focus on the screen-printing and flexographic printing industries. Our border and\nperimeter security customers are primarily government agencies.\nThree customers comprised 19.7%, 5.2% and 20.0% of our revenue during fiscal year 2019. The latter two customers are\naffiliated with a common parent company. One customer comprised 10.4% of our revenue during fiscal year 2018. One customer\ncomprised 17.8% of our revenue during fiscal year 2017. The following table describes our revenue by customer segment type (in\nthousands):\n5\nYEAR ENDED SEPTEMBER 30,\n2019 2018 2017\nTraditional seismic exploration product revenue...................... $ 9,504 $ 12,855 $ 14,756\nWireless seismic exploration product revenue.......................... 52,770 27,254 29,690\nSeismic reservoir product revenue............................................ 2,692 4,842 2,663\nIndustrial product revenue........................................................ 18,324 18,352 14,420\nImaging product revenue.......................................................... 11,832 11,580 11,607\nBorder & perimeter security product revenue........................... 159 286 —\nCorporate revenue..................................................................... 528 579 585\nTotal revenue............................................................................. $ 95,809 $ 75,748 $ 73,721\nIntellectual Property\nWe seek to protect our intellectual property by means of patents, trademarks, trade secrets and other measures. We hold\npatents on geophones, micro-geophones, piezo-electric sensors, seismic data acquisition, in-line retrieval devices and water meter\nconnectors, and we have pending applications on related technology. We do not consider any single patent essential to our success.\nOur patents are scheduled to expire at various dates through 2037. We are not able to predict the effect of any patent expiration. We\nprotect our proprietary rights to our technology through a variety of methods, including confidentiality agreements and proprietary\ninformation agreements with suppliers, employees, consultants and others who may have access to proprietary information.\nResearch and Development\nWe expect to incur significant future research and development expenditures aimed at the development of additional products\nfor each of our business segments. We have incurred company-sponsored research and development expenses of $15.5 million, $10.8\nmillion and $13.8 million during the fiscal years ended September 30, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively.\nEmployees\nAs of September 30, 2019, we employed 786 people predominantly on a full-time basis, of which 513 were employed in the\nUnited States, 242 in the Russian Federation and the remainder in the United Kingdom, Canada, China and Colombia. A majority of\nour employees in the Russian Federation belong to a regional union for machine manufacturers. Our remaining employees are not\nunionized. We have never experienced a work stoppage and consider our relationship with our employees to be satisfactory.\nFinancial Information by Segment and Geographic Area\nFor a discussion of financial information by segment and geographic area, see Note 21 to the consolidated financial\nstatements contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. For a description of risks attendant to our foreign operations, please see\n“Risk Factors - Our Foreign Subsidiaries and Foreign Marketing Efforts Are Subject to Additional Political, Economic, Legal and\nOther Uncertainties Not Generally Associated with Domestic Operations.”\nAvailable Information\nWe file annual, quarterly and special reports, proxy statements and other information with the Securities and Exchange\nCommission (“SEC”). Our SEC filings are available to the public over the internet at the SEC’s website at www.sec.gov. Our SEC\nfilings are also available to the public on our website at www.geospace.com. Please note that information contained on our website,\nwhether currently posted or posted in the future, is not a part of this Annual Report on Form 10-K or the documents incorporated by\nreference in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n6\nItem 1A. Risk Factors\nRisk Factors\nCommodity Price Levels May Affect Demand for Our Oil and Gas Products, Which Has and Could Continue to Materially and\nAdversely Affect Our Results of Operations and Liquidity\nDemand for many of our products and the profitability of our operations depend primarily on the level of worldwide oil and\ngas exploration activity. Prevailing oil and gas prices, with an emphasis on crude oil prices, and market expectations regarding\npotential changes in such prices significantly affect the level of worldwide oil and gas exploration activity. During periods of\nimproved energy commodity prices, the capital spending budgets of oil and natural gas operators tend to expand, which results in\nincreased demand for our products. Conversely, in periods when these energy commodity prices deteriorate, capital spending budgets\nof oil and natural gas operators tend to contract and the demand for our products generally weakens. Historically, the markets for oil\nand gas have been volatile and are subject to wide fluctuation in response to changes in the supply of and demand for oil and gas,\nmarket uncertainty and a variety of additional factors that are beyond our control. These factors include the level of consumer\ndemand, supplies of oil and natural gas, regional and international economic conditions, weather conditions, domestic and foreign\ngovernmental regulations (including those related to climate change), price and availability of alternative fuels, political conditions,\ninstability and hostilities in the Middle East and other significant oil-producing regions, increases and decreases in the supply of oil\nand gas, the effect of worldwide energy conservation measures and the ability of OPEC to set and maintain production levels and\nprices of foreign imports.\nIn addition to the negative effects of slowdowns in the United States economy, slowing economic growth in growing\neconomies like those in China and India could lead to a decline in demand for crude oil and natural gas. Slowdowns in economic\nactivity would likely reduce worldwide demand for energy and result in an extended period of lower crude oil and natural gas prices.\nAny material changes in oil and gas prices or other market trends that adversely impact seismic exploration activity would likely affect\nthe demand for our products and could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and liquidity.\nGenerally imbalances in the supply and demand for oil and gas will affect oil and gas prices and, in such circumstances,\ndemand for our oil and gas products may be adversely affected when world supplies exceed demand.\nOur New Products Require a Substantial Investment by Us in Research and Development Expense and May Not Achieve Market\nAcceptance\nOur outlook and assumptions are based on various macro-economic factors and internal assessments, and actual market\nconditions could vary materially from those assumed. In recent years, we have incurred significant expenditures to fund our research\nand development efforts, and we intend to continue those expenditures in the future. However, research and development is by its\nnature speculative, and we cannot assure you that these expenditures will result in the development of new products or services or that\nany new products and services we have developed recently or may develop in the future will be commercially marketable or profitable\nto us. In particular, we have incurred substantial expenditures to develop our oil and gas nodal seismic data acquisition systems, as\nwell as other products for PRM applications. In addition, we try to use some of our capabilities to supply products to new adjacent\nand emerging markets. We cannot assure you that we will realize our expectations regarding acceptance of and revenue generated by\nour new products and services in existing or new markets.\nThe Short Term Nature of Our Order Backlog for Sales of Our Oil and Gas Products and Delayed or Canceled Customer Orders\nMay Cause Us to Experience Fluctuations in Quarterly Results of Operations\nHistorically, the rate of new orders for the sale of our oil and gas products has varied substantially from quarter to quarter.\nMoreover, we typically operate, and expect to continue operating, on the basis of orders in-hand for our products before we commence\nsubstantial manufacturing “runs.” The short-term nature of our order backlog for most of our oil and gas products generally does not\nallow us to predict with any accuracy demand for our products more than approximately three months in advance. Thus, our ability to\nreplenish orders and the completion of orders, particularly large orders for deep water PRM projects, can significantly impact our\noperating results and cash flow for any quarter, and results of operations for any one quarter may not be indicative of results of\noperations for future quarters.\nAdditionally, customers can delay or even cancel orders and rental contracts before product delivery occurs. For larger\norders which generally require us to make a substantial capital investment in our inventories or rental fleet, we attempt to negotiate for\na non-refundable deposit or cancellation penalties depending on our relationship with the customer. However, such deposits or\npenalties, even when obtained, may not fully compensate us for our inventory investment and forgone profits if the order is ultimately\ncancelled.\nThese periodic fluctuations in our operating results and the impact of any order delays/cancellations could adversely affect\nour stock price.\n7\nOur Credit Risk Could Increase and We May Incur Bad Debt Write-Offs If Our Customers Continue to Face Difficult Economic\nCircumstances\nWhile we believe that our allowance for bad debts is adequate in light of known circumstances, additional amounts\nattributable to uncollectible accounts and notes receivable and bad debt write-offs may have a material adverse effect on our future\nresults of operations. Many of our oil and gas customers are not well capitalized and as a result cannot always pay our invoices when\ndue. We have in the past incurred write-offs in our accounts and notes receivable due to customer credit problems. We have found it\nnecessary from time to time to extend trade credit, including promissory notes, to long-term customers and others where some risks of\nnon-payment exist. While we are now seeing increasing crude oil prices, many of our oil and gas customers continue to experience\nsignificant liquidity difficulties, which increase those credit risks. These risks include the potential inability to collect the entire $8.5\nmillion owed to us by an international seismic marine customer, including the failure of such customer to perform under their payment\nplan. An increase in the level of bad debts and any deterioration in our credit risk could adversely affect the price of our stock. In\naddition, we rent equipment to our oil and gas customers who utilize such equipment in various countries around the world. If these\ncustomers experience financial difficulties, it could be difficult or impossible to retrieve our rental equipment from foreign countries.\nThe Industries in Which We Operate are Characterized by Rapid Technological Development and Product Obsolescence, Which\nMay Affect Our Ability to Provide Product Enhancements or New Products on a Timely and Cost Effective Basis\nOur instruments and equipment are constantly undergoing rapid technological improvement. Our future success depends on\nour ability to continue to:\n• improve our existing product lines,\n• address the increasingly sophisticated needs of our customers,\n• maintain a reputation for technological leadership,\n• maintain market acceptance of our products,\n• anticipate changes in technology and industry standards,\n• respond to technological developments on a timely basis and\n• develop new markets for our products and capabilities.\nCurrent competitors or new market entrants may develop new technologies, products or standards that could render our\nproducts obsolete. We cannot assure you that we will be successful in developing and marketing, on a timely and cost effective basis,\nproduct enhancements or new products that respond to technological developments, that are accepted in the marketplace or that\ncomply with new industry standards. Additionally, in anticipation of customer product orders, from time to time we acquire\nsubstantial quantities of inventories, which if not sold or integrated into products within a reasonable period of time, could become\nobsolete. In such case, we would be required to impair the value of such inventories on our balance sheet.\nWe Operate in Highly Competitive Markets and Our Competitors May Be Able to Provide Newer or Better Products Than We Are\nAble to Provide\nThe markets for most of our products are highly competitive. Many of our existing and potential competitors have\nsubstantially greater marketing, financial and technical resources than we do. Some competitors currently offer a broader range of\ninstruments and equipment for sale than we do and may offer financing arrangements to customers on terms that we may not be able\nto match. In addition, new competitors may enter the market and competition could intensify.\nWe cannot assure you that revenue from our products will continue at current volumes or prices if current competitors or new\nmarket entrants introduce new products with better features, performance, price or other characteristics than our products.\nCompetitive pressures or other factors may also result in significant price competition that could have a material adverse effect on our\nresults of operations.\nThe Limited Market for Our Oil and Gas Markets and Emerging Markets Products Can Affect Our Revenue\nIn our Oil and Gas Markets segment, we generally market many of our products to seismic service contractors. We estimate\nthat fewer than 30 oil and gas seismic contracting companies are currently operating in countries other than those operating in the\nRussian Federation and the former Soviet Union, India, the People’s Republic of China and certain Eastern European countries, where\nsuch information is difficult to verify. We estimate that fewer than 15 seismic contractors are engaged in marine seismic exploration\nactivities. Due to these market factors, a relatively small number of customers, some of whom are experiencing financial difficulties,\naccount for most of our oil and gas product revenue. From time to time, these contractors have sought to vertically integrate and\nacquire our competitors, which has influenced their supplier decisions before and after such transactions. In addition, consolidation\namong our customers may further concentrate our business to a limited number of customers and expose us to increased risks related\nto dependence on a small number of customers. We market our seabed PRM systems products to large oil and gas companies. Since\nthis product’s introduction in 2002, we have received system orders from three offshore oil and gas operators: BP, Shell and Statoil,\n8\nwhich have accounted for a significant portion of our revenue in fiscal year 2014 and prior fiscal years. We did not deliver nor have\nwe received orders for any PRM systems since 2014. Our emerging markets segment currently sells its products to a small number of\nagencies within the United States government. The loss of a small number of these customers, and particularly our oil and gas\ncustomers, could materially and adversely impact our future revenues.\nWe Cannot Be Certain of the Effectiveness of Patent Protection on Our Products\nWe hold and from time to time apply for certain patents relating to some of our products. We cannot assure you that our\npatents will prove enforceable or free of challenge, that any patents will be issued for which we have applied or that competitors will\nnot develop functionally similar technology outside the protection of any patents we have or may obtain.\nOur Foreign Subsidiaries and Foreign Marketing Efforts Are Subject to Additional Political, Economic, Legal and Other\nUncertainties Not Generally Associated with Domestic Operations\nBased on customer billing data, revenue to customers outside the United States accounted for approximately 66% of our\nrevenue during fiscal year 2019; however, we believe the percentage of revenue outside the United States is likely higher since many\nof our products are first delivered to a domestic location and ultimately shipped to a foreign location. We again expect revenue\noutside of the United States to represent a substantial portion of our revenue for fiscal year 2020 and subsequent years.\nForeign revenue is subject to special risks inherent in doing business outside of the United States, including the risk of war,\nterrorist activities, civil disturbances, embargo and government activities, shifting foreign attitudes about conducting business\nactivities with the United States, restrictions of the movement and exchange of funds, inhibitions of our ability to collect accounts\nreceivable, international sanctions, expropriation and nationalization of our assets or those of our customers, currency fluctuations,\ndevaluations and conversion restrictions, confiscatory taxation or other adverse tax policies and governmental actions that may result\nin the deprivation of our contractual rights, all of which may disrupt markets or our operations.\nA portion of our oil and gas product manufacturing is conducted through our subsidiary Geospace Technologies Eurasia\nLLC, which is based in the Russian Federation. Our oil and gas business could be directly affected by political and economic\nconditions in the Russian Federation, including the current geopolitical instability involving the Russian Federation, Ukraine and\nSyria. United States sanctions against Russia have been expanded to preclude the export of oil and gas equipment anywhere in the\nworld that involve persons designated under the sanctions and to include projects in which persons subject to the sanctions have a 33%\nownership interest or a majority of voting interests. Together, these changes make it more difficult for us to support projects that have\nthe potential to produce oil involving Russian energy companies. Furthermore, if an exporter is unable to determine whether its\nequipment will be used in such projects, the export is prohibited. In fiscal year 2019, we imported $1.8 million of products from\nGeospace Technologies Eurasia LLC, our wholly-owned subsidiary in the Russian Federation for resale elsewhere in the world. If\nimports of these products from the Russian Federation are restricted by government regulation, we may be forced to find other sources\nfor the manufacture of these products at potentially higher costs. Boycotts, protests, unfavorable regulations, additional governmental\nsanctions and other actions in the region could also adversely affect our ability to operate profitably. Delays in obtaining\ngovernmental approvals can affect our ability to timely deliver our products pursuant to contractual obligations, which could result in\nus being liable to our customers for damages. The risk of doing business in the Russian Federation and other economically or\npolitically volatile areas could adversely affect our operations and earnings.\nForeign revenue is also generally subject to the risk of compliance with additional laws, including tariff regulations and\nimport and export restrictions. International revenue transactions for our products containing hydrophones require prior U.S.\ngovernment approval in the form of an export license, which may be withheld by the U.S. government based upon factors which we\ncannot predict.\nWe may experience difficulties in connection with future foreign revenue. Additionally, due to foreign laws and restrictions,\nshould we experience substantial growth in certain foreign markets, for example in the Russian Federation, we may not be able to\ntransfer cash balances to the United States to assist with debt servicing or other obligations.\nIncreases in Tariffs, Trade Restrictions or Taxes on our Products Could Have an Adverse Impact on our Operations.\nIn fiscal year 2019, customers outside the United States accounted for 66% of our revenues. We also purchase a portion of\nour raw materials from suppliers in China and other foreign countries. The commerce we conduct in the international marketplace\nmakes us subject to tariffs, trade restrictions and other taxes when the raw materials we purchase, and the products we ship, cross\ninternational borders. Trade tensions between the United States and China, as well as those between the U.S. and Canada, Mexico and\nother countries have been escalating in recent years. Trade tensions have led to a series of tariffs imposed by the U.S. on imports from\nChina, as well as retaliatory tariffs imposed by China on imports from the U.S. Most recently, on August 23, 2019, the U.S.\ngovernment announced a plan to implement two additional tariff increases in retaliation for China’s imposing additional tariffs of 5%\nto 10% on $75 billion of U.S. imports to China earlier that day. We believe that certain raw materials we purchase from China could\nbecome subject to these tariffs which could increase our manufacturing costs. Products we sell into certain foreign markets could also\n9\nbecome subject to similar retaliatory tariffs, making the products we sell uncompetitive to similar products not subjected to such\nimport tariffs. Further changes in U.S. trade policies, tariffs, taxes, export restrictions or other trade barriers, or restrictions on raw\nmaterials including rare earth minerals, may limit our ability to produce products, increase our manufacturing costs, decrease our\nprofit margins, reduce the competitiveness of our products, or inhibit our ability to sell products or purchase raw materials, which\ncould have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial conditions.\nOur Global Operations Expose Us to Risks Associated with Conducting Business Internationally, Including Failure to Comply\nwith U.S. Laws Which Apply to International Operations, Such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and U.S. Export Control\nLaws, as Well as the Laws of Other Countries\nWe have offices in Brazil, Colombia, Canada, China, the Russian Federation and the United Kingdom, in addition to our\noffices in the United States. In addition to the risks noted above that are inherent in conducting business internationally, we are also\nliable for compliance with international and U.S. laws and regulations that apply to our international operations. These laws and\nregulations include data privacy requirements, labor relations laws, tax laws, anti-competition regulations, import and trade\nrestrictions, export control laws, U.S. laws such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar laws in other countries which also\nprohibit certain payments to governmental officials or certain payments or remunerations to customers. Many of our products are\nsubject to U.S. export law restrictions that limit the destinations and types of customers to which our products may be sold, or require\nan export license in connection with revenue transactions outside the United States. Given the high level of complexity of these laws,\nthere is a risk that some provisions may be inadvertently breached, for example through the negligent or the unauthorized intentional\nbehavior of individual employees, our failure to comply with certain formal documentation requirements or otherwise. Additionally,\nwe may be held liable for actions taken by our local dealers and partners. Violations of these laws and regulations could result in\nfines, criminal sanctions against us, our officers or our employees, and prohibitions on the conduct of our business. Any such\nviolations could include prohibitions on our ability to offer our products in one or more countries and could materially damage our\nreputation, our brands, our international expansion efforts, our ability to attract and retain employees, our business and our operating\nresults.\nOur Strategy of Renting Our Oil and Gas Seismic Products Exposes Us to Additional Risks Relating to Equipment Recovery,\nRental Renewals, Technological Obsolescence and Impairment of Assets\nOur rental fleet of oil and gas equipment represents a significant portion of our assets and accounts for a growing portion of\nour revenue. Equipment we rent to our customers is frequently located in foreign countries where retrieval of the equipment after the\ntermination of the rental agreement is difficult or impossible if the customer does not return the equipment. The costs associated with\nretrieving this equipment or the loss of equipment that is not retrieved could be significant and could adversely affect our operations\nand earnings.\nThe advancement of seismic technology having a significant competitive advantage over the equipment in our rental fleet\ncould have an adverse effect on our ability to profitably rent and/or sell this equipment. Significant improvements in technology may\nalso require us to record asset impairment charges to write-down the value of our rental fleet investment and to invest significant sums\nto upgrade or replace our rental fleet with newer equipment demanded by our customers. In addition, rental contracts may not be\nrenewed for equipment in our rental fleet. Significant technology improvements by our competitors could have an adverse effect on\nour results of operations and earnings.\nOur equipment rental business has high fixed costs, which primarily consist of depreciation expenses. In periods of declining\nrental revenue, these fixed costs generally do not decline. As a result, any significant decline in rental revenue caused by reduced\ndemand could adversely affect our results of operations.\n10\nOur Expansion Into the Border and Perimeter Security Market May Not Be Successful\nWe have not previously operated in the border and perimeter security marketplace prior to our 2018 acquisition of Quantum.\nQuantum is also a relatively recent entrant into this marketplace, and Quantum was not cash-flow positive when we acquired it. While\nwe will devote management time and resources, financial and otherwise, to develop our business in this marketplace, our lack of\nexperience and success up to this point in this market makes it difficult to estimate our financial returns, if any, from this business. In\naddition, some of the customers for this business will be governmental entities and contracting with those entities can be difficult,\ncostly, and unpredictable. We do not have extensive experience in government contracting, and so we may not win, retain, or perform\nunder such contracts in a manner that is profitable. If we are not successful in this emerging market segment, it will negatively impact\nour financial performance and could negatively impact our reputation and harm our other business segments.\nCybersecurity Breaches and Other Disruptions of Our Information Technology Network and Systems Could Adversely Affect Our\nBusiness\nWe rely on information technology networks and systems, some of which are owned and operated by third parties, to process,\ntransmit and store electronic information. In particular, we depend on our information technology infrastructure for a variety of\nfunctions, including worldwide financial reporting, inventory management, procurement, invoicing and email communications. Any\nof these systems may be susceptible to outages due to fire, floods, power loss, telecommunications failures, terrorist attacks and\nsimilar events. Despite the implementation of network security measures, our systems and those of third parties on which we rely may\nalso be vulnerable to computer viruses, break-ins, malware and similar disruptions. Malware, if surreptitiously installed on our\nsystems and not timely detected and removed, could collect and disclose sensitive information relating to our customers, employees or\nothers, exposing us to legal liability and causing us to suffer reputational damage. It could also lead to disruptions in critical systems\nor the corruption or destruction of critical data. If we are unable to prevent such outages and breaches, these events could damage our\nreputation and lead to financial losses from remedial actions, loss of business or potential liability.\nBecause We Have No Plans to Pay Any Dividends for the Foreseeable Future, Investors Must Look Solely to Stock Appreciation\nfor a Return on Their Investment in Us\nWe have not paid cash dividends on our common stock since our incorporation and do not anticipate paying any cash\ndividends in the foreseeable future. We currently intend to retain any future earnings to support our operations and growth. Any\npayment of cash dividends in the future will be dependent on the amount of funds legally available, our financial condition, capital\nrequirements, loan covenants and other factors that our Board of Directors may deem relevant. Accordingly, investors must rely on\nsales of their common stock after price appreciation, which may never occur, as the only way to realize any future gains on their\ninvestment.\nUnfavorable Currency Exchange Rate Fluctuations Could Adversely Affect Our Results of Operations\nSubstantially all of our third-party revenue from the United States is invoiced in U.S. dollars, though from time to time we\nmay invoice revenue transactions in foreign currencies including intercompany sales. As a result, we may be subject to foreign\ncurrency fluctuations on our revenue. The reporting currency for our financial statements is the U.S. dollar. However, the assets,\nliabilities, revenue and costs of our Russian, Canadian and United Kingdom subsidiaries and our Brazilian, Chinese and Colombian\nbranch offices are denominated in currencies other than U.S. dollars. To prepare our consolidated financial statements, we must\ntranslate those assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses into U.S. dollars at then-applicable exchange rates. Consequently, increases\nand decreases in the value of the U.S. dollar versus these other currencies will affect the amount of these items in our consolidated\nfinancial statements, even if their value has not changed in their original currency. These translations could result in significant\nchanges to our results of operations from period to period. For the fiscal year ended September 30, 2019, approximately 11% of our\nconsolidated revenue related to the operations of our foreign subsidiaries and branches.\nWe Have a Relatively Small Public Float, and Our Stock Price May be Volatile\nAt September 30, 2019, we have approximately 13.1 million shares outstanding held by non-affiliates. This limited number\nof shares outstanding results in a relatively limited market for our common stock. Our daily trading volume for the year ended\nSeptember 30, 2019 averaged approximately 66,000 shares. Our small float and daily trading volumes have in the past caused, and\nmay in the future result in, significant volatility in our stock price.\nWe Rely on Key Suppliers for Certain Components Used in Our Products\nCertain models of our oil and gas marine wireless products require a timing device we purchase from a United States\nmanufacturer. We currently do not possess the ability to manufacture this component and have no other reliable source for this\ndevice. If this manufacturer were to discontinue its production of this timing device, were to become unwilling to contract with us on\n11\ncompetitive terms or were unable to supply the component in sufficient quantities to meet our requirements, our ability to compete in\nthe marine wireless marketplace could be impaired, which could adversely affect our financial performance.\nFor our imaging products, we purchase all of our thermal film from a European manufacturer. Except for the film sold to us\nby this manufacturer, we know of no other source for thermal film that performs as well in our imaging equipment. If the European\nmanufacturer were to discontinue producing thermal film, were to become unwilling to contract with us on competitive terms or were\nunable to supply thermal film in sufficient quantities to meet our requirements, our ability to compete in the direct thermal imaging\nmarketplace could be impaired, which could adversely affect our financial performance.\nOur Success Depends Upon a Limited Number of Key Personnel\nOur success depends on attracting and retaining highly skilled professionals. A number of our employees are highly skilled\nengineers and other professionals. In addition, our success depends to a significant extent upon the abilities and efforts of the\nmembers of our senior management team. If we fail to continue to attract and retain such professionals, our ability to compete in the\nindustry could be adversely affected.\nA Continued General Downturn in the Economy in Future Periods May Adversely Affect Our Business\nSlowing growth in China and India and any other economic slowdown in future periods, could adversely affect our business\nin ways that we cannot predict. During times of economic slowdown, our customers may reduce their capital expenditures and defer\nor cancel pending projects and product orders. Such developments occur even among customers that are not experiencing financial\ndifficulties. Any economic downturn may adversely affect the demand for oil and gas generally or cause volatility in oil and gas\ncommodity prices and, therefore, adversely affect the demand for delivery of our oil and gas products. It could also adversely affect\nthe demand for consumer and industrial products, which could in turn adversely affect our Adjacent Markets business segment. To\nthe extent these factors adversely affect other companies in the industries we serve, there could be an oversupply of products and\nservices and downward pressure on pricing for our products and services, which could adversely affect us. Additionally, bankruptcies\nor financial difficulties among our oil and gas customers could reduce our cash flows and adversely impact our liquidity and\nprofitability. See “The Limited Market for Our Oil and Gas Products Can Affect Our Revenue,” above.\nWe Have a Minimal Disaster Recovery Program at Our Houston Facilities\nDue to its proximity to the Texas Gulf Coast, our facilities in Houston, Texas are annually subject to the threat of hurricanes,\nand the aftermath that follows. Hurricanes may cause, among other types of damage, the loss of electrical power for extended periods\nof time. If we lost electrical power at our Pinemont facility, or if a fire or other natural disaster occurred, we would be unable to\ncontinue our manufacturing operations during the power outage because we do not own a generator or any other back-up power source\nlarge enough to provide for our manufacturing power consumption needs. Additionally, we do not have an alternative manufacturing\nor operating location in the United States. Therefore, a significant disruption in our manufacturing operations could materially and\nadversely affect our business operations during an extended period of a power outage, fire or other natural disaster. We have a back-\nup generator to provide power for our information technology operations. We store our back-up data offsite and we replicate our\nmission critical data to an alternative cloud-based data center on a real-time basis. In the event of a major service interruption in our\ndata center, we believe we would be able to activate our mission critical applications within less than 24 hours.\nOur Credit Agreement Imposes Restrictions on Our Business\nWe and several of our subsidiaries domiciled in the United States are parties to a credit agreement with a bank. Amounts\navailable for borrowing under the credit agreement are determined by a borrowing base, which is determined based upon the book\nvalue of certain assets. The credit agreement limits the incurrence of additional indebtedness, restricts our and our U.S. subsidiaries’\nability to pay cash dividends if payment would result in pro forma non-compliance with the negative covenants in the credit\nagreement, requires us to maintain a certain amount of unencumbered liquid assets, contains a covenant that requires us to maintain a\ncertain amount of tangible net worth and contains other covenants customary in agreements of this type. Our ability to comply with\nthese restrictions may be affected by events beyond our control, including, but not limited to, prevailing economic, financial and\nindustry conditions and continuing declines in our product revenue. The breach of any of these covenants or restrictions, as well as\nany failure to make a payment of interest or principal when due, could result in a default under the credit agreement. Such a default\nwould permit our lender to declare any amounts borrowed from it to be due and payable, together with accrued and unpaid interest,\nand the ability to borrow under the credit agreement could be terminated. If we are unable to repay any debts owed to our lender, the\nlender could proceed against the collateral securing that debt. While we intend to seek alternative sources of cash in such a situation,\nthere is no guarantee that any alternative cash source would be available or would be available on terms favorable to us.\n12\nReliance on Third Party Subcontractors Could Adversely Affect Our Results of Operations and Reputation\nWe may rely on subcontractors to complete certain projects. The quality and timing of production and services by our\nsubcontractors is not totally under our control. Reliance on subcontractors gives us less control over a project and exposes us to\nsignificant risks, including late delivery, substandard quality and high costs. The failure of our subcontractors to deliver quality\nproducts or services in a timely manner could adversely affect our profitability and reputation.\nThe High Fixed Costs of Our Operations Could Adversely Affect Our Results of Operations\nWe have a high fixed cost structure primarily consisting of (i) depreciation expenses associated with our rental equipment\nand (ii) fixed manufacturing costs including salaries and benefits, taxes, insurance, maintenance, depreciation and other fixed\nmanufacturing costs. In regards to our rental equipment, large declines in the demand for rental equipment could result in substantial\noperating losses due to the on-going fixed nature of rental equipment depreciation expense. Concerning our product manufacturing\ncosts, in periods of low product demand our fixed costs generally do not decline or may decline only in modest increments. Therefore\nlower demand for our rental equipment and manufactured products could adversely affect our results of operations.\nOur Long-Lived Assets May be Subject to Impairment\nWe periodically assess our long-lived assets for impairment. Significant sustained future decreases in crude oil and natural\ngas prices may require us to write down the value of our long-lived assets in our Oil and Gas Markets business segment, including our\nmanufacturing facilities, manufacturing equipment and rental equipment if future cash flows anticipated to be generated from these\nassets fall below the asset’s net book value. Furthermore, we may be required to write down the value of goodwill and other\nintangible assets if our acquisition of Quantum or the OptoSeis® fiber optic sensing technology does not generate sufficient cash flows\nto recover the carrying value of such assets. If we are forced to write down the value of our long-lived assets, these noncash asset\nimpairments could adversely affect our results of operations.\nIncreased or Inaccurate Estimation of Contingent Earn-Out Liabilities Could Result in Increased Charge-Offs or Losses and\nDefaults Under Our Credit Agreement\nAs further discussed below, we have contingent earn-out liability associated with our acquisitions of Quantum and\nOptoSeis. We have utilized the services of an independent valuation consultant to assist us with the estimation of the contingent earn-\nout liability in each case. We expect to continue to utilize similar consulting services to help us estimate the contingent earn-out\nliability in future periods. If we, or our independent valuation consultant, have incorrectly estimated such potential earn-out liability\nor if such estimates prove to be inaccurate due to the inherent unpredictability of the size, scope, and occurrence of the contracts that\nmight be subject to such earn-outs, and we are required to pay an amount of consideration in excess of our estimate, we may incur\nincreased losses and charge-offs associated with that increased liability. If we receive substantial revenue from Quantum or OptoSeis\nand if such revenue is subject to the applicable earn-out, the attendant increase in contingent liability could also be\nsubstantial. Further, in certain instances, if the increases in contingent earn-out liability are of a large enough magnitude, they may\ncause us to default on certain financial covenants in our credit agreement. These increased losses, potential defaults, and other\nnegative repercussions from such increased liability could adversely affect our financial performance and results of operations.\nShould We Fail to Maintain an Effective System of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting, We May Not Be Able to Accurately\nReport Our Financial Results and Prevent Material Fraud, Which Could Adversely Affect the Value of Our Common Stock\nEffective internal control over financial reporting is necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports and effectively\nprevent and detect material fraud. If we cannot provide reliable financial reports or prevent or detect material fraud, our operating\nresults could be misstated. There can be no assurances that we will be able to prevent control deficiencies from occurring and which\ncould cause us to incur unforeseen costs, negatively impact our results of operations, cause the market price of our common stock to\ndecline, or have other potential adverse consequences.\nItem 1B.

Selected Financial Data\nNot Required.\nItem 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following is management’s discussion and analysis of the major elements of our consolidated financial statements. You\nshould read this discussion and analysis together with our consolidated financial statements, including the accompanying notes, and\nother detailed information appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including under the heading “Risk Factors.” The\ndiscussion of our financial condition and results of operations includes various forward-looking statements about our markets, the\ndemand for our products and services and our future plans and results. These statements are based on assumptions that we consider to\nbe reasonable, but that could prove to be incorrect. For more information regarding our assumptions, you should refer to the section\nentitled “Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements and Assumptions” below.\nCautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements and Assumptions\nThis Annual Report on Form 10-K and the documents incorporated by reference herein, if any, contain “forward-looking”\nstatements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange\nAct of 1934, as amended. These forward-looking statements can be identified by terminology such as “may”, “will”, “should”,\n“intend”, “expect”, “plan”, “budget”, “forecast”, “anticipate”, “believe”, “estimate”, “predict”, “potential”, “continue”, “evaluating” or\nsimilar words. Statements that contain these words should be read carefully because they discuss our future expectations, contain\nprojections of our future results of operations or of our financial position or state other forward-looking information. Examples of\nforward-looking statements include, among others, statements that we make regarding our expected operating results, the results and\nsuccess of our transactions with Quantum and the OptoSeis® technology, the adoption and sale of our products in various geographic\nregions, potential tenders for PRM systems, future demand for OBX systems, anticipated levels of capital expenditures and the\nsources of funding therefor, and our strategy for growth, product development, market position, financial results and the provision of\naccounting reserves. These forward-looking statements reflect our current judgment about future events and trends based on the\ninformation currently available to us. However, there will likely be events in the future that we are not able to predict or control. The\nfactors listed under the caption “Risk Factors”, as well as cautionary language in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, provide examples\nof risks, uncertainties and events that may cause our actual results to differ materially from the expectations we describe in our\nforward-looking statements. Such examples include, but are not limited to, the failure of the Quantum or OptoSeis® technology\ntransactions to yield positive operating results, decreases in commodity price levels, which could reduce demand for our products, the\nfailure of our products to achieve market acceptance, despite substantial investment by us, our sensitivity to short term backlog,\ndelayed or cancelled customer orders, product obsolescence resulting from poor industry conditions or new technologies, bad debt\nwrite-offs associated with customer accounts, lack of further orders for our OBX systems, failure of our Quantum products to be\nadopted by the border and perimeter security market, infringement or failure to protect intellectual property. The occurrence of the\nevents described in these risk factors and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K could have a material adverse effect on our\nbusiness, results of operations and financial position, and actual events and results of operations may vary materially from our current\nexpectations. We assume no obligation to revise or update any forward-looking statement, whether written or oral, that we may make\nfrom time to time, whether as a result of new information, future developments or otherwise.\n16\nBackground\nWe design and manufacture seismic instruments and equipment and primarily market these products to the oil and gas\nindustry to locate, characterize and monitor hydrocarbon producing reservoirs. We also market our seismic products to other\nindustries for vibration monitoring, border and perimeter security and various geotechnical applications. We design and manufacture\nother products of a non-seismic nature, including water meter products, imaging equipment and offshore cables. See the information\nunder the heading “Business” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nConsolidated Results of Operations\nAs we have reported in the past, our revenue and operating profits have varied significantly from quarter-to-quarter, and even\nyear-to-year, and are expected to continue that trend in the future, especially when our quarterly or annual financial results are\nimpacted by the presence or absence of relatively large, but somewhat erratic, sales of our oil and gas PRM systems and/or wireless\nseismic data acquisition systems for land and marine applications.\nOur revenue and results of operations have not been materially impacted by inflation or changing prices in the past two fiscal\nyears.\nWe report and evaluate financial information for three segments: Oil and Gas Markets, Adjacent Markets and Emerging\nMarkets. Summary financial data by business segment follows (in thousands):\nYEAR ENDED SEPTEMBER 30,\n2019 2018\nOil and Gas Markets\nTraditional exploration product revenue........................................... $ 9,504 $ 12,855\nWireless exploration product revenue............................................... 52,770 27,254\nReservoir product revenue................................................................. 2,692 4,842\nTotal revenue..................................................................................... 64,966 44,951\nOperating income (loss)..................................................................... 3,095 (14,070)\nAdjacent Markets\nIndustrial product revenue................................................................. 18,324 18,352\nImaging product revenue................................................................... 11,832 11,580\nTotal revenue..................................................................................... 30,156 29,932\nOperating income.............................................................................. 6,234 5,345\nEmerging Markets\nRevenue............................................................................................. 159 286\nOperating loss....................................................................................

During this period oil production in North America’s unconventional\nshale reservoirs increased, as did oil production from other non-OPEC countries, resulting in an oversupply of crude oil in the world\nmarket. Market prices for a barrel of West Texas Intermediate crude oil declined from over $100 in July 2014 to approximately $26 in\nFebruary 2016, and have recovered to approximately $55 today. With this decline in oil prices, oil and gas exploration and production\ncompanies experienced a significant reduction in cash flows, which resulted in sharp reductions in their capital spending budgets for\noil and gas exploration-focused activities, including seismic data acquisition activities. Our Oil and Gas Markets segment is now\nseeing significant demand for the rental of our marine wireless nodal products; however, the demand for new land-based seismic\nequipment in recent fiscal years has remained restrained due to capital limitations affecting many of our customers, along with their\nexcess levels of underutilized equipment. As a result, revenue from the sale and rental of our land-based traditional and wireless\nproducts has remained low due to reduced investment in exploration-focused seismic activities. We expect these challenging industry\nconditions will improve somewhat in fiscal year 2020, however, we expect revenue from our traditional and land-based wireless\nproducts to remain below historical norms.\n17\nIn light of current market conditions, the inventory balances in our Oil and Gas Markets business segment at September 30,\n2019 continued to exceed levels we consider appropriate for the current level of product demand. While we are aggressively working\nto reduce these legacy inventory balances, we are also adding new inventories for new wireless product developments and for other\nproduct demand in our Adjacent Markets segment. During periods of excessive inventory levels, our policy has been, and will\ncontinue to be, to record obsolescence expense as we experience reduced product demand and as our inventories continue to age. If\ndifficult market conditions continue for the products in our Oil and Gas Markets segment, we expect to record additional inventory\nobsolescence expense in fiscal year 2020 and beyond until product demand and/or resulting inventory turnover return to acceptable\nlevels.\nIn December 2017, we initiated a program to reduce operating costs in light of expected and continuing low levels of oil and\ngas product demand. The program produced approximately $6 million of annualized cash savings. The majority of these future cost\nreductions were realized through the reduction of over 60 employees from our Houston area workforce. In connection with the\nworkforce reductions, we incurred $0.7 million of termination costs in our first quarter of fiscal year 2018. The termination costs were\nrecorded to both cost of revenue and operating expenses in the consolidated statement of operations. There are no outstanding\nliabilities related to this program as of September 30, 2019.\nFiscal Year 2019 Compared to Fiscal Year 2018\nConsolidated revenue for fiscal year 2019 increased $20.1 million, or 26.5%, from fiscal year 2018. The increase in revenue\nprimarily resulted from increased rental revenue in our Oil and Gas Markets segment from our OBX marine nodal products.\nConsolidated gross profit for fiscal year 2019 was $31.4 million, compared to $11.0 million for fiscal year 2018. The\nincrease in gross profit primarily resulted from a significant increase in wireless product rental revenue caused by the high utilization\nof our expanding OBX rental fleet and a decline in unutilized factory costs due to higher manufacturing productivity from production\nof OBX nodes. While factory utilization has recently increased due to demand for the rental of our OBX marine nodal products, we\nexpect our consolidated gross margins from the sale of our Oil and Gas Markets products to remain below historic norms until demand\nincreases significantly for our land-based traditional and wireless seismic products.\nConsolidated operating expenses for fiscal year 2019 were $37.4 million, an increase of $5.7 million, or 18.1%, from fiscal\nyear 2018. The increase in operating expenses was primarily due to incremental operating costs associated with our recent\nacquisitions of the Quantum and OptoSeis® businesses. For fiscal year 2019, operating expenses increased $7.1 million due to\nacquisition-related operating costs, inclusive of intangible asset amortization expenses of $1.5 million. These acquisition-related\nincreases in operating expenses were partially offset by a $2.1 million net non-cash reduction in the estimated fair value of contingent\nearn-out consideration related to our Quantum and OptoSeis® acquisitions. The balance of the increased operating expenses relates to\npersonnel wage increases and other general expense increases related to our business operations.\nIn August 2019, we sold our real property located at 7334-7340 N. Gessner Road in Houston, Texas for a cash sales price of\n$8.3 million. We recognized a gain of $7.0 million from the sale of this property in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2019. The buyer\nhad previously occupied the property as a tenant under a long-term lease.\nConsolidated other income for fiscal year 2019 increased $0.3 million from fiscal year 2018, or 30.2% from fiscal year 2018.\nThis increase was primarily due to (i) an increase in interest charged to a customer for the late payment of our invoices and (ii) a\ndecrease in foreign currency hedge financing fees. These increases in other income were partially offset by a decrease in foreign\nexchange gains.\nConsolidated income tax expense for fiscal year 2019 was $2.4 million compared to a tax benefit of $0.6 million for fiscal\nyear 2018. The income tax expense in fiscal year 2019 primarily reflects foreign withholding tax assessed on our rental income. The\nincome tax benefit for fiscal year 2018 primarily reflects a $0.7 million refund resulting from the filing of an amended U.S. tax return.\nWe are currently unable to record any tax benefits from the tax losses we incur in the U.S. and Canada due to the uncertainty\nsurrounding our ability to utilize such losses in the future to offset taxable income.\n18\nSegment Results of Operations\nOil and Gas Markets\nFiscal Year 2019 Compared to Fiscal Year 2018\nRevenue\nRevenue from our Oil and Gas Markets products for fiscal year 2019 increased $20.0 million, or 44.5%, from the prior fiscal\nyear. The components of this increase include the following:\n• Traditional Exploration Product Revenue – Revenue from our traditional products decreased $3.4 million, or 26.1%\nfrom the prior fiscal year. The decrease primarily reflects lower demand for our specialty sensor products and customer\nproduct repairs. The decrease was partially offset by higher demand for our marine products.\n• Wireless Exploration Product Revenue – Revenue from our wireless exploration products increased $25.5 million, or\n93.6%, from the prior fiscal year. The increase resulted from higher rental demand for our OBX systems. The increase\nwas partially offset by a decline in demand for sales and rental of our GSX wireless products.\n• Reservoir Product Revenue – Revenue from our reservoir products decreased $2.2 million, or 44.4%, from the prior\nfiscal year. The decrease was primarily due to a decrease in sales of our borehole products and lower service revenue.\nOperating Income (Loss)\nOperating income associated with our Oil and Gas Markets products for fiscal year 2019 was $3.1 million, compared to an\noperating loss of $(14.1) million from the prior fiscal year. The improvement in our operating income primarily resulted from (i) an\nincrease in wireless rental revenue and gross profits from our OBX systems and (ii) a decline in unutilized factory costs due to higher\nproductivity. Partially offsetting these operating income improvements is an $0.8 million adjustment to increase our operating\nexpenses due to an increase in the estimated fair value of contingent earn-out consideration related to our recent OptoSeis®\nacquisition.\nAdjacent Markets\nFiscal Year 2019 Compared to Fiscal Year 2018\nRevenue\nRevenue from our Adjacent Markets products for fiscal year 2019 increased $0.2 million, or 0.7%, from the prior fiscal year.\nThe components of this increase included the following:\n• Industrial Product Revenue and Services – Revenue from our industrial products decreased $28,000, or 0.2% from the\nprior fiscal year. The decrease in revenue primarily attributable to lower demand for our water meter products. These\ndecreases were partially offset by increased demand for our industrial sensor products.\n• Imaging Product Revenue – Revenue from our imaging products increased $0.3 million, or 2.2%, from the prior fiscal\nyear. The increase was primarily due to higher demand for our equipment and film products. We consider this small\nchange in revenue to be normal and not indicative of any particular trend in product demand.\nOperating Income\nThe operating income from our Adjacent Markets products for fiscal year 2019 increased $0.9 million or 16.6%, from the\nprior fiscal year. The increase in operating income resulted from efficiencies gained in our manufacturing efforts and lower operating\npersonnel costs.\nEmerging Markets\nFiscal Year 2019 Compared to Fiscal Year 2018\nRevenue\nOn July 27, 2018, we entered the border and perimeter security market through our acquisition of Quantum. In connection\nwith the Quantum acquisition, we established the Emerging Markets business segment, which currently includes only Quantum.\nRevenue from our Emerging Markets products for fiscal year 2019 decreased $0.1 million, or 44.4%, from the prior fiscal year. The\n19\ndecrease in revenue primarily resulted from the completion of contracts that existed when Quantum was acquired. Quantum did not\nreceive any significant border and perimeter security contracts during fiscal year 2019.\nOperating Loss\nOur operating loss from our Emerging Markets products for fiscal year 2019 increased $1.6 million, or 221.2% from the prior\nfiscal year. Since its acquisition in July 2018, Quantum has primarily focused on product development activities, and the marketing of\nits technologies to government agencies and other end users. Fiscal year 2018 includes approximately two months of Quantum’s\noperating activities while fiscal year 2019 includes a full year of operating activities. Included in Quantum’s operating expenses for\nfiscal years 2019 and 2018 are intangible asset amortization expenses of $1.2 million and $0.2 million, respectively. Also included in\nQuantum’s operating expenses for fiscal year 2019 is a $2.9 million adjustment to decrease Quantum’s operating expenses caused by a\ndecrease in the estimated fair value of contingent earn-out consideration related to our acquisition of Quantum. We expect Quantum\nto incur operating losses into the future until it obtains revenue-generating contracts that are sufficiently able to support its current cost\nstructure.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nFiscal Year 2019\nAt September 30, 2019, we had approximately $18.9 million in cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments. For\nfiscal year 2019, we generated $5.6 million of cash from operating activities. Our net loss of $0.1 million included net non-cash\ncharges of $24.6 million resulting from deferred income taxes, depreciation, amortization, accretion, inventory obsolescence, stock-\nbased compensation, bad debt expense and changes in the estimated fair value of contingent consideration. These net non-cash\ncharges were partially offset by (i) a $9.2 million increase in trade accounts and financing receivables resulting from the increase in\nrevenue and delays in collecting funds owed from a rental customer, (ii) a $1.9 million increase in inventories for the production of\nrecently introduced land-based wireless seismic products, (iii) the removal of a $7.1 million gain from the sale of real property and\nequipment since such gains are reflected in the proceeds from the sale of property and equipment under investing activities and (iv) a\n$1.0 decrease in deferred revenue due to the revenue recognition of customer deposits on rental contracts.\nFor fiscal year 2019, we generated cash of $1.6 million from investing activities. Sources of cash included (i) $25.6 million\nof proceeds from the sale of short-term investments, (ii) $8.3 million of proceeds from the sale of a real property (iii) $4.9 million of\nproceeds from the sale of rental equipment and (iv) $0.5 million of proceeds, net of payments, from a property-related insurance\nclaim. These sources of cash were partially offset by (i) $34.1 million investment in our rental equipment primarily to expand our\nOBX rental fleet, (ii) $1.9 million for additions to our property, plant and equipment and (iii) $1.8 million for the acquisition of the\nintellectual property and related assets of the OptoSeis® fiber optic sensing technology business. Depending on demand for our\nmarine OBX rental equipment, we expect fiscal year 2020 cash investments into our rental fleet to be approximately $6 million. We\nestimate total fiscal year 2020 cash investments in property, plant and equipment could be up to $5 million. Our capital expenditures\nare expected to be funded from our cash on hand, internal cash flows, cash flows from our rental contracts or, if necessary, from\nborrowings under our credit agreement.\nFor fiscal year 2019, we generated cash proceeds of $0.2 million from financing activities from the exercise of stock options\nby our employees. We had no long-term debt outstanding throughout the fiscal year ended September 30, 2019.\nThe significant crude oil price volatility that began in 2014 continues today, stifling budgets targeted at the oil and gas\nexploration industry, including the seismic industry. OPEC and other crude oil producing/exporting nations appear united in their\nefforts to maintain equilibrium between current worldwide crude oil supply and demand. If worldwide crude oil supplies and\nassociated prices stabilize, these factors and developing trends bode well for the oil and gas industry and we expect to participate in\nany resurgence in demand for new seismic equipment that may be forthcoming. While we are seeing some signs of increased seismic\nactivity in certain areas around the world, the need for new seismic equipment remains restrained due to capital limitations affecting\nmany of our customers along with excessive on-hand quantities of under-utilized seismic equipment. We expect product sales of our\nOil and Gas Markets products, and in particular our legacy land-based traditional and wireless products, to remain low until\nexploration-focused seismic activities increase, which we believe will eventually result from the ongoing depletion of existing\nreservoirs prompting the need to find new sources of oil and gas. We expect these challenging industry conditions facing our land-\nbased traditional and legacy wireless products will continue in fiscal year 2020.\nOur trade accounts receivable at September 30, 2019 include $8.5 million due from an international seismic marine customer\nthat, as of September 30, 2019 rented a significant amount of our marine nodal equipment. We experienced cash collection\ndifficulties with this customer throughout fiscal year 2019 due to the customer’s inability to generate enough cash flow to pay its\nobligations to us in a timely manner. In November 2019, we accepted from the customer a plan to bring our current and future unpaid\ninvoices to a satisfactory status. This plan contemplates completion during our second fiscal quarter ending March 31, 2020, and is\npremised upon the customer’s (i) projections of free cash flows from an existing contract with a third-party and (ii) potential access to\ncapital transactions and/or future borrowing availability from its bank. While we have significant concerns about the ultimate\ncollection of this customer’s accounts receivable, we have not, and do not currently intend to, provide any significant bad debt\n20\nreserves toward this customer’s outstanding accounts receivable balance unless and until it becomes probable (in our judgement) that\nthe customer cannot (i) generate free cash flows from its existing contract and (ii) complete capital transactions and/or borrow from its\nbank.\nOur available cash and cash equivalents totaled $18.9 million at September 30, 2019, which included $7.0 million of cash\nand cash equivalents held by our foreign subsidiaries and branch offices. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act signed into law on December 22,\n2017, creates new taxes on certain foreign earnings and also requires companies to pay a one-time transition tax on undistributed\nearnings of their foreign subsidiaries which were previously tax deferred. We have determined that we are not required to pay\nany transition tax on the undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries since we had no accumulated earnings on a consolidated\nbasis.\nOur credit agreement allows for borrowings of up to $30.0 million with such amounts available for borrowing determined by\na borrowing base. In November 2018, we extended the maturity of the credit agreement from April 2019 to April 2020. In March\n2019, we entered into an amendment to the credit agreement that altered the unencumbered liquid assets covenant to (i) reduce the\nminimum threshold from $10 million to $5 million and (ii) include unencumbered liquid assets held outside the United States. The\namendment also added another financial covenant that requires us to maintain a tangible net worth of not less than $140 million.\nAdditionally, pursuant to the amendment, our principal place of business and the related real estate, located at 7007 Pinemont Drive,\nHouston, Texas was added as collateral securing our obligations under the credit agreement. In November 2019, we further amended\nthe credit agreement to (i) extend the maturity date from April 2020 to April 2022, (ii) increase the unencumbered liquid assets\ncovenant threshold from $5 million to $10 million effective in the first quarter of fiscal year 2021, (iii) to increase the tangible net\nworth requirement from $140 million to $145 million in the first quarter of fiscal year 2021 and (iv) remove the requirement that we\nobtain the consent of Frost Bank prior to paying dividends or repurchasing stock so long as we are in compliance with the covenants\nof the credit agreement.\nAt September 30, 2019, we had no outstanding borrowings under the credit agreement and our borrowing availability under\nthe credit facility was $27.0 million. At September 30, 2019, we were in compliance with all covenants under the credit agreement.\nWe currently do not anticipate the need to borrow under the credit agreement; however, we can make no assurance that we will not do\nso.\nIn August 2019, we sold our real property located at 7334 N. Gessner in Houston, Texas for $8.3 million. We recognized a\n$7.0 million gain on the disposal of the property in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2019. The buyer occupied the property as a tenant\nunder a long-term lease. The property was not strategic to our ongoing operations.\nIn fiscal years 2016, 2017 and 2018, we received income tax refunds of $18.3 million, $12.8 million and $0.7 million,\nrespectively, from the U.S. Department of Treasury. These refunds were a result of the significant tax losses we experienced in fiscal\nyears 2016 and 2015, which we elected to carryback and recoup taxes previously paid. For U.S. income tax purposes, we are now in a\nloss carryforward position in regards to our tax losses occurring in fiscal year 2017 and beyond. As a result, our current tax losses will\nnot result in any additional U.S. federal income tax refunds. The tax refunds we received in fiscal years 2016 and 2017 were\nsignificant contributors to our overall liquidity. In the absence of future profitable results of operations, we may need to rely on other\nsources of liquidity to fund our future operations, including executed rental contracts, available borrowings under our credit agreement\nthrough its expiration in April 2020, leveraging or sale of real estate assets, sales of rental assets and other liquidity sources which may\nbe available to us. However, currently we believe that our cash, cash equivalents and borrowings under our credit facility will be\nsufficient to finance any future operating losses and planned capital expenditures through the next twelve months.\nFiscal Year 2018\nAt September 30, 2018, we had approximately $11.9 million in cash and cash equivalents and $25.5 million in short-term\ninvestments. For the fiscal year ended September 30, 2018, we used $10.4 million of cash in operating activities. In addition to our\nnet loss of $19.2 million, we incurred other uses of cash in our operations including (i) a $5.1 million increase in trade accounts\nreceivable resulting from the timing of collections from customers, (ii) a $4.3 million increase in inventories for the production of\nOBX products and recently introduced land-based wireless seismic products and (iii) the removal of a $6.8 million gross profit from\nthe sale of used rental equipment since such gross profit is reflected in the proceeds from the sale of used rental equipment under\ninvesting activities. These uses of cash were offset by (i) net non-cash charges of $22.7 million from deferred income taxes,\ndepreciation, amortization, impairment, accretion, inventory obsolescence, stock-based compensation and bad debt expense, (ii) a $1.3\nmillion increase in accounts payable associated with inventory purchases and the timing of payments to suppliers, (iii) a $3.1 million\nincrease in deferred revenue due to the receipt from customers of deposits for rental contracts and (iv) an increase of $1.0 million in\naccrued and other expenses.\nFor the fiscal year ended September 30, 2018, we generated cash of $7.8 million from investing activities. Sources of cash\nincluded (i) $10.5 million of net proceeds from the sale of short-term investments, (ii) $9.9 million of proceeds from the sale of rental\nequipment and (iii) $2.1 million in insurance proceeds and claims receivable related to a property insurance claim. These sources of\ncash were partially offset by (i) a down payment of $4.4 million for the Quantum acquisition, (ii) $6.5 million to expand our rental\n21\nfleet, (iii) $1.7 million for additions to our property, plant and equipment and (iv) $2.4 million in payments for damages related to the\ninsurance claim.\nFor the fiscal year ended September 30, 2018, we generated cash proceeds of $63,000 from financing activities from the\nexercise of stock options by our employees. We had no long-term debt outstanding throughout the fiscal year ended September 30,\n2018.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe do not have any obligations which meet the definition of an off-balance sheet arrangement and which have or are\nreasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial statements or the items contained therein that are material to\ninvestors.\nContractual Obligations\nContingent Consideration\nWe recorded an initial contingent earn-out liability of $7.7 million in connection with our July 2018 acquisition of Quantum.\nContingent payments, if any, may be paid in the form of cash or Company stock and will be derived from eligible revenue generated\nduring a four-year earn-out period subsequent to the closing of the acquisition. The maximum amount of contingent payments is\n$23.5 million over the earn-out period. For the fiscal year ended September 30, 2019, we recorded a $2.9 million adjustment to\ndecrease the initial earn-out liability to its estimated fair value.\nWe recorded an initial contingent earn-out liability of $4.3 million in connection with our November 2018 acquisition of all\nthe intellectual property and related assets of the OptoSeis® fiber optic sensing technology. Contingent cash payments, if any, will be\nderived from eligible revenue generated during a five-and-a-half year earn-out period subsequent to the closing of the acquisition from\nproducts and services utilizing the OptoSeis® fiber optic technology. The maximum amount of contingent payments is $23.2 million\nover the earn-out period. For the fiscal year ended September 30, 2019, we recorded an $0.8 million adjustment to increase the initial\nearn-out liability to its estimated fair value.\nWe will reassess the earn-out calculations related to this contingent consideration in future periods.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States\nrequires the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes.\nWe consider many factors in selecting appropriate operational and financial accounting policies and controls, and in developing the\nestimates and assumptions that are used in the preparation of these financial statements. We continually evaluate our estimates,\nincluding those related to revenue recognition, bad debt reserves, inventory obsolescence reserves, self-insurance reserves for medical\nexpenses, product warranty reserves, contingent consideration, stock-based compensation and deferred income tax assets. We base\nour estimates on historical experience and various other factors, including the impact from the current economic conditions that we\nbelieve to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different conditions or\nassumptions.\nOur normal credit terms for trade receivables are 30 days. In certain situations, credit terms for trade receivables may be\nextended to 60 days or longer and such receivables generally do not require collateral. Additionally, we provide long-term financing\nin the form of promissory notes and sales-type leases when competitive conditions require such financing and, in such cases, we may\nrequire collateral. We perform ongoing credit evaluations of our accounts and financing receivables, and allowances are recognized\nfor potential credit losses.\nOur long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever an event or change in circumstances indicates the carrying\namount of an asset or group of assets may not be recoverable. The impairment review, if necessary, includes a comparison of\nexpected future cash flows (undiscounted and without interest charges) to be generated by an asset group with the associated carrying\nvalue of the related assets. If the carrying value of the asset group exceeds the expected future cash flows, an impairment loss is\nrecognized to the extent that the carrying value of the asset group exceeds its fair value.\nManagement makes judgments regarding the interpretation of tax laws that might be challenged upon an audit and cause\nchanges to previous estimates of tax liability. In addition, we operate within multiple taxing jurisdictions and are subject to audit in\nthese jurisdictions as well as by the Internal Revenue Service. In management’s opinion, adequate provisions for income taxes have\nbeen made for all open tax years. The potential outcomes of examinations are regularly assessed in determining the adequacy of the\nprovision for income taxes and income tax liabilities. Management believes that adequate provisions have been made for reasonable\nand foreseeable outcomes related to uncertain tax matters.\n22\nWe record a write-down of our inventories when the cost basis of any manufactured product, including any estimated future\ncosts to complete the manufacturing process, exceeds its net realizable value. Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net\nrealizable value. Cost is determined on a first-in, first-out method, except that our subsidiaries in the Russian Federation and the\nUnited Kingdom use an average cost method to value their inventories.\nWe periodically review the composition of our inventories to determine if market demand, product modifications, technology\nchanges, excessive quantities on-hand and other factors hinder our ability to recover our investment in such inventories.\nManagement’s assessment is based upon historical product demand, estimated future product demand and various other judgments\nand estimates. Inventory obsolescence reserves are recorded when such assessments reveal that portions or components of our\ninventory investment will not be realized in our operating activities.\nThe value of our inventories not expected to be realized in cash, sold or consumed during our next operating cycle are\nclassified as non-current assets in our consolidated balance sheets.\nWe recognize revenue from product sales and services in accordance with ASC Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with\nCustomers. This standard applies to contracts for the sale of products and services and does not apply to contracts for the rental or\nlease of products. Under this standard, we recognize revenue when performance of contractual obligations are satisfied, generally\nwhen control of the promised goods or services is transferred to our customers, in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect\nto be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. Revenue from product sales is recognized when obligations under the terms of\na contract are satisfied, control is transferred and collectability of the sales price is reasonably assured. Transfer of control generally\noccurs with shipment or delivery, depending on the terms of the underlying contract. Our products are generally sold without any\ncustomer acceptance provisions, and our standard terms of sale do not allow customers to return products for credit. Most of our\nproducts do not require installation assistance or sophisticated instruction. We offer a standard product warranty, which obligates us\nto repair or replace our products having manufacturing defects. We maintain a reserve for future warranty costs based on historical\nexperience or, in the absence of historical experience, management estimates. Revenue from engineering services is recognized as\nservices are rendered over the duration of a project or as billed on a per hour basis. Field service revenue is recognized when services\nare rendered and is generally priced on a per day rate. We recognize rental revenue as earned over the rental period. Rentals of our\nequipment generally range from daily rentals to rental periods of up to six months or longer.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nPlease refer to Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements contained in this Annual Report for a discussion of recent\naccounting pronouncements.\nManagement’s Current Outlook and Assumptions\nRegarding our Oil and Gas Markets business segment, prices for a barrel of WTI crude oil declined from over $100 in July\n2014 to approximately $26 in February 2016, and have recovered to approximately $55 today. With this substantial net decline in\ncrude oil prices, oil and gas exploration and production companies experienced a significant reduction in cash flows, which resulted in\nsharp reductions in their capital spending budgets for oil and gas exploration-focused activities, including seismic data acquisition\nactivities. While we are now seeing some signs of increased oil and gas exploration activity around the world, the need for new\nseismic equipment, particularly land-based equipment, remains restrained due to our customers’ (i) limited capital resources, (ii) lack\nof visibility into future demand for their seismic services and (iii) in some cases, under-utilized legacy equipment.\nMany of our traditional seismic products are damaged, destroyed or otherwise consumed during field operations. We expect\nfiscal year 2020 demand for our land-based traditional seismic products to increase slightly over fiscal year 2019 levels.\nWe have recently introduced the “GCL” which is a new version of our land-based wireless data recorder. This version\ncontains several unique features not found in competitive models and we have received positive customer feedback regarding these\nfeatures and its overall functionality. We recently sold 5,000 GCL stations to a European customer and we recently received an order\nto deliver 30,000 stations to another customer. While we believe the GCL will be a market leader similar to our GSX wireless unit,\nbeyond the recently received order for 30,000 stations it is uncertain what revenue impact this product will have during fiscal year\n2020 in light of the tepid market demand for oil and gas seismic services and equipment. However, we expect our fiscal year 2020\nland-based wireless product revenue to exceed the levels we achieved in fiscal year 2019.\nThe vast majority of our oil and gas rental revenue in fiscal year 2019 was derived from short-term rentals of our OBX\nocean-bottom recorder. We believe our OBX rental revenue will increase further in fiscal year 2020 as a result of rental contracts we\nexecuted in fiscal year 2019 and from additional demand we continue to see for this product.\nWe believe that fiscal year 2020 revenue from our oil and gas reservoir products, and principally our borehole tools and\nservices, will be similar to the revenues we achieved in fiscal year 2019. We have not received any orders for large-scale seabed PRM\nsystems since November 2012 and we currently do not have any indication that such an order will be received in fiscal year 2020,\n23\nalthough we do believe opportunities for PRM orders do exist in today’s market. If a large-scale order were received in fiscal year\n2020, it could significantly impact our fiscal year 2020 revenue and profits.\nWe expect fiscal year 2020 revenue from our Adjacent Markets products to increase over fiscal year 2019 levels. We expect\nour industrial products to contribute the majority of this increase as a result of expanded market acceptance of these products.\nWe expect fiscal year 2020 revenue from our Emerging Markets products to increase over fiscal year 2019 as a result of\nanticipated market acceptance of our border and perimeter security surveillance products.\nItem 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk\nNot required.\nItem 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\nOur consolidated financial statements, including the reports thereon, the notes thereto and supplementary data begin at page\nF-1 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K and are incorporated herein by reference.\nItem 9. Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure\nNone.\nItem 9A. Controls and Procedures\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining a system of disclosure controls and procedures that are\ndesigned to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed,\nsummarized and reported within the time periods specified under SEC’s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and\ncommunicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”) and Chief Financial Officer (“CFO”).\nNotwithstanding the foregoing, there can be no assurance that our disclosure controls and procedures will detect or uncover all failures\nof persons within the Company and its consolidated subsidiaries to report material information otherwise required to be set forth in our\nreports.\nIn connection with the preparation of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we carried out an evaluation under the supervision and\nwith the participation of our management, including the CEO and CFO, as of September 30, 2019 of the effectiveness of the Company’s\ndisclosure controls and procedures, as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act. Based on that\nevaluation, the CEO and CFO concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective as of September 30, 2019.\nManagement’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting (as defined\nin Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act). Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial\nreporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to\nthe risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or\nprocedures may deteriorate.\nOur management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2019. In\nmaking this assessment, we used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission\n(COSO) in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013). Based on this assessment, our management concluded that, as of\nSeptember 30, 2019, our internal control over financial reporting is effective based on those criteria.\nOur internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2019 has been audited by RSM US LLP, an independent\nregistered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which appears herein.\nChanges in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nThere have not been any changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f)\nof the Exchange Act) during the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2019 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to\nmaterially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.\n24\nItem 9B.

In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial\nposition of the Company as of September 30, 2019 and 2018, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the years then\nended, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\nWe have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States)\n(PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2019, based on criteria established in Internal\nControl — Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in 2013, and\nour report dated November 22, 2019 expressed an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over\nfinancial reporting.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion\non the Company’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are\nrequired to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and\nregulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform\nthe audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error\nor fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether\ndue to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis,\nevidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting\nprinciples used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial\nstatements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\n/s/ RSM US LLP\nWe have served as the Company's auditor since 2018.\nHouston, Texas\nNovember 22, 2019\nF-2\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nTo the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Geospace Technologies Corporation\nOpinion on the Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nWe have audited Geospace Technologies Corporation and its subsidiaries' (the Company) internal control over financial\nreporting as of September 30, 2019, based on criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework issued by the\nCommittee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in 2013. In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all\nmaterial respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2019, based on criteria established in Internal\nControl — Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in 2013.\nWe have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States)\n(PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets as of September 30, 2019 and 2018, the related consolidated statements of operations,\ncomprehensive loss, stockholders' equity and cash flows for the years then ended of the Company and our report dated November 22,\n2019 expressed an unqualified opinion.\nBasis for Opinion\nThe Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its\nassessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal\nControl over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial\nreporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with\nrespect to the Company in accordance with U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and\nExchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform\nthe audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material\nrespects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material\nweakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our\naudit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit\nprovides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nA company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the\nreliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally\naccepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1)\npertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the\nassets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial\nstatements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being\nmade only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance\nregarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the company's assets that could have a\nmaterial effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies:\nThe Company\nGeospace Technologies Corporation (“Geospace”) designs and manufactures instruments and equipment used by the oil and\ngas industry to acquire seismic data in order to locate, characterize and monitor hydrocarbon producing reservoirs. Geospace also\ndesigns and manufactures Adjacent Markets products, including industrial products and imaging equipment, and Emerging Market\nproducts consisting of border and perimeter security products. Geospace and its subsidiaries are referred to collectively as the\n“Company”.\nBasis of Presentation\nThe accompanying financial statements present the consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows of the\nCompany in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. All intercompany balances\nand transactions have been eliminated.\nReclassifications\nThe Company reclassified certain components of revenue and cost of revenue on its consolidated statement of operations for\nthe fiscal year ended September 30, 2018 to conform to the current year presentation. The reclassifications had no effect on\npreviously reported total revenue, total cost of revenue, net loss, stockholders’ equity or cash flows.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of\nAmerica requires the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying\nnotes. The Company considers many factors in selecting appropriate operational and financial accounting policies and controls, and in\ndeveloping the estimates and assumptions that are used in the preparation of these financial statements. The Company continually\nevaluates its estimates, including those related to bad debt reserves, inventory obsolescence reserves, self-insurance reserves, product\nwarranty reserves, useful lives of long-lived assets, impairment of long-lived assets and intangible assets, contingent consideration and\ndeferred income tax assets. The Company bases its estimates on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be\nreasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different conditions or assumptions.\nCash and Cash Equivalents\nThe Company considers all highly-liquid investments purchased with an original or remaining maturity at the time of\npurchase of three months or less to be cash equivalents. At September 30, 2019 cash and cash equivalents included $7.0 million held\nby the Company’s foreign subsidiaries and branch offices. If the Company were to repatriate the cash held by its foreign subsidiaries,\nit would be required to accrue and pay taxes on any amount repatriated under rates enacted by The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (“2017 Tax\nAct’).\nShort-term Investments\nThe Company classifies its short-term investments consisting of corporate bonds, government bonds and other such similar\ninvestments as available-for-sale securities. Available-for-sale securities are carried at fair market value with net unrealized holding\ngains and losses reported each period as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss in stockholders’ equity. See Note 4 to\nthese consolidated financial statements for additional information.\nConcentrations of Credit and Supplier Risk\nThe Company maintains its cash in bank deposit accounts that, at times, exceed federally insured limits. Management of the\nCompany believes that the financial strength of the financial institutions holding such deposits minimizes the credit risk of such\ndeposits.\nThe Company sells products to customers throughout the United States and various foreign countries. The Company’s\nnormal credit terms for trade receivables are 30 days. In certain situations, credit terms may be extended to 60 days or longer. The\nF-10\nGeospace Technologies Corporation and Subsidiaries\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements—(Continued)\nCompany performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers and generally does not require collateral for its trade receivables.\nAdditionally, the Company provides long-term financing in the form of promissory notes and sales-type leases when competitive\nconditions require such financing. In such cases, the Company may require collateral. Allowances are recognized for potential credit\nlosses. Three customers comprised 19.7%, 5.2% and 20.0% of the Company’s revenue during fiscal year 2019. At September 30,\n2019, the Company had trade account receivables due from these three customers of $6.7 million, $3.6 million and $8.5 million,\nrespectively. With respect to the Company’s revenue and trade account receivables, the latter two customers are affiliated with a\ncommon parent company. One customer comprised 10.4% of the Company’s revenue during fiscal year 2018. At September 30,\n2018, the Company had a combined trade account and financing receivable due from this customer of $9.0 million.\nCertain models of the Company’s oil and gas marine wireless products require a timing device it purchases from a United\nStates manufacturer. The Company currently does not possess the ability to manufacture this component and has no other reliable\nsource for this device. If this manufacturer were to discontinue its production of this timing device, were to become unwilling to\ncontract with the Company on competitive terms or were unable to supply the component in sufficient quantities to meet its\nrequirements, the Company’s ability to compete in the marine wireless marketplace could be impaired, which could adversely affect\nits financial performance.\nThe Company purchases all of its thermal film from a European manufacturer for its imaging products. Except for the film\nsold to the Company by this manufacturer, the Company knows of no other source for thermal film that performs as well in its\nimaging equipment. If the European manufacturer were to discontinue producing thermal film, were to become unwilling to contract\nwith the Company on competitive terms or were unable to supply thermal film in sufficient quantities to meet its requirements, the\nCompany’s ability to compete in the direct thermal imaging marketplace could be impaired, which could adversely affect its financial\nperformance.\nInventories\nThe Company records a write-down of its inventories when the cost basis of any manufactured product, including any\nestimated future costs to complete the manufacturing process, exceeds its net realizable value. Inventories are stated at the lower of\ncost or net realizable value. Cost is determined on the first-in, first-out method, except that certain of the Company’s foreign\nsubsidiaries use an average cost method to value their inventories.\nThe Company periodically reviews the composition of its inventories to determine if market demand, product modifications,\ntechnology changes, excessive quantities on-hand and other factors hinder our ability to recover its investment in such\ninventories. The Company’s assessment is based upon historical product demand, estimated future product demand and various other\njudgments and estimates. Inventory obsolescence reserves are recorded when such assessments reveal that portions or components of\nthe Company’s inventory investment will not be realized in its operating activities.\nThe Company reviews it inventories for classification purposes. The value of inventories not expected to be realized in cash,\nsold or consumed during its next operating cycle are classified as noncurrent assets.\nProperty, Plant and Equipment and Rental Equipment\nProperty, plant and equipment and rental equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation expense is calculated using the straight-\nline method over the following estimated useful lives:\nYears\nRental equipment........................................................................... 2-5\nProperty, plant and equipment:\nMachinery and equipment........................................................ 3-15\nBuildings and building improvements..................................... 10-50\nOther......................................................................................... 5-10\nExpenditures for renewals and betterments are capitalized. Repairs and maintenance expenditures are charged to expense as\nincurred. The cost and accumulated depreciation of assets sold or otherwise disposed of are removed from the accounts and any gain\nor loss thereon is reflected in the statements of operations.\nF-11\nGeospace Technologies Corporation and Subsidiaries\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements—(Continued)\nImpairment of Long-lived Assets\nThe Company’s long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever an event or change in circumstances indicates the\ncarrying amount of an asset or group of assets may not be recoverable. The impairment review, if necessary, includes a comparison of\nexpected future cash flows (undiscounted and without interest charges) to be generated by an asset group with the associated carrying\nvalue of the related assets. If the carrying value of the asset group exceeds the expected future cash flows, an impairment loss is\nrecognized to the extent that the carrying value of the asset group exceeds its fair value. Impairment charges are included as a\ncomponent of cost of revenue in the Company’s consolidated statements of operations.\nGoodwill\nThe Company conducts its evaluation of goodwill at the reporting unit level on an annual basis as of September 30 and more\nfrequently if events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value. The guidance on the\ntesting of goodwill for impairment provides the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine if the annual two-step test of\ngoodwill for impairment must be performed. If, based on the qualitative assessment of events or circumstances, an entity determines it\nis more likely than not that the goodwill fair value of a reporting unit is more than its carrying amount then it is not necessary to\nperform the two-step impairment test. However, if an entity concludes otherwise, then the two-step impairment test must be performed\nto identify potential impairment and to measure the amount of goodwill impairment, if any.\nAt September 30, 2019, the Company performed the two-step analysis on its Oil & Gas and Emerging Markets reporting\nunits and determined there was no impairment since the value of the goodwill was more than its carrying amount.\nOther Intangible Assets\nIntangible assets are carried at cost, net of accumulated amortization. The estimated useful life of the Company’s other\nintangible assets are evaluated each reporting period to determine whether events or circumstances warrant a revision to the remaining\namortization period. If the estimate of an intangible asset’s remaining useful life is changed, the amortization period should be\nchanged prospectively. Amortization expense is calculated using the straight-line method over the following estimated useful lives:\nYears\nDeveloped technology.............................................. 18\nTrade names............................................................. 5\nCustomer relationships............................................. 4\nNon-compete agreements......................................... 4\nRevenue Recognition\nSee Note 2 to these consolidated financial statements.\nDeferred Revenue\nThe Company records deferred revenue when customer funds are billed or received prior to the recognition of the associated\nrevenue.\nContingent Consideration\nThe Company established earn-out liabilities in connection with its business acquisitions in the fourth quarter of fiscal year\n2018 and the first quarter of fiscal year 2019. The Company engaged the services of a valuation firm to measure the initial fair value\nof the earn-out liabilities as of the acquisition date for each business. The valuation technique used to measure the fair value of the\nliability was derived from models utilizing market observable inputs. The Company records the fair value of its contingent earn-out\nliabilities on a quarterly basis. Adjustments to the liabilities, if any, are included as a component of earnings in the consolidated\nstatements of operations. See Note 19 to these consolidated financial statements for additional information.\nResearch and Development Costs\nThe Company expenses research and development costs as incurred. Research and development costs include salaries,\nemployee benefit costs, department supplies, direct project costs and other related costs.\nF-12\nGeospace Technologies Corporation and Subsidiaries\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements—(Continued)\nProduct Warranties\nMost of the Company’s products do not require installation assistance or sophisticated instructions. The Company offers a\nstandard product warranty obligating it to repair or replace equipment with manufacturing defects. The Company maintains a reserve\nfor future warranty costs based on historical experience or, in the absence of historical product experience, management’s estimates.\nReserves for future warranty costs are included within accrued expenses and other current liabilities on the consolidated balance\nsheets.\nChanges in the product warranty reserve are reflected in the following table (in thousands):\nBalance at October 1, 2017........................................................... $ 508\nAccruals for warranties issued during the year............................. 1,074\nSettlements made (in cash or in kind) during the year.................. (894)\nBalance at September 30, 2018..................................................... 688\nAccruals for warranties issued during the year............................. 386\nSettlements made (in cash or in kind) during the year.................. (845)\nBalance at September 30, 2019..................................................... $ 229\nStock-Based Compensation\nThe Company accounts for stock-based compensation, including grants of restricted awards and unqualified stock options in\naccordance with Accounting Standards Codification Topic 718, which requires that all share-based payments (to the extent that they\nare compensatory) be recognized as an expense in the Company’s consolidated statements of operations based on their fair values on\nthe award date and the estimated number of shares it ultimately expects to vest.\nThe Company recognizes stock-based compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period of the\naward. The Company’s stock-based compensation plan and awards are more fully described in Note 16 to these consolidated financial\nstatements.\nForeign Currency Gains and Losses\nThe assets and liabilities of the Company’s foreign subsidiaries that have a foreign currency as their functional currency have\nbeen translated into U.S. dollars using the exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date. Results of operations have been\ntranslated using the average exchange rates during the year. Resulting translation adjustments have been recorded as a component of\naccumulated other comprehensive loss in stockholders’ equity. Foreign currency transaction gains and losses are included in the\nstatements of operations as they occur. Transaction gains and losses on intra-entity foreign currency transactions and balances\nincluding advances and demand notes payable, on which settlement is not planned or anticipated in the foreseeable future, are\nrecorded in “accumulated other comprehensive loss” on our consolidated balance sheets.\nShipping and Handling Costs\nAmounts billed to a customer in a sales transaction related to reimbursable shipping and handling costs are included in\nrevenue and the associated costs incurred by the Company for reimbursable shipping and handling expenses are reported in cost of\nsales. The Company had shipping and handling expenses of $0.5 million and $0.5 million, respectively, for the fiscal years ended\nSeptember 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nFair Value\nFair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or the amount paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction\nbetween market participants (an exit price) at the measurement date. U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) has\nestablished a fair value hierarchy which prioritizes the inputs to the valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three levels.\nThese levels are determined based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement. Level 1 represents\nunadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities. Level 2 represents quoted prices for similar assets and\nliabilities in active markets (other than those included in Level 1) which are observable, either directly or indirectly. Level 3\nrepresents valuations derived from valuation techniques in which one or more significant inputs or significant value drivers are\nunobservable.\nF-13\nGeospace Technologies Corporation and Subsidiaries\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements—(Continued)\nIncome Taxes\nIncome taxes are presented in accordance with the Accounting Standards Codification Topic 740 (“Topic 740”) guidance for\naccounting for income taxes. The estimated future tax effects of temporary differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities\nand amounts reported in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets, as well as operating loss and tax credit carrybacks and\ncarryforwards are recorded. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between financial reporting and tax\nbasis of assets and liabilities (temporary differences) and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when\nthe differences are expected to reverse. The Company periodically reviews the recoverability of tax assets recorded on the balance\nsheet and provides valuation allowances if it is more likely than not that such assets will not be realized.\nThe Company follows the guidance of Topic 740 to analyze all tax positions that are less than certain. Topic 740 prescribes a\nrecognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or\nexpected to be taken in a tax return. In accordance with Topic 740, the Company recognizes in its financial statements the impact of a\ntax position if that position is “more likely than not” to be sustained on audit, based on the technical merits of the position. The\nCompany’s estimate of the potential outcome of any uncertain tax issue is subject to management’s assessment of relevant risks, facts,\nand circumstances existing at that time.\nThe Company classifies interest and penalties associated with the payment of income taxes, if any, in the Other Income\n(Expense) section of its consolidated statements of operations. The Company incurred no interest or penalties for the fiscal years\nended September 30, 2019 and 2018.\nRecently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements\nIn November 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued guidance which requires that a statement of\ncash flows explain the change during the period in the total of cash, cash equivalents, and amounts generally described as restricted\ncash or restricted cash equivalents. Therefore, amounts generally described as restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents should be\nincluded with cash and cash equivalents when reconciling the beginning-of-period and end-of-period total amounts shown on the\nstatement of cash flows. This guidance was adopted by the Company in its first quarter of fiscal year 2019. The adoption of this\nguidance had no effect on the Company’s consolidated financial statements since it currently holds no restricted cash balances.\nIn May 2014, the FASB issued guidance requiring entities to recognize revenue from contracts with customers by applying a\nfive-step model in accordance with the core principle to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount\nthat reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. In addition, this\nguidance specifies the accounting for some costs to obtain or fulfill a contract with a customer and expands disclosure requirements\nfor revenue recognition. This new standard supersedes existing revenue recognition guidance and requires changes to the revenue\nrecognition process, financial statement presentation and footnote disclosures. The Company adopted this standard on October 1,\n2018 using the modified retrospective method. The adoption of this standard did not result in a cumulative adjustment as of October\n1, 2018 nor did it have any impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.\nRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements\nIn June 2018, the FASB issued guidance expanding the scope of ASC Topic 718, Compensation - Stock Compensation, to\ninclude share-based payment transactions for acquiring goods and services from nonemployees. The guidance is effective for fiscal\nyears beginning after December 15, 2018 and interim periods within those fiscal years with early adoption permitted. The Company\nwill adopt this guidance in its first quarter of its fiscal year ending September 30, 2020 and does not expect the adoption of this\nguidance to have any material impact on its consolidated financial statements.\nIn August 2018, the FASB issued guidance requiring certain existing disclosure requirements in ASC Topic 820, Fair Value\nMeasurements and Disclosures, to be modified or removed, and certain new disclosure requirements to be added to this standard. In\naddition, the guidance allows entities to exercise more discretion when considering fair value measurement disclosures. The guidance\nis effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019 with early adoption permitted. The Company is in the process of\nevaluating the impact of this guidance on its consolidated financial statements.\nIn January 2017, the FASB issued guidance simplifying the current two-step goodwill impairment test by eliminating Step 2\nof the test. The guidance requires a one-step impairment test in which an entity compares the fair value of a reporting unit with its\ncarrying amount and recognizes an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit’s fair\nvalue, if any. This guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019 and interim periods within those fiscal\nyears, and should be applied on a prospective basis. Early adoption is permitted for the interim or annual goodwill impairment tests\nF-14\nGeospace Technologies Corporation and Subsidiaries\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements—(Continued)\nperformed on testing dates after January 1, 2017. The Company does not expect the adoption of this guidance to have a material\nimpact on its consolidated financial statements and disclosures.\nIn June 2016, the FASB issued guidance surrounding credit losses for financial instruments that replaces the incurred loss\nimpairment methodology in generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”). The new impairment model requires immediate\nrecognition of estimated credit losses expected to occur for most financial assets and certain other financial instruments. For\navailable-for-sale debt securities with unrealized losses, credit losses will be recognized as allowances rather than reductions in the\namortized cost of the securities. The standard is effective for fiscal years reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2019 and\ninterim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption for a fiscal year beginning after December 15, 2018 is permitted. Entities\nwill apply the standard’s provisions as a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of the first effective\nreporting period. The Company expects to adopt this standard during the first quarter of its fiscal year ending September 30, 2021 and\nis currently evaluating the impact of this new guidance on its consolidated financial statements.\nIn February 2016, the FASB issued guidance requiring a lessee to recognize assets and liabilities for leases with lease terms\nof more than 12 months. Consistent with current GAAP, the recognition, measurement and presentation of expense and cash flows\narising from a lease by a lessee primarily will depend on its classification of the lease as a finance or operating lease. However, unlike\ncurrent GAAP, which requires only capital leases to be recognized on the balance sheet, the new guidance will also require operating\nleases of the lessee to be recognized on the balance sheet if the operating lease term is more than 12 months. The guidance also\nrequires disclosures to help investors and other financial statement users to better understand the amount, timing and uncertainty of\ncash flows arising from leases. These disclosures include qualitative and quantitative requirements, providing additional information\nabout the amounts recorded in the financial statements. The guidance is effective for fiscal years, and interim reporting periods\ntherein, beginning after December 15, 2018 and is to be applied using the modified retrospective approach. The Company will adopt\nthis guidance in its first quarter of its fiscal year ending September 30, 2020. Effective May 1, 2019, the Company became a lessee\nunder an office lease agreement with a term longer than one year and will follow the guidance of the new standard regarding this lease\ncontract. The adoption of this guidance will not have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.\n2. Revenue Recognition\nOn October 1, 2018, the Company adopted ASC Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers. This new standard\napplies to contracts for the sale of products and services, and does not apply to contracts for the rental or lease of products. The\nCompany adopted the new standard using the modified retrospective method applied to those contracts that were not completed as of\nSeptember 30, 2018. Results for reporting periods beginning after September 30, 2018 are presented under the new standard, while\nprior period amounts are not restated.\nUnder the new standard, the Company recognizes revenue from product sales and services when performance of contractual\nobligations are satisfied, generally when control of the promised goods or services is transferred to its customers, in an amount that\nreflects the consideration it expects to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services.\nThe Company primarily derives product revenue from the sale of its manufactured products. Revenue from these product\nsales is recognized when obligations under the terms of a contract are satisfied, control is transferred and collectability of the sales\nprice is reasonably assured. Transfer of control generally occurs with shipment or delivery, depending on the terms of the underlying\ncontract. Most of the Company’s products do not require installation assistance or sophisticated instruction. The Company’s products\nare generally sold without any customer acceptance provisions, and the Company’s standard terms of sale do not allow customers to\nreturn products for credit. We offer a standard product warranty, which obligates us, in certain circumstance, to repair or replace our\nproducts having manufacturing defects. We maintain a reserve for future warranty costs based on historical experience or, in the\nabsence of historical experience, management estimates.\nRevenue from engineering services is recognized as services are rendered over the duration of a project, or as billed on a per\nhour basis. Field service revenue is recognized when services are rendered and is generally priced on a per day rate.\nThe Company also generates revenue from short-term rentals under operating leases of its manufactured products. Rental\nrevenue is recognized as earned over the rental period. Rentals of the Company’s equipment generally range from daily rentals to\nminimum rental periods of up to six months or longer. The Company has determined that the new standard does not apply to rental\ncontracts, which are within the scope of other revenue recognition accounting standards.\nThe cumulative effect of the changes made to the Company’s consolidated balance sheet as of October 1, 2018 resulting from\nthe adoption of the new standard was not material and did not impact beginning retained earnings. The impact on the timing of sales\nand services for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2019 resulting from the application of the new standard was not material.\nAs permissible under the new standard, sales taxes and transaction-based taxes are excluded from revenue. The Company\ndoes not disclose the value of unsatisfied performance obligations for contracts with an original expected duration of one year or less.\nF-15\nGeospace Technologies Corporation and Subsidiaries\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements—(Continued)\nAdditionally, the Company expenses costs incurred to obtain contracts when incurred because the amortization period would be one\nyear or less. These costs are recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses.\nAt September 30, 2019 and September 30, 2018 the Company had deferred contract liabilities of zero and $0.2 million,\nrespectively, included as a component of deferred revenue. The Company had deferred contract costs of zero and $27,000 at\nSeptember 30, 2019 and September 30, 2018, respectively, included as a component of prepaid expenses and other current assets.\nDuring the fiscal year ended September 30, 2019, the Company recognized revenue of $0.2 million from deferred contract liabilities\nand cost of revenue of $27,000 from deferred contract costs.\nFor each of the Company’s operating segments, the following table presents revenue only from the sale of products and the\nperformance of services under contracts with customers.

Business Acquisitions\nOptoSeis® fiber optic sensing technology\nOn November 13, 2018, the Company acquired all of the intellectual property and related assets of the OptoSeis® fiber optic\nsensing technology business from PGS Americas, Inc. The assets of the OptoSeis® business are included in the Company’s Oil and\nGas Markets business segment. The acquisition represented the Company’s strategy for the addition of breadth to its PRM and other\nproducts. The acquisition purchase price consisted of cash at closing of approximately $1.8 million and contingent earn-out payments\nof up to $23.2 million over a five-and-a half year period beginning on the date of acquisition. The contingent cash payments will be\nderived from certain eligible product and service revenue generated during the earn-out period.\nIn connection with the OptoSeis® acquisition, the Company recorded goodwill of $0.7 million (deductible for tax purposes),\nother intangible assets of $3.7 million, fixed assets of $1.7 million and has established an initial contingent earn-out liability of $4.3\nmillion.\nLegal costs of $0.2 million related to the OptoSeis® acquisition are included in selling, general and administrative expenses.\nFor the fiscal year ended September 30, 2019, the estimated fair value of the acquired OptoSeis® assets was revised,\nincluding a $1.8 million addition to machinery and equipment, which was offset by a $1.0 million decrease in goodwill and a $0.8\nmillion decrease in other intangible assets.\nQuantum Technology Sciences, Inc.\nOn July 27, 2018, the Company acquired Quantum Technology Sciences, Inc., a Florida-based tactical security and\nsurveillance systems solutions provider (“Quantum”) through a merger of the Company’s subsidiary with and into Quantum, with\nQuantum as the surviving corporation. The acquisition represented the Company’s strategy to expand its product revenues, as well as\nits engineering and manufacturing competencies, to markets outside the oil and gas industry.\nThe acquisition purchase price for Quantum consisted of a cash down payment at closing of approximately $4.4 million and\ncontingent earn-out payments of up to $23.5 million over a four-year period.\nIn connection with the acquisition the Company recorded goodwill of $4.3 million (not deductible for tax purposes) and other\nintangible assets of $8.2 million and established an initial contingent earn-out liability of $7.7 million. Current assets and current\nliabilities of $0.2 million and $0.6 million were acquired in the transaction. The contingent earn-out payments, if any, which may be\npaid in the form of cash or Company stock, will be derived from certain eligible revenue that may be generated during the four-year\nearn-out period.\nAcquisition related costs of $0.3 million incurred in connection with the transaction are included in selling, general and\nadministrative expenses in the Company’s consolidated financial statements.\n4. Short-term Investments\nDuring the fiscal years ended September 30, 2019 and 2018 the Company realized losses of $66,000 and $11,000,\nrespectively, from the sale of short-term investments. These realized losses are recorded in Other Income on the consolidated\nstatements of operations. The Company had no short-term investments at September 30, 2019. At September 30, 2018, the\nCompany’s short-term investments were composed of the following (in thousands):\nAS OF SEPTEMBER 30, 2018\nAmortized Unrealized Unrealized Estimated\nCost Gains Losses Fair Value\nShort-term investments:\nCorporate bonds................................................................. $ 17,851 $ — $ (60) $ 17,791\nGovernment bonds............................................................. 7,702 — (22) 7,680\nTotal................................................................................... $ 25,553 $ — $ (82) $ 25,471\n5. Derivative Financial Instruments\nAt September 30, 2019 and 2018, the Company’s Canadian subsidiary had CAN$9.3 million and CAN$20.4 million,\nrespectively, of Canadian dollar denominated intercompany accounts payable owed to one of the Company’s U.S subsidiaries. In\norder to mitigate its exposure to movements in foreign currency rates between the U.S. dollar and Canadian dollar, the Company\nroutinely enters into foreign currency forward contracts to hedge a portion of its exposure to changes in the value of the Canadian\ndollar. At September 30, 2019 and 2018, the Company had short-term hedge contracts of CAN$7.0 million and CAN$30.0 with a\nF-17\nGeospace Technologies Corporation and Subsidiaries\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements—(Continued)\nUnited States bank to reduce the impact on cash flows from movements in the Canadian dollar/U.S. dollar currency exchange rate, but\nhave not been designated as a hedge for accounting purposes.\nThe following table summarizes the gross fair value of all derivative instruments, which are not designated as hedging\ninstruments and their location in the consolidated balance sheets (in thousands):\nDerivative Instrument Location AS OF SEPTEMBER 30,\n2019 2018\nForeign Currency Forward Contracts.....

Fair Value of Financial Instruments\nThe Company’s financial instruments generally included cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, a foreign\ncurrency forward contract, trade, notes and financing lease receivables and accounts payable. Due to the short-term maturities of cash\nand cash equivalents, trade and other receivables and accounts payable, the carrying amounts approximate fair value on the respective\nbalance sheet dates. The valuation technique used to measure the fair value of the contingent consideration was derived from models\nutilizing market observable inputs.\nThe Company measures short-term investments and derivatives at fair value on a recurring basis.\nThe following tables present the fair value of the Company’s short-term investments, contingent consideration and foreign\ncurrency forward contracts by valuation hierarchy and input (in thousands):\nAS OF SEPTEMBER 30, 2019\nQuoted Prices\nin Active\nMarkets for Significant Other Significant\nIdentical Assets Observable Unobservable\n(Level 1) (Level 2) (Level 3) Totals\nContingent consideration........................................................ $ — $ — $ (9,940) $ (9,940)\nForeign currency forward contract.......................................... — (4) — (4)\nTotal................................................................................... $ - $ (4) $ (9,940) $ (9,944)\nAS OF SEPTEMBER 30, 2018\nQuoted Prices\nin Active\nMarkets for Significant Other Significant\nIdentical Assets Observable Unobservable\n(Level 1) (Level 2) (Level 3) Totals\nShort-term investments\nCorporate bonds................................................................. $ 17,791 $ — $ — $ 17,791\nGovernment bonds............................................................. 7,680 — — 7,680\nContingent consideration........................................................ — — (7,713) (7,713)\nForeign currency forward contract.......................................... — (270) — (270)\nTotal................................................................................... $ 25,471 $ (270) $ (7,713) $ 17,488\nAssets and liabilities measured on a nonrecurring basis\nThe measurements utilized to determine the implied fair value of the Company’s long-lived assets and contingent\nconsideration as of September 30, 2019 represented significant unobservable inputs (Level 3).\nF-18\nGeospace Technologies Corporation and Subsidiaries\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements—(Continued)\nThe following table summarizes changes in the fair value of the Company’s Level 3 financial instruments for the fiscal year\nended September 30, 2019:\nBalance at October 1, 2018.............................................................................................. $ 7,713\nContingent consideration pursuant to acquisitions........................................................... 4,342\nFair value adjustments......................................................................................................

(951) (1,453)\n$ 24,193 $ 14,323\nThe allowance for doubtful accounts represents the Company’s best estimate of probable credit losses. The Company\ndetermines the allowance based upon historical experience and a current review of its accounts receivable balances. Accounts\nreceivable balances are charged off against the allowance whenever it is probable that the receivable balance will not be recoverable.\nTrade accounts receivable at September 30, 2019 includes $8.5 million due from an international seismic marine customer\nthat, as of September 30, 2019 rented a significant amount of marine nodal equipment from the Company. The Company has\nexperienced cash collection difficulties with this customer throughout fiscal year 2019 due to the customer’s inability to generate\nenough cash flow to pay its obligations in a timely manner. In November 2019, the Company accepted from the customer a plan to\nbring the Company’s current and future unpaid invoices to a satisfactory status. This plan contemplates completion during the\nCompany’s second fiscal quarter ending March 31, 2020, and is premised upon the customer’s (i) projections of free cash flows from\nan existing contract with a third-party and (ii) potential access to capital transactions and/or future borrowing availability from its\nbank. While the Company has significant concerns about the ultimate collection of its accounts receivable from this customer, it has\nnot, and does not currently intend to, provide any significant bad debt reserves toward its outstanding accounts receivable balance\nfrom this customer unless and until it becomes probable (in the Company’s judgement) that the customer cannot (i) generate free cash\nflows from its existing contract and (ii) complete capital transactions and/or borrow from its bank.\nF-19\nGeospace Technologies Corporation and Subsidiaries\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements—(Continued)\nSee Note 1 to these consolidated financial statements for information on concentrations of credit risk.\nFinancing receivables are reflected in the following table (in thousands):\nAS OF SEPTEMBER 30,\n2019 2018\nPromissory notes......................................................................... $ 780 $ 5,646\nSales-type lease........................................................................... 2,692 5,533\nTotal financing receivables................................................... 3,472 11,179\nUnearned income:\nPromissory notes................................................................... — (95)\nSales-type lease.....................................................................

Long-Term Debt\nThe Company had no long-term debt outstanding at September 30, 2019 and 2018.\nOn March 2, 2011, the Company entered into a credit agreement with Frost Bank (the “Original Credit Agreement”). The\nOriginal Credit Agreement has been amended periodically since 2011 (as so amended, the “Credit Agreement”). In November 2018,\nthe Company extended the maturity of the Credit Agreement from April 2019 to April 2020. In March 2019, the Company entered\ninto an amendment to the Credit Agreement that altered the unencumbered liquid assets covenant to (i) reduce the minimum threshold\nfrom $10 million to $5 million and (ii) include unencumbered assets held outside the United States. The amendment also added\nanother financial covenant that requires the Company to maintain a tangible net worth of not less than $140 million. Additionally,\npursuant to the amendment, the Company’s principal place of business and the related real estate, located at 7007 Pinemont Drive,\nHouston, Texas was added as collateral securing its obligations under the credit agreement. In November 2019, we further amended\nthe credit agreement to (i) extend the maturity date from April 2020 to April 2022, (ii) increase the unencumbered liquid assets\ncovenant threshold from $5 million to $10 million effective in the first quarter of fiscal year 2021, (iii) to increase the tangible net\nworth requirement from $140 million to $145 million in the first quarter of fiscal year 2021 and (iv) remove the requirement that we\nobtain the consent of Frost Bank prior to paying dividends or repurchasing stock so long as we are in compliance with the covenants\nof the credit agreement. Under the Credit Agreement, the Company can borrow up to $30.0 million with amounts available for\nborrowing determined by a borrowing base. The borrowing base is determined based upon certain of the Company’s assets which\ninclude (i) 80% of certain accounts receivable plus (ii) 50% of certain notes receivable (such result not to exceed $10 million) plus (iii)\n25% of certain inventories (such result not to exceed $20 million). Subject to the borrowing base calculation, as of September 30,\n2019, the amount available for borrowing was $27.0 million. Several of the Company’s domestic subsidiaries have guaranteed the\nobligations of the Company under the Credit Agreement and such subsidiaries have secured their obligations under such guarantees by\nthe pledge of substantially all of the assets of such subsidiaries. The Company is required to make monthly interest payments on\nborrowed funds. The Credit Agreement limits the incurrence of additional indebtedness and contains other covenants customary in\nagreements of this type. The interest rate for borrowings under the Credit Agreement is based on the Wall Street Journal prime rate,\nwhich was 5.0% at September 30, 2019. At September 30, 2019, the Company was in compliance with all covenants under the Credit\nAgreement.\nF-22\nGeospace Technologies Corporation and Subsidiaries\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements—(Continued)\n14.

The Company has purchased stop-loss\ncoverage for individual claims in excess of $175,000 per claimant per year in order to limit its exposure to any significant levels of\nemployee medical claims. Self-insured losses are accrued based on the Company’s historical experience and on estimates of\naggregate liability for uninsured claims incurred using certain actuarial assumptions followed in the insurance industry.\n15. Employee Benefits\nThe Company’s U.S. employees are participants in the Geospace Technologies Corporation’s Employee’s 401(k) Retirement\nPlan (the “Plan”), which covers substantially all eligible employees in the United States. The Plan is a qualified salary reduction plan\nin which all eligible participants may elect to have a percentage of their compensation contributed to the Plan, subject to certain\nguidelines issued by the Internal Revenue Service. The Company’s share of discretionary matching contributions was approximately\n$0.9 million and $0.8 million in fiscal years 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nThe Company’s stock incentive plans in which key employees may participate are discussed in Note 16 to these consolidated\nfinancial statements.\n16. Stockholders’ Equity\nIn September 1997, the board of directors and stockholders approved the 1997 Key Employee Stock Option Plan (as\namended the “1997 Plan”) and, following amendments thereto, there has been reserved an aggregate of 2,250,000 shares of common\nstock for issuance thereunder. The 1997 Plan expired in November 2017.\nIn February 2014, the board of directors and stockholders approved the 2014 Long Term Incentive Plan (the “2014 Plan”),\nwhich replaced the 1997 Plan. Under the 2014 Plan, an aggregate of 1,500,000 shares of common stock may be issued. The\nCompany is authorized to issue nonqualified and incentive stock options to purchase common stock, restricted stock awards (“RSAs”)\nand restricted stock units (“RSUs”) to key employees, directors and consultants under the 2014 Plan. Options have a term not to\nexceed ten years, with the exception of incentive stock options granted to employees owning ten percent or more of the outstanding\nshares of common stock, which have a term not to exceed five years. The exercise price of any option may not be less than the fair\nmarket value of the common stock on the date of grant. In the case of incentive stock options granted to an employee owning ten\npercent or more of the outstanding shares of common stock, the exercise price of such option may not be less than 110% of the fair\nmarket value of the common stock on the date of grant. An RSU represents a contingent right to receive one share of the common\nstock upon vesting. Under the 2014 Plan, the Company may issue RSAs and RSUs to employees for no payment by the employee or\nfor a payment below the fair market value on the date of grant. The RSAs and RSUs are subject to certain restrictions described in the\n2014 Plan.\nAt September 30, 2019, an aggregate of 477,015 shares of common stock were available for issuance under the 2014 Plan.\nNo further awards of stock options may be made under the 1997 Plan.\nF-23\nGeospace Technologies Corporation and Subsidiaries\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements—(Continued)\nThe following table summarizes the combined activity under the equity incentive plans for the indicated periods:\nWeighted Weighted Weighted\nNumber of Average Average Average\nNonqualified Exercise Number Grant-date Grant-date\nOptions Price per of Fair Value Number of Fair Value\nOutstanding Share RSAs per Share RSUs per Unit\nOutstanding at October 1, 2017.......... 201,800 $ 17.47 288,800 $ 28.92 — $ —\nGranted........................................ — — 176,450 15.13 — —\nExercised.....................................

The total grant date fair value of all RSAs issued for fiscal years 2019 and 2018 was\n$0.1 million and $2.7 million, respectively, which will be charged to expense over the next four years as the restrictions lapse.\nCompensation expense for the RSAs was determined based on the closing market price of the Company’s stock on the date of grant\napplied to the total number of shares that are anticipated to fully vest. Recipients of RSAs are entitled to vote such shares and are\nentitled to dividends, if paid.\nDuring fiscal year 2019, the Company issued 161,800 RSUs to certain of its employees, executive officers and directors\nunder the 2014 Plan, as amended. The RSUs issued include both time-based and performance-based vesting provisions. The\nweighted average grant date fair value of each RSU was $15.11 per unit. The total grant date fair value of all RSUs issued was $2.4\nmillion, which will be charged to expense over the next four years as the restrictions lapse. Compensation expense for RSUs was\ndetermined based on the closing market price of the Company’s stock on the date of grant applied to the total number of units that are\nanticipated to fully vest.\nAll RSAs and RSUs outstanding at September 30, 2019 and 2018 were issued from the 2014 Plan. 45,000 stock options\noutstanding at September 30, 2019 were issued under the 1997 Plan.

The income tax benefit for fiscal year 2018 primarily reflects a $0.7 million tax refund resulting from the filing of an\namended U.S. tax return. The Company is currently unable to record any tax benefits for its tax losses in the U.S. and Canada due to\nthe uncertainty surrounding its ability to utilize such losses in the future to offset taxable income.\nDeferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and\nliabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes.

The 2017 Tax Act, among other things, reduces the U.S. federal corporate\ntax rate from 35% to 21%, effective January 1, 2018, creates new taxes on certain foreign earnings and may require companies to pay\na one-time transition tax on undistributed earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries that were previously tax deferred. The Company is\nnot required to pay a one-time transition tax on earnings of our foreign subsidiaries since there were no accumulated earnings on a\nconsolidated basis. As a result of the 2017 Tax Act, during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2018, the Company revalued its U.S.\ndeferred tax assets based on a U.S. federal tax rate of 21%, which resulted in a reduction to our deferred tax assets of approximately\n$8.1 million. The reduction in deferred tax assets was completely offset by a like reduction to the valuation allowance.\nThe financial reporting basis of investments in foreign subsidiaries exceed their tax basis. A deferred tax liability is not\nrecorded for this temporary difference because the investment is deemed to be permanent. A reversal of the Company’s plans to\npermanently invest in these foreign operations would cause the excess to become taxable. At September 30, 2019, the Company had\n$7.0 million of cash and cash equivalents held by its foreign subsidiaries. At September 30, 2019 and 2018, the temporary difference\nrelated to undistributed earnings for which no deferred taxes have been provided was approximately $12.9 million and $12.9 million,\nrespectively.\nF-26\nGeospace Technologies Corporation and Subsidiaries\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements—(Continued)\nTax return filings which are subject to review by local tax authorities by major jurisdiction are as follows:\n• United States—fiscal years ended September 30, 2016 through 2019\n• State of Texas—fiscal years ended September 30, 2016 through 2019\n• State of New York—fiscal years ended September 30, 2017\n• State of California – fiscal years ended September 30, 2016 through 2019\n• State of Pennsylvania – fiscal years ended September 30, 2017\n• Russian Federation—calendar years 2017 through 2019\n• Canada—fiscal years ended September 30, 2016 through 2019\n• United Kingdom—fiscal years ended September 30, 2018 through 2019\n• Colombia—calendar years 2017 through 2019\nThe Company had no unrecognized tax liabilities as of September 30, 2019 and 2018.\nAs of September 30, 2019, the Company had net operating loss (“NOL”) carry-forwards of approximately $61.7 million in\nthe United States, $15.2 million in Canada and $0.5 million in Russia which are available to offset future taxable income in those\njurisdictions. The NOL carry-forwards for Canada and Russia begin to expire in 2033 and 2026, respectively. The NOL carry-\nforward for the United States which originated prior to the 2017 Tax Act of $41.4 million begins to expire in 2028. The Company’s\nNOLs originating after the 2017 Tax Act of $17.5 million do not expire.\nManagement of the Company has concluded that it was more-likely-than-not that its U.S. and Canadian net deferred tax\nassets will not be realized in accordance with U.S. GAAP. At September 30, 2019 and September 30, 2018, the Company had a\nvaluation allowance against its U.S. net deferred tax assets of $21.5 million and $20.9 million, respectively, and a valuation allowance\nagainst its Canadian net deferred tax assets of $4.5 million and $4.4 million, respectively.\n18. Loss Per Common Share\nBasic loss per share is computed by dividing net loss available to common stockholders by the weighted average number of\ncommon shares used in basic loss per share during the period. Diluted loss per share is determined on the assumption that outstanding\nRSUs have been exchanged for common stock and outstanding dilutive stock options have been exercised and the aggregate proceeds\nas defined were used to reacquire common stock using the average price of such common stock for the period.\nThe following table summarizes the calculation of net loss and weighted average common shares and common equivalent\nshares outstanding for purposes of the computation of loss per share (in thousands, except share and per share amounts):\nYEAR ENDED SEPTEMBER 30,\n2019 2018\nNet loss...................................................................................................... $ (146) $ (19,212)\nLess: Loss allocable to unvested restricted stock...................................... — —\nLoss attributable to common shareholders\nfor diluted earnings per share................................................................. $ (146) $ (19,212)\nWeighted average number of common share equivalents:\nCommon shares used in basic loss per share....................................... 13,388,626 13,250,867\nCommon share equivalents outstanding related to\nstock options and RSUs.................................................................... — —\nTotal weighted average common shares and common share\nequivalents used in diluted loss per share............................................... 13,388,626 13,250,867\nLoss per shares:\nBasic..................................................................................................... $ (0.01) $ (1.45)\nDiluted.................................................................................................. $ (0.01) $ (1.45)\nFor the calculation of diluted loss per share for fiscal years 2019 and 2018, stock options of 165,600 and\n190,600, respectively, and RSUs of 137,290 and zero, respectively, were excluded in the calculation of weighted average shares\noutstanding as a result of their impact being antidilutive.\nF-27\nGeospace Technologies Corporation and Subsidiaries\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements—(Continued)\n19. Commitments and Contingencies\nContingent Consideration\nIn connection with its acquisitions of Quantum and OptoSeis, the Company recorded contingent purchase price payments, or\ncontingent consideration, that may be owed in the future. For both acquisitions, the contingent payments are based on future receipt of\ncontracts awards and the resulting revenue derived from such contracts. The Company has utilized the services of an independent\nvaluation consultant to assist it with the estimation of the fair value of this contingent consideration. The determination of fair value is\ninherently unpredictable since it requires estimates and projections of future revenue, including the size, length, timing and, in the case\nof Quantum, the extent of gross profits earned under its future contracts. As a result, the Company anticipates future fair value\nadjustments to these liabilities over the respective earn-out periods, and these adjustments will result in either charges or credits to the\nCompany’s operating expenses when the fair value of the contingent consideration increases or decreases, respectively.\nThe Company recorded an initial contingent earn-out liability of $7.7 million in connection with its July 2018 acquisition of\nQuantum. Contingent payments, if any, may be paid in the form of cash or Company stock and will be derived from eligible revenue\ngenerated during a four-year earn-out period subsequent to the closing of the acquisition. The maximum amount of contingent\npayments is $23.5 million over the earn-out period. For the fiscal year ended September 30, 2019, the Company recorded a $2.9\nmillion adjustment to decrease the initial earn-out liability to its estimated fair value.\nThe Company recorded an initial continent earn-out liability of $4.3 million in connection with its November 2018\nacquisition of all the intellectual property and related assets of the OptoSeis® fiber optic sensing technology. Contingent cash\npayments, if any, will be derived from eligible revenue generated during a five-and-a-half year earn-out period subsequent to the\nclosing of the acquisition from products and services utilizing the OptoSeis® fiber optic technology. The maximum amount of\ncontingent payments is $23.2 million over the earn-out period. For the fiscal year ended September 30, 2019, the Company recorded a\n$0.8 million adjustment to increase the initial earn-out liability to fair value.\nThe Company will reassess the earn-out calculations related to this contingent consideration in future periods.\nOperating Leases\nThe Company leases office space and certain equipment for terms of two years or less. Rent expense was approximately $0.6\nmillion and $0.1 million during fiscal years 2019 and 2018, respectively. Future minimum lease obligations for the fiscal years ending\nSeptember 30, 2020 and 2021 are $0.4 million and $36,000, respectively.\nLegal Proceedings\nThe Company is involved in various pending legal actions in the ordinary course of its business. Management is unable to\npredict the ultimate outcome of these actions, because of the inherent uncertainty of such actions. However, management believes that\nthe most probable, ultimate resolution of current pending matters will not have a material adverse effect on the Company’s\nconsolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.\n20.

However, there will likely be events in the future that we are not able to predict or control. The factors listed under the caption “Risk Factors”, as well\nas cautionary language in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, provide examples of risks, uncertainties and events that may cause our actual results to differ materially from the expectations\nwe describe in our forward-looking statements. Such examples include, but are not limited to, the failure of the Quantum or OptoSeis® technology transactions to yield positive operating\nresults, decreases in commodity price levels, which could reduce demand for our products, the failure of our products to achieve market acceptance, despite substantial investment by us, our\nsensitivity to short term backlog, delayed or cancelled customer orders, product obsolescence resulting from poor industry conditions or new technologies, bad debt write-offs associated with\ncustomer accounts, lack of further orders for our OBX systems, failure of our Quantum products to be adopted by the border and perimeter security markets, infringement or failure to protect\nintellectual property, the failure of the acquisition transaction to yield positive results, and any negative impact from our restatement of our financial statements regarding current assets.\nThe occurrence of the events described in these risk factors and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and\nfinancial position, and actual events and results of operations may vary materially from our current expectations. We assume no obligation to revise or update any forward-looking statement,\nwhether written or oral, that we may make from time to time, whether as a result of new information, future developments or otherwise.\nDear Fellow Shareholder,\nGeospace Deepens and Extends its Product Lines\nWhile fiscal year 2018 reflected a fourth year of depressed oil and gas exploration spending,\nthe year was still momentous for Geospace. During the year, we acquired Quantum\nTechnology Sciences, Inc. (Quantum) to broaden our product line and extend our technology\nofferings in the protection of critical infrastructure and perimeters, including domestic\nand international borders. We have long provided sensors to this marketplace, but with\nQuantum, we now add strong real-time analytics that provide our customers with highly\naccurate and actionable real-time intelligence.\nRick Wheeler Subsequent to year-end, we also acquired from PGS Americas, Inc. all of the intellectual\nproperty and related assets associated with OptoSeis®, a fiber optic technology which has\nbeen successfully deployed in a permanent reservoir monitoring (PRM) system located\noffshore Brazil. For a decade and a half, our PRM systems have provided oil and gas\ncompanies with a thorough understanding of reservoir characteristics through crystal-clear\nimages, allowing them to reduce field risks and improve production economics throughout\nthe lifecycle of the reservoir. The OptoSeis technology complements our existing PRM\nproduct offerings, demonstrating our commitment to serve the energy industry in the\nbroadest way possible. We believe our expertise in PRM system products will be at the\nforefront of consideration as oil and gas companies seek to extract hydrocarbons more cost\neffectively and extend the life of their fields. The OptoSeis technology also holds promise\nas an improved solution for land seismic operations requiring large-channel-count cabled\nsystems, including its potential use for border and perimeter security.\nGeospace has a reputation for robust and innovative seismic solutions and, with our strategic\nacquisition of Quantum and OptoSeis, we are expanding into important new markets as well\nas deepening our commitments in existing markets.\nFinancial Results\nOur fiscal year 2018 results reflect the fourth year of a downturn in the oil and gas industry.\nFor the year, we narrowed our net loss to $19.2 million, or $1.45 per diluted share, on\nrevenue of $75.7 million. This compares to a net loss of $56.8 million, or $4.32 per diluted\nshare, on revenues of $73.7 million for the prior year. Throughout this extended downturn\nwe have remained debt free, entering fiscal year 2019 with $37.4 of cash, cash equivalents\nand short-term investments, plus $21.5 million available under our credit facility. As always,\nwe are laser-focused on cost containment while at the same time making sensible capital\nimprovements to increase our operating efficiencies. To that end, we have introduced new\nautomation in areas of our production and intend to expand this effort as appropriate.\nOil and Gas Markets Segment\nIn the oil and gas markets segment (formerly known as the seismic segment), our fiscal\nyear 2018 results reflected a 5% reduction in revenues, as oil and gas companies engaged\nin fewer exploration programs. Despite the decline, revenue from our OBX and GSX rental\nfleets increased during the year. It is especially encouraging to see growth in the demand\nfor our OBX products in an otherwise diminished market of seismic industry activity. Such\ngrowth is evidenced by the two lease contracts for our OBX products announced prior to\nyear-end, which commence in fiscal year 2019 and are expected to generate in excess of $20\nmillion in revenue. We are also working with customers on even more opportunities where\nOBX equipment could be deployed. To satisfy these growing demands, we intend to wisely\ndeploy additional capital into our OBX products and rental fleet to take advantage of these\nopportunities.\nGEOSPACE TECHNOLOGIES ANNUAL REPORT 2018\n1\nWe hope fiscal year 2019 sees a loosening of the four-year stranglehold on exploration spending,\nespecially given the dismal replacement of reserves and last year’s lowest amount of new discoveries\nin seventy years. A refocus on such fundamentals could lead to increases in geophysical activity and\nexpenditures. Our hope is of course predicated on a need for the industry to become sufficiently\nconcerned about the possibility of supply shortages, after years of ignoring the decline in\nreserve-replacements.\nAs we enter year five of a downturn in seismic exploration, the challenges of forecasting industry\nexpenditures and translating into potential sales and rentals for Geospace are even more complex.\nMore used equipment is available in the marketplace and new manufacturers of systems are still trying\nto emerge, resulting in competition and pressure for lower pricing at the highest levels. Our OBX,\nGSX, and PRM systems are renowned for their innovation, quality, and reliability for any\nproject - from exploration to reservoir characterization – and we believe these factors give us favor\nin this tight market.\nAdjacent Markets Segment\nIn fiscal year 2018, we recorded the largest amount of revenue in the history of our adjacent markets\nsegment (formerly known as our non-seismic segment), largely due to greater demand for our smart\nwater meter related products. We expect continued growth in this segment as industry demand\nexpands for existing and new products.\nEmerging Markets Segment\nFor fiscal year 2019, this new market segment (attributable to our acquisition of Quantum) will focus\non integrating and advancing Geospace’s innovative products with Quantum’s exceptional analytics,\nresulting in more rugged and reliable solutions uniquely suited for the border and perimeter security\nmarkets. We welcome Dr. Mark Tinker and his team to Geospace where we have already begun\nco-development efforts on products expected to create strong future demand.\nConclusion\nWe know fiscal year 2019 will be a year in which we strengthen and extend our product lines,\nwhile improving our operating efficiencies. We also know that for now, oil and gas companies remain\ncautious if not hesitant about increasing capital expenditures for seismic exploration in apparent\nwillingness to accept unsustainable depletion of reserves. Despite this environment, improved revenues\nare still possible. Two potential drivers for such improvement are increased demand for our OBX\nproducts, which can lead to additional long-term contracts for its use, and renewed interest by oil and\ngas companies in PRM systems. We believe we are optimally positioned to take advantage of any and\nall opportunities presented in these areas. Combining this with our strategy of market diversification\nthrough the acquisitions of Quantum and OptoSeis, we believe we can once again demonstrably\nincrease shareholder value.\nRRiicckk WWhheeeelleerr\nPresident & Chief Executive Officer\nGEOSPACE TECHNOLOGIES ANNUAL REPORT 2018\n2\n10K\n2018\nUNITED STATES\nSECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION\nWashington, D.C. 20549\nFORM 10-K\n⌧ Annual Report Pursuant to Section 13 or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 for the Fiscal Year\nEnded September 30, 2018\nOR\n(cid:4) Transition Report Pursuant to Section 13 or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934\nCommission file number 001-13601\nGEOSPACE TECHNOLOGIES CORPORATION\n(Exact Name of Registrant as Specified in Its Charter)\nTexas 76-0447780\n(State or Other Jurisdiction of (I.R.S.

Business\nBusiness Overview\nGeospace Technologies Corporation reincorporated as a Texas corporation on April 16, 2015. We originally incorporated as\na Delaware corporation on September 27, 1994. Unless otherwise specified, the discussion in this Annual Report on Form 10-K refers\nto Geospace Technologies Corporation and its subsidiaries. We design and manufacture instruments and equipment used in the oil\nand gas industry to acquire seismic data in order to locate, characterize and monitor hydrocarbon producing reservoirs. We also\ndesign and manufacture industrial products, offshore cables, imaging equipment and border and perimeter security products.\nWe have been engaged in the design and manufacture of seismic instruments and equipment since 1980. We primarily\nmarket our seismic products to the oil and gas industry to locate, characterize and monitor hydrocarbon producing reservoirs. We also\nmarket our seismic products to other industries for vibration monitoring, border and perimeter security and various geotechnical\napplications. We design and manufacture other products of a non-seismic nature, including water meter products, imaging equipment\nand offshore cables. Demand for our seismic products targeted at the oil and gas industry has been, and will likely continue to be,\nvulnerable to downturns in the economy and the oil and gas industry in general. For more information, please refer to the risks\ndiscussed under the heading “Risk Factors.”\nBusiness Acquisition\nOn July 27, 2018, the Company acquired Quantum Technology Sciences, Inc., a Florida-based tactical security and\nsurveillance systems solutions provider (“Quantum”) through a merger of the Company’s subsidiary with and into Quantum, with\nQuantum as the surviving corporation. Quantum’s operations will remain in Florida, performing as a wholly-owned subsidiary of the\nCompany.\nThe acquisition purchase price for Quantum consisted of a cash payment at closing of approximately $4.4 million and\ncontingent earn-out payments of up to $23.5 million over a four-year period. The contingent payments, if any, which may be paid in\nthe form of cash or Company stock, will be derived from certain eligible revenue that may be generated during the four-year earn-out\nperiod.\nSegment and Geographical Information\nEffective September 30, 2018, we began reporting and evaluating financial information for three business segments: Oil and\nGas Markets, Adjacent Markets and Emerging Markets. The Oil and Gas Markets segment was previously referred to as our Seismic\nsegment. Our Adjacent Markets segment was previously referred to as our Non-Seismic segment. The Emerging Markets segment\nwas added in conjunction with the acquisition of Quantum, which designs and markets seismic products targeted at the border and\nperimeter security markets. Because we have simply renamed our two original segments and added a new segment, we have not\nrestated any previous financial statements. For a discussion of the products sold and markets served by each of our segments, see\n“Products and Product Development” below. For a discussion of financial information by segment and geographic area, see Note 22\nto the consolidated financial statements contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nProducts and Product Development\nOil and Gas Markets\nOur Oil and Gas Markets business segment has historically accounted for the majority of our revenue. Geoscientists use\nseismic data primarily in connection with the exploration, development and production of oil and gas reserves to map potential and\nknown hydrocarbon bearing formations and the geologic structures that surround them. This segment’s products include wireless\nseismic data acquisition systems, reservoir characterization products and services, and traditional seismic exploration products such as\ngeophones, hydrophones, leader wire, connectors, cables, marine streamer retrieval and steering devices and various other seismic\nproducts. We believe that our oil and gas products are among the most technologically advanced instruments and equipment available\nfor seismic data acquisition.\n1\nTraditional Products\nAn energy source and a data recording system are combined to acquire seismic data. We provide many of the components of\nseismic data recording systems, including geophones, hydrophones, multi-component sensors, leader wire, geophone strings,\nconnectors, seismic telemetry cables and other seismic related products. On land, our customers use geophones, leader wire, cables\nand connectors to receive and measure seismic reflections resulting from an energy source into data recording units, which store the\nseismic information for subsequent processing and analysis. In the marine environment, large ocean-going vessels tow long seismic\ncables known as “streamers” containing hydrophones which are used to detect pressure changes. Hydrophones transmit electrical\nimpulses back to the vessel’s data recording unit where the seismic data is stored for subsequent processing and analysis. Our marine\nseismic products also help steer streamers while being towed and help recover streamers if they become disconnected from the vessel.\nOur seismic sensor, cable and connector products are compatible with most major competitive seismic data acquisition\nsystems currently in use. Revenue from these products results primarily from seismic contractors purchasing our products as\ncomponents of new seismic data acquisition systems or to repair and replace components of seismic data acquisition systems already\nin use.\nOur products used in marine seismic data acquisition include our seismic streamer retrieval devices (“SRDs”). Occasionally,\nstreamer cables are severed and become disconnected from the vessel as a result of obstacles, inclement weather, vessel traffic or\nhuman error. Our SRDs, which are attached to the streamer cables, contain air bags which are designed to inflate automatically at a\ngiven water depth, bringing the severed streamer cables to the surface. These SRDs save the seismic contractors significant time and\nmoney compared to the alternative of losing the streamer cable. We also produce seismic streamer steering devices, or “birds,” which\nare fin-like devices that attach to the streamer cable. These birds help maintain the streamer cable at a certain desired depth as it is\nbeing towed through the water.\nWireless Products\nWe have developed a land-based wireless (or nodal) seismic data acquisition system called the GSX. Rather than utilizing\ninterconnecting cables as required by most traditional land data acquisition systems, each GSX station operates as an independent data\ncollection system, allowing our GSX stations to be deployed in virtually unlimited channel configurations. As a result, our GSX\nsystem requires less maintenance, which we believe allows our customers to operate more effectively and efficiently because of its\nreduced environmental impact, lower weight and ease of operation. Our GSX system is designed into configurations ranging from\none to four channels per station. Since its introduction in 2008 and through September 30, 2018, we have sold 432,000 GSX channels\nand we have 77,000 GSX channels in our rental fleet.\nWe have also developed a marine-based wireless seismic data acquisition system called the OBX. Similar to our GSX land-\nbased wireless system, the marine OBX system can be deployed in virtually unlimited channel configurations and does not require\ninterconnecting cables between each station. Our deep water versions of the OBX system can be deployed in depths of up to 3,450\nmeters. At September 30, 2018, we had 13,000 OBX stations in our rental fleet, and additional OBX stations under construction in\norder to meet contracted demand. We expect to make significant financial investments into our OBX rental fleet during fiscal year\n2019.\nReservoir Products\nSeismic surveys repeated over selected time intervals show dynamic changes within the reservoir and can be used to monitor\nthe effects of oil and gas development and production. In this regard, we have developed permanently installed high-definition\nreservoir monitoring systems for land and ocean-bottom applications in producing oil and gas fields. We also produce a retrievable\nversion of our ocean-bottom system for use on fields where permanently installed systems are not appropriate or economical.\nUtilizing these tools, producers can enhance the recovery of oil and gas deposits over the life of a reservoir.\nOur high-definition reservoir monitoring products include the HDSeis™ product line and a suite of borehole and reservoir\nmonitoring products and services. Our HDSeis™ system is a high-definition seismic data acquisition system with flexible architecture\nthat allows it to be configured as a borehole seismic system or as a subsurface system for both land and marine reservoir-monitoring\nprojects. The scalable architecture of the HDSeis™ system enables custom designed system configuration for applications ranging\nfrom low-channel engineering and environmental-scale surveys requiring a minimum number of recording channels to high-channel\nsurveys required to efficiently conduct permanent reservoir monitoring (“PRM”). Modular architecture allows virtually unlimited\nchannel expansion. In addition, multi-system synchronization features make the HDSeis™ system well-suited for multi-well or multi-\nsite acquisition, simultaneous surface and downhole acquisition and continuous reservoir monitoring projects.\n2\nReservoir monitoring requires special purpose or custom designed systems in which portability becomes less critical and\nfunctional reliability assumes greater importance. This reliability factor helps assure successful operations in inaccessible locations\nover a considerable period of time. Additionally, reservoirs located in deep water or harsh environments require special\ninstrumentation and new techniques to maximize recovery. Reservoir monitoring also requires high-bandwidth, high-resolution\nseismic data for engineering project planning and reservoir management. We believe our HDSeis™ System and tools, designed for\ncost-effective deployment and lifetime performance, will make borehole and seabed seismic acquisition a cost-effective and reliable\nprocess for the challenges of reservoir monitoring. Our multi-component seismic product developments include an omni-directional\ngeophone for use in reservoir monitoring, a compact marine three-component or four-component gimbaled sensor and special-purpose\nconnectors, connector arrays and cases.\nWe have not received any orders for large-scale seabed PRM systems since November 2012 and we currently do not have\nany indication that such an order will be received in fiscal year 2019, although we do believe opportunities for PRM orders do exist in\ntoday’s market.\nIn addition, we produce seismic borehole acquisition systems which employ a fiber optic augmented wireline capable of very\nhigh data transmission rates. These systems are used for several reservoir monitoring applications, including an application pioneered\nby us allowing operators and service companies to monitor and measure the results of fracturing operations.\nAdjacent Markets\nOur Adjacent Markets businesses leverage upon our existing manufacturing facilities and engineering capabilities. We have\nfound that many of our oil and gas seismic products, with little or no modification, have direct application to industries beyond those\ninvolved in oil and gas exploration and development.\nIndustrial Products\nOur industrial products include water meter products, imaging equipment, offshore cables, as well as seismic sensors used for\nvibration monitoring and geotechnical applications such as mine safety applications and earthquake detection.\nImaging Products\nOur imaging products include electronic pre-press products that employ direct thermal imaging and digital inkjet printing\ntechnologies targeted at the commercial graphics, industrial graphics, textile and flexographic printing industries.\nEmerging Markets\nOur Emerging Markets business segment consists of our recent acquisition of Quantum. Quantum’s product developments\ninclude a proprietary detection system called SADAR®, which detects, locates and follows activities of interest in real-time. Using the\nSADAR® technology, Quantum designs and sells products used for border and perimeter security surveillance, cross-border tunneling\ndetection and other products targeted at movement monitoring, intrusion detection and situational awareness. Quantum’s customers\ninclude various agencies of the U.S. government including the Department of Defense, Department of Energy, Department of\nHomeland Security and other agencies.\nBusiness Strategy\nWe have experienced several years of very low demand for most of the products we sell and rent into our Oil and Gas\nMarkets. We are now seeing signs of increased oil and gas exploration activities brought about by improving market prices for crude\noil. Specifically, we are seeing significant rental demand for certain of our oil and gas products used to gather seismic data on the\nocean-bottom and we are allocating capital resources to the production of these products. Conversely, depressed demand continues\nfor our marine PRM systems and our land-focused seismic products. As a result, we have adopted what we think is a conservative and\nprudent business strategy which places a focus on sound financial management practices. We have not changed our primary focus on\ncontinued investment in product research and development and, possibly, selective acquisitions and joint ventures.\n(cid:129) Continue Investment in Product Research and Development – Past periods of revenue growth were primarily driven\nthrough our internal development of new products for the oil and gas industry. In past years, our oil and gas product\ninnovations included the introduction of borehole seismology tools, land and seabed PRM systems and wireless data\nacquisition systems for both land and marine applications. These innovative technologies are the result of our unceasing\ninvestment in research and development initiatives, even during difficult industry cycles when we experience a\nsignificant decline in customer demand for our products. A majority of our product research and development cost\nrelates to our product engineers. Our engineering staff has been key to our past success, and we intend to continue our\ntradition of retaining and attracting quality engineering staff and providing appropriate compensation and benefits.\nGoing forward, we intend to continue significant investments in product research and development of new oil and gas\ntechnologies as well as products for our other business segments in order to diversify and grow our revenue base.\n3\n(cid:129) Selectively Pursue Acquisitions of Businesses with Technological and Engineering Overlap – The oil and gas industry\nperiodically experiences volatile business cycles requiring us to rapidly increase and decrease our business activities to\nmeet the industry’s demand for our products. This industry generally offers equipment manufacturers like us limited\nvisibility into new orders creating challenges for us to manage our manufacturing capacity, workforce, inventories and\nother working capital challenges. While our primary growth initiative is to expand our oil and gas seismic product\nofferings, we may also seek out other business opportunities in adjacent markets and emerging markets which\ncomplement our existing oil and gas seismic products, engineering and manufacturing capabilities, and company-wide\nculture. In order to diversify our revenue base and expose us to different markets with different business cycles, we may\ndirect these efforts toward businesses outside the oil and gas industry, as recently seen with our acquisition of Quantum.\n(cid:129) Financial Management – Industry conditions since fiscal year 2014 have required us to place increased emphasis on cash\nmanagement and preservation. Due to the cyclicality of the oil and gas industry, we have historically managed our\nfinancial risk by limiting or eliminating debt leverage in our balance sheet. While we are not opposed to moderate\namounts of short-term debt during favorable business cycles, we choose to minimize our exposure to long-term debt\nobligations which, in our view, restrict our ability to operate during periodic difficult business cycles in the oil and gas\nindustry similar to the recent business environment. We believe this strategy has allowed us to continue operations\nthrough difficult business cycles without disruption for debt and equity restructuring as has been seen among our peers,\nmany of whom have significant long-term debt burdens. In addition, we have limited our investments in capital assets\nand have liquidated, and made appropriate reserves for, significant amounts of our inventories and rental fleet assets.\nWe also believe that the value of our common shares outstanding will be best served in the long-term by retaining our\ncash and short-term investments to fund future cash outflows as they become necessary or advisable. In this regard, we\ndo not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future, nor do we expect to initiate any significant buy-\nback program to repurchase our common stock.\nCompetition\nOil and Gas Products\nWe are one of the world’s largest designers and manufacturers of seismic products used in the oil and gas industry. The\nprincipal competitors for many of our traditional seismic products are Sercel (a division of CGG), ION Geophysical (“ION”) and\nINOVA (a joint venture formed in 2009 between ION and Bureau of Geophysical Prospecting, a subsidiary of China National\nPetroleum Company). Furthermore, entities in China affiliated with Sercel, as well as other Chinese manufacturers produce low-cost\noil and gas seismic products meeting current industry standards.\nThe primary competitors for our land wireless data acquisition systems are Sercel, FairfieldNodal, INOVA and numerous\nsmaller entities who have introduced similar versions of wireless data acquisition systems. We believe the primary competitors for\nour marine nodal data acquisition systems are marine seismic data acquisition service providers like FairfieldNodal (“Fairfield”),\nSeabed Geosolutions (a joint venture formed between Fugro and CGG) and Magseis ASA (“Magseis”), each of whom utilizes their\nown proprietary nodal technology. On October 30, 2018, Magseis announced that it intended to purchase the seismic technologies\nbusiness of Fairfield.\nMost oil and gas seismic products are price sensitive, so the ability to manufacture these products at a low cost is essential to\nmaintain market share. While price is an important factor in a customer’s decision to purchase a land or marine wireless data\nacquisition system, we believe customers also place a high value on a product’s historical performance and the ongoing engineering\nand field support provided by the product’s manufacturer.\nThe principal keys for success in the seismic instruments and equipment market are technological superiority, product\ndurability under harsh field conditions, reliability and customer support. Product deliverability is always an important consideration\nfor our customers.\nIn general, most customers prefer to standardize data acquisition systems, geophones and hydrophones, particularly if they\nare used by seismic companies that have multiple crews which are able to support each other. This standardization makes it difficult\nfor competitive manufacturers to gain market share from other manufacturers with existing customer relationships.\nOur primary competitors for the rental of our traditional and wireless seismic equipment are Mitcham Industries, Inc. and\nSeismic Equipment Solutions.\nOur primary competitor for our seabed PRM systems is Alcatel-Lucent. We believe our primary competitors for high-\ndefinition borehole seismic data acquisition systems are Avalon Sciences Ltd and Sercel.\n4\nAdjacent Markets Products\nOur industrial and imaging products face competition from numerous domestic and international specialty product\nmanufacturers.\nEmerging Markets Products\nThe border and perimeter security marketplace is dominated by large integrated system providers such as Boeing, General\nDynamics, Lockheed Martin, Raytheon, Elbit Systems and others. Systems provided by these competitors are generally multifaceted\nand may include numerous integrated surveillance technologies, including the geophysical sensor and software systems that we have\ndeveloped. Our sensing technology does not rely on line-of-sight motion detection, which is required by cameras and other optical\ntechnologies. This allows our technology to detect things a camera would miss. Competitive geophysical technologies utilizing fiber\noptic sensing techniques are provided by OptaSense, Fibersensys, Future Fiber Technologies and other specialty sensor manufacturing\nfirms.\nSuppliers\nWe purchase raw materials from a variety of suppliers located in various countries. We typically have multiple suppliers for\nour critical materials. In our oil and gas seismic business segment, certain models of our marine wireless products use a timing device\nmanufactured by a single supplier. We currently do not possess the ability to manufacture this component and have no other reliable\nsource for this device. In our Adjacent Markets business segment, we purchase all of our imaging thermal film from a single supplier.\nBeyond this film supplier, we know of no other source for thermal film that performs as well in our imaging equipment. For a\ndiscussion of the risks related to our reliance on these suppliers, see “Risk Factors – We Rely on Key Suppliers for Certain\nComponents Used in Our Products.”\nWe do not currently experience any significant difficulties in obtaining raw materials from our suppliers for the production of\nour products.\nProduct Manufacturing and Assembly\nOur manufacturing and product assembly operations consist of machining, molding or cabling the necessary component\nparts, configuring these parts along with components received from various vendors and assembling a final product. We manufacture\nmany of our oil and gas seismic products to the specifications required by our customers. For example, we can armor cables for use in\nmultiple deep water applications. We assemble geophone strings based on a number of customer choices such as length, gauge,\ntolerance and color of molded parts. Upon completion of our manufacturing and assembly operations, we test our final products to the\nfunctional and environmental extremes of product specifications and inspect the products for quality assurance. Consistent with\nindustry practice, we normally manufacture our products based on firm customer orders, anticipated customer orders and historical\nproduct demand. As a result of the steep decline in product demand that began in fiscal year 2014 and that was further aggravated by\nthe decline in crude oil prices, we currently hold significant levels of inventories.\nMarkets and Customers\nOur principal customers for our traditional and wireless seismic products are seismic contractors and, to a lesser extent, major\nindependent and government-owned oil and gas companies that either operate their own seismic crews or specify seismic instrument\nand equipment preferences to contractors. For our deep water PRM products, our customers are generally large international oil and\ngas companies that operate long-term offshore oil and gas producing properties. Our industrial product customers consist of specialty\nmanufacturers, research institutions and industrial product distributors. Our imaging customers primarily consist of direct users of\nour equipment as well as specialized resellers that focus on the screen-printing and flexographic printing industries. Our border and\nperimeter security customers are primarily government agencies. Our corporate customer is a rental tenant in a building facility we\nown.\n5\nOne customer comprised 10.4% of our revenue during fiscal year 2018. One customer comprised 17.8% of our revenue\nduring fiscal year 2017. One customer comprised 18.5% of our revenue during fiscal year 2016. The following table describes our\nrevenue by customer segment type (in thousands):\nYEAR ENDED SEPTEMBER 30,\n2018 2017 2016\nTraditional seismic exploration product revenue...................... $ 12,855 $ 14,756 $ 13,298\nWireless seismic exploration product revenue.......................... 27,254 29,690 18,400\nSeismic reservoir product revenue............................................ 4,842 2,663 2,094\nIndustrial product revenue........................................................ 18,352 14,420 16,223\nImaging product revenue.......................................................... 11,580 11,607 11,485\nBorder & perimeter security product revenue........................... 286 — —\nCorporate revenue..................................................................... 579 585 560\nTotal revenue............................................................................. $ 75,748 $ 73,721 $ 62,060\nIntellectual Property\nWe seek to protect our intellectual property by means of patents, trademarks, trade secrets and other measures. We hold\npatents on geophones, micro-geophones, piezo-electric sensors, seismic data acquisition, in-line retrieval devices and water meter\nconnectors, and we have pending applications on related technology. We do not consider any single patent essential to our success.\nOur patents are scheduled to expire at various dates through 2035. We are not able to predict the effect of any patent expiration. We\nprotect our proprietary rights to our technology through a variety of methods, including confidentiality agreements and proprietary\ninformation agreements with suppliers, employees, consultants and others who may have access to proprietary information.\nResearch and Development\nWe expect to incur significant future research and development expenditures aimed at the development of additional products\nfor each of our business segments. We have incurred company-sponsored research and development expenses of $10.8 million, $13.8\nmillion and $13.9 million during the fiscal years ended September 30, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.\nEmployees\nAs of September 30, 2018, we employed 726 people predominantly on a full-time basis, of which 460 were employed in the\nUnited States, 230 in the Russian Federation and the remainder in the United Kingdom, Canada, China and Colombia. A majority of\nour employees in the Russian Federation belong to a regional union for machine manufacturers. Our remaining employees are not\nunionized. We have never experienced a work stoppage and consider our relationship with our employees to be satisfactory.\nFinancial Information by Segment and Geographic Area\nFor a discussion of financial information by segment and geographic area, see Note 22 to the consolidated financial\nstatements contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Risk Factors\nRisk Factors\nCommodity Price Levels May Affect Demand for Our Oil and Gas Products, Which Has and Could Continue to Materially and\nAdversely Affect Our Results of Operations and Liquidity\nDemand for many of our products and the profitability of our operations depend primarily on the level of worldwide oil and\ngas exploration activity. Prevailing oil and gas prices, with an emphasis on crude oil prices, and market expectations regarding\npotential changes in such prices significantly affect the level of worldwide oil and gas exploration activity. During periods of\nimproved energy commodity prices, the capital spending budgets of oil and natural gas operators tend to expand, which results in\nincreased demand for our products. Conversely, in periods when these energy commodity prices deteriorate, capital spending budgets\nof oil and natural gas operators tend to contract and the demand for our products generally weakens. Historically, the markets for oil\nand gas have been volatile and are subject to wide fluctuation in response to changes in the supply of and demand for oil and gas,\nmarket uncertainty and a variety of additional factors that are beyond our control. These factors include the level of consumer\ndemand, supplies of oil and natural gas, regional and international economic conditions, weather conditions, domestic and foreign\ngovernmental regulations (including those related to climate change), price and availability of alternative fuels, political conditions,\ninstability and hostilities in the Middle East and other significant oil-producing regions, increases and decreases in the supply of oil\nand gas, the effect of worldwide energy conservation measures and the ability of OPEC to set and maintain production levels and\nprices of foreign imports.\nSlowing economic growth in growing economies like those in China and India could lead to a decline in demand for crude oil\nand natural gas. Slowdowns in economic activity would likely reduce worldwide demand for energy and result in an extended period\nof lower crude oil and natural gas prices. Any material changes in oil and gas prices or other market trends that adversely impact\nseismic exploration activity would likely affect the demand for our products and could materially and adversely affect our results of\noperations and liquidity.\nGenerally imbalances in the supply and demand for oil and gas will affect oil and gas prices and, in such circumstances,\ndemand for our oil and gas products may be adversely affected when world supplies exceed demand.\nOur New Products Require a Substantial Investment by Us in Research and Development Expense and May Not Achieve Market\nAcceptance\nOur outlook and assumptions are based on various macro-economic factors and internal assessments, and actual market\nconditions could vary materially from those assumed. In recent years, we have incurred significant expenditures to fund our research\nand development efforts, and we intend to continue those expenditures in the future. However, research and development is by its\nnature speculative, and we cannot assure you that these expenditures will result in the development of new products or services or that\nany new products and services we have developed recently or may develop in the future will be commercially marketable or profitable\nto us. In particular, we have incurred substantial expenditures to develop our oil and gas nodal seismic data acquisition systems, as\nwell as other products for PRM applications. In addition, we try to use some of our capabilities to supply products to new adjacent\nand emerging markets. We cannot assure you that we will realize our expectations regarding acceptance of and revenue generated by\nour new products and services in existing or new markets.\nThe Short Term Nature of Our Order Backlog for our Oil and Gas Products and Delayed or Canceled Customer Orders May\nCause Us to Experience Fluctuations in Quarterly Results of Operations\nHistorically, the rate of new orders for our oil and gas products has varied substantially from quarter to quarter. Moreover,\nwe typically operate, and expect to continue operating, on the basis of orders in-hand for our products before we commence\nsubstantial manufacturing “runs.” The short-term nature of our order backlog for most of our oil and gas products generally does not\nallow us to predict with any accuracy demand for our products more than approximately three months in advance. Thus, our ability to\nreplenish orders and the completion of orders, particularly large orders for deep water PRM projects, can significantly impact our\noperating results and cash flow for any quarter, and results of operations for any one quarter may not be indicative of results of\noperations for future quarters.\nAdditionally, customers can delay or even cancel orders and rental contracts before product delivery occurs. For larger\norders which generally require us to make a substantial capital investment in our inventories or rental fleet, we attempt to negotiate for\na non-refundable deposit or cancellation penalties depending on our relationship with the customer. However, such deposits or\npenalties, even when obtained, may not fully compensate us for our inventory investment and forgone profits if the order is ultimately\ncancelled.\nThese periodic fluctuations in our operating results and the impact of any order delays/cancellations could adversely affect\nour stock price.\n7\nOur Credit Risk Could Increase and We May Incur Bad Debt Write-Offs If Our Customers Continue to Face Difficult Economic\nCircumstances\nWe believe that our allowance for bad debts is adequate in light of known circumstances. However, additional amounts\nattributable to uncollectible accounts and notes receivable and bad debt write-offs may have a material adverse effect on our future\nresults of operations. Many of our oil and gas customers are not well capitalized and as a result cannot always pay our invoices when\ndue. We have in the past incurred write-offs in our accounts and notes receivable due to customer credit problems. We have found it\nnecessary from time to time to extend trade credit, including promissory notes, to long-term customers and others where some risks of\nnon-payment exist. While we are now seeing increasing crude oil prices, many of our oil and gas customers continue to experience\nsignificant liquidity difficulties, which increase those credit risks. An increase in the level of bad debts and any deterioration in our\ncredit risk could adversely affect the price of our stock. In addition, we rent equipment to our oil and gas customers who utilize such\nequipment in various countries around the world. If these customers experience financial difficulties, it could be difficult or\nimpossible to retrieve our rental equipment from foreign countries.\nThe Industries in Which We Operate are Characterized by Rapid Technological Development and Product Obsolescence, Which\nMay Affect Our Ability to Provide Product Enhancements or New Products on a Timely and Cost Effective Basis\nOur instruments and equipment are constantly undergoing rapid technological improvement. Our future success depends on\nour ability to continue to:\n(cid:129) improve our existing product lines,\n(cid:129) address the increasingly sophisticated needs of our customers,\n(cid:129) maintain a reputation for technological leadership,\n(cid:129) maintain market acceptance of our products,\n(cid:129) anticipate changes in technology and industry standards,\n(cid:129) respond to technological developments on a timely basis and\n(cid:129) develop new markets for our products and capabilities.\nCurrent competitors or new market entrants may develop new technologies, products or standards that could render our\nproducts obsolete. We cannot assure you that we will be successful in developing and marketing, on a timely and cost effective basis,\nproduct enhancements or new products that respond to technological developments, that are accepted in the marketplace or that\ncomply with new industry standards. Additionally, in anticipation of customer product orders, from time to time we acquire\nsubstantial quantities of inventories, which if not sold or integrated into products within a reasonable period of time, could become\nobsolete. In such case, we would be required to impair the value of such inventories on our balance sheet.\nWe Operate in Highly Competitive Markets and Our Competitors May Be Able to Provide Newer or Better Products Than We Are\nAble to Provide\nThe markets for most of our products are highly competitive. Many of our existing and potential competitors have\nsubstantially greater marketing, financial and technical resources than we do. Some competitors currently offer a broader range of\ninstruments and equipment for sale than we do and may offer financing arrangements to customers on terms that we may not be able\nto match. In addition, new competitors may enter the market and competition could intensify.\nWe cannot assure you that revenue from our products will continue at current volumes or prices if current competitors or new\nmarket entrants introduce new products with better features, performance, price or other characteristics than our products.\nCompetitive pressures or other factors may also result in significant price competition that could have a material adverse effect on our\nresults of operations.\nThe Limited Market for Our Oil and Gas Markets and Emerging Markets Products Can Affect Our Revenue\nIn our Oil and Gas Markets segment, we generally market many of our products to seismic service contractors. We estimate\nthat fewer than 30 oil and gas seismic contracting companies are currently operating in countries other than those operating in the\nRussian Federation and the former Soviet Union, India, the People’s Republic of China and certain Eastern European countries, where\nsuch information is difficult to verify. We estimate that fewer than 15 seismic contractors are engaged in marine seismic exploration\nactivities. Due to these market factors, a relatively small number of customers, some of whom are experiencing financial difficulties,\naccount for most of our oil and gas product revenue. From time to time, these contractors have sought to vertically integrate and\nacquire our competitors, which has influenced their supplier decisions before and after such transactions. In addition, consolidation\n8\namong our customers may further concentrate our business to a limited number of customers and expose us to increased risks related\nto dependence on a small number of customers. We market our seabed PRM systems products to large oil and gas companies. Since\nthis product’s introduction in 2002, we have received system orders from three offshore oil and gas operators: BP, Shell and Statoil,\nwhich have accounted for a significant portion of our revenue in fiscal year 2014 and prior fiscal years. We did not deliver nor have\nwe received orders for any PRM systems since 2014. Our emerging markets segment currently sells its products to a small number of\nagencies within the United States government. The loss of a small number of these customers, and particularly our oil and gas\ncustomers, could materially and adversely impact our future revenues.\nWe Cannot Be Certain of the Effectiveness of Patent Protection on Our Products\nWe hold and from time to time apply for certain patents relating to some of our products. We cannot assure you that our\npatents will prove enforceable or free of challenge, that any patents will be issued for which we have applied or that competitors will\nnot develop functionally similar technology outside the protection of any patents we have or may obtain.\nOur Foreign Subsidiaries and Foreign Marketing Efforts Are Subject to Additional Political, Economic, Legal and Other\nUncertainties Not Generally Associated with Domestic Operations\nBased on customer billing data, revenue to customers outside the United States accounted for approximately 29% of our\nrevenue during fiscal year 2018; however, we believe the percentage of revenue outside the United States is likely higher since many\nof our products are first delivered to a domestic location and ultimately shipped to a foreign location. We again expect revenue\noutside of the United States to represent a substantial portion of our revenue for fiscal year 2019 and subsequent years.\nForeign revenue is subject to special risks inherent in doing business outside of the United States, including the risk of war,\nterrorist activities, civil disturbances, embargo and government activities, shifting foreign attitudes about conducting business\nactivities with the United States, restrictions of the movement and exchange of funds, inhibitions of our ability to collect accounts\nreceivable, international sanctions, expropriation and nationalization of our assets or those of our customers, currency fluctuations,\ndevaluations and conversion restrictions, confiscatory taxation or other adverse tax policies and governmental actions that may result\nin the deprivation of our contractual rights, all of which may disrupt markets or our operations.\nA portion of our oil and gas product manufacturing is conducted through our subsidiary Geospace Technologies Eurasia\nLLC, which is based in the Russian Federation. Our oil and gas business could be directly affected by political and economic\nconditions in the Russian Federation, including the current geopolitical instability involving the Russian Federation, Ukraine and\nSyria. United States sanctions against Russia have been expanded to preclude export of oil and gas equipment anywhere in the world\nthat involve persons designated under the sanctions and to include projects in which persons subject to the sanctions have a 33%\nownership interest. Together, these changes make it more difficult for us to support projects that have the potential to produce oil\ninvolving Russian energy companies. Furthermore, if an exporter is unable to determine whether its equipment will be used in such\nprojects, the export is prohibited. In fiscal year 2018, we imported $1.5 million of products from Geospace Technologies Eurasia LLC\nfor resale elsewhere in the world. If imports of these products from the Russian Federation are restricted by government regulation,\nwe may be forced to find other sources for the manufacture of these products at potentially higher costs. Boycotts, protests,\nunfavorable regulations, additional governmental sanctions and other actions in the region could also adversely affect our ability to\noperate profitably. Delays in obtaining governmental approvals can affect our ability to timely deliver our products pursuant to\ncontractual obligations, which could result in us being liable to our customers for damages. The risk of doing business in the Russian\nFederation and other economically or politically volatile areas could adversely affect our operations and earnings.\nForeign revenue is also generally subject to the risk of compliance with additional laws, including tariff regulations and\nimport and export restrictions. International revenue transactions for our products containing hydrophones require prior U.S.\ngovernment approval in the form of an export license, which may be withheld by the U.S. government based upon factors which we\ncannot predict.\nWe may experience difficulties in connection with future foreign revenue. Additionally, due to foreign laws and restrictions,\nshould we experience substantial growth in certain foreign markets, for example in the Russian Federation, we may not be able to\ntransfer cash balances to the United States to assist with debt servicing or other obligations.\nIncreases in Tariffs, Trade Restrictions or Taxes on our Products Could Have an Adverse Impact on our Operations.\nIn fiscal year 2018, customers outside the United States accounted for 29% of our revenues. We also purchase a portion of\nour raw materials from suppliers in China and other foreign countries. The commerce we conduct in the international marketplace\nmakes us subject to tariffs, trade restrictions and other taxes when the raw materials we purchase, and the products we ship, cross\ninternational borders. Trade tensions between the United States and China, as well as those between the U.S. and Canada, Mexico and\nother countries have been escalating in recent months. Most notably, three rounds of U.S. tariffs were placed on Chinese goods being\nexported to the U.S., with such tariffs taking effect in July, August and September 2018. Each of these U.S. tariff impositions against\n9\nChinese exports were followed by a round of retaliatory Chinese tariffs on U.S. exports to China. We believe that certain raw\nmaterials we purchase from China could become subject to these tariffs which could increase our manufacturing costs. Products we\nsell into certain foreign markets could also become subject to similar retaliatory tariffs, making the products we sell uncompetitive to\nsimilar products not subjected to such import tariffs. Further changes in U.S. trade policies, tariffs, taxes, export restrictions or other\ntrade barriers, or restrictions on raw materials including rare earth minerals, may limit our ability to produce products, increase our\nmanufacturing costs, decrease our profit margins, reduce the competitiveness of our products, or inhibit our ability to sell products or\npurchase raw materials, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial conditions.\nOur Global Operations Expose Us to Risks Associated with Conducting Business Internationally, Including Failure to Comply\nwith U.S. Laws Which Apply to International Operations, Such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and U.S. Export Control\nLaws, as well as the Laws of Other Countries\nWe have offices in Colombia, Canada, China, the Russian Federation and the United Kingdom, in addition to our offices in\nthe United States. In addition to the risks noted above that are inherent in conducting business internationally, we are also liable for\ncompliance with international and U.S. laws and regulations that apply to our international operations. These laws and regulations\ninclude data privacy requirements, labor relations laws, tax laws, anti-competition regulations, import and trade restrictions, export\ncontrol laws, U.S. laws such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar laws in other countries which also prohibit certain\npayments to governmental officials or certain payments or remunerations to customers. Many of our products are subject to U.S.\nexport law restrictions that limit the destinations and types of customers to which our products may be sold, or require an export\nlicense in connection with revenue transactions outside the United States. Given the high level of complexity of these laws, there is a\nrisk that some provisions may be inadvertently breached, for example through the negligent or the unauthorized intentional behavior\nof individual employees, our failure to comply with certain formal documentation requirements or otherwise. Additionally, we may\nbe held liable for actions taken by our local dealers and partners. Violations of these laws and regulations could result in fines,\ncriminal sanctions against us, our officers or our employees, and prohibitions on the conduct of our business. Any such violations\ncould include prohibitions on our ability to offer our products in one or more countries and could materially damage our reputation,\nour brands, our international expansion efforts, our ability to attract and retain employees, our business and our operating results.\nOur Strategy of Renting our Oil and Gas Seismic Products Exposes Us to Additional Risks Relating to Equipment Recovery,\nRental Renewals, Technological Obsolescence and Impairment of Assets\nOur rental fleet of oil and gas equipment represents a significant portion of our assets and accounts for a growing portion of\nour revenue. Equipment we rent to our customers is frequently located in foreign countries where retrieval of the equipment after the\ntermination of the rental agreement is difficult or impossible if the customer does not return the equipment. The costs associated with\nretrieving this equipment or the loss of equipment that is not retrieved could be significant and could adversely affect our operations\nand earnings.\nThe advancement of seismic technology having a significant competitive advantage over the equipment in our rental fleet\ncould have an adverse effect on our ability to profitably rent and/or sell this equipment. Significant improvements in technology may\nalso require us to record asset impairment charges to write-down the value of our rental fleet investment and to invest significant sums\nto upgrade or replace our rental fleet with newer equipment demanded by our customers. In addition, rental contracts may not be\nrenewed for equipment in our rental fleet. Significant technology improvements by our competitors could have an adverse effect on\nour results of operations and earnings.\nOur equipment rental business has high fixed costs, which primarily consist of depreciation expenses. In periods of declining\nrental revenue, these fixed costs generally do not decline. As a result, any significant decline in rental revenue caused by reduced\ndemand could adversely affect our results of operations.\nOur Expansion Into the Border and Perimeter Security Market May Not Be Successful\nWe have not previously operated in the border and perimeter security marketplace. Quantum is also a relatively recent\nentrant into this marketplace, and Quantum was not cash-flow positive when we acquired it. We will devote management time and\nresources, financial and otherwise, to develop our business in this marketplace. Our lack of experience and success up to this point in\nthis market makes it difficult to estimate our financial returns, if any, from this business. In addition, some of the customers for this\nbusiness will be governmental entities and contracting with those entities can be difficult, costly, and unpredictable. We do not have\nextensive experience in government contracting, and so we may not win, retain, or perform under such contracts in a manner that is\nprofitable. If we are not successful in this emerging market segment, it will negatively impact our financial performance and could\nnegatively impact our reputation and harm our other business segments.\n10\nCybersecurity Breaches and Other Disruptions of Our Information Technology Network and Systems Could Adversely Affect Our\nBusiness\nWe rely on information technology networks and systems, some of which are owned and operated by third parties, to process,\ntransmit and store electronic information. In particular, we depend on our information technology infrastructure for a variety of\nfunctions, including worldwide financial reporting, inventory management, procurement, invoicing and email communications. Any\nof these systems may be susceptible to outages due to fire, floods, power loss, telecommunications failures, terrorist attacks and\nsimilar events. Despite the implementation of network security measures, our systems and those of third parties on which we rely may\nalso be vulnerable to computer viruses, break-ins, malware and similar disruptions. Malware, if surreptitiously installed on our\nsystems and not timely detected and removed, could collect and disclose sensitive information relating to our customers, employees or\nothers, exposing us to legal liability and causing us to suffer reputational damage. It could also lead to disruptions in critical systems\nor the corruption or destruction of critical data. If we are unable to prevent such outages and breaches, these events could damage our\nreputation and lead to financial losses from remedial actions, loss of business or potential liability.\nBecause We Have No Plans to Pay Any Dividends for the Foreseeable Future, Investors Must Look Solely to Stock Appreciation\nfor a Return on Their Investment in Us\nWe have not paid cash dividends on our common stock since our incorporation and do not anticipate paying any cash\ndividends in the foreseeable future. We currently intend to retain any future earnings to support our operations and growth. Any\npayment of cash dividends in the future will be dependent on the amount of funds legally available, our financial condition, capital\nrequirements, loan covenants and other factors that our Board of Directors may deem relevant. Accordingly, investors must rely on\nsales of their common stock after price appreciation, which may never occur, as the only way to realize any future gains on their\ninvestment.\nUnfavorable Currency Exchange Rate Fluctuations Could Adversely Affect Our Results of Operations\nSubstantially all of our third-party revenue from the United States is invoiced in U.S. dollars, though from time to time we\nmay invoice revenue transactions in foreign currencies including intercompany sales. As a result, we may be subject to foreign\ncurrency fluctuations on our revenue. The reporting currency for our financial statements is the U.S. dollar. However, the assets,\nliabilities, revenue and costs of our Russian, Canadian and United Kingdom subsidiaries and our Chinese and Colombian branch\noffices are denominated in currencies other than U.S. dollars. To prepare our consolidated financial statements, we must translate\nthose assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses into U.S. dollars at then-applicable exchange rates. Consequently, increases and\ndecreases in the value of the U.S. dollar versus these other currencies will affect the amount of these items in our consolidated\nfinancial statements, even if their value has not changed in their original currency. These translations could result in significant\nchanges to our results of operations from period to period. For the fiscal year ended September 30, 2018, approximately 18.1% of our\nconsolidated revenue related to the operations of our foreign subsidiaries and branches.\nWe Have a Relatively Small Public Float, and Our Stock Price May be Volatile\nAt September 30, 2018, we have approximately 13.0 million shares outstanding held by non-affiliates. This limited number\nof shares outstanding results in a relatively limited market for our common stock. Our daily trading volume for the year ended\nSeptember 30, 2018 averaged approximately 80,000 shares. Our small float and daily trading volumes have in the past caused, and\nmay in the future result in, significant volatility in our stock price.\nWe Rely on Key Suppliers for Certain Components Used in Our Products\nCertain models of our oil and gas marine wireless products require a timing device we purchase from a United States\nmanufacturer. We currently do not possess the ability to manufacture this component and have no other reliable source for this\ndevice. If this manufacturer were to discontinue its production of this timing device, were to become unwilling to contract with us on\ncompetitive terms or were unable to supply the component in sufficient quantities to meet our requirements, our ability to compete in\nthe marine wireless marketplace could be impaired, which could adversely affect our financial performance.\nFor our imaging products, we purchase all of our thermal film from a European manufacturer. Except for the film sold to us\nby this manufacturer, we know of no other source for thermal film that performs as well in our imaging equipment. If the European\nmanufacturer were to discontinue producing thermal film, were to become unwilling to contract with us on competitive terms or were\nunable to supply thermal film in sufficient quantities to meet our requirements, our ability to compete in the direct thermal imaging\nmarketplace could be impaired, which could adversely affect our financial performance.\n11\nOur Success Depends Upon a Limited Number of Key Personnel\nOur success depends on attracting and retaining highly skilled professionals. A number of our employees are highly skilled\nengineers and other professionals. In addition, our success depends to a significant extent upon the abilities and efforts of the\nmembers of our senior management team. If we fail to continue to attract and retain such professionals, our ability to compete in the\nindustry could be adversely affected.\nA Continued General Downturn in the Economy in Future Periods May Adversely Affect Our Business\nSlowing growth in China and India and any other economic slowdown in future periods, could adversely affect our business\nin ways that we cannot predict. During times of economic slowdown, our customers may reduce their capital expenditures and defer\nor cancel pending projects and product orders. Such developments occur even among customers that are not experiencing financial\ndifficulties. Any economic downturn may adversely affect the demand for oil and gas generally or cause volatility in oil and gas\ncommodity prices and, therefore, adversely affect the demand for delivery of our oil and gas products. It could also adversely affect\nthe demand for consumer and industrial products, which could in turn adversely affect our Adjacent Markets business segment. To\nthe extent these factors adversely affect other companies in the industries we serve, there could be an oversupply of products and\nservices and downward pressure on pricing for our products and services, which could adversely affect us. Additionally, bankruptcies\nor financial difficulties among our oil and gas customers could reduce our cash flows and adversely impact our liquidity and\nprofitability. See “The Limited Market for Our Oil and Gas Products Can Affect Our Revenue,” above.\nWe Have a Minimal Disaster Recovery Program at Our Houston Facilities\nDue to its proximity to the Texas Gulf Coast, our facilities in Houston, Texas are annually subject to the threat of hurricanes,\nand the aftermath that follows. Hurricanes may cause, among other types of damage, the loss of electrical power for extended periods\nof time. If we lost electrical power at our Pinemont facility, or if a fire or other natural disaster occurred, we would be unable to\ncontinue our manufacturing operations during the power outage because we do not own a generator or any other back-up power source\nlarge enough to provide for our manufacturing power consumption needs. Additionally, we do not have an alternative manufacturing\nor operating location in the United States. Therefore, a significant disruption in our manufacturing operations could materially and\nadversely affect our business operations during an extended period of a power outage, fire or other natural disaster. We have a back-\nup generator to provide power for our information technology operations. We store our back-up data offsite and we replicate our\nmission critical data to an alternative cloud-based data center on a real-time basis. In the event of a major service interruption in our\ndata center, we believe we would be able to activate our mission critical applications within less than 24 hours.\nOur Credit Agreement Imposes Restrictions on Our Business\nWe and several of our subsidiaries are parties to a credit agreement with a bank. Amounts available for borrowing under the\ncredit agreement are determined by a borrowing base, which is determined based upon the book value of certain of our assets. The\ncredit agreement limits the incurrence of additional indebtedness, requires the maintenance of a single financial ratio that compares\ncertain of our and our U.S. subsidiaries’ assets to certain of our liabilities, restricts our and our U.S. subsidiaries’ ability to pay cash\ndividends and contains other covenants customary in agreements of this type. Our ability to comply with these restrictions may be\naffected by events beyond our control, including, but not limited to, prevailing economic, financial and industry conditions and\ncontinuing declines in our product revenue. The breach of any of these covenants or restrictions, as well as any failure to make a\npayment of interest or principal when due, could result in a default under the credit agreement. Such a default would permit our\nlender to declare any amounts borrowed from it to be due and payable, together with accrued and unpaid interest, and the ability to\nborrow under the credit agreement could be terminated. If we are unable to repay any debts owed to our lender, the lender could\nproceed against the collateral securing that debt. While we intend to seek alternative sources of cash in such a situation, there is no\nguarantee that any alternative cash source would be available or would be available on terms favorable to us.\nReliance on Third Party Subcontractors Could Adversely Affect Our Results of Operations and Reputation\nWe may rely on subcontractors to complete certain projects. The quality and timing of production and services by our\nsubcontractors is not totally under our control. Reliance on subcontractors gives us less control over a project and exposes us to\nsignificant risks, including late delivery, substandard quality and high costs. The failure of our subcontractors to deliver quality\nproducts or services in a timely manner could adversely affect our profitability and reputation.\n12\nThe High Fixed Costs of Our Operations Could Adversely Affect Our Results of Operations\nWe have a high fixed cost structure primarily consisting of (i) depreciation expenses associated with our rental equipment\nand (ii) fixed manufacturing costs including salaries and benefits, taxes, insurance, maintenance, depreciation and other fixed\nmanufacturing costs. In regards to our rental equipment, large declines in the demand for rental equipment could result in substantial\noperating losses due to the on-going fixed nature of rental equipment depreciation expense. Concerning our product manufacturing\ncosts, in periods of low product demand our fixed costs generally do not decline or may decline only in modest increments. Therefore\nlower demand for our rental equipment and manufactured products could adversely affect our results of operations.\nOur Long-Lived Assets May be Subject to Impairment\nWe periodically assess our long-lived assets for impairment. Significant sustained future decreases in crude oil and natural\ngas prices may require us to write down the value of our long-lived assets in our Oil and Gas Markets business segment, including our\nmanufacturing facilities, manufacturing equipment and rental equipment if future cash flows anticipated to be generated from these\nassets fall below the asset’s net book value. Furthermore, we may be required to write down the value of goodwill and other\nintangible assets if our acquisition of Quantum does not generate sufficient cash flows to recover the carrying value of such assets. If\nwe are forced to write down the value of our long-lived assets, these noncash asset impairments could adversely affect our results of\noperations.\nShould We Fail to Maintain an Effective System of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting, We May Not Be Able to Accurately\nReport Our Financial Results and Prevent Material Fraud, Which Could Adversely Affect the Value of Our Common Stock\nEffective internal control over financial reporting is necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports and effectively\nprevent and detect material fraud. If we cannot provide reliable financial reports or prevent or detect material fraud, our operating\nresults could be misstated. There can be no assurances that we will be able to prevent control deficiencies from occurring and which\ncould cause us to incur unforeseen costs, negatively impact our results of operations, cause the market price of our common stock to\ndecline, or have other potential adverse consequences.\nItem 1B.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following is management’s discussion and analysis of the major elements of our consolidated financial statements. You\nshould read this discussion and analysis together with our consolidated financial statements, including the accompanying notes, and\nother detailed information appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including under the heading “Risk Factors.” The\ndiscussion of our financial condition and results of operations includes various forward-looking statements about our markets, the\ndemand for our products and services and our future plans and results. These statements are based on assumptions that we consider to\nbe reasonable, but that could prove to be incorrect. For more information regarding our assumptions, you should refer to the section\nentitled “Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements and Assumptions” below.\nCautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements and Assumptions\nThis Annual Report on Form 10-K and the documents incorporated by reference herein, if any, contain “forward-looking”\nstatements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange\nAct of 1934, as amended. These forward-looking statements can be identified by terminology such as “may”, “will”, “should”,\n“intend”, “expect”, “plan”, “budget”, “forecast”, “anticipate”, “believe”, “estimate”, “predict”, “potential”, “continue”, “evaluating” or\nsimilar words. Statements that contain these words should be read carefully because they discuss our future expectations, contain\nprojections of our future results of operations or of our financial position or state other forward-looking information. Examples of\nforward-looking statements include, among others, statements that we make regarding our expected operating results, the results and\nsuccess of our transactions with Quantum and the OptoSeis® technology, the adoption and sale of our products in various geographic\nregions, anticipated levels of capital expenditures and the sources of funding therefore, and our strategy for growth, product\ndevelopment, market position, financial results and the provision of accounting reserves. These forward-looking statements reflect\nour current judgment about future events and trends based on the information currently available to us. However, there will likely be\nevents in the future that we are not able to predict or control. The factors listed under the caption “Risk Factors”, as well as cautionary\nlanguage in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, provide examples of risks, uncertainties and events that may cause our actual results to\ndiffer materially from the expectations we describe in our forward-looking statements. Such examples include, but are not limited to,\nthe failure of the Quantum or OptoSeis® technology transactions to yield positive operating results, decreases in commodity price\nlevels, which could reduce demand for our products, the failure of our products to achieve market acceptance, despite substandital\ninvestment by us, our sensitivity to short term backlog, delayed or cancelled customer orders, product obsolescence resulting from\npoor industry conditions or new technologies, bad debt write-offs associated with customer accounts, lack of further orders for our\nOBX systems, failure of our Quantum products to be adopted by the border and perimeter security markets, infringement or failure to\nprotect intellectual property, the failure of the acquisition transaction to yield positive results, and any negative impact from our\nrestatement of our financial statements regarding current assets. The occurrence of the events described in these risk factors and\nelsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and\nfinancial position, and actual events and results of operations may vary materially from our current expectations. We assume no\nobligation to revise or update any forward-looking statement, whether written or oral, that we may make from time to time, whether as\na result of new information, future developments or otherwise.\nBackground\nWe design and manufacture seismic instruments and equipment and primarily market these products to the oil and gas\nindustry to locate, characterize and monitor hydrocarbon producing reservoirs. We also market our seismic products to other\nindustries for vibration monitoring, border and perimeter security and various geotechnical applications. We design and manufacture\nother products of a non-seismic nature, including water meter products, imaging equipment and offshore cables. See the information\nunder the heading “Business” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nConsolidated Results of Operations\nAs we have reported in the past, our revenue and operating profits have varied significantly from quarter-to-quarter, and even\nyear-to-year, and are expected to continue that trend in the future, especially when our quarterly or annual financial results are\nimpacted by the presence or absence of relatively large, but somewhat erratic, sales of our oil and gas PRM systems and/or wireless\nseismic data acquisition systems for land and marine applications.\nOur revenue and results of operations have not been materially impacted by inflation or changing prices in the past three\nfiscal years.\n18\nWe report and evaluate financial information for three segments: Oil and Gas Markets, Adjacent Markets and Emerging\nMarkets.

During this period oil production in North America’s unconventional shale reservoirs increased, as did oil\nproduction from other non-OPEC countries, resulting in an oversupply of crude oil in the world market. Market prices for a barrel of\nWTI crude oil declined from over $100 in July 2014 to approximately $26 in February 2016, and have recovered to approximately $56\ntoday. With this decline in oil prices, oil and gas exploration and production companies experienced a significant reduction in cash\nflows, which resulted in sharp reductions in their capital spending budgets for oil and gas exploration-focused activities, including\nseismic data acquisition activities. While we are now seeing some signs of increased seismic activity around the world, the need for\nnew seismic equipment remains restrained due to capital limitations affecting many of our customers along with excess levels of\nunutilized equipment. While we are seeing significant demand for the rental of our marine wireless seismic products, we expect\nrevenue from the sale of our land-based seismic products, and in particular our traditional and wireless products, to remain low until\nexploration-focused seismic activities increase due to the ongoing depletion of existing reservoirs prompting the need to find new\nsources of oil and gas. We expect these challenging industry conditions will continue in fiscal year 2019.\nIn September 2017, Statoil requested quotes for two new PRM systems which were required to utilize fiber optic sensor\ntechnology. Since our PRM designs utilize electrical sensor technology, we were not invited to participate with a quotation for the\ndesign and manufacture of these PRM systems. This contract was subsequently awarded to Alcatel in January 2018. The technology\ndirection taken by Statoil, combined with the absence of any new PRM orders of any technology type since November 2012, caused\nus to record $5.1 million of obsolescence reserves and $5.3 million of impairment reserves in September 2017 related to our PRM\ninventories and related manufacturing equipment, respectively. On November 13, 2018, we announced our acquisition of all the\nintellectual property and related assets of the OptoSeis® fiber optic sensing technology business from PGS Americas, Inc. With this\ntechnology, we now offer both electrical and fiber optic sensing technologies.\nIn December 2017, we initiated a program to reduce operating costs in light of expected and continuing low levels of oil and\ngas product demand. The program is expected to produce approximately $6 million of annualized cash savings. The majority of the\nfuture cost reductions were realized through the reduction of over 60 employees from our Houston area workforce. In connection with\nthe workforce reductions, we incurred $0.7 million of termination costs in our first quarter of fiscal year 2018. The termination costs\nwere recorded to both cost of revenue and operating expenses in the consolidated statement of operations. No further termination\ncosts are expected and there are no outstanding liabilities related to this program as of September 30, 2018.\n19\nFiscal Year 2018 Compared to Fiscal Year 2017\nConsolidated revenue for fiscal year 2018 increased $2.0 million, or 2.7%, from fiscal year 2017. The increase in revenue for\nfiscal year 2018 was primarily due to an increase in our Adjacent Markets product revenue.\nConsolidated gross profit for fiscal year 2018 was $11.0 million, compared to a loss of ($20.7) million for fiscal year 2017.\nThe improvement in gross profit (loss) resulted from (i) an $8.2 million increase in rental revenue combined with a $2.4 million\ndecline in depreciation expense associated with rental equipment, (ii) a $17.1 million decrease in inventory obsolescence expense, and\n(iii) a reduction in fixed manufacturing costs primarily resulting from workforce reductions occurring in the first quarter of fiscal year\n2018. Since fiscal year 2014, reduced demand for the sale of our oil and gas products has caused our factory to be under-utilized.\nUntil demand increases significantly for these products, we expect our consolidated gross margins for our oil and gas products to\nremain below historic norms.\nIn light of current market conditions, our oil and gas product inventories at September 30, 2018 continue to exceed levels\nconsidered appropriate for the current level of product demand. While we are aggressively working to reduce these legacy inventory\nbalances, we are also adding new inventories for recent product developments and other product demand. During periods of excessive\ninventory levels, our policy has been, and will continue to be, to record obsolescence expense in our consolidated income statement as\nwe experience reduced levels of inventory turnover and as our inventories continue to age. If difficult market conditions continue for\nour oil and gas products, we expect to record additional inventory obsolescence expense in fiscal year 2019 and beyond until product\ndemand and resulting inventory turnover returns to acceptable levels.\nConsolidated operating expenses for fiscal year 2018 were $31.7 million, a decrease of $1.9 million, or 5.7%, from the\ncorresponding period of the prior fiscal year. The decrease in operating expenses was primarily due to lower stock-based\ncompensation expense, workforce reductions and a decline in research and development project costs. The decrease was partially\noffset by an increase in bad debt expense and $0.8 million of additional operating expenses resulting from the Quantum acquisition,\nincluding intangible asset amortization expense of $0.2 million.\nConsolidated other income for fiscal year 2018 was $1.0 million, compared to $0.2 million from fiscal year 2017. The\nincrease in other income was primarily due to an increase in interest income on a financing receivable entered into in June 2017 and\nan increase in net foreign exchange gains, partially offset by an increase in foreign currency hedge financing fees.\nConsolidated income tax expense (benefit) for fiscal year was $(0.6) million compared to $2.7 million for fiscal year 2017.\nOur effective tax rates for fiscal year 2018 and 2017 were 2.9% and (5.0)%, respectively. The United States statutory tax rate for\nfiscal year 2018 and 2017 were 24.5% (blended) and 35%, respectively. Compared to the United States statutory rate, the lower\neffective tax rates for fiscal year 2018 and 2017 primarily resulted from our inability to recognize any tax benefits for the tax losses\nwe incurred in the U.S. and Canada due to the uncertainty surrounding our ability to utilize these losses in the future to offset taxable\nincome. For fiscal year 2017, we recorded tax expenses for (i) U.S. income taxes paid in prior years resulting from the sale of rental\nequipment to our foreign subsidiaries and (ii) the recognition of a valuation allowance against foreign taxes withheld from rental\nrevenues invoiced into foreign taxing jurisdiction. In addition, for fiscal year 2018, the Company amended its prior year U.S. tax\nreturn and received a $0.7 million refund.\nFiscal Year 2017 Compared to Fiscal Year 2016\nConsolidated revenue for fiscal year 2017 increased $11.7 million, or 18.8% from fiscal year 2016. The increase in revenue\nfor fiscal year 2017 was primarily due to an increase in revenue from our seismic business segment, driven by an increase in demand\nfor our wireless exploration products, including the sale of 45,000 GSX channels in our fourth quarter.\nConsolidated gross profit (loss) for fiscal year 2017 was a loss of ($20.7) million, compared to a loss of ($19.4) million for\nfiscal year 2016. The decline in gross profit (loss) for fiscal year 2017 was primarily due to a $10.3 million increase in inventory\nobsolescence expenses and a $5.3 million increase in equipment impairment charges. The decline was partially offset by an increase\nin wireless exploration product sales and, to a lesser extent, a decrease in manufacturing costs resulting from the Company’s\nworkforce reduction in the second fiscal quarter of 2016.\nConsolidated operating expenses for fiscal year 2017 were $33.6 million, a decrease of $2.5 million, or 6.9%, from fiscal\nyear 2016. This decrease was primarily attributable to the Company’s cost reduction program implemented during the second fiscal\nquarter of 2016 and, to a lesser extent, a decrease in bad debt expense.\nConsolidated other income for fiscal year 2017 was flat from fiscal year 2016. An increase in interest income from our short-\nterm investments and notes receivable was offset by an increase in foreign exchange losses attributable to U.S. dollar deposits held by\nour Russian subsidiary.\n20\nConsolidated income tax expense (benefit) for fiscal year 2017 was $2.7 million compared to ($9.4) million for the\ncorresponding period of the prior fiscal year. Our effective tax rates for fiscal year 2017 and 2016 were 5.0% and (16.9)%,\nrespectively. The United States statutory tax rate for the same periods was 35%. Compared to the United States statutory rate, the\nlower effective tax rates for fiscal year 2017 resulted from our inability to recognize any tax benefits for the tax losses we incurred in\nthe U.S. and Canada due to the uncertainty surrounding our ability to utilize these losses in the future to offset taxable income. In\naddition, for fiscal year 2017, we recorded tax expenses for (i) U.S. income taxes paid in prior years resulting from the sale of rental\nequipment to our foreign subsidiaries and (ii) the recognition of a valuation allowance against foreign taxes withheld from rental\nrevenues invoiced into foreign taxing jurisdiction. For fiscal year 2016, the lower effective tax rate resulted primarily from our\ninability to recognize tax benefits for the tax losses we incurred in the U.S. and Canada due to the uncertainty of their utilization;\nhowever, we were able to recognize an income tax benefit of $13.1 million related to our ability to carryback certain U.S. tax losses to\nobtain a refund of taxes paid in previous years.\nSegment Results of Operations\nOil and Gas Markets\nFiscal Year 2018 Compared to Fiscal Year 2017\nRevenue\nRevenue from our oil and gas products for fiscal year 2018 decreased $2.2 million, or 4.6%, from the prior fiscal year. The\ncomponents of this decrease include the following:\n(cid:129) Traditional Exploration Product Revenue – Revenue from our traditional products decreased $1.9 million, or 12.9%\nfrom the prior fiscal year. The decrease primarily reflects lower demand for our specialty sensor products.\n(cid:129) Wireless Exploration Product Revenue – Revenue from our wireless exploration products decreased $2.4 million, or\n8.2%, from the prior fiscal year. This decrease was primarily due to lower OBX product sales, partially offset by an\nincrease in both OBX and GSX wireless rental revenue.\n(cid:129) Reservoir Product Revenue – Revenue from our reservoir products increased $2.2 million, or 81.8%, from the prior\nfiscal year. The increase primarily reflects revenue received from the sale of borehole tools from our rental fleet and\nhigher service revenue.\nOperating Loss\nOur operating loss associated with our Oil and Gas products for fiscal year 2018 decreased $32.8 million, or 70.0%, from the\nprior year. The reduction in our operating loss resulted from (i) an $8.2 million increase in rental revenue combined with a $2.4\nmillion decline in depreciation expense associated with rental equipment, (ii) a $17.1 million decrease in inventory obsolescence\nexpense, and (iii) a reduction in manufacturing and operating expenses primarily resulting from workforce reductions occurring in the\nfirst quarter of fiscal year 2018. Since fiscal year 2014, reduced demand for the sale of our oil and gas products has caused our factory\nto be under-utilized. Until demand increases significantly for these products, we expect our operating margins for our oil and gas\nproducts to remain below historic norms.\nFiscal Year 2017 Compared to Fiscal Year 2016\nRevenue\nRevenue from our Oil and Gas products for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2017 increased $13.3 million, or 39.4%,\nfrom the prior fiscal year. The components of this increase include the following:\n(cid:129) Traditional Exploration Product Revenue – Revenue from our traditional products increased $1.5 million, or 11.0% from\nthe prior fiscal year. The increase primarily reflects higher demand for our geophone products, primarily in connection\nwith the sale from our rental fleet of a GSX wireless system in our fourth quarter.\n(cid:129) Wireless Exploration Product Revenue – Revenue from our wireless exploration products increased by $11.3 million, or\n61.4%, from the prior fiscal year. The increase was primarily due to higher demand for the sale of our OBX and GSX\nproducts and included the fourth quarter sale of 45,000 GSX channels from our rental fleet. This increase in revenue was\npartially offset by a decrease in OBX rental revenue.\n(cid:129) Reservoir Product Revenue – Revenue from our reservoir products increased $0.6 million, or 27.2%, from the prior\nfiscal year. The increase was primarily due to higher demand for our borehole products and reservoir monitoring\nservices.\n21\nOperating Loss\nOur operating loss from our Oil and Gas products for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2017 decreased $0.8 million, or\n1.7%, from the prior year. The decrease in operating loss for fiscal year 2017 was primarily due to (i) increased wireless exploration\nproduct sales and (ii) lower manufacturing and operating costs due to workforce reductions initiated in the second fiscal quarter of\n2016. This decrease was partially offset by an increase of $10.3 million in inventory obsolescence expense and $5.3 million in\nimpairment charges on PRM manufacturing equipment.\nAdjacent Markets\nFiscal Year 2018 Compared to Fiscal Year 2017\nRevenue\nRevenue from our Adjacent Markets products for fiscal year 2018 increased $3.9 million, or 15.0%, from the prior fiscal\nyear. The components of these increases included the following:\n(cid:129) Industrial Product Revenue and Services – Revenue from our industrial products increased $3.9 million, or 27.3% from\nthe prior fiscal year. The increase was primarily attributable to higher demand for our water meter products as well as\nhigher revenue contributions from our contract manufacturing services.\n(cid:129) Imaging Product Revenue – Revenue from our imaging products decreased $27,000, or 0.2%, from the prior fiscal year.\nWe consider this small change in revenue to be normal and not indicative of any particular trend in product demand.\nOperating Income\nOur operating income from our Adjacent Markets products for fiscal year 2018 increased $1.2 million, or 28.7%, from the\nprior fiscal year. The improvement in operating income resulted from increased gross profits realized on higher industrial product\nrevenue and from decreased segment operating expenses.\nFiscal Year 2017 Compared to Fiscal Year 2016\nRevenue\nRevenue from our Adjacent Markets products for the year ended September 30, 2017 decreased $1.7 million, or 6.1%, from\nfiscal year 2016. The components of this decrease included the following:\n(cid:129) Industrial Product Revenue and Services – Revenue from our industrial products decreased $1.8 million, or 11.1% from\nthe corresponding period of the prior fiscal year. The decrease was primarily attributable to lower demand for our water\nmeter products.\n(cid:129) Imaging Product Revenue – Revenue from our imaging products increased $0.1 million, or 1.1%, from the\ncorresponding period of the prior fiscal year. We consider this small change in annual revenue to be normal and not\nindicative of any particular trend in product demand.\nOperating Income\nOur operating income associated with sales of our Adjacent Markets products for the year ended September 30, 2017\nincreased by $0.1 million, or 1.4% from fiscal year 2016. The increase in operating income was primarily driven by price increases\nand manufacturing efficiencies.\nEmerging Markets\nOn July 27, 2018, we entered the border and perimeter security market through our acquisition of Quantum. In connection\nwith the Quantum acquisition, we established the Emerging Markets business segment, which currently includes only Quantum.\nRevenue from our Emerging Markets products for the period July 27, 2018 through September 30, 2018 was $0.3 million. Our\noperating loss for the same period was $0.7 million, including $0.2 million of intangible asset amortization expense.\n22\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nFiscal Year 2018\nAt September 30, 2018, we had approximately $11.9 million in cash and cash equivalents and $25.5 million in short-term\ninvestments. For the fiscal year ended September 30, 2018, we used $10.4 million of cash in operating activities. In addition to our\nnet loss of $19.2 million, we incurred other uses of cash in our operations including (i) a $5.1 million increase in trade accounts\nreceivable resulting from the timing of collections from customers, (ii) a $4.3 million increase in inventories for the production of\nOBX products and recently introduced land-based wireless seismic products and (iii) the removal of a $6.8 million gross profit from\nthe sale of used rental equipment since such gross profit is reflected in the proceeds from the sale of used rental equipment under\ninvesting activities. These uses of cash were offset by (i) net non-cash charges of $22.7 million from deferred income taxes,\ndepreciation, amortization, impairment, accretion, inventory obsolescence, stock-based compensation and bad debt expense, (ii) a $1.3\nmillion increase in accounts payable associated with inventory purchases and the timing of payments to suppliers, (iii) a $3.1 million\nincrease in deferred revenue due to the receipt from customers of deposits for rental contracts and (iv) an increase of $1.0 million in\naccrued and other expenses.\nFor the fiscal year ended September 30, 2018, we generated cash of $7.8 million from investing activities. Sources of cash\nincluded (i) $10.5 million of net proceeds from the sale of short-term investments, (ii) $9.9 million of proceeds from the sale of rental\nequipment and (iii) $2.1 million in insurance proceeds and claims receivable related to a property insurance claim. These sources of\ncash were partially offset by (i) a down payment of $4.4 million for the Quantum acquisition, (ii) $6.5 million to expand our rental\nfleet, (iii) $1.7 million for additions to our property, plant and equipment and (iv) $2.4 million in payments for damages related to the\ninsurance claim. As a result of significant demand for our marine OBX rental equipment, we expect fiscal year 2019 cash investments\ninto our rental fleet to be $30 million or more. We estimate total fiscal year 2019 cash investments in property, plant and equipment\nwill be approximately $3 million. Our capital expenditures are expected to be funded from our cash on hand, internal cash flows, cash\nflows from our rental contracts or, if necessary, from borrowings under our credit agreement.\nFor the fiscal year ended September 30, 2018, we generated cash proceeds of $63,000 from financing activities from the\nexercise of stock options by our employees. We had no long-term debt outstanding throughout the fiscal year ended September 30,\n2018.\nRecently, crude oil prices increased to their highest level in three years, although the current price level of crude oil remains\nsignificantly below the peak price levels seen in 2014. OPEC and other crude oil producing/exporting nations appear united in their\nefforts to maintain equilibrium between current worldwide crude oil supply and demand and these efforts have been successful in\nreducing the glut of crude oil in storage around the world. If these efforts to maintain an economic equilibrium in worldwide crude oil\nsupplies are successful, crude oil prices may stabilize or possibly drift higher. These factors and developing trends bode well for the\noil and gas industry and we expect to participate in any resurgence in demand for new seismic equipment that may be forthcoming.\nWhile we are seeing some signs of increased seismic activity around the world, the need for new seismic equipment remains\nrestrained due to capital limitations affecting many of our customers along with excessive quantities of under-utilized equipment. We\nexpect product sales of our oil and gas products, and in particular our land-based traditional and wireless products, to remain low until\nexploration-focused seismic activities increase, which we believe will result from the ongoing depletion of existing reservoirs\nprompting the need to find new sources of oil and gas. We expect these challenging industry conditions facing our land-based\ntraditional and wireless products will continue into fiscal year 2019.\nOur available cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments totaled $37.4 million at September 30, 2018, including $7.3\nmillion of cash and cash equivalents held by our foreign subsidiaries and branch offices. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act signed into law\non December 22, 2017, creates new taxes on certain foreign earnings and also requires companies to pay a one-time transition tax on\nundistributed earnings of their foreign subsidiaries which were previously tax deferred. We have determined that we are not required\nto pay any transition tax on the undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries since there were no accumulated earnings on a\nconsolidated basis.\nOur credit agreement allows for borrowings of up to $30.0 million with such amounts available for borrowing determined by\na borrowing base. In October 2017, we extended the maturity of the credit agreement from May 2018 to April 2019. At September\n30, 2018, we had no outstanding borrowings under the credit agreement and, after consideration of $0.3 million of outstanding letters\nof credit, our borrowing availability under the credit facility was $21.5 million. At September 30, 2018, we were in compliance with\nall covenants under the credit agreement. We currently do not anticipate the need to borrow under the credit agreement; however, we\ncan make no assurance that we will not do so. On November 8, 2018, we further extended the maturity of the credit agreement from\nApril 2019 to April 2020.\n23\nIn fiscal years 2016, 2017 and 2018, we received income tax refunds of $18.3 million, $12.8 million and $0.7 million,\nrespectively, from the U.S. Department of Treasury. These refunds were a result of the significant tax losses we experienced in fiscal\nyears 2016 and 2015, which we elected to carryback and recoup taxes previously paid. For U.S. income tax purposes, we are now in a\nloss carryforward position in regards to our tax losses occurring in fiscal year 2017 and beyond. As a result, our current tax losses will\nnot result in any additional U.S. federal income tax refunds. The tax refunds we received in fiscal years 2016 and 2017 were\nsignificant contributors to our overall liquidity. In the absence of future profitable results of operations, we may need to rely on other\nsources of liquidity to fund our future operating results, including liquidating short-term investments, executed rental contracts,\navailable borrowings under our credit agreement through its expiration in April 2019, leveraging or sale of real estate assets, sales of\nrental assets and other liquidity sources which may be available to us. However, currently we believe that our cash and short-term\ninvestment balances will be sufficient to finance any future operating losses and planned capital expenditures through the next twelve\nmonths.\nFiscal Year 2017\nAt September 30, 2017, we had approximately $15.1 million in cash and cash equivalents and $36.1 million in short-term\ninvestments. For the fiscal year ended September 30, 2017, we generated $10.1 million of cash in operating activities primarily due to\nan income tax refund as discussed below. Our net loss of $56.8 million was offset by (i) net non-cash charges of $50.0 million from\ndeferred income taxes, depreciation, accretion, inventory obsolescence, asset impairments, stock-based compensation and bad debts,\n(ii) income tax refunds totaling $13.0 million, (iii) a $7.7 million decrease in trade accounts and notes receivable resulting from\ncollections, (iv) a $3.0 million decrease in inventories caused by a drawdown of our excess levels of finished goods and (v) a $2.2\nmillion decrease in prepaid income taxes related to the depreciation of intercompany profits by our foreign subsidiary. These sources\nof cash were partially offset by (i) the removal of a $9.1 million gross profit from the sale of used rental equipment since such gross\nprofit is reflected in the proceeds from the sale of used rental equipment under investing activities and (ii) $1.3 million decrease in\naccrued and other expenses primarily due to lower property taxes.\nFor the fiscal year ended September 30, 2017, we used cash of $5.5 million from investing activities. These uses of cash\nincluded (i) net disbursements of $8.7 million for the purchase of short-term investments, (ii) an investment of $1.2 million in\nproperty, plant and equipment and (iii) $0.5 million to expand our equipment rental fleet. These uses of cash were partially offset by\n$4.9 million in proceeds from the sale of used rental equipment. For the fiscal year ended September 30, 2017, we generated cash\nproceeds of $0.1 million from financing activities from the exercise of stock options by our employees. We had no long-term debt\noutstanding throughout the fiscal year ended September 30, 2017.\nFiscal Year 2016\nAt September 30, 2016, we had approximately $10.3 million in cash and cash equivalents and $27.5 million in short-term\ninvestments. For the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016, we used $1.7 million of cash in operating activities. These uses of cash\nincluded (i) our net loss of $46.0 million, (ii) a $3.4 million increase in trade accounts and notes receivable primarily due to amounts\nowed under the OBX Contract, (iii) a $1.9 million decrease in accounts payable primarily due to declining inventory purchases\nresulting from reduced product demand and (iv) a $2.1 million decrease in accrued and other expenses primarily due to settlements\nand reductions in expected warranty claims. These uses of cash were partially offset by (i) non-cash charges of $43.2 million from\ndeferred income taxes, depreciation, accretion, stock-based compensation, inventory obsolescence, asset impairments and bad debts,\n(ii) a $4.1 million decrease in income tax receivable primarily resulting from an $18.3 million income tax refund received in fiscal\nyear 2016, (iii) a $5.2 million decrease in inventories caused by a drawdown of our excess levels of finished goods, and (iv) a $1.5\nmillion decrease in prepaid income taxes.\nFor the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016, we used cash of $10.2 million from investing activities. These uses of cash\nincluded (i) net disbursements of $9.4 million from the purchase and sale of short-term investments, (ii) $1.9 million for additions to\nour property, plant and equipment and (iii) $0.5 million to expand our rental equipment fleet, primarily for additional OBX nodes. In\naddition, we made non-cash inventory transfers to our rental fleet of approximately $4.0 million. These uses of cash were partially\noffset by $1.6 million in proceeds from the sale of used rental equipment.\nFor the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016, we had no cash flows from financing activities. We had no long-term debt\noutstanding at September 30, 2016.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe do not have any obligations which meet the definition of an off-balance sheet arrangement and which have or are\nreasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial statements or the items contained therein that are material to\ninvestors.\n24\nContractual Obligations\nThe Company established an estimated initial contingent earn-out liability of $7.7 million in connection with the acquisition\nof Quantum. Contingent payments, if any, which may be paid in the form of cash or company stock, will be derived from certain\neligible revenue that may be generated during the four-year earn-out period subsequent to the closing of the acquisition. The purchase\nagreement allows for the payment of a maximum contingent liability of up to $23.5 million over the four-year earn-out period.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States\nrequires the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes.\nWe consider many factors in selecting appropriate operational and financial accounting policies and controls, and in developing the\nestimates and assumptions that are used in the preparation of these financial statements. We continually evaluate our estimates,\nincluding those related to revenue recognition, bad debt reserves, inventory obsolescence reserves, self-insurance reserves for medical\nexpenses, product warranty reserves, contingent earn-out liabilities, stock-based compensation and deferred income tax assets. We\nbase our estimates on historical experience and various other factors, including the impact from the current economic conditions that\nwe believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different conditions or\nassumptions.\nOur normal credit terms for trade receivables are 30 days. In certain situations, credit terms for trade receivables may be\nextended to 60 days or longer and such receivables generally do not require collateral. Additionally, we provide long-term financing\nin the form of promissory notes and sales-type leases when competitive conditions require such financing and, in such cases, we may\nrequire collateral. We perform ongoing credit evaluations of our accounts and financing receivables, and allowances are recognized\nfor potential credit losses.\nOur long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever an event or change in circumstances indicates the carrying\namount of an asset or group of assets may not be recoverable. The impairment review, if necessary, includes a comparison of\nexpected future cash flows (undiscounted and without interest charges) to be generated by an asset group with the associated carrying\nvalue of the related assets. If the carrying value of the asset group exceeds the expected future cash flows, an impairment loss is\nrecognized to the extent that the carrying value of the asset group exceeds its fair value.\nManagement makes judgments regarding the interpretation of tax laws that might be challenged upon an audit and cause\nchanges to previous estimates of tax liability. In addition, we operate within multiple taxing jurisdictions and are subject to audit in\nthese jurisdictions as well as by the Internal Revenue Service. In management’s opinion, adequate provisions for income taxes have\nbeen made for all open tax years. The potential outcomes of examinations are regularly assessed in determining the adequacy of the\nprovision for income taxes and income tax liabilities. Management believes that adequate provisions have been made for reasonable\nand foreseeable outcomes related to uncertain tax matters.\nWe record a write-down of our inventories when the cost basis of any manufactured product, including any estimated future\ncosts to complete the manufacturing process, exceeds its net realizable value. Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net\nrealizable value. Cost is determined on a first-in, first-out method, except that our offices in the Russian Federation, Colombia and the\nUnited Kingdom use an average cost method to value their inventories.\nWe periodically review the composition of our inventories to determine if market demand, product modifications, technology\nchanges, excessive quantities on-hand and other factors hinder our ability to recover our investment in such inventories.\nManagement’s assessment is based upon historical product demand, estimated future product demand and various other judgments\nand estimates. Inventory obsolescence reserves are recorded when such assessments reveal that portions or components of our\ninventory investment will not be realized in our operating activities.\nThe value of our inventories not expected to be realized in cash, sold or consumed during our next operating cycle are\nclassified as non-current assets in our consolidated balance sheets.\nWe primarily derive our revenue from product sales and product rentals under short-term operating leases and sales type\nleases. Our products are produced in a standard manufacturing operation. We recognize revenue from product sales when (i) title\npasses to the customer, (ii) the customer assumes risks and rewards of ownership, (iii) the product sales price has been determined,\n(iv) collectability of the sales price is reasonably assured and (v) product delivery occurs as directed by our customer. We recognize\nrental revenue as earned over the rental period. Rentals of our equipment generally range from daily rentals to rental periods of up to\nsix months or longer. Service revenue is recognized when services are rendered and are generally priced on a per day rate. Except for\ncertain of our PRM products, our products are generally sold without any customer acceptance provisions and our standard terms of\nsale do not allow customers to return products for credit.\n25\nMost of our products do not require installation assistance or sophisticated instruction. We offer a standard product warranty,\nwhich obligates us to repair or replace our products having manufacturing defects. We maintain a reserve for future warranty costs\nbased on historical experience or, in the absence of historical experience, management estimates.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nPlease refer to Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements contained in this Annual Report for a discussion of recent\naccounting pronouncements.\nManagement’s Current Outlook and Assumptions\nRegarding our Oil and Gas Markets business segment, prices for a barrel of WTI crude oil declined from over $100 in July\n2014 to approximately $26 in February 2016, and have recovered to approximately $56 today. With this substantial net decline in oil\nprices, oil and gas exploration and production companies experienced a significant reduction in cash flows, which resulted in sharp\nreductions in their capital spending budgets for oil and gas exploration-focused activities, including seismic data acquisition activities.\nWhile we are now seeing some signs of increased oil and gas exploration activity around the world, the need for new seismic\nequipment remains restrained due to our customers’ (i) limited capital resources, (ii) lack of visibility into future demand for their\nseismic services and (iii) in some cases, under-utilized legacy equipment.\nMany of our traditional seismic products are damaged, destroyed or otherwise consumed during field operations. We do not\nexpect fiscal year 2019 demand for our land-based traditional seismic products to exceed fiscal year 2018 levels since we expect\ncontinued low levels of land seismic contracting activities by most of our customers.\nWe have recently introduced the “GCL” which is a new version of our land-based wireless data recorder. This version\ncontains several unique features not found in competitive models and we have received positive customer feedback regarding these\nfeatures and its overall functionality. Despite the positive customer feedback, market demand remains constrained for the reasons\ncited above. While we believe the GCL will be a market leader similar to our GSX wireless unit, it is uncertain what revenue impact\nthis product will have, if any, during fiscal year 2019 in light of the tepid market demand for oil and gas seismic services and\nequipment. However, we expect our fiscal year 2019 land-based wireless product revenue resulting from product rentals and rental\nequipment sales to match the levels we achieved in fiscal year 2018.\nThe majority of our oil and gas rental revenue in fiscal year 2018 was derived from short-term rentals of our wireless OBX\nocean-bottom recorder. We believe our OBX rental revenue will increase substantially in fiscal year 2019 as a result of rental\ncontracts we executed in fiscal year 2018, and the heightened demand we continue to see for this product.\nWe believe that fiscal year 2019 revenue from our oil and gas reservoir products, and principally our borehole tools and\nservices, will be similar to the revenues we achieved in fiscal year 2018. We have not received any orders for large-scale seabed PRM\nsystems since November 2012 and we currently do not have any indication that such an order will be received in fiscal year 2019,\nalthough we do believe opportunities for PRM orders do exist in today’s market. If a large-scale order were received in fiscal year\n2019, it could significantly impact our fiscal year 2019 revenue and profits.\nWe expect fiscal year 2019 revenue from our Adjacent Markets products to increase over fiscal year 2018 levels. We expect\nour industrial products to contribute the majority of this increase as a result of expanded market acceptance of our products targeted at\nthe water meter industry.\nWe expect fiscal year 2019 revenue from our Emerging Markets products to increase over fiscal year 2018 levels as we only\nentered this market in July 2018.\n26\nItem 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk\nWe have market risk relative to our short-term investments, foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. We do not engage in\ncommodity or commodity derivative instrument purchase or sales transactions. Because of the inherent unpredictability of foreign currency\nrates and interest rates, as well as other factors, actual results could differ materially from those projected in this Item 7A.\nForeign Currency and Operations Risk\nOne of our wholly-owned subsidiaries, Geospace Technologies Eurasia, LLC is located in the Russian Federation. In\naddition, we operate a branch office, Geospace Technologies Sucursal Sudamericana, in Colombia. Our financial results for these\nentities may be affected by factors such as volatile changes in foreign currency exchange rates, weak economic conditions or changes\nin the political climate. Our consolidated balance sheet at September 30, 2018 reflected approximately $4.6 million and $0.1 million\nof foreign currency denominated net working capital related to our Russian and Colombian operations, respectively. Both of these\nentities receive a portion of their revenue and pay a majority of their expenses primarily in their local currency. To the extent that\ntransactions of these entities are settled in their local currency, a devaluation of these currencies versus the U.S. dollar could reduce\nany contribution from these entities to our consolidated results of operations and total comprehensive income as reported in U.S.\ndollars. We do not hedge the market risk with respect to our operations in these countries; therefore, such risk is a general and\nunpredictable risk of future disruptions in the valuation of such currencies versus U.S. dollars to the extent such disruptions result in\nany reduced valuation of these foreign entities’ net working capital or future contributions to our consolidated results of operations.\nAt September 30, 2018, the foreign exchange rate for $1.00 (one U.S. dollar) was equal to 65.6 Russian Rubles and 2,960 Colombian\nPesos, respectively. If the value of the U.S. dollar were to increase by ten percent against these foreign currencies, our working capital\nin the Russian Federation and in Colombia could decline by $0.5 million and $9,000, respectively.\nForeign Currency Intercompany Accounts and Financing Receivables\nWe sell products to our foreign subsidiaries on trade credit terms in both U.S. dollars and in the subsidiary’s local currency.\nAt September 30, 2018, we had outstanding Canadian-dollar denominated intercompany accounts receivable of CAN $20.4 million,\nwhich we consider to be of a short-term nature. The appreciation or devaluation of the Canadian dollar against the U.S. dollar will\nresult in a gain or loss, respectively, to our consolidated statement of operations. At September 30, 2018, the foreign exchange rate for\nUSD $1.00 was equal to approximately CAN $1.29. On September 28, 2018 we entered into a CAN $30.0 million short-term hedge\ncontract with a United States bank to hedge a portion of our Canadian dollar foreign exchange rate exposure, resulting in an over-\nhedged position of approximately CAN $9.6 million. At September 30, 2018, if the U.S. dollar exchange rate were to weaken by ten\npercent against the Canadian dollar, we would recognize a foreign exchange loss of USD $0.7 million in our consolidated financial\nstatements. On October 18, 2018, we settled CAN $10.0 million of the hedge and realized a $0.1 million loss.\nFloating Interest Rate Risk\nOur credit agreement contains a floating interest rate which subjects us to the risk of increased interest costs associated with\nany upward movements in bank market interest rates. Under our credit agreement our borrowing interest rate is the Wall Street\nJournal prime rate, which was 5.25% at September 30, 2018. As of September 30, 2018, there were no borrowings outstanding under\nour credit agreement.\nItem 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\nOur consolidated financial statements, including the reports thereon, the notes thereto and supplementary data begin at page\nF-1 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K and are incorporated herein by reference.\nItem 9. Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure\nNone.\n27\nItem 9A. Controls and Procedures\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining a system of disclosure controls and procedures that are\ndesigned to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed,\nsummarized and reported within the time periods specified under SEC’s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and\ncommunicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”) and Chief Financial Officer (“CFO”).\nNotwithstanding the foregoing, there can be no assurance that our disclosure controls and procedures will detect or uncover all failures\nof persons within the Company and its consolidated subsidiaries to report material information otherwise required to be set forth in our\nreports.\nIn connection with the preparation of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we carried out an evaluation under the supervision and\nwith the participation of our management, including the CEO and CFO, as of September 30, 2018 of the effectiveness of the Company’s\ndisclosure controls and procedures, as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act. Based on that\nevaluation, the CEO and CFO concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective as of September 30, 2018.\nManagement’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting (as defined\nin Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act). Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial\nreporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to\nthe risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or\nprocedures may deteriorate.\nOur management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2018. In\nmaking this assessment, we used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission\n(COSO) in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013). Based on this assessment, our management concluded that, as of\nSeptember 30, 2018, our internal control over financial reporting is effective based on those criteria.\nOur internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2018 has been audited by RSM US LLP, an independent\nregistered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which appears herein.\nChanges in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nIn the fourth quarter of our fiscal year ended September 30, 2018, we added and/or modified certain internal controls and\nprocesses in preparation of adopting the new revenue recognition standard in October 2018 under the modified retrospective approach.\nThere have not been any additional changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f)\nof the Exchange Act) during the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2018 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to\nmaterially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.\nItem 9B.

In our opinion, the\nconsolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of the Company as of\nSeptember 30, 2018, and the consolidated results of its operations and its cash flows for the year then ended, in conformity with\naccounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\nWe have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States)\n(PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2018, based on criteria established in Internal\nControl — Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in 2013, and\nour report dated November 16, 2018 expressed an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over\nfinancial reporting.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express\nan opinion on the Company’s consolidated financial statements based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with\nthe PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with U.S. federal securities laws and the\napplicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform\nthe audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether\ndue to error or fraud. Our audit included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated\nfinancial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included\nexamining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audit also\nincluded evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall\npresentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\n/s/ RSM US LLP\nWe have served as the Company's auditor since 2018.\nHouston, Texas\nNovember 16, 2018\nF-2\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nTo the Board of Directors and Stockholders\nGeospace Technologies Corporation\nOpinion on the Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nWe have audited Geospace Technologies Corporation and its subsidiaries' (the Company) internal control over financial\nreporting as of September 30, 2018, based on criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework issued by the\nCommittee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in 2013. In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all\nmaterial respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2018, based on criteria established in Internal\nControl — Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in 2013.\nWe have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States)\n(PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheet as of September 30, 2018, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive\nloss, stockholders' equity and cash flows for the year then ended of the Company and our report dated November 16, 2018 expressed\nan unqualified opinion.\nBasis for Opinion\nThe Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its\nassessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal\nControl over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial\nreporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with\nrespect to the Company in accordance with U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and\nExchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform\nthe audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material\nrespects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material\nweakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our\naudit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit\nprovides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nA company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the\nreliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally\naccepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1)\npertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the\nassets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial\nstatements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being\nmade only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance\nregarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the company's assets that could have a\nmaterial effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also,\nprojections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of\nchanges in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n/s/ RSM US LLP\nHouston, Texas\nNovember 16, 2018\nF-3\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nTo the Board of Directors and Stockholders\nGeospace Technologies Corporation\nOur audit of the consolidated financial statements and internal control over financial reporting referred to in our separate reports dated\nNovember 16, 2018, (included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K) also included the financial statement schedule of\nGeospace Technologies Corporation and its subsidiaries, listed in Item 15(a) of this Form 10-K.

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies:\nThe Company\nGeospace Technologies Corporation (“Geospace”) designs and manufactures instruments and equipment used by the oil and\ngas industry to acquire seismic data in order to locate, characterize and monitor hydrocarbon producing reservoirs. Geospace also\ndesigns and manufactures Adjacent Markets products, including industrial products and imaging equipment, and Emerging Market\nproducts consisting of border and perimeter security products. Geospace and its subsidiaries are referred to collectively as the\n“Company”.\nBasis of Presentation\nThe accompanying financial statements present the consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows of the\nCompany in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. All intercompany balances\nand transactions have been eliminated.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of\nAmerica requires the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying\nnotes. The Company considers many factors in selecting appropriate operational and financial accounting policies and controls, and in\ndeveloping the estimates and assumptions that are used in the preparation of these financial statements. The Company continually\nevaluates its estimates, including those related to bad debt reserves, inventory obsolescence reserves, self-insurance reserves, product\nwarranty reserves, impairment of long-lived assets and deferred income tax assets. The Company bases its estimates on historical\nexperience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these\nestimates under different conditions or assumptions.\nCash and Cash Equivalents\nThe Company considers all highly liquid investments purchased with an original or remaining maturity at the time of\npurchase of three months or less to be cash equivalents. At September 30, 2018 cash and cash equivalents included $7.3 million held\nby the Company’s foreign subsidiaries and branch offices. If the Company were to repatriate the cash held by its foreign subsidiaries,\nit would be required to accrue and pay taxes on any amount repatriated under rated enacted by The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (“2017 Tax\nAct’).\nShort-term Investments\nThe Company classifies its short-term investments consisting of corporate bonds, government bonds and other such similar\ninvestments as available-for-sale securities. Available-for-sale securities are carried at fair market value with net unrealized holding\ngains and losses reported each period as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss in stockholders’ equity. See Note 2 to\nthese consolidated financial statements for additional information.\nConcentrations of Credit Risk\nThe Company maintains its cash in bank deposit accounts that, at times, exceed federally insured limits. Management of the\nCompany believes that the financial strength of the financial institutions holding such deposits minimizes the credit risk of such\ndeposits.\nThe Company sells products to customers throughout the United States and various foreign countries. The Company’s\nnormal credit terms for trade receivables are 30 days. In certain situations, credit terms may be extended to 60 days or longer. The\nCompany performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers and generally does not require collateral for its trade receivables.\nAdditionally, the Company provides long-term financing in the form of promissory notes and sales-type leases when competitive\nconditions require such financing. In such cases, the Company may require collateral. Allowances are recognized for potential credit\nlosses. One customer comprised 10.4% of the Company’s revenue during fiscal year 2018. At September 30, 2018, the Company had\na combined trade account and financing receivable due from this customer of $9.0 million. One customer comprised 17.8% of the\nCompany’s revenue during fiscal year 2017. At September 30, 2017, the Company had a financing receivable from this customer of\n$8.1 million. One customer comprised 18.5% of the Company’s revenues during fiscal year 2016. At September 30, 2016, the\nCompany had an account receivable from this customer of $9.1 million.\nF-11\nGeospace Technologies Corporation and Subsidiaries\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements—(Continued)\nInventories\nThe Company records a write-down of its inventories when the cost basis of any manufactured product, including any\nestimated future costs to complete the manufacturing process, exceeds its net realizable value. Inventories are stated at the lower of\ncost or net realizable value. Cost is determined on the first-in, first-out method, except that certain of the Company’s foreign\nsubsidiaries use an average cost method to value their inventories.\nThe Company periodically reviews the composition of its inventories to determine if market demand, product modifications,\ntechnology changes, excessive quantities on-hand and other factors hinder our ability to recover its investment in such\ninventories. The Company’s assessment is based upon historical product demand, estimated future product demand and various other\njudgments and estimates. Inventory obsolescence reserves are recorded when such assessments reveal that portions or components of\nthe Company’s inventory investment will not be realized in its operating activities.\nThe Company reviews it inventories for classification purposes. The value of inventories not expected to be realized in cash,\nsold or consumed during its next operating cycle are classified as noncurrent assets.\nProperty, Plant and Equipment and Rental Equipment\nProperty, plant and equipment and rental equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation expense is calculated using the straight-\nline method over the following estimated useful lives:\nYears\nRental equipment........................................................................... 2-5\nProperty, plant and equipment:\nMachinery and equipment........................................................ 3-15\nBuildings and building improvements..................................... 10-50\nOther......................................................................................... 5-10\nExpenditures for renewals and betterments are capitalized. Repairs and maintenance expenditures are charged to expense as\nincurred. The cost and accumulated depreciation of assets sold or otherwise disposed of are removed from the accounts and any gain\nor loss thereon is reflected in the statements of operations.\nImpairment of Long-lived Assets\nThe Company’s long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever an event or change in circumstances indicates the\ncarrying amount of an asset or group of assets may not be recoverable. The impairment review, if necessary, includes a comparison of\nexpected future cash flows (undiscounted and without interest charges) to be generated by an asset group with the associated carrying\nvalue of the related assets. If the carrying value of the asset group exceeds the expected future cash flows, an impairment loss is\nrecognized to the extent that the carrying value of the asset group exceeds its fair value. Impairment charges are included as a\ncomponent of cost of revenue in the Company’s consolidated statements of operations.\nGoodwill\nFor the fiscal year ended September 30, 2018, the Company followed the simplified procedures for analyzing goodwill\nimpairment. The guidance on the testing of goodwill for impairment provides the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine\nif the annual two-step test of goodwill for impairment must be performed. If, based on the qualitative assessment of events or\ncircumstances, an entity determines it is more likely than not that the goodwill fair value is more than its carrying amount then it is not\nnecessary to perform the two-step impairment test. However, if an entity concludes otherwise, then the two-step impairment test must\nbe performed to identify potential impairment and to measure the amount of goodwill impairment, if any. At September 30, 2018, the\nCompany performed step-one of the two-step analysis and determined the fair value of its goodwill was more than its carrying\namount.\nF-12\nGeospace Technologies Corporation and Subsidiaries\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements—(Continued)\nOther Intangible Assets\nIntangible assets are carried at cost, net of accumulated amortization. The estimated useful life of the Company’s other\nintangible assets are evaluated each reporting period to determine whether events or circumstances warrant a revision to the remaining\namortization period. If the estimate of an intangible asset’s remaining useful life is changed, the amortization period should be\nchanged prospectively. Amortization expense is calculated using the straight-line method over the following estimated useful lives:\nYears\nDeveloped technology.............................................. 18\nTrade names............................................................. 5\nCustomer relationships............................................. 4\nNon-compete agreements......................................... 4\nRevenue Recognition – Products and Services\nThe Company primarily derives revenue from the sale of its manufactured products, including revenue derived from the sale\nof its manufactured rental equipment. In addition, the Company generates revenue from the short-term rental under operating leases\nof its manufactured products. The Company recognizes revenue from product sales, including the sale of used rental equipment, when\nall of the following have occurred: (i) title passes to the customer, (ii) the customer assumes the risks and rewards of ownership, (iii)\nthe product sales price has been determined, (iv) collectability of the sales price is reasonably assured, and (v) product delivery occurs\nas directed by the customer. Although infrequent, in cases where collectability is not reasonably assured, the installment or cost\nrecovery method is used. Except for certain of the Company’s reservoir characterization products, the Company’s products are\ngenerally sold without any customer acceptance provisions, and the Company’s standard terms of sale do not allow customers to\nreturn products for credit. The Company recognizes rental revenue as earned over the rental period. Rentals of the Company’s\nequipment generally range from daily rentals to rental periods of up to six months or longer. Revenue from engineering services is\nrecognized as services are rendered over the duration of a project, or as billed on a per hour basis. Field service revenue is recognized\nwhen services are rendered and is generally priced on a per day rate.\nDeferred Revenue\nThe Company records deferred revenue when customer funds are billed or received prior to the recognition of the associated\nrevenue.\nContingent Earn-out Liability\nThe Company established an earn-out liability in connection with a business acquisition in the fourth quarter of fiscal year\n2018. The Company engaged the services of a valuation firm to measure the fair value of the liability. The valuation technique used\nto measure the fair value of the liability was derived from models utilizing market observable inputs. The Company reviews and\naccesses the value of the liability on a quarterly basis. Adjustments to the liability, if any, will be included as a component of earnings\nin the consolidated statements of operations.\nResearch and Development Costs\nThe Company expenses research and development costs as incurred. Research and development costs include salaries,\nemployee benefit costs, department supplies, direct project costs and other related costs.\nProduct Warranties\nMost of the Company’s products do not require installation assistance or sophisticated instructions. The Company offers a\nstandard product warranty obligating it to repair or replace equipment with manufacturing defects. The Company maintains a reserve\nfor future warranty costs based on historical experience or, in the absence of historical product experience, management’s estimates.\nReserves for future warranty costs are included within accrued expenses and other current liabilities on the consolidated balance\nsheets.\nF-13\nGeospace Technologies Corporation and Subsidiaries\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements—(Continued)\nChanges in the product warranty reserve are reflected in the following table (in thousands):\nBalance at October 1, 2015........................................................... $ 2,326\nAccruals for warranties issued during the year............................. 595\nSettlements made (in cash or in kind) during the year..................

(894)\nBalance at September 30, 2018..................................................... $ 688\nStock-Based Compensation\nThe Company accounts for stock-based compensation, including grants of restricted awards and unqualified stock options in\naccordance with Accounting Standards Codification Topic 718, which requires that all share-based payments (to the extent that they\nare compensatory) be recognized as an expense in the Company’s consolidated statements of operations based on their fair values on\nthe award date and the estimated number of shares it ultimately expects to vest.\nThe Company recognizes stock-based compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period of the\naward. The Company’s stock-based compensation plan and awards are more fully described in Note 15 to these consolidated financial\nstatements.\nForeign Currency Gains and Losses\nThe assets and liabilities of the Company’s foreign subsidiaries that have a foreign currency as their functional currency have\nbeen translated into U.S. dollars using the exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date. Results of operations have been\ntranslated using the average exchange rates during the year. Resulting translation adjustments have been recorded as a component of\naccumulated other comprehensive loss in stockholders’ equity. Foreign currency transaction gains and losses are included in the\nstatements of operations as they occur. Transaction gains and losses on intra-entity foreign currency transactions and balances\nincluding advances and demand notes payable, on which settlement is not planned or anticipated in the foreseeable future, are\nrecorded in “accumulated other comprehensive loss” on our consolidated balance sheets.\nShipping and Handling Costs\nAmounts billed to a customer in a sales transaction related to reimbursable shipping and handling costs are included in\nrevenue and the associated costs incurred by the Company for reimbursable shipping and handling expenses are reported in cost of\nsales. The Company had shipping and handling expenses of $0.5 million, $0.3 million and $0.4 million for each of the fiscal years\nended September 30, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.\nFair Value\nFair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or the amount paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction\nbetween market participants (an exit price) at the measurement date. U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) has\nestablished a fair value hierarchy which prioritizes the inputs to the valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three levels.\nThese levels are determined based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement. Level 1 represents\nunadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities. Level 2 represents quoted prices for similar assets and\nliabilities in active markets (other than those included in Level 1) which are observable, either directly or indirectly. Level 3\nrepresents valuations derived from valuation techniques in which one or more significant inputs or significant value drivers are\nunobservable.\nF-14\nGeospace Technologies Corporation and Subsidiaries\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements—(Continued)\nIncome Taxes\nIncome taxes are presented in accordance with the Accounting Standards Codification Topic 740 (“Topic 740”) guidance for\naccounting for income taxes. The estimated future tax effects of temporary differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities\nand amounts reported in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets, as well as operating loss and tax credit carrybacks and\ncarryforwards are recorded. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between financial reporting and tax\nbasis of assets and liabilities (temporary differences) and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when\nthe differences are expected to reverse. The Company periodically reviews the recoverability of tax assets recorded on the balance\nsheet and provides valuation allowances if it is more likely than not that such assets will not be realized.\nThe Company follows the guidance of Topic 740 to analyze all tax positions that are less than certain. Topic 740 prescribes a\nrecognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or\nexpected to be taken in a tax return. In accordance with Topic 740, the Company recognizes in its financial statements the impact of a\ntax position if that position is “more likely than not” to be sustained on audit, based on the technical merits of the position. The\nCompany’s estimate of the potential outcome of any uncertain tax issue is subject to management’s assessment of relevant risks, facts,\nand circumstances existing at that time.\nThe Company classifies interest and penalties associated with the payment of income taxes in the Other Income (Expense)\nsection of its consolidated statements of operations.\nRecently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements\nIn October 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued guidance which eliminates the exception of\nrecognizing, at the time of transfer, current and deferred income taxes for intercompany profits on intra-entity asset transfers other\nthan inventory. The Company adopted this guidance in its first quarter of its fiscal year ended September 30, 2018 using the modified\nretrospective approach. The adoption resulted in a cumulative-effect charge to opening retained earnings of $0.4 million. Under prior\nguidance, the Company maintained a non-current prepaid income tax asset on its consolidated balance sheets representing income\ntaxes paid in the U.S. on profits realized from the sale of rental equipment to its foreign subsidiaries. As this rental equipment was\ndepreciated, the prepaid tax was recognized as a current income tax expense in the Company’s consolidated statement of\noperations. Under the new guidance, the Company is required to recognize a deferred tax asset related to the intercompany profits\nrealized on the sale of non-inventory assets to its subsidiaries; however, profits realized from the intercompany sale of inventories will\ncontinue to be accounted for as a prepaid income tax asset in accordance with the prior guidance. Under the new guidance, the\ndeferred tax asset resulting from the sale of non-inventory assets is recognized at the jurisdictional tax rate of the subsidiary which\npurchased the asset. Any differences between the subsidiary’s jurisdictional tax rate and the seller’s tax rate pertaining to the\nintercompany profit are charged to seller’s current income tax expense at the time of the sale. With the recent reduction in the U.S.\nincome tax rate to 21%, and assuming that a majority of the Company’s future intercompany equipment sales will continue to be made\nto its Canadian subsidiary having a higher statutory tax rate, the new guidance is expected to have a favorable impact on the\nCompany’s provision for income taxes in future periods. Due to the fact the Company has a valuation allowance against most of its\nnet deferred tax assets, the adoption of this guidance had no impact upon the Company’s income tax expense for the fiscal year ended\nSeptember 30, 2018.\nIn March 2016, the FASB issued guidance to simplify key components of employee share-based payment accounting. The\nnew guidance simplifies several aspects of the accounting for share-based payment transactions, including: (a) income tax\nconsequences; (b) classification of awards as either equity or liabilities; and (c) classification of excess tax benefits from share-based\npayments on the statement of cash flows. The Company adopted this guidance in the first quarter of its fiscal year ended September\n30, 2018. No cumulative effect adjustment to retained earnings was needed upon adoption since the Company had no unrecorded\nexcess tax benefits residing in its additional paid-in-capital account. Under the prior standard, the Company was required to track and\nrecord as a component of additional paid-in capital the tax impact of cumulative windfalls, net of any shortfalls, which resulted from\nexcess tax benefits from share-based payments. As a result, the impact of net windfalls has not historically affected the Company’s\nprovision for income taxes or its effective income tax rate. Under the new guidance, the Company will no longer track windfalls or\nshortfalls resulting from share-based payments since all future windfalls and shortfalls will be recorded as a component of the\nCompany’s current provision for income taxes. Depending on the magnitude of future windfalls or shortfalls, this change could\nsignificantly affect the Company’s provision for income taxes in a positive or negative direction. Since the Company had a valuation\nallowance against the value of its cumulative U.S. net operating losses, the adoption of this guidance had no impact upon the\nCompany’s income tax expense for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2018.\nF-15\nGeospace Technologies Corporation and Subsidiaries\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements—(Continued)\nIn July 2015, the FASB issued guidance requiring management to measure inventory at the lower of cost or net realizable\nvalue. Under the new guidance, net realizable value is defined as the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less\nreasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal, and transportation. Since the Company is a manufacturer and the nature of its\ninventory is generally unique to its designs and applications thus preventing the gathering of relevant external market data, its existing\npractice for calculating net realizable value under the current standard is consistent with the practice prescribed by the new guidance.\nThe Company adopted this standard in the first quarter of its fiscal year ended September 30, 2018. The adoption of this guidance had\nno impact upon the Company’s consolidated financial statements.\nRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements\nIn August 2018, the FASB issued guidance which requires certain existing disclosure requirements in Topic 820 to be\nmodified or removed, and certain new disclosure requirements to be added to the Topic. In addition, the guidance allows entities to\nexercise more discretion when considering fair value measurement disclosures. The guidance will be effective for the Company\nbeginning January 1, 2020 with early adoption permitted. The Company is in the process of evaluating the impact of this guidance on\nits consolidated financial statements.\nIn January 2017, the FASB issued guidance which simplifies the current two-step goodwill impairment test by eliminating\nStep 2 of the test. The guidance requires a one-step impairment test in which an entity compares the fair value of a reporting unit with\nits carrying amount and recognizes an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit’s\nfair value, if any. This guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019 and interim periods within those fiscal\nyears, and should be applied on a prospective basis. Early adoption is permitted for the interim or annual goodwill impairment tests\nperformed on testing dates after January 1, 2017. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of this guidance on\nits consolidated financial statements.\nIn November 2016, the FASB issued guidance which requires that a statement of cash flows explain the change during the\nperiod in the total of cash, cash equivalents, and amounts generally described as restricted cash or restricted cash equivalents.\nTherefore, amounts generally described as restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents should be included with cash and cash\nequivalents when reconciling the beginning-of-period and end-of-period total amounts shown on the statement of cash flows. This\nguidance will be adopted by the Company in its first quarter of fiscal year 2019 and should be applied on a retrospective transition\nbasis. The Company has historically not held restricted cash balances and, therefore, does not expect the adoption of this guidance to\nhave a material effect on its consolidated financial statements. However, upon adoption of this guidance, the Company will make any\nnecessary changes to present restricted cash balances in accordance with the guidance.\nIn June 2016, the FASB issued guidance surrounding credit losses for financial instruments that replaces the incurred loss\nimpairment methodology in GAAP. The new impairment model requires immediate recognition of estimated credit losses expected to\noccur for most financial assets and certain other financial instruments. For available-for-sale debt securities with unrealized losses,\ncredit losses will be recognized as allowances rather than reductions in the amortized cost of the securities. The standard is effective\nfor annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2019 and interim periods within those annual periods. Early adoption for a\nfiscal year beginning after December 15, 2018 is permitted. Entities will apply the standard’s provisions as a cumulative-effect\nadjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of the first effective reporting period. The Company expects to adopt this standard\nduring the first quarter of its fiscal year ending September 30, 2021 and is currently evaluating the impact of this new guidance on its\nconsolidated financial statements.\nIn February 2016, the FASB issued guidance requiring a lessee to recognize assets and liabilities for leases with lease terms\nof more than 12 months. Consistent with current GAAP, the recognition, measurement and presentation of expense and cash flows\narising from a lease by a lessee primarily will depend on its classification of the lease as a finance or operating lease. However, unlike\ncurrent GAAP, which requires only capital leases to be recognized on the balance sheet, the new guidance will also require operating\nleases of the lessee to be recognized on the balance sheet if the operating lease term is more than 12 months. The guidance also\nrequires disclosures to help investors and other financial statement users to better understand the amount, timing and uncertainty of\ncash flows arising from leases. These disclosures include qualitative and quantitative requirements, providing additional information\nabout the amounts recorded in the financial statements. The guidance is effective for fiscal years, and interim reporting periods\ntherein, beginning after December 15, 2018 and is to be applied using the modified retrospective approach. The Company expects to\nadopt this standard in its first quarter of its fiscal year ending September 30, 2020. The Company currently is not a lessee under any\nlease agreements with a term longer than one year. The Company is routinely a lessor in its rental contracts with customers. The term\nof these rental contracts is generally short-term in nature, and the Company believes these rentals would be treated as operating leases\nunder the new guidance; however, the Company has not completed a detailed review of its various lease and rental arrangements, and\nthese conclusions are subject to change.\nF-16\nGeospace Technologies Corporation and Subsidiaries\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements—(Continued)\nIn May 2014, the FASB issued guidance requiring entities to recognize revenue from contracts with customers by applying a\nfive-step model in accordance with the core principle to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount\nthat reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. In addition, this\nguidance specifies the accounting for some costs to obtain or fulfill a contract with a customer and expands disclosure requirements\nfor revenue recognition. In August 2015, the FASB issued guidance deferring the effective date of this guidance to annual periods\nbeginning after December 15, 2017, including interim reporting periods therein. Entities have the option to adopt this guidance either\nretrospectively or through a modified retrospective transition method. This new standard will supersede existing revenue guidance\nand affect the Company's revenue recognition process and the presentations or disclosures of the Company's consolidated financial\nstatements and footnotes. The Company recognizes revenue through three primary transactions types: (i) the immediate recognition\nof revenue through the routine delivery of products to its customers, (ii) the rental of equipment to its customers through short-term\noperating leases, and (iii) the recognition of revenue utilizing the percentage of completion method for the delivery of complex\nproducts requiring long manufacturing times and substantial engineering resources. The Company will adopt this standard in the first\nquarter of its fiscal year ending September 30, 2019 using the modified retrospective method. The Company’s evaluation of the\nstandard is complete and the Company has not identified any transaction that will have a material effect on revenues recorded in its\nconsolidated financial statements.\n2. Business Acquisition\nOn July 27, 2018, the Company acquired Quantum Technology Sciences, Inc., a Florida-based tactical security and\nsurveillance systems solutions provider (“Quantum”) through a merger of the Company’s subsidiary with and into Quantum, with\nQuantum as the surviving corporation. The acquisition represents the Company’s strategy to expand its product revenues, as well as\nits engineering and manufacturing competencies, to markets outside the oil and gas industry.\nThe acquisition purchase price for Quantum consisted of a cash down payment at closing of approximately $4.4 million and\ncontingent earn-out payments of up to $23.5 million over a four-year period.\nIn connection with the acquisition the Company recorded goodwill and other intangible assets of $12.5 million and\nestablished an initial contingent earn-out liability of $7.7 million. Current assets and current liabilities of $0.2 million and $0.6\nmillion were acquired in the transaction. The contingent earn-out payments, if any, which may be paid in the form of cash or\nCompany stock, will be derived from certain eligible revenue that may be generated during the four-year earn-out period.\nAcquisition related costs of $0.3 million incurred in connection with the transaction are included in selling, general and\nadministrative expenses in the Company’s consolidated financial statements.\n3. Short-term Investments\nDuring the fiscal years ended September 30, 2018, 2017 and 2016 the Company realized losses of $11,000, $3,000 and\n$5,000, respectively, from the sale of short-term investments. The realized losses are recorded in Other Income (Expense) on the\nconsolidated statements of operations. The Company’s short-term investments were composed of the following (in thousands):\nAS OF SEPTEMBER 30, 2018\nAmortized Unrealized Unrealized Estimated\nCost Gains Losses Fair Value\nShort-term investments:\nCorporate bonds................................................................. $ 17,851 $ — $ (60) $ 17,791\nGovernment bonds............................................................. 7,702 — (22) 7,680\nTotal................................................................................... $ 25,553 $ — $ (82) $ 25,471\nAS OF SEPTEMBER 30, 2017\nAmortized Unrealized Unrealized Estimated\nCost Gains Losses Fair Value\nShort-term investments:\nCorporate bonds................................................................. $ 22,832 $ — $ (34) $ 22,798\nGovernment bonds............................................................. 13,363 — (24) 13,339\nTotal................................................................................... $ 36,195 $ — $ (58) $ 36,137\nThe Company’s short-term investments have contractual maturities ranging from November 2018 to May 2020.\nF-17\nGeospace Technologies Corporation and Subsidiaries\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements—(Continued)\n4. Derivative Financial Instruments\nAt September 30, 2018 and 2017, the Company’s Canadian subsidiary had CAN$20.4 million and CAN$26.1 million,\nrespectively, of Canadian dollar denominated intercompany accounts payable owed to one of the Company’s U.S subsidiaries. In\norder to mitigate its exposure to movements in foreign currency rates between the U.S. dollar and Canadian dollar, the Company\nroutinely enters into foreign currency forward contracts to hedge a portion of its exposure to changes in the value of the Canadian\ndollar. On September 28, 2018, the Company entered into a CAN$30.0 million 90-day hedge contract with a United States Bank to\nreduce the impact on cash flows from movements in the Canadian dollar/U.S. dollar currency exchange rate, but has not been\ndesignated as a hedge for accounting purposes. On October 18, 2018, the Company reduced its hedge to CAN$20.0 million.\nThe following table summarizes the gross fair value of all derivative instruments, which are not designated as hedging\ninstruments and their location in the consolidated balance sheets (in thousands):\nDerivative Instrument Location September 30, 2018 September 30, 2017\nForeign Currency Forward Contracts.....

Fair Value of Financial Instruments\nAt September 30, 2018, the Company’s financial instruments included cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, a\nforeign currency forward contract, trade, notes and financing lease receivables and accounts payable. Due to the short-term maturities\nof cash and cash equivalents, trade and other receivables and accounts payable, the carrying amounts approximate fair value on the\nrespective balance sheet dates. The fair value of the intangible assets acquired in the Quantum acquisition was determined using a\ndiscounted cash flow analysis. The valuation technique used to measure the fair value of the contingent earn-out liability was derived\nfrom models utilizing market observable inputs.\nThe Company measures short-term investments and derivatives at fair value on a recurring basis.\nThe following tables present the fair value of the Company’s short-term investments, contingent earn-out liability and foreign\ncurrency forward contracts by valuation hierarchy and input (in thousands):\nAS OF SEPTEMBER 30, 2018\nQuoted Prices\nin Active\nMarkets for Significant Other Significant\nIdentical Assets Observable Unobservable\n(Level 1) (Level 2) (Level 3) Totals\nShort-term investments\nCorporate bonds................................................................. $ 17,791 $ — $ — $ 17,791\nGovernment bonds............................................................. 7,680 — — 7,680\nContingent earn-out liability................................................... — — (7,713) (7,713)\nForeign currency forward contract.......................................... — (270) — (270)\nTotal................................................................................... $ 25,471 $ (270) $ (7,713) $ 17,488\nF-18\nGeospace Technologies Corporation and Subsidiaries\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements—(Continued)\nAS OF SEPTEMBER 30, 2017\nQuoted Prices\nin Active\nMarkets for Significant Other Significant\nIdentical Assets Observable Unobservable\n(Level 1) (Level 2) (Level 3) Totals\nShort-term investments\nCorporate bonds................................................................. $ 22,798 $ — $ — $ 22,798\nGovernment bonds............................................................. 13,339 — — 13,339\nTotal................................................................................... $ 36,137 $ — $ — $ 36,137\nAssets and liabilities measured on a nonrecurring basis\nThe measurements utilized to determine the implied fair value of the Company’s long-lived assets and contingent earn-out\nliability as of September 30, 2018 represented significant unobservable inputs (Level 3).\n6.

Long-Term Debt\nThe Company had no long-term debt outstanding at September 30, 2018 and 2017.\nOn March 2, 2011, the Company entered into a credit agreement with Frost Bank (the “Original Credit Agreement”). The\nOriginal Credit Agreement has been amended periodically since 2011 (as so amended, the “Credit Agreement”). Under the Credit\nAgreement, which expires on April 30, 2019, the Company can borrow up to $30.0 million with amounts available for borrowing\ndetermined by a borrowing base. The borrowing base is determined based upon certain of the Company’s assets which include (i)\n80% of certain accounts receivable plus (ii) 50% of certain notes receivable (such result not to exceed $10 million) plus (iii) 25% of\ncertain inventories (such result not to exceed $20 million) and requires the Company to maintain unencumbered liquid assets of $10\nmillion. Subject to the borrowing base calculation, as of September 30, 2018, the amount available for borrowing was $21.5 million\nafter consideration of $0.3 million of outstanding letters of credit. The Company’s domestic subsidiaries have guaranteed the\nobligations of the Company under the Credit Agreement and such subsidiaries have secured their obligations under such guarantees by\nthe pledge of substantially all of the assets of such subsidiaries, except real property assets. The Company is required to make\nmonthly interest payments on borrowed funds. The Credit Agreement limits the incurrence of additional indebtedness and contains\nother covenants customary in agreements of this type. The interest rate for borrowings under the Credit Agreement is based on the\nWall Street Journal prime rate, which was 5.25% at September 30, 2018. At September 30, 2018, the Company was in compliance\nwith all covenants under the Credit Agreement. On November 8, 2018, the Company further amended the Credit Agreement to extend\nits expiration date to April 30, 2020.\n13. Accrued Expenses and Other Current Liabilities\nAccrued expenses and other current liabilities consisted of the following (in thousands):\nAS OF SEPTEMBER 30,\n2018 2017\nProduct warranty....................................................................................... $ 688 $ 508\nCompensated absences.............................................................................. 1,329 1,287\nLegal and professional fees....................................................................... 434 194\nPayroll........................................................................................................ 960 682\nProperty and sales taxes............................................................................. 1,977 2,383\nMedical claims........................................................................................... 450 550\nOther.......................................................................................................... 988 734\n$ 6,826 $ 6,338\nThe Company is self-insured for certain losses related to employee medical claims. The Company has purchased stop-loss\ncoverage for individual claims in excess of $175,000 per claimant per year in order to limit its exposure to any significant levels of\nemployee medical claims. Self-insured losses are accrued based on the Company’s historical experience and on estimates of\naggregate liability for uninsured claims incurred using certain actuarial assumptions followed in the insurance industry.\n14. Employee Benefits\nThe Company’s U.S. employees are participants in the Geospace Technologies Corporation’s Employee’s 401(k) Retirement\nPlan (the “Plan”), which covers substantially all eligible employees in the United States. The Plan is a qualified salary reduction plan\nin which all eligible participants may elect to have a percentage of their compensation contributed to the Plan, subject to certain\nguidelines issued by the Internal Revenue Service. The Company’s share of discretionary matching contributions was approximately\n$0.8 million in fiscal years 2018, 2017 and 2016.\nThe Company’s stock incentive plans in which key employees may participate are discussed in Note 15 to these consolidated\nfinancial statements.\nF-22\nGeospace Technologies Corporation and Subsidiaries\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements—(Continued)\n15. Stockholders’ Equity\nIn September 1997, the board of directors and stockholders approved the 1997 Key Employee Stock Option Plan (as\namended the “1997 Plan”) and, following amendments thereto, there has been reserved an aggregate of 2,250,000 shares of common\nstock for issuance thereunder. The 1997 Plan expired in November 2017.\nIn February 2014, the board of directors and stockholders approved the 2014 Long Term Incentive Plan (the “2014 Plan”),\nwhich replaced the 1997 Plan. Under the 2014 Plan, an aggregate of 1,500,000 shares of common stock may be issued. The\nCompany is authorized to issue nonqualified and incentive stock options to purchase common stock and restricted stock awards of\ncommon stock to key employees, directors and consultants under the 2014 Plan. Options have a term not to exceed ten years, with the\nexception of incentive stock options granted to employees owning ten percent or more of the outstanding shares of common stock,\nwhich have a term not to exceed five years. The exercise price of any option may not be less than the fair market value of the\ncommon stock on the date of grant. In the case of incentive stock options granted to an employee owning ten percent or more of the\noutstanding shares of common stock, the exercise price of such option may not be less than 110% of the fair market value of the\ncommon stock on the date of grant. Under the 2014 Plan, the Company may issue shares of restricted stock to employees for no\npayment by the employee or for a payment below the fair market value on the date of grant. The restricted stock is subject to certain\nrestrictions described in the 2014 Plan.\nAt September 30, 2018, an aggregate of 691,388 shares of common stock were available for issuance under the 2014 Plan.\nNo further awards of stock options may be made under the 1997 Plan.\nThe following table summarizes the combined activity under the equity incentive plans for the indicated periods:\nWeighted Weighted\nNumber of Average Average\nNonqualified Exercise Number of Grant-date\nOptions Price per Restricted Fair Value\nOutstanding Share Stock Awards per Share\nOutstanding at October 1, 2015............................................... 89,700 $ 17.27 142,500 $ 93.80\nGranted............................................................................... 69,300 14.87 182,400 14.84\nExercised............................................................................ — — — —\nForfeited............................................................................. — — (2,250) 77.33\nVested................................................................................. — — (49,000) 90.73\nOutstanding at September 30, 2016......................................... 159,000 16.23 273,650 39.98\nGranted............................................................................... 51,300 21.42 109,500 21.12\nExercised............................................................................

The\nweighted average grant date fair value of the restricted stock was $15.13 per share. The grant date fair value of these awards was\n$2.7 million, which will be charged to expense over the next four years as the restrictions lapse. Compensation expense for restricted\nstock awards was determined based on the closing market price of the Company’s stock on the date of grant applied to the total\nnumber of shares that are anticipated to fully vest. Recipients of restricted stock awards are entitled to vote such shares and are\nentitled to dividends, if paid.\nAll of the restricted stock outstanding at September 30, 2018 and 2017 were issued from the 2014 Plan. The 89,700 stock\noptions outstanding at October 1, 2015 were issued under the 1997 Plan. All remaining stock options granted subsequent to October\n1, 2015 were granted under the 2014 Plan. All stock options outstanding are nonqualified options.\nThe total intrinsic value of the Company’s nonqualified stock options exercised during fiscal year 2018 and 2017 was\n$41,000 and $45,000, respectively.

As of September 30, 2018, the Company had unrecognized\ncompensation expense of $3.9 million relating to restricted stock awards. This unrecognized compensation expense is expected to be\nrecognized over a weighted average period of 2.6 years.

(45) (37)\n$ 201 $ 222\nThe 2017 Tax Act was enacted in December 2017. The 2017 Tax Act, among other things, reduces the U.S. federal corporate\ntax rate from 35% to 21%, effective January 1, 2018, creates new taxes on certain foreign earnings and may require companies to pay\na one-time transition tax on undistributed earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries that were previously tax deferred. The Company is\nnot required to pay a one-time transition tax on earnings of our foreign subsidiaries since there were no accumulated earnings on a\nconsolidated basis. As a result of the 2017 Tax Act, the Company revalued its U.S. our deferred tax assets based on a U.S. federal tax\nrate of 21%, which resulted in a reduction to our deferred tax assets of approximately $8.1 million. This amount was offset by a like\nreduction to the valuation allowance.\nThe financial reporting basis of investments in foreign subsidiaries exceed their tax basis. A deferred tax liability is not\nrecorded for this temporary difference because the investment is deemed to be permanent. A reversal of the Company’s plans to\npermanently invest in these foreign operations would cause the excess to become taxable. At September 30, 2018, the Company had\n$7.3 million of cash and cash equivalents held by its foreign subsidiaries. At September 30, 2018 and 2017, the temporary difference\nrelated to undistributed earnings for which no deferred taxes have been provided was approximately $12.9 million and $12.8 million,\nrespectively.\nTax return filings which are subject to review by local tax authorities by major jurisdiction are as follows:\n(cid:129) United States—fiscal years ended September 30, 2015 through 2018\n(cid:129) State of Texas—fiscal years ended September 30, 2015 through 2018\n(cid:129) State of New York—fiscal years ended September 30, 2016 through 2018\n(cid:129) State of California – fiscal years ended September 30, 2015 through 2018\n(cid:129) State of Pennsylvania – fiscal years ended September 30, 2016 through 2018\n(cid:129) Russian Federation—calendar years 2016 through 2018\n(cid:129) Canada—fiscal years ended September 30, 2015 through 2018\n(cid:129) United Kingdom—fiscal years ended September 30, 2017 through 2018\n(cid:129) Colombia—calendar years 2016 through 2018\nF-26\nGeospace Technologies Corporation and Subsidiaries\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements—(Continued)\nThe following table is a reconciliation of the total amounts of unrecognized tax liabilities (in thousands):\nBalance at October 1, 2015........................................................... $ 75\nChange in prior year tax positions................................................

The NOL carry-forwards for Canada and Russia begin to expire in 2033 and 2026, respectively. The NOL carry-\nforward for the United States which originated prior to the 2017 Tax Act of $49.4 million begins to expire in 2028. The Company’s\nNOLs originating after the 2017 Tax Act of $12.8 million do not expire.\nDuring the year ended September 30, 2016, management concluded that it was more-likely-than-not that all of our U.S. and\nCanadian net deferred tax assets will not be realized in accordance with U.S. GAAP. At September 30, 2018 and September 30, 2017,\nwe had a valuation allowance against our U.S. net deferred tax assets of $20.9 million and $23.6 million, respectively, and a valuation\nallowance against our Canadian net deferred tax assets of $4.4 million and $4.7 million, respectively.\n17. Loss Per Common Share\nThe Company applies the two-class method in calculating per share data. Basic loss per share is computed by dividing net\nloss available to common stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares used in basic loss per share during the\nperiod. Diluted loss per share is determined on the assumption that outstanding dilutive stock options have been exercised and the\naggregate proceeds as defined were used to reacquire common stock using the average price of such common stock for the period.\nF-27\nGeospace Technologies Corporation and Subsidiaries\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements—(Continued)\nThe following table summarizes the calculation of net loss and weighted average common shares and common equivalent\nshares outstanding for purposes of the computation of loss per share (in thousands, except share and per share amounts):\nYEAR ENDED SEPTEMBER 30,\n2018 2017 2016\nNet loss...................................................................................... $ (19,212) $ (56,791) $ (45,970)\nLess: Income allocable to unvested restricted stock................. — — —\nLoss available to common shareholders...................................

Related Party Transactions\nThe Company regularly transacts business with Creative Marketing Services, LP (“CMS”), a company owned by the spouse\nof Richard F. Miles, a director of the Company. CMS is a marketing company which has historically provided marketing,\ncommunications, and support services to the Company, including product photography, video shoots, brochure design, magazine\nadvertising, website design, annual report production and various other marketing and advertising services. For fiscal years 2018,\n2017 and 2016, the Company incurred expenses of $13,000, $7,000, and $39,000, respectively, to CMS for these services.\n19. Exit and Disposal Activities\nIn December 2017, the Company initiated a program to reduce operating costs in light of expected and continuing low levels\nof product demand. The program was expected to produce approximately $6 million of annualized cash savings. The majority of the\ncost reductions were realized through a reduction of over 60 employees from the Company’s Houston area workforce. In connection\nwith the workforce reductions, the Company incurred $0.7 million of termination costs in its first quarter of fiscal year 2018. The\ntermination costs were recorded to both cost of revenue and operating expenses in the consolidated statement of operations. No\nfurther termination costs are expected and there are no outstanding liabilities related to this program as of September 30, 2018.\n20. Commitments and Contingencies\nContingent Earn-out Liability\nThe Company established an initial earn-out liability of $7.7 million in connection with its July 2018 acquisition of Quantum.\nThe contingent earn-out payments, if any, which at the Company’s option may be paid in the form of cash or Company stock, will be\nderived from certain eligible revenue that may be generated by Quantum during the four-year earn-out period. The Company reviews\nand accesses the value of the contingent earn-out liability on a quarterly basis. The maximum amount of contingent payments is $23.5\nmillion over the four-year earn-out period.\nF-28\nGeospace Technologies Corporation and Subsidiaries\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements—(Continued)\nOperating Leases\nThe Company leases office space and certain equipment for terms of one year or less. Rent expense was approximately $0.1\nmillion, $0.1 million and $0.2 million during fiscal years 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.\nLegal Proceedings\nThe Company is involved in various pending legal actions in the ordinary course of its business. Management is unable to\npredict the ultimate outcome of these actions, because of the inherent uncertainty of litigation. However, management believes that\nthe most probable, ultimate resolution of current pending matters will not have a material adverse effect on the Company’s\nconsolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.\n21.

Segment and Geographic Information\nEffective September 30, 2018, the Company began reporting and evaluating financial information for three operating\nbusiness segments: Oil and Gas Markets, Adjacent Markets and Emerging Markets. The Oil and Gas Markets segment was previously\nreferred to as our Seismic segment. This segment’s products include wireless seismic data acquisition systems, reservoir\ncharacterization products and services, and traditional seismic exploration products such as geophones, hydrophones, leader wire,\nconnectors, cables, marine streamer retrieval and steering devices and various other seismic products. Our Adjacent Markets segment\nwas previously referred to as our Non-Seismic segment. This segment’s products include imaging equipment, water meter products,\noffshore cables, as well as seismic sensors used for vibration monitoring and geotechnical applications such as mine safety\napplications and earthquake detection. The Emerging Markets segment was added in conjunction with the acquisition of Quantum,\nwhich designs and markets seismic products targeted at the border and perimeter security markets.\nF-29\nGeospace Technologies Corporation and Subsidiaries\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements—(Continued)\nThe following tables summarize the Company’s segment information:\nYEAR ENDED SEPTEMBER 30,\n2018 2017 2016\nRevenue:\nOil and Gas Markets............................................................ $ 44,951 $ 47,109 $ 33,792\nAdjacent Markets................................................................. 29,932 26,027 27,708\nEmerging Markets............................................................... 286 — —\nCorporate............................................................................. 579 585 560\nTotal..................................................................................... 75,748 73,721 62,060\nIncome (loss) from operations:\nOil and Gas Markets............................................................

This error has been identified and corrected in the restated consolidated balance sheets as of September 30, 2016 and 2015 and\nas of December 31, 2016, March 31, 2017 and June 30, 2017 in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The effects of this restatement\nconsist of a non-cash reclassification with respect to inventories. The restatement did not affect previously reported total assets, total\nliabilities, revenues, net loss, loss per share, or cash flows. For discussions of the restatement adjustments, see Item 1A. “Risk Factors”\nand Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data”, including Notes 21 and 22 of the notes to the Consolidated Financial\nStatements.\nAdditionally, in connection with the errors noted above, our management, including the CEO and CFO, has identified a\nmaterial weakness in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2017 and 2016 and has been\nengaged in a focused review of its financial reporting practices and remediation of the related control weakness. For a discussion of\nour controls and procedures, the material weakness identified and our actions to remediate such weakness see Item 9A, “Controls and\nProcedures” in Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10-K,\nWe believe that presenting all of this information regarding the Restated Periods in this Annual Report allows investors to\nreview all pertinent data in a single presentation. We do not therefore plan to amend our previously filed Annual Report on Form 10-\nK the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016 and Forms 10-Q for the quarterly periods ended December 31, 2016, March 31, 2017 and\nJune 30, 2017 in connection with the restatement. The financial information that has been previously filed or otherwise reported for\nthe Restated Periods is superseded by the information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Unless otherwise stated, all financial\ninformation contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for periods prior to September 30, 2017 are presented on a restated basis.\n\nPART I\nItem 1. Business\nBusiness Overview\nGeospace Technologies Corporation reincorporated as a Texas corporation on April 16, 2015. We originally incorporated as\na Delaware corporation on September 27, 1994. Unless otherwise specified, the discussion in this Annual Report on Form 10-K refers\nto Geospace Technologies Corporation and its subsidiaries. We design and manufacture instruments and equipment used in the oil\nand gas industry to acquire seismic data in order to locate, characterize and monitor hydrocarbon producing reservoirs. We also\ndesign and manufacture non-seismic products, including industrial products, offshore cables and imaging equipment. We report and\ncategorize our customers and products into two different segments: Seismic and Non-Seismic.\nWe have engaged in the seismic instrument and equipment business since 1980 and market our products primarily to the oil\nand gas industry. Demand for our products has been, and will likely continue to be, vulnerable to downturns in the economy and the\noil and gas industry in general. For more information, please refer to the risks discussed under the heading “Risk Factors.”\nProducts and Product Development\nSeismic Products\nOur seismic business segment has historically accounted for the majority of our revenue. Geoscientists use seismic data\nprimarily in connection with the exploration, development and production of oil and gas reserves to map potential and known\nhydrocarbon bearing formations and the geologic structures that surround them. Our seismic product lines currently consist of land\nand marine nodal data acquisition systems, permanent land and seabed reservoir monitoring products and services, geophones and\ngeophone strings, hydrophones, leader wire, connectors, telemetry cables, marine streamer retrieval and steering devices and various\nother products. Our seismic products are compatible with most major competitive seismic data acquisition systems currently in use.\nWe believe that our seismic products are among the most technologically advanced instruments and equipment available for seismic\ndata acquisition.\nTraditional Products\nAn energy source and a data recording system are combined to acquire seismic data. We provide many of the components of\nseismic data recording systems, including geophones, hydrophones, multi-component sensors, leader wire, geophone strings,\nconnectors, seismic telemetry cables and other seismic related products. On land, our customers use geophones, leader wire, cables\nand connectors to receive and measure seismic reflections resulting from an energy source into data recording units, which store the\nseismic information for subsequent processing and analysis. In the marine environment, large ocean-going vessels tow long seismic\ncables known as “streamers” containing hydrophones which are used to detect pressure changes. Hydrophones transmit electrical\nimpulses back to the vessel’s data recording unit where the seismic data is stored for subsequent processing and analysis. Our marine\nseismic products also help steer streamers while being towed and help recover streamers if they become disconnected from the vessel.\nOur seismic sensor, cable and connector products are compatible with most major competitive seismic data acquisition\nsystems currently in use. Revenue from these products results primarily from seismic contractors purchasing our products as\ncomponents of new seismic data acquisition systems or to repair and replace components of seismic data acquisition systems already\nin use.\nOur products used in marine seismic data acquisition include our seismic streamer retrieval devices (“SRDs”). Occasionally,\nstreamer cables are severed and become disconnected from the vessel as a result of obstacles, inclement weather, vessel traffic or\nhuman error. Our SRDs, which are attached to the streamer cables, contain air bags which are designed to inflate automatically at a\ngiven water depth, bringing the severed streamer cables to the surface. These SRDs save the seismic contractors significant time and\nmoney compared to the alternative of losing the streamer cable. We also produce seismic streamer steering devices, or “birds,” which\nare fin-like devices that attach to the streamer cable. These birds help maintain the streamer cable at a certain desired depth as it is\nbeing towed through the water.\nWireless Products\nWe have developed a land-based wireless (or nodal) seismic data acquisition system called the GSX. Rather than utilizing\ninterconnecting cables as required by most traditional land data acquisition systems, each GSX station operates as an independent data\ncollection system, allowing our GSX stations to be deployed in virtually unlimited channel configurations. As a result, our GSX\nsystem requires less maintenance, which we believe allows our customers to operate more effectively and efficiently because of its\nreduced environmental impact, lower weight and ease of operation. Our GSX system is designed into configurations ranging from\n1\none to four channels per station. Since its introduction in 2008 and through September 30, 2017, we have sold 403,000 GSX channels\nand we have 71,000 GSX channels in our rental fleet. We expect to make additional investments in our GSX rental fleet in fiscal year\n2018 to replenish a sale of used GSX rental equipment in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2017.\nWe have also developed a marine-based wireless seismic data acquisition system called the OBX. Similar to our GSX land-\nbased wireless system, the marine OBX system can be deployed in virtually unlimited channel configurations and does not require\ninterconnecting cables between each station. Our deep water versions of the OBX system can be deployed in depths of up to 3,450\nmeters. Through September 30, 2017, we have sold approximately 600 OBX stations and we have 6,700 OBX stations in our rental\nfleet. We expect to make additional investments into our OBX rental fleet during fiscal year 2018.\nReservoir Products\nSeismic surveys repeated over selected time intervals show dynamic changes within the reservoir and can be used to monitor\nthe effects of oil and gas development and production. In this regard, we have developed permanently installed high-definition\nreservoir monitoring systems for land and ocean-bottom applications in producing oil and gas fields. We also produce a retrievable\nversion of our ocean-bottom system for use on fields where permanently installed systems are not appropriate or economical.\nUtilizing these tools, producers can enhance the recovery of oil and gas deposits over the life of a reservoir.\nOur high-definition reservoir monitoring products include the HDSeis™ product line and a suite of borehole and reservoir\nmonitoring products and services. Our HDSeis™ system is a high-definition seismic data acquisition system with flexible architecture\nthat allows it to be configured as a borehole seismic system or as a subsurface system for both land and marine reservoir-monitoring\nprojects. The scalable architecture of the HDSeis™ system enables custom designed system configuration for applications ranging\nfrom low-channel engineering and environmental-scale surveys requiring a minimum number of recording channels to high-channel\nsurveys required to efficiently conduct permanent reservoir monitoring (“PRM”). Modular architecture allows virtually unlimited\nchannel expansion. In addition, multi-system synchronization features make the HDSeis™ system well suited for multi-well or multi-\nsite acquisition, simultaneous surface and downhole acquisition and continuous reservoir monitoring projects.\nReservoir monitoring requires special purpose or custom designed systems in which portability becomes less critical and\nfunctional reliability assumes greater importance. This reliability factor helps assure successful operations in inaccessible locations\nover a considerable period of time. Additionally, reservoirs located in deep water or harsh environments require special\ninstrumentation and new techniques to maximize recovery. Reservoir monitoring also requires high-bandwidth, high-resolution\nseismic data for engineering project planning and reservoir management. We believe our HDSeis™ System and tools, designed for\ncost-effective deployment and lifetime performance, will make borehole and seabed seismic acquisition a cost-effective and reliable\nprocess for the challenges of reservoir monitoring. Our multi-component seismic product developments include an omni-directional\ngeophone for use in reservoir monitoring, a compact marine three-component or four-component gimbaled sensor and special-purpose\nconnectors, connector arrays and cases.\nWe did not deliver nor did we receive orders for any PRM systems during the fiscal years 2015, 2016 and 2017.\nIn addition, we produce seismic borehole acquisition systems which employ a fiber optic augmented wireline capable of very\nhigh data transmission rates. These systems are used for several reservoir monitoring applications, including an application pioneered\nby us allowing operators and service companies to monitor and measure the results of fracturing operations.\nNon-Seismic Products\nOur non-seismic businesses leverage upon our existing manufacturing facilities and engineering capabilities. We have found\nthat many of our seismic products, with little or no modification, have direct application to industries beyond those involved in oil and\ngas exploration and development. For example, our customers utilize our borehole tools to monitor subsurface carbon dioxide\ninjections and for mine safety applications.\nOur non-seismic products include electronic pre-press products that employ direct thermal imaging and digital inkjet printing\ntechnologies targeted at the commercial graphics, industrial graphics, textile and flexographic printing industries. Our other non-\nseismic products consist of (i) sensors and tools for vibration monitoring, mine safety application and earthquake detection, (ii) cables\nfor power and communication for the offshore oil and gas and offshore construction industries, (iii) water meter cables and\nconnectors, and (iv) other specialty industrial cable and connector products.\nBusiness Strategy\nWe are currently experiencing depressed industry conditions as a result of lower and volatile crude oil prices and their impact\nupon capital spending in the oil and gas industry worldwide. The resulting significant decline in seismic product orders and, in\nparticular, the lack of any orders for PRM systems, has required us to modify our business strategy during this difficult period. Our\ncurrent business strategy places more focus on sound financial management practices while we endure this downturn. We have not\n2\nchanged our primary focus on continued investment in product research and development and, possibly, selective acquisitions and\njoint ventures.\n(cid:129) Continue Investment in Product Research and Development – Past periods of revenue growth were primarily driven\nthrough our internal development of new products for the seismic industry. In past years, our seismic product\ninnovations included the introduction of borehole seismology tools, seabed PRM systems and wireless data acquisition\nsystems for both land and marine applications. These innovative technologies are the result of our unceasing investment\nin research and development initiatives, even during difficult industry cycles when we experience a significant decline in\ncustomer demand for our products. A majority of our product research and development cost relates to our product\nengineers. Our engineering staff has been key to our past success, and we intend to continue our tradition of retaining\nand attracting quality engineering staff and providing appropriate compensation and benefits. Going forward, we intend\nto continue significant investments in product research and development of new seismic technologies as well as non-\nseismic products in order to diversify and grow our revenue base.\n(cid:129) Selectively Pursue Acquisitions of Businesses with Technological and Engineering Overlap – The seismic industry\nperiodically experiences volatile business cycles requiring us to rapidly increase and decrease our business activities to\nmeet the industry’s demand for our products. The seismic industry generally offers equipment manufacturers like us\nlimited visibility into new orders creating challenges for us to manage our manufacturing capacity, workforce and\nworking capital. While our primary growth initiative is to expand our seismic product offerings, we may also seek out\nother non-seismic business opportunities which complement our existing products, engineering and manufacturing\ncapabilities, and company-wide culture. While we routinely evaluate both seismic and non-seismic business acquisition\nopportunities, we may direct these efforts toward non-seismic businesses in order to diversify our revenue base and\nexpose us to different markets with different business cycles.\n(cid:129) Financial Management – Current industry conditions have required us to place increased emphasis on cash management\nand preservation. Due to the cyclicality of the seismic industry, we have historically managed our financial risk by\nlimiting or eliminating debt leverage in our balance sheet. While we are not opposed to moderate amounts of short-term\ndebt during favorable business cycles, we choose to minimize our exposure to long-term debt obligations which, in our\nview, restrict our ability to operate during periodic difficult business cycles in the seismic industry similar to the current\nbusiness environment. We believe this strategy has allowed us to continue operations through difficult business cycles\nwithout disruption for debt and equity restructuring as has been seen among our peers, many of whom have significant\nlong-term debt burdens. In addition, we have limited investments in our capital assets and have liquidated, and made\nappropriate reserves for, significant amounts of our inventories and rental fleet assets. We also believe that the value of\nour common shares outstanding will be best served in the long-term by retaining our cash and short-term investments to\nfund future cash outflows as they become necessary or advisable. In this regard, we do not anticipate paying any cash\ndividends in the foreseeable future, nor do we expect to initiate any significant buy-back program to repurchase our\ncommon stock.\nSegment and Geographic Information\nWe report and categorize our revenue and products into two business segments: Seismic and Non-Seismic. Our Seismic\nproduct segments currently include traditional exploration products, wireless exploration products and reservoir products. Our Non-\nSeismic product segments include imaging and industrial products. Frequently, we receive a minor amount of Seismic product\nrevenue from our Non-Seismic customers. For a discussion of financial information by segment and geographic area, see Note 20 to\nthe consolidated financial statements contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nCompetition\nSeismic Products\nWe are one of the world’s largest designers and manufacturers of seismic related products. The principal competitors for\nmany of our traditional seismic products are Sercel (a division of CGG), ION Geophysical (“ION”) and INOVA (a joint venture\nformed in 2009 between ION and Bureau of Geophysical Prospecting, a subsidiary of China National Petroleum Company).\nFurthermore, entities in China affiliated with Sercel as well as other Chinese manufacturers produce low-cost seismic products\nmeeting current industry standards. Most seismic products are price sensitive, so the ability to manufacture these products at a low\ncost is essential to maintain market share. We believe our primary competitor in the manufacture of our marine products is Sercel.\nThe primary competitors for our land wireless data acquisition systems are Sercel, FairfieldNodal, INOVA, Wireless Seismic\nand numerous smaller entities who have recently introduced new versions of wireless data acquisition systems. We believe the\nprimary competitors for our marine nodal data acquisition systems are marine seismic data acquisition service providers like\nFairfieldNodal, Seabed Geosolutions (a joint venture formed between Fugro and CGG), and Magseis ASA, each of whom utilizes\ntheir own proprietary nodal technology. For land and marine wireless data acquisition systems, while price is an important factor in a\n3\ncustomer’s decision to purchase the product, we believe customers also place a high value on a product’s historical performance and\nthe ongoing engineering and field support provided by the product’s manufacturer.\nOur primary competitors for rental of our traditional and wireless seismic equipment are Mitcham Industries, Inc. and\nSeismic Equipment Solutions.\nOur primary competitors for our seabed PRM systems are Alcatel-Lucent and Petroleum Geo-Services ASA. We believe our\nprimary competitors for high-definition borehole seismic data acquisition systems are Avalon Sciences Ltd and Sercel. A product’s\nhistorical performance, field support and engineering capabilities are important factors for receiving orders for our seismic reservoir\nproducts.\nThe principal keys for success in the seismic instruments and equipment market are technological superiority, product\ndurability, reliability, and customer support. Price and product delivery are always important considerations for our customers. In\ngeneral, most customers prefer to standardize data acquisition systems, geophones and hydrophones, particularly if they are used by\nseismic companies that have multiple crews which are able to support each other. This standardization makes it difficult for\ncompetitive manufacturers to gain market share from other manufacturers with existing customer relationships.\nAs mentioned above, a key factor for seismic instruments and equipment manufacturers is durability under harsh field\nconditions. Seismic instruments and equipment must meet not only rigorous technical specifications regarding signal integrity and\nsensitivity, but must also be extremely rugged and durable to withstand the rigors of field use, often in harsh environments.\nNon-Seismic Products\nThere are numerous competitors and competitive technologies including other direct thermal printer manufacturers and\nmanufacturers of direct-to-screen and inkjet solutions. Our non-seismic industrial products face competition from numerous domestic\nand international specialty product manufacturers.\nSuppliers\nWe purchase raw materials from a variety of suppliers located in various countries. We typically have multiple suppliers for\nour critical materials. We purchase all of our thermal film from a single supplier. Except for the film sold to us by this supplier, we\nknow of no other source for thermal film that performs as well in our imaging equipment. In addition, certain models of our marine\nwireless products use a timing device manufactured by a single supplier. We currently do not possess the ability to manufacture this\ncomponent and have no other source for this device. For a discussion of the risks related to our reliance on these suppliers, see “Risk\nFactors – We Rely on Key Suppliers for Certain Components Used in Our Products.”\nWe do not currently experience any significant difficulties in obtaining raw materials from our suppliers for the production of\nour seismic or non-seismic products.\nProduct Manufacturing and Assembly\nOur manufacturing and product assembly operations consist of machining, molding or cabling the necessary component\nparts, configuring these parts along with components received from various vendors and assembling a final product. We manufacture\nseismic equipment to the specifications of our customers. For example, we can armor cables for use in multiple deep water\napplications. We assemble geophone strings and seismic telemetry cables based on a number of customer choices such as length,\ngauge, tolerance and color of molded parts. Upon completion of our manufacturing and assembly operations, we test our final\nproducts to the functional and, in the case of seismic equipment, environmental extremes of product specifications and inspect the\nproducts for quality assurance. Consistent with industry practice, we normally manufacture and ship our products based on firm\ncustomer orders, anticipated customer orders and historical product demand. As a result of the steep decline in product demand that\nbegan in fiscal year 2014 and that was further aggravated by the decline in crude oil prices, we currently hold significant inventories\nof finished goods. Our finished goods inventories also include sub-assemblies of extensively manufactured products.\nMarkets and Customers\nOur principal customers for our traditional and wireless seismic products are seismic contractors and, to a lesser extent, major\nindependent and government-owned oil and gas companies that either operate their own seismic crews or specify seismic instrument\nand equipment preferences to contractors. For our deep water PRM products, our customers are generally large international oil and\ngas companies that operate long-term offshore oil and gas producing properties. Our graphics imaging customers primarily consist of\ndirect users of our equipment as well as specialized resellers that focus on the screen-printing and flexographic printing industries.\nOur industrial product customers consist of specialty manufacturers, research institutions and industrial product distributors. One\ncustomer comprised 17.8% of our revenue during fiscal year 2017. One customer comprised 18.5% of our revenue during fiscal year\n4\n2016. No customer comprised 10% or more of our revenue during fiscal year 2015. The following table describes our revenue by\ncustomer type (in thousands):\nYEAR ENDED SEPTEMBER 30,\n2017 2016 2015\nTraditional seismic exploration product revenue...................... $ 14,756 $ 13,298 $ 30,083\nWireless seismic exploration product revenue.......................... 29,690 18,400 25,070\nSeismic reservoir product revenue............................................ 2,663 2,094 5,412\nIndustrial product revenue........................................................ 14,420 16,223 11,965\nImaging product revenue.......................................................... 11,607 11,485 11,793\nCorporate................................................................................... 585 560 544\n$ 73,721 $ 62,060 $ 84,867\nIntellectual Property\nWe seek to protect our intellectual property by means of patents, trademarks, trade secrets and other measures. We hold\npatents on geophones, micro-geophones, seismic data acquisition, in-line retrieval devices and water meter connectors, and we have\npending applications on related technology. We do not consider any single patent essential to our success. Our patents are scheduled\nto expire at various dates through 2035. At this time we are not able to predict the effect of any patent expiration. We protect our\nproprietary rights to our technology through a variety of methods, including confidentiality agreements and proprietary information\nagreements with suppliers, employees, consultants and others who may have access to proprietary information.\nResearch and Development\nWe expect to incur significant future research and development expenditures aimed at the development of additional seismic\nand non-seismic products. We have incurred company-sponsored research and development expenses of $13.8 million, $13.9 million\nand $14.7 million during the fiscal years ended September 30, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.\nEmployees\nAs of September 30, 2017, we employed 707 people predominantly on a full-time basis, of which 429 were employed in the\nUnited States, 238 in the Russian Federation and the remainder in the United Kingdom, Canada, China and Colombia. A majority of\nour employees in the Russian Federation belong to a regional union for machine manufacturers. Our remaining employees are not\nunionized. We have never experienced a work stoppage and consider our relationship with our employees to be satisfactory.\nFinancial Information by Segment and Geographic Area\nFor a discussion of financial information by segment and geographic area, see Note 20 to the consolidated financial\nstatements contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. For a description of risks attendant to our foreign operations, please see\n“Risk Factors - Our Foreign Subsidiaries and Foreign Marketing Efforts Are Subject to Additional Political, Economic, Legal and\nOther Uncertainties Not Generally Associated with Domestic Operations.”\nAvailable Information\nWe file annual, quarterly and special reports, proxy statements and other information with the Securities and Exchange\nCommission (“SEC”).

Risk Factors\nRisk Factors\nCommodity Price Levels May Affect Demand for Our Products, Which Has and Could Continue to Materially and Adversely\nAffect Our Results of Operations and Liquidity\nDemand for many of our products and the profitability of our operations depend primarily on the level of worldwide oil and\ngas exploration activity. Prevailing oil and gas prices, with an emphasis on crude oil prices, and market expectations regarding\npotential changes in such prices significantly affect the level of worldwide oil and gas exploration activity. During periods of\nimproved energy commodity prices, the capital spending budgets of oil and natural gas operators tend to expand, which results in\nincreased demand for our products. Conversely, in periods when these energy commodity prices deteriorate, capital spending budgets\nof oil and natural gas operators tend to contract and the demand for our products generally weakens. Historically, the markets for oil\nand gas have been volatile and are subject to wide fluctuation in response to changes in the supply of and demand for oil and gas,\nmarket uncertainty and a variety of additional factors that are beyond our control. These factors include the level of consumer\ndemand, supplies of oil and natural gas, regional and international economic conditions, weather conditions, domestic and foreign\ngovernmental regulations (including those related to climate change), price and availability of alternative fuels, political conditions,\ninstability and hostilities in the Middle East and other significant oil-producing regions, increases and decreases in the supply of oil\nand gas, the effect of worldwide energy conservation measures and the ability of OPEC to set and maintain production levels and\nprices of foreign imports.\nUncertainty in the European markets and slowing economic growth in growing economies like those in China and India\ncould lead to a decline in demand for crude oil and natural gas. Slowdowns in economic activity would likely reduce worldwide\ndemand for energy and result in an extended period of lower crude oil and natural gas prices. Any material changes in oil and gas\nprices or other market trends that adversely impact seismic exploration activity would likely affect the demand for our products and\ncould materially and adversely affect our results of operations and liquidity.\nGenerally, as exists at present, imbalances in the supply and demand for oil and gas will ordinarily affect oil and gas prices\nand, in such circumstances, our company will be adversely affected as now with world supplies exceeding demand.\nOur New Products Require a Substantial Investment by Us in Research and Development Expense and May Not Achieve Market\nAcceptance\nOur outlook and assumptions are based on various macro-economic factors and internal assessments, and actual market\nconditions could vary materially from those assumed. In recent years, we have incurred significant expenditures to fund our research\nand development efforts, and we intend to continue those expenditures in the future. However, research and development is by its\nnature speculative, and we cannot assure you that these expenditures will result in the development of new products or services or that\nany new products and services we have developed recently or may develop in the future will be commercially marketable or profitable\nto us. In particular, we have incurred substantial expenditures to develop our land and marine wireless nodal seismic data acquisition\nsystems, as well as other seismic products for PRM applications. In addition, we try to use some of our capabilities to supply products\nto new markets. We cannot assure you that we will realize our expectations regarding acceptance of and revenue generated by our\nnew products and services in existing or new markets.\nThe Short Term Nature of Our Order Backlog and Delayed or Canceled Customer Orders May Cause Us to Experience\nFluctuations in Quarterly Results of Operations\nHistorically, the rate of new orders for our products has varied substantially from quarter to quarter. Moreover, we typically\noperate, and expect to continue operating, on the basis of orders in-hand for our products before we commence substantial\nmanufacturing “runs.” The short-term nature of our order backlog for most products generally does not allow us to predict with any\naccuracy demand for our products more than approximately three months in advance. Thus, our ability to replenish orders and the\ncompletion of orders, particularly large orders for deep water PRM projects, can significantly impact our operating results and cash\nflow for any quarter, and results of operations for any one quarter may not be indicative of results of operations for future quarters.\nAdditionally, customers can delay or even cancel orders and rental contracts before delivery. For larger orders, we attempt to\nnegotiate for a non-refundable deposit or cancellation penalties depending on our relationship with the customer. However, such\ndeposits or penalties, even when obtained, may not fully compensate us for our inventory investment and forgone profits if the order is\nultimately cancelled.\nThese periodic fluctuations in our operating results and the impact of any order delays/cancellations could adversely affect\nour stock price.\n6\nOur Credit Risk Could Increase and We May Incur Bad Debt Write-Offs if Our Customers Continue to Face Difficult Economic\nCircumstances\nWe believe that our allowance for bad debts is adequate in light of known circumstances. However, we cannot assure you\nthat additional amounts attributable to uncollectible accounts and notes receivable and bad debt write-offs will not have a material\nadverse effect on our future results of operations. Many of our seismic customers are not well capitalized and as a result cannot\nalways pay our invoices when due. We have in the past incurred write-offs in our accounts and notes receivable due to customer\ncredit problems. We have found it necessary from time to time to extend trade credit, including promissory notes, to long-term\ncustomers and others where some risks of non-payment exist. With the recent decline in oil prices and a decline in seismic activities\naround the world, some of our seismic customers may experience significant liquidity difficulties, which increase those credit risks.\nAn increase in the level of bad debts and any deterioration in our credit risk could adversely affect the price of our stock. In addition,\nwe rent equipment to our customers which utilize such equipment in various countries around the world. If our rental customers\nexperience financial difficulties, it could be difficult or impossible to retrieve our rental equipment from foreign countries.\nOur Industry is Characterized by Rapid Technological Development and Product Obsolescence, Which May Affect Our Ability to\nProvide Product Enhancements or New Products on a Timely and Cost Effective Basis\nOur instruments and equipment are constantly undergoing rapid technological improvement. Our future success depends on\nour ability to continue to:\n(cid:129) improve our existing product lines,\n(cid:129) address the increasingly sophisticated needs of our customers,\n(cid:129) maintain a reputation for technological leadership,\n(cid:129) maintain market acceptance of our products,\n(cid:129) anticipate changes in technology and industry standards,\n(cid:129) respond to technological developments on a timely basis and\n(cid:129) develop new markets for our products and capabilities.\nCurrent competitors or new market entrants may develop new technologies, products or standards that could render our\nproducts obsolete. We cannot assure you that we will be successful in developing and marketing, on a timely and cost effective basis,\nproduct enhancements or new products that respond to technological developments, that are accepted in the marketplace or that\ncomply with new industry standards. Additionally, in anticipation of customer product orders, from time to time we acquire\nsubstantial quantities of inventories, which if not sold or integrated into products within a reasonable period of time, could become\nobsolete. In such case, we would be required to impair the value of such inventories on our balance sheet.\nWe Operate in Highly Competitive Markets and Our Competitors May Be Able to Provide Newer or Better Products Than We Are\nAble to Provide\nThe markets for most of our products are highly competitive. Many of our existing and potential competitors have\nsubstantially greater marketing, financial and technical resources than we do. Some competitors currently offer a broader range of\ninstruments and equipment for sale than we do and may offer financing arrangements to customers on terms that we may not be able\nto match. In addition, new competitors may enter the market and competition could intensify. As to our non-seismic imaging\nsolutions, we compete with other printing solutions, including inkjet and laser printing technologies, many of which are provided by\nlarge companies with significant resources.\nWe cannot assure you that revenue from our products will continue at current volumes or prices if current competitors or new\nmarket entrants introduce new products with better features, performance, price or other characteristics than our products.\nCompetitive pressures or other factors may also result in significant price competition that could have a material adverse effect on our\nresults of operations.\nThe Limited Market for Our Seismic Products Can Affect Our Revenue in the Seismic Business Segment\nIn our seismic business segment, we generally market our traditional and wireless products to seismic service contractors.\nWe estimate that, based on published industry sources, fewer than 50 seismic contracting companies are currently operating in\ncountries other than those operating in the Russian Federation and the former Soviet Union, India, the People’s Republic of China and\ncertain Eastern European countries, where seismic data acquisition activity is difficult to verify. We estimate that fewer than 20\nseismic contractors are engaged in marine seismic exploration. Due to these market factors, a relatively small number of customers,\n7\nsome of whom are experiencing financial difficulties, account for most of our revenue. From time to time, these seismic contractors\nhave sought to vertically integrate and acquire our competitors, which has influenced their supplier decisions before and after such\ntransactions. In addition, consolidation among our customers may further concentrate our business to a limited number of customers\nand expose us to increased risks related to dependence on a small number of customers. The loss of a small number of these\ncustomers could materially and adversely impact revenue from of our seismic products. We market our seabed PRM systems products\nto large oil and gas companies. Since this product’s introduction in 2002, we have received system orders from three offshore oil and\ngas operators: BP, Shell and Statoil, which have accounted for a significant portion of our revenue in fiscal year 2014 and prior fiscal\nyears. We did not deliver nor have we received orders for any PRM systems since 2014.\nWe Cannot Be Certain of the Effectiveness of Patent Protection on Our Products\nWe hold and from time to time apply for certain patents relating to some of our seismic products. We cannot assure you that\nour patents will prove enforceable or free of challenge, that any patents will be issued for which we have applied or that competitors\nwill not develop functionally similar technology outside the protection of any patents we have or may obtain.\nOur Foreign Subsidiaries and Foreign Marketing Efforts Are Subject to Additional Political, Economic, Legal and Other\nUncertainties Not Generally Associated with Domestic Operations\nBased on customer billing data, revenue to customers outside the United States accounted for approximately 35% of our\nrevenue during fiscal year 2017; however, we believe the percentage of revenue outside the United States is likely higher since many\nof our products are first delivered to a domestic location and ultimately shipped to a foreign location. We again expect revenue\noutside of the United States to represent a substantial portion of our revenue for fiscal year 2018 and subsequent years.\nForeign revenue is subject to special risks inherent in doing business outside of the United States, including the risk of war,\nterrorist activities, civil disturbances, embargo and government activities, shifting foreign attitudes about conducting business\nactivities with the United States, restrictions of the movement and exchange of funds, inhibitions of our ability to collect accounts\nreceivable, international sanctions, expropriation and nationalization of our assets or those of our customers, currency fluctuations,\ndevaluations and conversion restrictions, confiscatory taxation or other adverse tax policies and governmental actions that may result\nin the deprivation of our contractual rights, all of which may disrupt markets or our operations.\nA portion of our manufacturing is conducted through our subsidiary Geospace Technologies Eurasia, which is based in the\nRussian Federation. Our business could be directly affected by political and economic conditions in the Russian Federation, including\nthe current geopolitical instability involving the Russian Federation, Ukraine and Syria. United States sanctions against Russia have\nbeen expanded to preclude export of seismic equipment anywhere in the world that involve persons designated under the sanctions\nand to include projects in which persons subject to the sanctions have a 33% ownership interest. Together, these changes make it\nmore difficult for us to support projects that have the potential to produce oil involving Russian energy companies. Furthermore, if an\nexporter is unable to determine whether its seismic equipment will be used in such projects, the export is prohibited. In fiscal year\n2017, we imported $1.4 million of products from Geospace Technologies Eurasia for resale elsewhere in the world. If imports of\nthese products from the Russian Federation are restricted by government regulation, we may be forced to find other sources for these\nproducts at potentially higher costs. Boycotts, protests, unfavorable regulations, additional governmental sanctions and other actions\nin the region could also adversely affect our ability to operate profitably. Delays in obtaining governmental approvals can affect our\nability to timely deliver our products pursuant to contractual obligations, which could result in us being liable to our customers for\ndamages. The risk of doing business in the Russian Federation and other economically or politically volatile areas could adversely\naffect our operations and earnings.\nForeign revenue is also generally subject to the risk of compliance with additional laws, including tariff regulations and\nimport and export restrictions. International revenue transactions for our products containing hydrophones require prior U.S.\ngovernment approval in the form of an export license, which may be withheld by the U.S. government based upon factors which we\ncannot predict.\nWe may experience difficulties in connection with future foreign revenue. Additionally, due to foreign laws and restrictions,\nshould we experience substantial growth in certain foreign markets, for example in the Russian Federation, we may not be able to\ntransfer cash balances to the United States to assist with debt servicing or other obligations.\nOur Global Operations Expose Us to Risks Associated with Conducting Business Internationally, Including Failure to Comply\nwith U.S. Laws Which Apply to International Operations, Such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and U.S. Export Control\nLaws, as well as the Laws of Other Countries\nWe have offices in Colombia, Canada, China, the Russian Federation and the United Kingdom, in addition to our offices in\nthe United States. In addition to the risks noted above that are inherent in conducting business internationally, we are also liable for\ncompliance with international and U.S. laws and regulations that apply to our international operations. These laws and regulations\n8\ninclude data privacy requirements, labor relations laws, tax laws, anti-competition regulations, import and trade restrictions, export\ncontrol laws, U.S. laws such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar laws in other countries which also prohibit certain\npayments to governmental officials or certain payments or remunerations to customers. Many of our products are subject to U.S.\nexport law restrictions that limit the destinations and types of customers to which our products may be sold, or require an export\nlicense in connection with revenue transactions outside the United States. Given the high level of complexity of these laws, there is a\nrisk that some provisions may be inadvertently breached, for example through the negligent or the unauthorized intentional behavior\nof individual employees, our failure to comply with certain formal documentation requirements or otherwise. Additionally, we may\nbe held liable for actions taken by our local dealers and partners. Violations of these laws and regulations could result in fines,\ncriminal sanctions against us, our officers or our employees, and prohibitions on the conduct of our business. Any such violations\ncould include prohibitions on our ability to offer our products in one or more countries and could materially damage our reputation,\nour brands, our international expansion efforts, our ability to attract and retain employees, our business and our operating results.\nOur Strategy of Leasing Seismic Products Exposes Us to Additional Risks Relating to Equipment Recovery, Lease Renewals,\nTechnological Obsolescence and Impairment of Assets\nOur rental fleet of seismic equipment represents a significant portion of our assets and accounts for a growing portion of our\nrevenue. Equipment leased by our customers is frequently located in foreign countries where retrieval of the equipment after the\ntermination of the lease is difficult or impossible if the customer does not return the equipment. The costs associated with retrieving\nthis equipment or the loss of equipment that is not retrieved could be significant and could adversely affect our operations and\nearnings.\nThe advancement of seismic technology having a significant competitive advantage over the equipment in our rental fleet\ncould have an adverse effect on our ability to profitably lease and/or sell this equipment. Significant improvements in technology may\nalso require us to record asset impairment charges to write-down the value of our rental fleet investment and to invest significant sums\nto upgrade or replace our rental fleet with newer equipment demanded by our customers. In addition, rental contracts may not be\nrenewed for equipment in our rental fleet, whether or not it has become obsolete. Significant technology improvements by our\ncompetitors could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and earnings.\nOur equipment leasing business has high fixed costs, which primarily consist of depreciation expenses. In periods of\ndeclining rental revenue, these fixed costs generally do not decline. As a result, any significant decline in rental revenue caused by\nreduced demand could adversely affect our results of operations.\nCybersecurity Breaches and Other Disruptions of Our Information Technology Network and Systems Could Adversely Affect Our\nBusiness\nWe rely on information technology networks and systems, some of which are owned and operated by third parties, to process,\ntransmit and store electronic information. In particular, we depend on our information technology infrastructure for a variety of\nfunctions, including worldwide financial reporting, inventory management, procurement, invoicing and email communications. Any\nof these systems may be susceptible to outages due to fire, floods, power loss, telecommunications failures, terrorist attacks and\nsimilar events. Despite the implementation of network security measures, our systems and those of third parties on which we rely may\nalso be vulnerable to computer viruses, break-ins, malware and similar disruptions. Malware, if surreptitiously installed on our\nsystems and not timely detected and removed, could collect and disclose sensitive information relating to our customers, employees or\nothers, exposing us to legal liability and causing us to suffer reputational damage. It could also lead to disruptions in critical systems\nor the corruption or destruction of critical data. If we are unable to prevent such outages and breaches, these events could damage our\nreputation and lead to financial losses from remedial actions, loss of business or potential liability.\nBecause We Have No Plans to Pay Any Dividends for the Foreseeable Future, Investors Must Look Solely to Stock Appreciation\nfor a Return on Their Investment in Us\nWe have not paid cash dividends on our common stock since our incorporation and do not anticipate paying any cash\ndividends in the foreseeable future. We currently intend to retain any future earnings to support our operations and growth. Any\npayment of cash dividends in the future will be dependent on the amount of funds legally available, our financial condition, capital\nrequirements, loan covenants and other factors that our Board of Directors may deem relevant. Accordingly, investors must rely on\nsales of their common stock after price appreciation, which may never occur, as the only way to realize any future gains on their\ninvestment.\nUnfavorable Currency Exchange Rate Fluctuations Could Adversely Affect Our Results of Operations\nSubstantially all of our third-party revenue from the United States is invoiced in U.S. dollars, though from time to time we\nmay invoice revenue transactions in foreign currencies including intercompany sales. As a result, we may be subject to foreign\n9\ncurrency fluctuations on our revenue. The reporting currency for our financial statements is the U.S. dollar. However, the assets,\nliabilities, revenue and costs of our Russian, Canadian and United Kingdom subsidiaries and our Chinese and Colombian branch\noffices are denominated in currencies other than U.S. dollars. To prepare our consolidated financial statements, we must translate\nthose assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses into U.S. dollars at then-applicable exchange rates. Consequently, increases and\ndecreases in the value of the U.S. dollar versus these other currencies will affect the amount of these items in our consolidated\nfinancial statements, even if their value has not changed in their original currency. These translations could result in significant\nchanges to our results of operations from period to period. For the fiscal year ended September 30, 2017, approximately 22.2% of our\nconsolidated revenue related to the operations of our foreign subsidiaries and branches.\nWe Have a Relatively Small Public Float, and Our Stock Price May be Volatile\nAt September 30, 2017, we have approximately 13.0 million shares outstanding held by non-affiliates. This small float\nresults in a relatively limited market for our common stock. Our daily trading volume for the year ended September 30, 2017\naveraged approximately 52,000 shares. Our small float and daily trading volumes have in the past caused, and may in the future result\nin, significant volatility in our stock price.\nWe Rely on Key Suppliers for Certain Components Used in Our Products\nWe no longer manufacture thermal film and now purchase all of our thermal film from a European manufacturer. Except for\nthe film sold to us by this manufacturer, we know of no other source for thermal film that performs as well in our imaging equipment.\nIf the European manufacturer were to discontinue producing thermal film, were to become unwilling to contract with us on\ncompetitive terms or were unable to supply thermal film in sufficient quantities to meet our requirements, our ability to compete in the\ndirect thermal imaging marketplace could be impaired, which could adversely affect our financial performance.\nCertain models of our marine wireless products require a timing device we purchase from a United States manufacturer. We\ncurrently do not possess the ability to manufacture this component and have no other source for this device. If this manufacturer were\nto discontinue its production of this timing device, were to become unwilling to contract with us on competitive terms or were unable\nto supply the component in sufficient quantities to meet our requirements, our ability to compete in the marine wireless marketplace\ncould be impaired, which could adversely affect our financial performance.\nOur Success Depends Upon a Limited Number of Key Personnel\nOur success depends on attracting and retaining highly skilled professionals. A number of our employees are highly skilled\nengineers and other professionals. In addition, our success depends to a significant extent upon the abilities and efforts of the\nmembers of our senior management team. If we fail to continue to attract and retain such professionals, our ability to compete in the\nindustry could be adversely affected.\nA Continued General Downturn in the Economy in Future Periods May Adversely Affect Our Business\nUncertainty in the European markets and slowing growth in China and India and any other economic slowdown in future\nperiods, could adversely affect our business in ways that we cannot predict. During times of economic slowdown, our customers may\nreduce their capital expenditures and defer or cancel pending projects and product orders. Such developments occur even among\ncustomers that are not experiencing financial difficulties. Any economic downturn may adversely affect the demand for oil and gas\ngenerally or cause volatility in oil and gas commodity prices and, therefore, adversely affect the demand for delivery of our products\nto the oil and gas industry. It could also adversely affect the demand for consumer and industrial products, which could in turn\nadversely affect our non-seismic business segment. To the extent these factors adversely affect other seismic companies in the\nindustry, there could be an oversupply of products and services and downward pressure on pricing for seismic products and services,\nwhich could adversely affect us. Additionally, bankruptcies or financial difficulties among our customers could reduce our cash flows\nand adversely impact our liquidity and profitability. See “The Limited Market for Our Seismic Products Can Affect Our Revenue in\nthe Seismic Business Segment,” above.\nWe Have a Minimal Disaster Recovery Program at Our Houston Facilities\nDue to its proximity to the Texas Gulf Coast, our facilities in Houston, Texas are annually subject to the threat of hurricanes,\nand the aftermath that follows. Hurricanes may cause, among other types of damage, the loss of electrical power for extended periods\nof time. If we lost electrical power at our Pinemont facility, or if a fire or other natural disaster occurred, we would be unable to\ncontinue our manufacturing operations during the power outage because we do not own a generator or any other back-up power source\nlarge enough to provide for our manufacturing power consumption needs. Additionally, we do not have an alternative manufacturing\nor operating location in the United States. Therefore, a significant disruption in our manufacturing operations could materially and\n10\nadversely affect our business operations during an extended period of a power outage, fire or other natural disaster. We have a back-\nup generator to provide power for our information technology operations. We store our back-up data offsite and we replicate our\nmission critical data to an alternative cloud-based data center on a real-time basis. In the event of a major service interruption in our\ndata center, we believe we would be able to activate our mission critical applications within less than 24 hours.\nOur Credit Agreement Imposes Restrictions on Our Business\nWe and several of our subsidiaries are parties to a credit agreement with a bank. Amounts available for borrowing under the\ncredit agreement are determined by a borrowing base, which is determined based upon the book value of certain of our assets. The\ncredit agreement limits the incurrence of additional indebtedness, requires the maintenance of a single financial ratio that compares\ncertain of our and our U.S. subsidiaries’ assets to certain of our liabilities, restricts our and our U.S. subsidiaries’ ability to pay cash\ndividends and contains other covenants customary in agreements of this type. Our ability to comply with these restrictions may be\naffected by events beyond our control, including, but not limited to, prevailing economic, financial and industry conditions and\ncontinuing declines in our product revenue. The breach of any of these covenants or restrictions, as well as any failure to make a\npayment of interest or principal when due, could result in a default under the credit agreement. Such a default would permit our\nlender to declare any amounts borrowed from it to be due and payable, together with accrued and unpaid interest, and the ability to\nborrow under the credit agreement could be terminated. If we are unable to repay any debts owed to our lender, the lender could\nproceed against the collateral securing that debt. While we intend to seek alternative sources of cash in such a situation, there is no\nguarantee that any alternative cash source would be available or would be available on terms favorable to us.\nReliance on Third Party Subcontractors Could Adversely Affect Our Results of Operations and Reputation\nWe may rely on subcontractors to complete certain projects. The quality and timing of production and services by our\nsubcontractors is not totally under our control. Reliance on subcontractors gives us less control over a project and exposes us to\nsignificant risks, including late delivery, substandard quality and high costs. The failure of our subcontractors to deliver quality\nproducts or services in a timely manner could adversely affect our profitability and reputation.\nThe High Fixed Costs of Our Operations Could Adversely Affect Our Results of Operations\nWe have a high fixed cost structure primarily consisting of (i) depreciation expenses associated with our rental equipment\nand (ii) fixed manufacturing costs including salaries and benefits, taxes, insurance, maintenance, depreciation and other fixed\nmanufacturing costs. In regards to our rental equipment, large declines in the demand for rental equipment could result in substantial\noperating losses due to the on-going nature of rental equipment depreciation expense. Concerning our product manufacturing costs, in\nperiods of low product demand our fixed costs generally do not decline or may decline only in modest increments. Therefore lower\ndemand for our rental equipment and manufactured products could adversely affect our results of operations.\nOur Long-Lived Assets May be Subject to Impairment\nWe periodically assess our long-lived assets for impairment. Significant sustained future decreases in oil and natural gas\nprices may require us to write down the value of these assets if future cash flows anticipated to be generated from the related assets\nfall below the asset’s net book value. If we are forced to write down the value of our long-lived assets, these noncash asset\nimpairments could adversely affect our results of operations.\nOur Use of Percentage-of-Completion Method of Accounting Could Result in Volatility in Our Results of Operations\nWe recognize revenue and profits on certain PRM systems using the percentage-of-completion method of accounting.\nAlthough we currently have no orders in hand that will require us to utilize the percentage-of-completion method of accounting, we\nanticipate that such contracts will again occur in the future although we can give no assurances in this regard. This accounting method\nrequires us to estimate contract costs and the profitability of our long-term contracts. While such estimates may be reasonably reliable\nwhen made, these estimates can change as a result of uncertainties associated with these types of contracts. Accordingly, we review\nthe contract price and cost estimates periodically as our manufacturing efforts progress, and the cumulative impact of any periodic\nrevisions to the contract price or cost estimates will be reflected in the period in which these changes become known, including, to the\nextent required, the recognition of losses at the time such losses are known and estimable, and such losses could be material. In\naddition, change orders can increase (sometimes substantially) the future scope and cost of a job. Therefore, change order awards\n(although frequently beneficial in the long-term) can have the short-term effect of reducing the contract’s percentage-of-completion\nand, thus, the revenue and profits that otherwise would be recognized to date.\n11\nWe have concluded that certain of our previously issued financial statements should not be relied upon and are restating certain of\nour previously issued financial statement, which may lead to, among other things, loss of investor confidence, negative impact on\nour stock price and certain other risks.\nAs discussed in the Explanatory Note to this Annual Report on Form 10-K and Item 8, “Financial Statements and\nSupplementary Data”, including Notes 21and 22 of the notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, on November 16, 2017 our\nAudit Committee concluded that our audited consolidated financial statements for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2016 and\n2015, and the unaudited consolidated financial statements for quarters ended December 31, 2016, March 31, 2017 and June 30, 2017\nshould no longer be relied upon because of an accounting error. The determination that the applicable financial statements should no\nlonger be relied upon and that certain financial statements would be restated was made following the identification of financial\nstatement misstatements relating to classification of inventories as noncurrent assets. We have determined that a portion of our\ninventories at September 30, 2016 and 2015 should have been classified as non-current assets, as all inventories were not reasonably\nexpected to be realized in cash, sold or consumed during our next operating cycle, and have corrected this error with restated\nconsolidated balance sheets as of September 30, 2016 and 2015 and as of December 31, 2016, March 31, 2017 and June 30, 2017 in\nthis Annual Report on Form 10-K. Although the restatement does not affect previously reported total assets, total liabilities, revenues,\nnet loss, loss per share, or cash flows, the restatement makes us subject to additional risks and uncertainties, including unanticipated\ncosts for accounting and legal fees. Such events may also cause a diversion of our management’s time and attention away from key\nprojects. The restatement, or additional restatements in the future, may lead to a loss of investor confidence and declines in the trading\nprice of our securities.\nWe have identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting, and this or other material weaknesses, or\ninadequate remediation measures, could impair our ability to report accurate financial information in a timely manner, which\ncould adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting (as defined\nin Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act). As disclosed in Item 9A. “Controls and Procedures”, our management\nidentified a material weakness relating to the error in our classification of current assets with respect to inventories. A material\nweakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable\npossibility that a material misstatement of the company’s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a\ntimely basis. As a result of this material weakness, our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was\nnot effective as of September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2017, based on the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring\nOrganizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013). If our remedial measures\nare insufficient to address the material weakness, or if additional material weaknesses or significant deficiencies in our internal control\nare discovered or occur in the future, our consolidated financial statements may contain material misstatements and may not be\navailable in a timely manner and we could be required to restate our financial statements which could lead to substantial additional\ncosts for accounting and legal fees.\nShould We Fail to Maintain an Effective System of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting, We May Not Be Able to Accurately\nReport Our Financial Results and Prevent Material Fraud, Which Could Adversely Affect the Value of Our Common Stock\nEffective internal control over financial reporting is necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports and effectively\nprevent and detect material fraud. If we cannot provide reliable financial reports or prevent or detect material fraud, our operating\nresults could be misstated. There can be no assurances that we will be able to prevent control deficiencies from occurring and which\ncould cause us to incur unforeseen costs, negatively impact our results of operations, cause the market price of our common stock to\ndecline, or have other potential adverse consequences.\nItem 1B.

Legal Proceedings\nWe are involved in various pending legal actions in the ordinary course of our business. Management is unable to predict the\nultimate outcome of these actions, because of the inherent uncertainty of litigation. However, management believes that the most\nprobable, ultimate resolution of currently pending matters will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial\nposition, results of operations or cash flows.\nItem 4.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following is management’s discussion and analysis of the major elements of our consolidated financial statements. You\nshould read this discussion and analysis together with our consolidated financial statements, including the accompanying notes, and\nother detailed information appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including under the heading “Risk Factors.” The\ndiscussion of our financial condition and results of operations includes various forward-looking statements about our markets, the\ndemand for our products and services and our future plans and results. These statements are based on assumptions that we consider to\nbe reasonable, but that could prove to be incorrect. For more information regarding our assumptions, you should refer to the section\nentitled “Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements and Assumptions” below.\nCautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements and Assumptions\nThis Annual Report on Form 10-K and the documents incorporated by reference herein, if any, contain “forward-looking”\nstatements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange\nAct of 1934, as amended. These forward-looking statements can be identified by terminology such as “may”, “will”, “should”,\n“intend”, “expect”, “plan”, “budget”, “forecast”, “anticipate”, “believe”, “estimate”, “predict”, “potential”, “continue”, “evaluating” or\nsimilar words. Statements that contain these words should be read carefully because they discuss our future expectations, contain\nprojections of our future results of operations or of our financial position or state other forward-looking information. Examples of\nforward-looking statements include, among others, statements that we make regarding our expected operating results, the adoption and\nsale of our products in various geographic regions, anticipated levels of capital expenditures and the sources of funding therefore, and\nour strategy for growth, product development, market position, financial results and the provision of accounting reserves. These\nforward-looking statements reflect our current judgment about future events and trends based on the information currently available to\nus. However, there will likely be events in the future that we are not able to predict or control. The factors listed under the caption\n“Risk Factors”, as well as cautionary language in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, provide examples of risks, uncertainties and\nevents that may cause our actual results to differ materially from the expectations we describe in our forward-looking statements.\nSuch examples include, but are not limited to, decreases in commodity price levels, which could reduce demand for our products, the\nfailure of our products to achieve market acceptance, despite substantial investment by us, our sensitivity to short term backlog,\ndelayed or cancelled customer orders, product obsolescence resulting from poor industry conditions or new technologies, bad debt\nwrite-offs associated with customer accounts, and any negative impact from our restatement of our financial statements regarding\ncurrent assets. The occurrence of the events described in these risk factors and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K could\nhave a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial position, and actual events and results of operations\nmay vary materially from our current expectations. We assume no obligation to revise or update any forward-looking statement,\nwhether written or oral, that we may make from time to time, whether as a result of new information, future developments or\notherwise.\nBackground\nWe design and manufacture instruments and equipment used by the oil and gas industry to acquire seismic data in order to\nlocate, characterize and monitor hydrocarbon producing reservoirs. The Company also designs and manufactures non-seismic\nproducts, including industrial products and imaging equipment. See the information under the heading “Business” in this Annual\nReport on Form 10-K.\nConsolidated Results of Operations\nAs we have reported in the past, our revenue and operating profits have varied significantly from quarter-to-quarter, and even\nyear-to-year, and are expected to continue that trend in the future, especially when our quarterly or annual financial results are\nimpacted by the presence or absence of relatively large, but somewhat erratic, shipments of permanent seabed reservoir monitoring\nsystems and/or wireless data acquisition systems for land and marine applications.\n17\nWe report and evaluate financial information for two segments: Seismic and Non-Seismic.

(54,323) (55,510) (52,555)\nOverview\nEarly in calendar year 2014, we began to experience a softening in the demand for our seismic exploration products,\nparticularly in North America, as capital budgets for oil and gas producers were trending away from exploration-focused activities\ntoward production and exploitation activities. During this period oil production in North America’s unconventional shale reservoirs\nincreased, as did oil production from other non-OPEC countries, resulting in an oversupply of crude oil in the world market. Market\nprices for a barrel of crude oil declined from over $100 in July 2014 to approximately $27 in January 2016, and have recovered\nsomewhat to approximately $57 today. With this decline in oil and natural gas prices, oil and gas exploration and production\ncompanies experienced a significant reduction in cash flows, which resulted in sharp reductions in their capital spending budgets for\noil and gas exploration-focused activities, including seismic activities. We expect revenue from our seismic products, and in\nparticular our traditional and wireless products, to remain low until crude oil prices stabilize at higher levels and exploration-focused\nindustry conditions improve. We expect these challenging industry conditions to continue to negatively impact the demand for our\nseismic products throughout fiscal year 2018.\nIn September 2017, we were notified by a previous PRM system customer that it is in the process of requesting quotes for\ntwo new PRM systems which must utilize fiber optic sensor technology. Since our PRM designs utilize electrical sensor technology,\nwe will not be participating with a quotation for the design and manufacture of these PRM systems. We believe that our PRM system\ndesigns, which utilize electrical sensor technology, provide the best long-term functionality and performance of any PRM system, and\nwe continue to aggressively market our PRM systems to major oil and gas companies. However, the occurrence of this notice,\ncombined with the absence of any new PRM orders of any technology type since November 2012, have caused us to provide\nadditional obsolescence reserves for a substantial portion of our PRM inventories, and we concluded a triggering event occurred and\nperformed an impairment assessment on certain heavy equipment used for the manufacturing of PRM systems, which resulted in an\nimpairment. Specific to our PRM inventories and manufacturing equipment, we recorded obsolescence reserves of $5.1 million and\nimpairment expense of $5.3 million, respectively, in the fourth quarter of our fiscal year ended September 30, 2017.\nFiscal Year 2017 Compared to Fiscal Year 2016\nConsolidated revenue for fiscal year 2017 increased $11.7 million, or 18.8% from fiscal year 2016. The increase in revenue\nfor fiscal year 2017 was primarily due to an increase in revenue from our seismic business segment, driven by an increase in demand\nfor our wireless exploration products, including the sale of 45,000 GSX channels in our fourth quarter.\nConsolidated gross profit (loss) for fiscal year 2017 was a loss of ($20.1) million, compared to a loss of ($19.4) million for\nfiscal year 2016. The decline in gross profit (loss) for fiscal year 2017 was primarily due to a $10.3 million increase in inventory\nobsolescence expenses and a $5.3 million increase in equipment impairment charges. The decline was partially offset by an increase\nin wireless exploration product sales and, to a lesser extent, a decrease in manufacturing costs resulting from the Company’s\n18\nworkforce reduction in the second fiscal quarter of 2016. Until seismic product demand increases to historical norms, we expect our\nconsolidated gross margins to remain low.\nIn light of current market conditions, our seismic product inventories at September 30, 2017 far exceed levels considered\nappropriate for the current level of product demand. We are aggressively working to continue reducing these legacy inventory\nbalances throughout fiscal year 2018 and beyond; however, we also expect to add new inventories for recent product developments.\nDuring periods of excessive inventory levels, our policy has been, and will continue to be, to record higher obsolescence expense in\nour consolidated income statement as we experience reduced levels of inventory turnover and as our inventories continue to age. If\ncurrent market conditions continue, we expect to record additional inventory obsolescence expense in fiscal year 2018 and beyond\nuntil seismic product demand and resulting seismic inventory turnover levels return to acceptable levels.\nConsolidated operating expenses for fiscal year 2017 were $33.6 million, a decrease of $2.5 million, or 6.9%, from fiscal\nyear 2016. This decrease was primarily attributable to the Company’s cost reduction program implemented during the second fiscal\nquarter of 2016 and, to a lesser extent, a decrease in bad debt expense.\nConsolidated other income for fiscal year 2017 was flat from fiscal year 2016. An increase in interest income from our short-\nterm investments and notes receivable was offset by an increase in foreign exchange losses attributable to U.S. dollar deposits held by\nour Russian subsidiary.\nConsolidated income tax expense (benefit) for fiscal year 2017 was $2.7 million compared to ($9.4) million for the\ncorresponding period of the prior fiscal year. Our effective tax rates for fiscal year 2017 and 2016 were 5.0% and (16.9)%,\nrespectively. The United States statutory tax rate for the same periods was 35%. Compared to the United States statutory rate, the\nlower effective tax rates for fiscal year 2017 resulted from our inability to recognize any tax benefits for the tax losses we incurred in\nthe U.S. and Canada due to the uncertainty surrounding our ability to utilize these losses in the future to offset taxable income. In\naddition, for fiscal year 2017, we recorded tax expenses for (i) U.S. income taxes paid in prior years resulting from the sale of rental\nequipment to our foreign subsidiaries and (ii) the recognition of a valuation allowance against foreign taxes withheld from rental\nrevenues invoiced into foreign taxing jurisdiction. For fiscal year 2016, the lower effective tax rate resulted primarily from our\ninability to recognize tax benefits for the tax losses we incurred in the U.S. and Canada due to the uncertainty of their utilization;\nhowever, we were able to recognize an income tax benefit of $13.1 million related to our ability to carryback certain U.S. tax losses to\nobtain a refund of taxes paid in previous years.\nFiscal Year 2016 Compared to Fiscal Year 2015\nConsolidated revenue for fiscal year 2016 decreased $22.8 million, or 26.9%, from fiscal year 2015. The decrease in revenue\nfor fiscal year 2016 was primarily attributable to substantially lower product demand in our seismic business segment driven by the\nlow level of crude oil prices.\nConsolidated gross profit (loss) for fiscal year 2016 was ($19.4) million, compared to ($11.2) million for fiscal year 2015.\nThe change in gross profit (loss) for fiscal year 2016 was caused by a number of factors, including (i) a substantial reduction in\nseismic product revenue, (ii) unabsorbed fixed manufacturing costs due to lower factory utilization caused by reduced demand for our\nseismic products and (iii) increased inventory obsolescence expenses due to higher levels of slow-moving seismic inventories and (iv)\nthe write-down of certain seismic inventories and rental equipment to their expected net realizable value.\nConsolidated operating expenses for fiscal year 2016 decreased $5.2 million, or 12.6%, from fiscal year 2015. The decrease\nin operating expenses was partially attributable to our cost reduction program, as well as a $1.8 million reduction in goodwill\nimpairment expense and a $1.4 million reduction in bad debt expense.\nConsolidated other income for fiscal year 2016 decreased $2.5 million, or 93.5%, from fiscal year 2015. The decrease in\nother income primarily resulted from a decrease in foreign exchange gains attributable to U.S. dollar deposits held by our Russian\nsubsidiary.\nOur effective tax rates for fiscal year 2016 and 2015 were (14.1)% and (34.5)%, respectively. The United States statutory tax\nrate for the same periods was 35%. The lower effective tax rate for fiscal year 2016 resulted from (i) a tax expense for a valuation\nallowance against the Company’s U.S. and Canadian deferred tax assets of $7.7 million, (ii) a tax expense of $1.4 million to recapture\na manufacturers’/producers’ deduction associated with the carryback of our fiscal year 2016 operating loss, and (iii) a tax expense of\n$1.0 million recorded during the fiscal quarter ended March 31, 2016 to correct our fiscal year 2015 income tax benefit.\n19\nSegment Results of Operations\nSeismic Products\nFiscal Year 2017 Compared to Fiscal Year 2016\nRevenue\nRevenue from our seismic products for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2017 increased $13.3 million, or 39.4%, from the\nprior fiscal year. The components of this increase include the following:\n(cid:129) Traditional Exploration Product Revenue – Revenue from our traditional products increased $1.5 million, or 11.0% from\nthe prior fiscal year. The increase primarily reflects higher demand for our geophone products, primarily in connection\nwith the sale from our rental fleet of a GSX wireless system in our fourth quarter.\n(cid:129) Wireless Exploration Product Revenue – Revenue from our wireless exploration products increased by $11.3 million, or\n61.4%, from the prior fiscal year. The increase was primarily due to higher demand for the sale of our OBX and GSX\nproducts and included the fourth quarter sale of 45,000 GSX channels from our rental fleet. This increase in revenue was\npartially offset by a decrease in OBX rental revenue.\n(cid:129) Reservoir Product Revenue – Revenue from our reservoir products increased $0.6 million, or 27.2%, from the prior\nfiscal year. The increase was primarily due to higher demand for our borehole products and reservoir monitoring\nservices. We have not delivered nor did we receive orders for any PRM systems during fiscal year 2016 or 2017.\nOperating Loss\nOur operating loss associated with revenue from our seismic products for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2017 decreased\n$0.8 million, or 1.7%, from the prior year. The decrease in operating loss for fiscal year 2017 was primarily due to (i) increased\nwireless exploration product sales and (ii) lower manufacturing and operating costs due to workforce reductions initiated in the second\nfiscal quarter of 2016. This decrease was partially offset by an increase of $10.3 million in inventory obsolescence expense and $5.3\nmillion in impairment charges on PRM manufacturing equipment.\nFiscal Year 2016 Compared to Fiscal Year 2015\nRevenue\nRevenue from our seismic products for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016 decreased $26.8 million, or 44.2%, from the\nprior fiscal year. In each of the product groups discussed below, the decline in revenue resulted from lower demand for our seismic\nproducts due to a weakening of industry conditions brought about by the substantial decline in oil and gas prices which began in 2014.\nThe components of this decrease include the following:\n(cid:129) Traditional Exploration Product Revenue – Revenue from our traditional products decreased $16.8 million, or 55.8%\nfrom the prior fiscal year. While revenue from all product lines declined, the decrease primarily reflects lower demand\nfor our land sensor and marine streamer products due to lower seismic crew activities.\n(cid:129) Wireless Exploration Product Revenue – Revenue from our GSX and OBX wireless products decreased by $6.7 million,\nor 26.6%, from the prior fiscal year. Revenue for the prior year includes $3.0 million resulting from the revenue\nrecognition of a non-refundable deposit on a cancelled purchase order. In addition, the reduction in revenue for fiscal\nyear 2016 reflects weak demand for product sales due to reduced seismic exploration projects and an abundance of\nunutilized customer-owned equipment in the marketplace. However, rental revenue increased due to an OBX rental\ncontract which began in February 2016 finished in our second quarter ending March 31, 2017 (the “OBX Contract”).\nRental revenue from the OBX Contract was $11.3 million for fiscal year 2016.\n(cid:129) Reservoir Product Revenue – Revenue from our reservoir products decreased $3.3 million, or 61.3%, from the prior\nfiscal year. The revenue decrease resulted from lower borehole product sales and repairs. We have not delivered nor did\nwe receive orders for any PRM systems during fiscal year 2015 or 2016.\nOperating Loss\nOur operating loss from our seismic products for fiscal year 2016 increased $5.0 million, or 11.6%, from fiscal year 2015.\nThe increase in operating loss for fiscal year 2016 was due to the substantial decline in our product revenue, unutilized factory costs\ndue to low productivity, inventory obsolescence expense and impairment of rental assets.\n20\nNon-Seismic Products\nFiscal Year 2017 Compared to Fiscal Year 2016\nRevenue\nRevenue from our non-seismic products for the year ended September 30, 2017 decreased $1.7 million, or 6.1%, from fiscal\nyear 2016. The components of this decrease included the following:\n(cid:129) Industrial Product Revenue – Revenue from our industrial products decreased $1.8 million, or 11.1% from the\ncorresponding period of the prior fiscal year. The decrease was primarily attributable to lower demand for our water\nmeter products.\n(cid:129) Imaging Product Revenue – Revenue from our imaging products increased $0.1 million, or 1.1%, from the\ncorresponding period of the prior fiscal year. We consider this small change in annual revenue to be normal and not\nindicative of any particular trend in product demand.\nOperating Income\nOur operating income associated with sales of our non-seismic products for the year ended September 30, 2017 increased by\n$0.1 million, or 1.4% from fiscal year 2016. The increase in operating income was primarily driven by price increases and\nmanufacturing efficiencies.\nFiscal Year 2016 Compared to Fiscal Year 2015\nRevenue\nRevenue from our non-seismic products for the year ended September 30, 2016 increased $4.0 million, or 16.6%, from fiscal\nyear 2015. The components of this increase include the following:\n(cid:129) Industrial Product Revenue – Revenue from our industrial products increased $4.3 million, or 35.6%, from the prior\nfiscal year. The increase in revenue was primarily attributable to higher demand and market acceptance for our water\nmeter products. The revenue increase was partially offset by lower sales of our offshore cable and industrial sensor\nproducts.\n(cid:129) Imaging Product Revenue – Revenue from our imaging products declined $0.3 million, or 2.6%, from the prior fiscal\nyear. We consider this small change in annual revenue to be normal and not indicative of any particular trend in product\ndemand.\nOperating Income\nOur operating income associated with revenue from our non-seismic products for the year ended September 30, 2016\nincreased by $1.1 million, or 35.0%, from fiscal year 2015. The increase in operating income was primarily the result of increased\nrevenue from our industrial products and was partially offset by lower operating income from our imaging product segment.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nFiscal Year 2017\nAt September 30, 2017, we had approximately $15.1 million in cash and cash equivalents and $36.1 million in short-term\ninvestments. For the fiscal year ended September 30, 2017, we generated $10.1 million of cash in operating activities primarily due to\nincome tax refund as discussed below. Our net loss of $56.8 million was offset by (i) net non-cash charges of $50.0 million from\ndeferred income taxes, depreciation, accretion, inventory obsolescence, asset impairments, stock-based compensation and bad debts,\n(ii) income tax refunds totaling $13.0 million, (iii) a $7.7 million decrease in trade accounts and notes receivable resulting from\ncollections, (iv) a $3.0 million decrease in inventories caused by a drawdown of our excess levels of finished goods and (v) a $2.2\nmillion decrease in prepaid income taxes related to the depreciation of intercompany profits by our foreign subsidiary. These sources\nof cash were partially offset by (i) the removal of a $9.1 million gross profit from the sale of used rental equipment since such gross\nprofit is reflected in the proceeds from the sale of used rental equipment under investing activities and (ii) $1.3 million decrease in\naccrued and other expenses primarily due to lower property taxes.\nFor the fiscal year ended September 30, 2017, we used cash of $5.5 million from investing activities. These uses of cash\nincluded (i) net disbursements of $8.7 million for the purchase of short-term investments, (ii) an investment of $1.2 million in\nproperty, plant and equipment and (iii) $0.5 million to expand our equipment rental fleet. These uses of cash were partially offset by\n$4.9 million in proceeds from the sale of used rental equipment. Regarding future investments into our rental fleet, we expect fiscal\n21\nyear 2018 cash investments into our rental fleet to be approximately $6 million and non-cash transfers from our inventory account of\napproximately $15 million pending demand for OBX and GSX systems. We estimate fiscal year 2018 cash investments in property,\nplant and equipment will be approximately $3 million. Our capital expenditures are expected to be funded from our cash on hand,\ninternal cash flow or, if necessary, from borrowings under our credit agreement.\nFor the fiscal year ended September 30, 2017, we generated cash proceeds of $0.1 million from financing activities from the\nexercise of stock options by our employees. We had no long-term debt outstanding throughout the fiscal year ended September 30,\n2017.\nWith the decline in oil and natural gas prices which have occurred since July 2014, exploration and production companies\nhave experienced a significant reduction in cash flows resulting in sharp reductions in their capital spending budgets for exploration-\nfocused activities, including seismic activities. As a result, our seismic business segment has experienced a significant decline in\nproduct orders and associated revenue, resulting in substantial operating losses and the continued depletion of our cash balances. Due\nto the uncertainty concerning a recovery of crude oil prices to levels capable of sustaining increased seismic exploration activities, we\nexpect these depressed seismic market conditions to continue through fiscal year 2018.\nOur available cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments totaled $51.2 million at September 30, 2017, including $7.6\nmillion of cash and cash equivalents held by our foreign subsidiaries and branch offices. We intend to permanently reinvest the\nundistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries. If we were to repatriate the cash held by our foreign subsidiaries, we would be\nrequired to accrue and pay taxes on any amounts repatriated.\nOur credit agreement allows for borrowings of up to $30.0 million with such amounts available for borrowing determined by\na borrowing base. At September 30, 2017, we had no outstanding borrowings under the credit agreement and, after consideration of\n$0.3 million of outstanding letters of credit, our borrowing availability under the credit facility was $23.8 million. At September 30,\n2017, we were in compliance with all covenants under the credit agreement. In October 2017, we extended the maturity of the credit\nagreement from May 2018 to April 2019. We currently do not anticipate the need to borrow under the credit agreement; however, we\ncan make no assurance that we will not do so.\nIn March 2017, we received a $12.8 million income tax refund from the U.S. Department of Treasury. The refund was a\nresult of the significant tax losses we experienced in fiscal year 2016 which we elected to carryback to our fiscal year 2014 U.S. tax\nreturn to recoup taxes previously paid. In addition, we expect to receive an additional $0.3 million income tax refund from the U.S.\nDepartment of Treasury in our first fiscal quarter of 2018. For U.S. income tax purposes, we are now in a loss carryforward position\nin regards to our tax losses for fiscal year 2017 and beyond. As a result, we will not receive any additional U.S. federal income tax\nrefunds in future years as a result of our current tax losses. The tax refunds we received in fiscal years 2016 and 2017 have been\nsignificant contributors to our overall liquidity. In the absence of future profitable results of operations, we may need to rely on other\nsources of liquidity to fund our future operating results, including liquidating short-term investments, executed rental contracts,\navailable borrowings under our credit agreement through its expiration in April 2019, leveraging or sale of real estate assets, sales of\nrental assets and other liquidity sources which may be available to us. However, currently we believe that our cash and short-term\ninvestment balances will be sufficient to finance our operating losses and planned capital expenditures through December 2018.\nFiscal Year 2016\nAt September 30, 2016, we had approximately $10.3 million in cash and cash equivalents and $27.5 million in short-term\ninvestments. For the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016, we used $1.7 million of cash in operating activities. These uses of cash\nincluded (i) our net loss of $46.0 million, (ii) a $3.4 million increase in trade accounts and notes receivable primarily due to amounts\nowed under the OBX Contract, (iii) a $1.9 million decrease in accounts payable primarily due to declining inventory purchases\nresulting from reduced product demand and (iv) a $2.1 million decrease in accrued and other expenses primarily due to settlements\nand reductions in expected warranty claims. These uses of cash were partially offset by (i) non-cash charges of $43.2 million from\ndeferred income taxes, depreciation, accretion, stock-based compensation, inventory obsolescence, asset impairments and bad debts,\n(ii) a $4.1 million decrease in income tax receivable primarily resulting from an $18.3 million income tax refund received in fiscal\nyear 2016, (iii) a $5.2 million decrease in inventories caused by a drawdown of our excess levels of finished goods, and (iv) a $1.5\nmillion decrease in prepaid income taxes.\nFor the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016, we used cash of $10.2 million from investing activities. These uses of cash\nincluded (i) net disbursements of $9.4 million from the purchase and sale of short-term investments, (ii) $1.9 million for additions to\nour property, plant and equipment and (iii) $0.5 million to expand our rental equipment fleet, primarily for additional OBX nodes. In\naddition, we made non-cash inventory transfers to our rental fleet of approximately $4.0 million. These uses of cash were partially\noffset by $1.6 million in proceeds from the sale of used rental equipment.\nFor the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016, we had no cash flows from financing activities. We had no long-term debt\noutstanding at September 30, 2016.\n22\nFiscal Year 2015\nAt September 30, 2015, we had approximately $22.3 million in cash and cash equivalents and $18.1 million in short-term\ninvestments. For the fiscal year ended September 30, 2015, we used $11.4 million of cash from operating activities. These uses of\ncash included (i) our net loss of $32.6 million, (ii) a $6.0 million decrease in accrued expenses and other current liabilities primarily\ndue to the payment of fiscal year 2014 incentive compensation, (iii) a $14.8 million increase in income tax receivable resulting from\nour pretax loss and our intent to claim a tax refund of $17.4 million in our second quarter ending March 2016 for taxes paid in prior\nyears, and (iv) a $3.6 million decrease in deferred revenue primarily due to the revenue recognition of a $3.0 million non-refundable\ncustomer deposit. These uses of cash were partially offset by (i) net non-cash charges of $31.2 million from deferred income taxes,\ndepreciation, goodwill impairment, accretion, stock-based compensation, inventory obsolescence and bad debts, (ii) a $7.1 million\ndecrease in trade accounts and financing receivables resulting from collections and a decline in revenue, (iii) a $9.7 million decrease in\ninventories caused by reduced product demand and a drawdown of our excess inventories, and (iv) a $1.0 million decrease in prepaid\nand other current assets.\nFor the fiscal year ended September 30, 2015, we used cash of $0.3 million from investing activities. These uses of cash\nincluded (i) $4.0 million to expand our rental equipment fleet primarily for the addition of OBX nodes and (ii) $2.2 million for\nadditions to our property, plant and equipment. These uses of cash were partially offset by (i) proceeds of $4.3 million from the sale\nof used rental equipment and (ii) net proceeds of $1.6 million from the sale and purchase of short-term investments.\nFor the fiscal year ended September 30, 2015, we had no cash flows from financing activities.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe do not have any obligations which meet the definition of an off-balance sheet arrangement and which have or are\nreasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial statements or the items contained therein that are material to\ninvestors.\nContractual Obligations\nWe have no contractual obligations requiring disclosure.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States\nrequires the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes.\nWe consider many factors in selecting appropriate operational and financial accounting policies and controls, and in developing the\nestimates and assumptions that are used in the preparation of these financial statements. We continually evaluate our estimates,\nincluding those related to revenue recognition, bad debt reserves, inventory obsolescence reserves, self-insurance reserves for medical\nexpenses, product warranty reserves, stock-based compensation and deferred income tax assets. We base our estimates on historical\nexperience and various other factors, including the impact from the current economic conditions that we believe to be reasonable\nunder the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different conditions or assumptions.\nOur normal credit terms for trade receivables are 30 days. In certain situations, credit terms for trade receivables may be\nextended to 60 days or longer and such receivables generally do not require collateral. Additionally, we provide long-term financing\nin the form of promissory notes and sales-type leases when competitive conditions require such financing and, in such cases, we may\nrequire collateral. We perform ongoing credit evaluations of our accounts and financing receivables, and allowances are recognized\nfor potential credit losses.\nOur long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever an event or change in circumstances indicates the carrying\namount of an asset or group of assets may not be recoverable. The impairment review, if necessary, includes a comparison of\nexpected future cash flows (undiscounted and without interest charges) to be generated by an asset group with the associated carrying\nvalue of the related assets. If the carrying value of the asset group exceeds the expected future cash flows, an impairment loss is\nrecognized to the extent that the carrying value of the asset group exceeds its fair value.\nManagement makes judgments regarding the interpretation of tax laws that might be challenged upon an audit and cause\nchanges to previous estimates of tax liability. In addition, we operate within multiple taxing jurisdictions and are subject to audit in\nthese jurisdictions as well as by the Internal Revenue Service. In management’s opinion, adequate provisions for income taxes have\nbeen made for all open tax years. The potential outcomes of examinations are regularly assessed in determining the adequacy of the\nprovision for income taxes and income tax liabilities. Management believes that adequate provisions have been made for reasonable\nand foreseeable outcomes related to uncertain tax matters.\n23\nWe record a write-down of our inventories when the cost basis of any manufactured product, including any estimated future\ncosts to complete the manufacturing process, exceeds its net realizable value. Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market\nvalue. Cost is determined on a first-in, first-out method, except that our offices in the Russian Federation, Colombia and the United\nKingdom use an average cost method to value their inventories.\nWe periodically review the composition of our inventories to determine if market demand, product modifications, technology\nchanges, excessive quantities on-hand and other factors hinder our ability to recover our investment in such inventories.\nManagement’s assessment is based upon historical product demand, estimated future product demand and various other judgments\nand estimates. Inventory obsolescence reserves are recorded when such assessments reveal that portions or components of our\ninventory investment will not be realized in our operating activities.\nThe value of our inventories not expected to be realized in cash, sold or consumed during our next operating cycle are\nclassified as non-current assets.\nWe primarily derive our revenue from product sales and product rentals under short-term operating leases and sales type\nleases. Our products are produced in a standard manufacturing operation. We recognize revenue from product sales when (i) title\npasses to the customer, (ii) the customer assumes risks and rewards of ownership, (iii) the product sales price has been determined,\n(iv) collectability of the sales price is reasonably assured and (v) product delivery occurs as directed by our customer. We recognize\nrental revenue as earned over the rental period. Rentals of our equipment generally range from daily rentals to rental periods of up to\nsix months or longer. Service revenue is recognized when services are rendered and are generally priced on a per day rate. Except for\ncertain of our PRM products, our products are generally sold without any customer acceptance provisions and our standard terms of\nsale do not allow customers to return products for credit.\nMost of our products do not require installation assistance or sophisticated instruction. We offer a standard product warranty,\nwhich obligates us to repair or replace our products having manufacturing defects. We maintain a reserve for future warranty costs\nbased on historical experience or, in the absence of historical experience, management estimates.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nPlease refer to Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements contained in this Annual Report for a discussion of recent\naccounting pronouncements.\nManagement’s Current Outlook and Assumptions\nCrude oil prices for West Texas Intermediate continued their volatility during fiscal year 2017, ranging from a high of $54\nper barrel and a low of $43 per barrel. The instability in price coupled with oversupply in the world market continues to negatively\nimpact the cash flows and spending patterns of oil and gas companies. Significantly reduced capital spending budgets targeted at oil\nand gas exploration projects, including both land and marine seismic projects, have contributed to the decline in our seismic business\nsegment revenue and gross profit since fiscal year 2014. Although WTI crude oil prices have rebounded recently to $57 per barrel\ntoday, we believe pricing volatility will continue in the near term and serve to mute any significant rebound in seismic exploration\nspending during fiscal year 2018. As a result, we do not expect fiscal year 2018 customer demand for most of our seismic products\nwill exceed fiscal year 2017 levels. As a result of reduced seismic exploration activities, many of our seismic customers are currently\nutilizing only a fraction of their owned seismic equipment. In most cases, this unutilized equipment is generally available for\nimmediate deployment if future demand for seismic services were to increase. The availability of excess customer-owned seismic\nequipment combined with substantially reduced capital budgets and cash flows has curtailed our customer’s need to purchase or rent\nseismic equipment from providers like us. As a result, we expect large-ticket sales of our GSX and OBX wireless data acquisition\nsystems, as well as sales of our other land and marine seismic products, are likely to remain at depressed levels through fiscal year\n2018.\nOur rental revenue is primarily derived from short-term leases of our GSX and OBX wireless products and, to a lesser extent,\nfrom our traditional and reservoir products. Rental revenue for our OBX wireless products decreased in fiscal year 2017, primarily\ndue to the expiration of the OBX Contract. However, demand for rentals of our GSX land-based wireless equipment increased in\nfiscal year 2017. We believe our GSX and OBX rental revenue could increase in fiscal year 2018, although we can offer no\nassurances of such an increase due to the lack of executed firm rental contracts.\nMany of our traditional seismic products are characterized as low margin commodity or consumable products with intense\ninternational competition. We believe the level of industry demand for these products is generally a good barometer of seismic crew\nactivities since these product are consumed, damaged or lost while being utilized in seismic field operations. As a result of current\nindustry conditions, revenue from these products has dropped significantly since fiscal year 2014, and we do not expect revenue levels\nfrom these lower margin products to grow during fiscal year 2018. As we focus our future product development and production\nactivities targeted at higher margin specialty products and new technologies, especially our wireless and reservoir products, we expect\nfuture sales of these lower margin traditional seismic products to decline.\n24\nWe have not received any orders for large-scale seabed PRM systems since November 2012 and we currently do not have\nany indication that such an order will be received in fiscal year 2018, although we do believe opportunities for PRM orders do exist in\ntoday’s market. If a large-scale order were received in fiscal year 2018, it could significantly impact our fiscal year 2018 revenue and\nprofits. However, if no such order is received, we expect revenue and profits from our reservoir products to remain at fiscal year 2017\nlevels.\nWe expect fiscal year 2018 revenue from our non-seismic products to increase over fiscal year 2017 levels. We expect our\nindustrial products to contribute the majority of this increase as a result of expanded market acceptance and new product innovations.\nItem 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk\nWe have market risk relative to our short-term investments, foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. We do not\nengage in commodity or commodity derivative instrument purchase or sales transactions. Because of the inherent unpredictability of\nforeign currency rates and interest rates, as well as other factors, actual results could differ materially from those projected in this\nItem 7A.\nForeign Currency and Operations Risk\nOne of our wholly-owned subsidiaries, Geospace Technologies Eurasia, is located in the Russian Federation. In addition, we\noperate a branch office, Geospace Technologies Sucursal Sudamericana, in Colombia. Our financial results for these entities may be\naffected by factors such as volatile changes in foreign currency exchange rates, weak economic conditions or changes in the political\nclimate. Our consolidated balance sheet at September 30, 2017 reflected approximately $6.2 million and $0.2 million of foreign\ncurrency denominated net working capital related to our Russian and Colombian operations, respectively. Both of these entities\nreceive a portion of their revenue and pay a majority of their expenses primarily in their local currency. To the extent that transactions\nof these entities are settled in their local currency, a devaluation of these currencies versus the U.S. dollar could reduce any\ncontribution from these entities to our consolidated results of operations and total comprehensive income as reported in U.S. dollars.\nWe do not hedge the market risk with respect to our operations in these countries; therefore, such risk is a general and unpredictable\nrisk of future disruptions in the valuation of such currencies versus U.S. dollars to the extent such disruptions result in any reduced\nvaluation of these foreign entities’ net working capital or future contributions to our consolidated results of operations. At\nSeptember 30, 2017, the foreign exchange rate for $1.00 (one U.S. dollar) was equal to 57.73 Russian Rubles and 2,937 Colombian\nPesos, respectively. If the value of the U.S. dollar were to increase by ten percent against these foreign currencies, our working capital\nin the Russian Federation and in Colombia could decline by $0.6 million and $25,000, respectively.\nForeign Currency Intercompany Accounts and Notes Receivable\nFrom time to time, we provide access to capital to our foreign subsidiaries through U.S. dollar denominated interest bearing\npromissory notes. Such funds are generally used by our foreign subsidiaries to purchase capital assets and for general working capital\nneeds. In addition, we sell products to our foreign subsidiaries on trade credit terms in both U.S. dollars and in the subsidiary’s local\ncurrency. At September 30, 2017, we had outstanding Canadian-dollar denominated intercompany accounts receivable of CAN $26.1\nmillion due from our Canadian subsidiary. We previously considered CAN $24.2 million of this intercompany accounts receivable to\nbe of a long-term nature whereby settlement was not planned or anticipated in the foreseeable future, therefore resulting foreign\nexchange gains and losses were to be reported in the consolidated balance sheets as a component of other comprehensive income in\naccordance with ASC 830 “Foreign Currency Matters”. At September 30, 2017, we reassessed the long-term portion of the\nintercompany accounts receivable balance since our Canadian subsidiary recently executed a USD $7.3 million sale of a significant\nportion of its rental equipment. This transaction was not anticipated, and the resulting cash flows from this equipment sale are\nexpected to result in a substantial decrease in the intercompany accounts receivable owed by the Canadian subsidiary. These cash\nflows combined with increased demand for certain wireless equipment manufactured by us increase the likelihood that the\nintercompany account receivable balance will be deemed of a short-term nature. At September 30, 2017, we considered the entire\nCAN$24.2 million intercompany accounts receivable to be of a short-term nature. In periods subsequent to September 30, 2017, the\nappreciation or devaluation of the Canadian dollar against the U.S. dollar will result in a gain or loss, respectively, to our consolidated\nstatement of operations. At September 30, 2017, the foreign exchange rate for USD $1.00 was equal to approximately CAN $1.25.\nIn September 2017, we entered into a CAN $9.0 million hedge agreement with a United States bank to hedge a portion of our\nCanadian dollar foreign exchange rate exposure, resulting in an under-hedged position of approximately CAN $17.1 million. In\nOctober 2017, we entered into an additional CAN $11.0 million hedge agreement to further reduce this exposure. Both hedge\nagreements expire December 29, 2017. At September 30, 2017 if the U.S. dollar exchange rate were to strengthen by ten percent\nagainst the Canadian dollar, we would recognize a foreign exchange loss of USD $1.4 million in our consolidated financial statements.\n25\nFloating Interest Rate Risk\nOur credit agreement contains a floating interest rate which subjects us to the risk of increased interest costs associated with\nany upward movements in bank market interest rates. Under our credit agreement our borrowing interest rate is the Wall Street\nJournal prime rate, which was 4.25% at September 30, 2017. As of September 30, 2017, there were no borrowings outstanding under\nour credit agreement.\nItem 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\nOur consolidated financial statements, including the reports thereon, the notes thereto and supplementary data begin at\npage F-1 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K and are incorporated herein by reference.\nItem 9. Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure\nNone.\nItem 9A. Controls and Procedures\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining a system of disclosure controls and procedures that are\ndesigned to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed,\nsummarized and reported within the time periods specified under SEC’s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and\ncommunicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”) and Chief Financial Officer (“CFO”).\nNotwithstanding the foregoing, there can be no assurance that our disclosure controls and procedures will detect or uncover all failures\nof persons within the Company and its consolidated subsidiaries to report material information otherwise required to be set forth in our\nreports.\nIn connection with the preparation of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we carried out an evaluation under the supervision\nand with the participation of our management, including the CEO and CFO, as of September 30, 2017 of the effectiveness of the\nCompany’s disclosure controls and procedures, as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act.\nBased on that evaluation, the CEO and CFO concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective at September 30,\n2017 due to the material weakness described in “Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting” as of\nSeptember 30, 2017.\nManagement’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting (as defined\nin Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act). Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting\nmay not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk\nthat controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or\nprocedures may deteriorate.\nOur management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2017. In\nmaking this assessment, we used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission\n(COSO) in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013). Based on this assessment, our management concluded that due to a\nmaterial weakness in our internal control over financial reporting as described below, our internal control over financial reporting was\nnot effective as of September 30, 2017.\nA material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting such that\nthere is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the company’s annual or interim financial statements will not be\nprevented or detected on a timely basis.\nAs of September 30, 2017, we did not maintain effective controls concerning our classification of current assets with respect\nto inventories. We have determined that a portion of our inventories should have been classified as noncurrent assets, as all\ninventories were not reasonably expected to be realized in cash, sold or consumed during our next operating cycle.\nThis error was subsequently identified and corrected, and resulted in a restatement of the consolidated balance sheets as of\nSeptember 30, 2016 and 2015 and as of December 31, 2016, March 31, 2017 and June 30, 2017, which are included in this Annual\nReport on Form 10-K. The error had no impact upon previously reported total assets, total liabilities, revenues, net loss, loss per\nshare, or cash flows.\n26\nBecause of this material weakness, management concluded that we did not maintain effective internal control over financial\nreporting as of September 30, 2015, 2016 and 2017, based on criteria described in Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013)\nissued by COSO.\nTo remediate the material weakness described above, we are designing and implementing a quarterly control to determine the\nvalue of our inventories expected to be realized in cash, sold or consumed during the next operating cycle. This control, which will\nencompass a review by senior management, will utilize a combination of forecasts and historical trends to determine our future\nexpected inventory utilization. We believe that this measure will remediate the material weakness identified and strengthen the\nCompany’s internal control over financial reporting.\nBDO USA, LLP, the independent registered public accounting firm that audited the consolidated financial statements of the\nCompany included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, has issued an attestation report on the Company's internal control over\nfinancial reporting as of September 30, 2017 and 2016, based on their audits.\nChanges in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nThere were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the fiscal quarter ended\nSeptember 30, 2017 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial\nreporting. As discussed above during the first quarter of fiscal year 2018, we are designing and implementing a new control to\nremediate the material weakness described above.\nItem 9B.

In connection with our audits of the\nconsolidated financial statements, we have also audited the financial statement schedule as of and for each of the three fiscal years in\nthe period ended September 30, 2017 listed in the accompanying index. These consolidated financial statements and schedule are the\nresponsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements\nand schedule based on our audits.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).\nThose standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are\nfree of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the\nfinancial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating\nthe overall presentation of the financial statements and schedule. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our\nopinion.\nIn our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of\nGeospace Technologies Corporation as of September 30, 2017, 2016 and 2015, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for\neach of the three fiscal years in the period ended September 30, 2017, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in\nthe United States of America.\nAlso, in our opinion, the related financial statement schedule as of and for each of the three fiscal years in the period ended\nSeptember 30, 2017, when considered in relation to the basic consolidated financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly, in all\nmaterial respects, the information set forth therein.\nAs discussed in Note 22 to the consolidated financial statements, the accompanying 2016 and 2015 consolidated financial statements\nhave been restated to correct misstatements.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the\nCompany’s internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2017 and 2016, based on criteria established in Internal\nControl-Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO),\nand our report dated December 1, 2017 expressed adverse opinions thereon.\n/s/ BDO USA, LLP\nHouston, Texas\nDecember 1, 2017\nF-2\nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\nTo the Board of Directors and\nStockholders of Geospace Technologies Corporation\nHouston, Texas\nWe have audited the internal control over financial reporting of Geospace Technologies Corporation (the “Company”) as of\nSeptember 30, 2017 and 2016, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the\nCommittee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (the COSO criteria). The Company’s management is\nresponsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal\ncontrol over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Item 9A, Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial\nReporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audits.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).\nThose standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control\nover financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audits included obtaining an understanding of internal control\nover financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating\neffectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we\nconsidered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of\nfinancial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting\nprinciples. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the\nmaintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the\ncompany; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in\naccordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in\naccordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding\nprevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect\non the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections\nof any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in\nconditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nIn our report dated November 17, 2016, we expressed an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of internal control over financial\nreporting as of September 30, 2016. Subsequent to November 17, 2016, the Company identified a material misstatement in its\nconsolidated balance sheets as of September 30, 2016 and 2015, requiring restatement of such financial statements. Management\nrevised its assessment of internal control over financial reporting due to the identification of a material weakness, described in the\nfollowing paragraph, in connection with the financial statement restatement. Accordingly, our opinion on the effectiveness of the\nCompany’s internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2016 expressed herein is different from that expressed in our\nprevious report.\nA material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a\nreasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the Company’s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or\ndetected on a timely basis. A material weakness regarding management’s failure to design and maintain controls over the\nclassification of inventory has been identified and described in management’s assessment. This material weakness was considered in\ndetermining the nature, timing, and extent of audit tests applied in our audit of the 2017, 2016 (as restated) and 2015 (as restated)\nconsolidated financial statements, and this report does not affect our report dated December 1, 2017 on those financial statements.\nIn our opinion, Geospace Technologies Corporation did not maintain, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial\nreporting as of September 30, 2017 and 2016, based on the COSO criteria.\nWe do not express an opinion or any other form of assurance on management’s statements referring to any corrective actions taken by\nthe Company after the date of management’s assessment.\nWe have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the\nconsolidated balance sheets of Geospace Technologies Corporation as of September 30, 2017, 2016 and 2015, and the related\nconsolidated statements of operations, comprehensive loss, stockholders’ equity and cash flows for each of the three fiscal years in the\nperiod ended September 30, 2017, and our report dated December 1, 2017 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.\n/s/ BDO USA, LLP\nHouston, Texas\nDecember 1, 2017\nF-3\nGeospace Technologies Corporation and Subsidiaries\nConsolidated Balance Sheets\n(In thousands,

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies:\nThe Company\nGeospace Technologies Corporation (“Geospace”) designs and manufactures instruments and equipment used by the oil and\ngas industry to acquire seismic data in order to locate, characterize and monitor hydrocarbon producing reservoirs. Geospace also\ndesigns and manufactures non-seismic products, including industrial products and imaging equipment. Geospace and its subsidiaries\nare referred to collectively as the “Company”.\nBasis of Presentation\nThe accompanying financial statements present the consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows of the\nCompany in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. All intercompany balances\nand transactions have been eliminated.\nReclassifications\nCertain amounts previously presented in the consolidated financial statements have been reclassified to conform to the\ncurrent year presentation. Such reclassifications had no effect on previously reported net loss, stockholders’ equity or cash flows.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of\nAmerica requires the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying\nnotes. The Company considers many factors in selecting appropriate operational and financial accounting policies and controls, and in\ndeveloping the estimates and assumptions that are used in the preparation of these financial statements. The Company continually\nevaluates its estimates, including those related to bad debt reserves, inventory obsolescence reserves, self-insurance reserves, product\nwarranty reserves, impairment of long-lived assets and deferred income tax assets. The Company bases its estimates on historical\nexperience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these\nestimates under different conditions or assumptions.\nCash and Cash Equivalents\nThe Company considers all highly liquid investments purchased with an original or remaining maturity at the time of\npurchase of three months or less to be cash equivalents.\nShort-term Investments\nThe Company classifies its short-term investments consisting of corporate bonds, government bonds and other such similar\ninvestments as available-for-sale securities. Available-for-sale securities are carried at fair market value with net unrealized holding\ngains and losses reported each period as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss in stockholders’ equity. See Note 2 for\nadditional information.\nConcentrations of Credit Risk\nThe Company maintains its cash in bank deposit accounts that, at times, exceed federally insured limits. Management of the\nCompany believes that the financial strength of the financial institutions holding such deposits minimizes the credit risk of such\ndeposits.\nThe Company sells products to customers throughout the United States and various foreign countries. The Company’s\nnormal credit terms for trade receivables are 30 days. In certain situations, credit terms may be extended to 60 days or longer. The\nCompany performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers and generally does not require collateral for its trade receivables.\nAdditionally, the Company provides long-term financing in the form of promissory notes and sales-type leases when competitive\nconditions require such financing. In such cases, the Company may require collateral. Allowances are recognized for potential credit\nlosses. One customer comprised 17.8% of the Company’s revenue during fiscal year 2017. At September 30, 2017, the Company had\na financing receivable from this customer of $8.1 million. One customer comprised 18.5% of the Company’s revenues during fiscal\nF-9\nGeospace Technologies Corporation and Subsidiaries\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements—(Continued)\nyear 2016. At September 30, 2016, the Company had an account receivable from this customer of $9.1 million. No customers\ncomprised 10% of the Company’s revenue during fiscal year 2015.\nInventories\nThe Company records a write-down of its inventories when the cost basis of any manufactured product, including any\nestimated future costs to complete the manufacturing process, exceeds its net realizable value. Inventories are stated at the lower of\ncost or market value. Cost is determined on the first-in, first-out method, except that certain of the Company’s foreign subsidiaries use\nan average cost method to value their inventories.\nThe Company periodically reviews the composition of its inventories to determine if market demand, product modifications,\ntechnology changes, excessive quantities on-hand and other factors hinder our ability to recover its investment in such\ninventories. The Company’s assessment is based upon historical product demand, estimated future product demand and various other\njudgments and estimates. Inventory obsolescence reserves are recorded when such assessments reveal that portions or components of\nthe Company’s inventory investment will not be realized in its operating activities.\nThe Company reviews it inventories for classification purposes. The value of inventories not expected to be realized in cash,\nsold or consumed during its next operating cycle are classified as noncurrent assets.\nProperty, Plant and Equipment and Rental Equipment\nProperty, plant and equipment and rental equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation expense is calculated using the straight-\nline method over the following estimated useful lives:\nYears\nRental Equipment........................................................................... 2-5\nProperty, plant and equipment:\nMachinery and equipment........................................................ 3-15\nBuildings and building improvements..................................... 10-50\nOther......................................................................................... 5-10\nExpenditures for renewals and betterments are capitalized. Repairs and maintenance expenditures are charged to expense as\nincurred. The cost and accumulated depreciation of assets sold or otherwise disposed of are removed from the accounts and any gain\nor loss thereon is reflected in the statements of operations.\nImpairment of Long-lived Assets\nThe Company’s long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever an event or change in circumstances indicates the\ncarrying amount of an asset or group of assets may not be recoverable. The impairment review, if necessary, includes a comparison of\nexpected future cash flows (undiscounted and without interest charges) to be generated by an asset group with the associated carrying\nvalue of the related assets. If the carrying value of the asset group exceeds the expected future cash flows, an impairment loss is\nrecognized to the extent that the carrying value of the asset group exceeds its fair value. At September 30, 2017, management\nreviewed the recoverability of the carrying value of certain of manufacturing cabling equipment based on future undiscounted cash\nflows and determined that the carrying value of the equipment exceeded the expected future cash flows. As a result, the Company\ncompared the fair value of these assets to their carrying value and determined that the fair value was less than their carrying value. In\nestimating the fair value of the equipment, the Company utilized a combination of both the market and cost approach methods, with a\nweighted emphasis toward the market approach method. The market approach method assumes the most probable selling price for an\nasset. The cost approach method assumes what a prudent investor would pay to replace or reproduce an asset. As a result of the fair\nvalue analysis, impairment charges of $5.3 million were recorded for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2017. Impairment charges\nof $1.8 million were recorded on certain rental assets for the fiscal ended September 30, 2016. The impairment charges are included\nas a component of cost of revenue in the Company’s consolidated statements of operations.\nRevenue Recognition – Products and Services\nThe Company primarily derives revenue from the sale of its manufactured products, including revenue derived from the sale\nof its manufactured rental equipment. In addition, the Company generates revenue from the short-term rental under operating leases\nof its manufactured products. The Company recognizes revenue from product sales, including the sale of used rental equipment, when\nF-10\nGeospace Technologies Corporation and Subsidiaries\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements—(Continued)\nall of the following have occurred: (i) title passes to the customer, (ii) the customer assumes the risks and rewards of ownership, (iii)\nthe product sales price has been determined, (iv) collectability of the sales price is reasonably assured, and (v) product delivery occurs\nas directed by the customer. Although infrequent, in cases where collectability is not reasonably assured, the installment or cost\nrecovery method is used. Except for certain of the Company’s reservoir characterization products, the Company’s products are\ngenerally sold without any customer acceptance provisions, and the Company’s standard terms of sale do not allow customers to\nreturn products for credit. The Company recognizes rental revenue as earned over the rental period. Rentals of the Company’s\nequipment generally range from daily rentals to rental periods of up to six months or longer. Revenue from engineering services is\nrecognized as services are rendered over the duration of a project, or as billed on a per hour basis. Field service revenue is recognized\nwhen services are rendered and is generally priced on a per day rate.\nDeferred Revenue\nThe Company records deferred revenue when customer funds are received prior to the recognition of the associated revenue.\nResearch and Development Costs\nThe Company expenses research and development costs as incurred. Research and development costs include salaries,\nemployee benefit costs, department supplies, direct project costs and other related costs.\nProduct Warranties\nMost of the Company’s products do not require installation assistance or sophisticated instructions. The Company offers a\nstandard product warranty obligating it to repair or replace equipment with manufacturing defects. The Company maintains a reserve\nfor future warranty costs based on historical experience or, in the absence of historical product experience, management’s estimates.\nReserves for future warranty costs are included within accrued expenses and other current liabilities on the consolidated balance\nsheets.\nChanges in the product warranty reserve are reflected in the following table (in thousands):\nBalance at October 1, 2014........................................................... $ 951\nAccruals for warranties issued during the year............................. 4,984\nSettlements made (in cash or in kind) during the year.................. (3,609)\nBalance at September 30, 2015..................................................... 2,326\nAccruals for warranties issued during the year............................. 595\nSettlements made (in cash or in kind) during the year..................

(654)\nBalance at September 30, 2017..................................................... $ 508\nStock-Based Compensation\nThe Company accounts for stock-based compensation, including grants of restricted awards and unqualified stock options in\naccordance with Accounting Standards Codification Topic 718, which requires that all share-based payments (to the extent that they\nare compensatory) be recognized as an expense in the Company’s consolidated statements of operations based on their fair values on\nthe award date and the estimated number of shares it ultimately expects to vest.\nThe Company recognizes stock-based compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period of the\naward. The Company’s stock-based compensation plan and awards are more fully described in Note 13.\nForeign Currency Gains and Losses\nThe assets and liabilities of the Company’s foreign subsidiaries that have a foreign currency as their functional currency have\nbeen translated into U.S. dollars using the exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date. Results of operations have been\ntranslated using the average exchange rates during the year. Resulting translation adjustments have been recorded as a component of\naccumulated other comprehensive loss in stockholders’ equity. Foreign currency transaction gains and losses are included in the\nF-11\nGeospace Technologies Corporation and Subsidiaries\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements—(Continued)\nstatements of operations as they occur. Transaction gains and losses on intra-entity foreign currency transactions and balances\nincluding advances and demand notes payable, on which settlement is not planned or anticipated in the foreseeable future, are\nrecorded in “accumulated other comprehensive loss” on our consolidated balance sheets.\nShipping and Handling Costs\nAmounts billed to a customer in a sales transaction related to reimbursable shipping and handling costs are included in\nrevenue and the associated costs incurred by the Company for reimbursable shipping and handling expenses are reported in cost of\nsales. The Company had shipping and handling expenses of $0.3 million, $0.4 million and $0.6 million for each of the fiscal years\nended September 30, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.\nFair Value\nFair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or the amount paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction\nbetween market participants (an exit price) at the measurement date. GAAP has established a fair value hierarchy which prioritizes\nthe inputs to the valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three levels. These levels are determined based on the lowest\nlevel input that is significant to the fair value measurement. Level 1 represents unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical\nassets and liabilities. Level 2 represents quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets (other than those included in\nLevel 1) which are observable, either directly or indirectly. Level 3 represents valuations derived from valuation techniques in which\none or more significant inputs or significant value drivers are unobservable.\nIncome Taxes\nIncome taxes are presented in accordance with the Accounting Standards Codification Topic 740 (“Topic 740”) guidance for\naccounting for income taxes. The estimated future tax effects of temporary differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities\nand amounts reported in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets, as well as operating loss and tax credit carrybacks and\ncarryforwards are recorded. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between financial reporting and tax\nbasis of assets and liabilities (temporary differences) and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when\nthe differences are expected to reverse. The Company periodically reviews the recoverability of tax assets recorded on the balance\nsheet and provides valuation allowances if it is more likely than not that such assets will not be realized.\nThe Company follows the guidance of Topic 740 to analyze all tax positions that are less than certain. Topic 740 prescribes a\nrecognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or\nexpected to be taken in a tax return. In accordance with Topic 740, the Company recognizes in its financial statements the impact of a\ntax position if that position is “more likely than not” to be sustained on audit, based on the technical merits of the position. The\nCompany’s estimate of the potential outcome of any uncertain tax issue is subject to management’s assessment of relevant risks, facts,\nand circumstances existing at that time.\nThe Company classifies interest and penalties associated with the payment of income taxes in the Other Income (Expense)\nsection of its consolidated statements of operations.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nIn November 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued guidance which requires that a statement of\ncash flows explain the change during the period in the total of cash, cash equivalents, and amounts generally described as restricted\ncash or restricted cash equivalents. Therefore, amounts generally described as restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents should be\nincluded with cash and cash equivalents when reconciling the beginning-of-period and end-of-period total amounts shown on the\nstatement of cash flows. This guidance must be adopted by the Company no later than its first quarter of fiscal year 2019 and should\nbe applied on a retrospective transition basis. The Company has historically not held restricted cash balances and, therefore, does not\nexpect the adoption of this guidance to have a material effect on its consolidated financial statements. However, upon adoption of this\nguidance, the Company will make any necessary changes to present restricted cash balances in accordance with the guidance.\nIn October 2016, the FASB issued guidance which eliminates the exception of recognizing, at the time of transfer, current\nand deferred income taxes for intercompany profits on intra-entity asset transfers other than inventory. This guidance must be adopted\nby the Company no later than its first quarter of fiscal year 2019 and applied on a modified retrospective transition basis. Since early\nadoption is permitted, the Company is planning to adopt this guidance in its first quarter of its fiscal year ending September 30, 2018.\nUpon the adoption of the guidance, the Company will record a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings of $0.1 million.\nUnder current guidance, the Company maintains a non-current prepaid income tax asset on its consolidated balance sheets\nF-12\nGeospace Technologies Corporation and Subsidiaries\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements—(Continued)\nrepresenting income taxes paid in the U.S. on profits realized from the sale of rental equipment to its foreign subsidiaries. As this\nrental equipment is depreciated, the prepaid tax is recognized as a current income tax expense in the Company’s consolidated\nstatement of operations. Upon adoption of the new guidance, the Company will be required to recognize a deferred tax asset related to\nthe intercompany profits realized on the sale of assets to its subsidiaries; however, profits realized from the intercompany sale of\ninventories will continue to be accounted for as a prepaid income tax asset similar to the current guidance. The deferred tax asset\nresulting from the sale of non-inventory assets will be recognized at the jurisdictional tax rate of the subsidiary purchasing the asset.\nAny differences between the subsidiary’s jurisdictional tax rate and the seller’s tax rate pertaining to the intercompany profit will be\ncharged to seller’s current income tax expense at the time of the sale. Since the current U.S. income tax rate is substantially higher\nthan the current income tax rates applicable to each of the Company’s foreign subsidiaries, adoption of the new guidance could have a\nsignificant impact on the Company’s provision for income taxes in future periods if significant amounts of rental equipment are sold\nby the Company’s U.S. subsidiaries to its foreign subsidiaries.\nIn June 2016, the FASB issued guidance surrounding credit losses for financial instruments that replaces the incurred loss\nimpairment methodology in current U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”). The new impairment model requires\nimmediate recognition of estimated credit losses expected to occur for most financial assets and certain other financial instruments.\nFor available-for-sale debt securities with unrealized losses, credit losses will be recognized as allowances rather than reductions in\nthe amortized cost of the securities. The standard is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2019 and\ninterim periods within those annual periods. Early adoption for a fiscal year beginning after December 15, 2018 is permitted. Entities\nwill apply the standard’s provisions as a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of the first effective\nreporting period. The Company expects to adopt this standard during the first quarter of its fiscal year ending September 30, 2021 and\nis currently evaluating the impact of this new guidance on its consolidated financial statements.\nIn March 2016, the FASB issued guidance to simplify key components of employee share-based payment accounting. The\nguidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within that reporting period. The\nnew guidance simplifies several aspects of the accounting for share-based payment transactions, including: (a) income tax\nconsequences; (b) classification of awards as either equity or liabilities; and (c) classification of excess tax benefits from share-based\npayments on the statement of cash flows. The Company will adopt this guidance in the first quarter of its fiscal year ending\nSeptember 30, 2018. No cumulative effect adjustment to retained earnings will be needed upon adoption as the Company has no\nunrecorded excess tax benefits residing in additional paid-in-capital account. Under the current standard, the Company is required to\ntrack and record as a component of additional paid-in capital the tax impact of cumulative windfalls, net of any shortfalls, which result\nfrom excess tax benefits from share-based payments. As a result, the impact of net windfalls has not historically affected the\nCompany’s provision for income taxes or its effective income tax rate. In addition, the Company will no longer track windfalls or\nshortfalls resulting from share-based payments since all future windfalls and shortfalls will be recorded as a component of the\nCompany’s current provision for income taxes. Depending on the magnitude of future windfalls or shortfalls, this change could\nsignificantly affect the Company’s provision for income taxes in a positive or negative direction.\nIn February 2016, the FASB issued guidance requiring a lessee to recognize assets and liabilities for leases with lease terms\nof more than 12 months. Consistent with current GAAP, the recognition, measurement and presentation of expense and cash flows\narising from a lease by a lessee primarily will depend on its classification of the lease as a finance or operating lease. However, unlike\ncurrent GAAP, which requires only capital leases to be recognized on the balance sheet, the new guidance will also require operating\nleases of the lessee to be recognized on the balance sheet if the operating lease term is more than 12 months. The guidance also\nrequires disclosures to help investors and other financial statement users to better understand the amount, timing and uncertainty of\ncash flows arising from leases. These disclosures include qualitative and quantitative requirements, providing additional information\nabout the amounts recorded in the financial statements. The guidance is effective for fiscal years, and interim reporting periods\ntherein, beginning after December 15, 2018 and is to be applied using the modified retrospective approach. The Company expects to\nadopt this standard in its first quarter of its fiscal year ending September 30, 2020. The Company currently is not a lessee under any\nlease agreements with a term longer than one year. The Company is routinely a lessor in its rental contracts with customers; however,\nthese rental agreements are generally short-term in nature and we believe would be treated as operating leases under the new guidance;\nhowever, we have not completed a detailed review of our lease arrangements and these conclusions are subject to change.\nIn July 2015, the FASB issued guidance requiring management to measure inventory at the lower of cost or net realizable\nvalue. Under the new guidance, net realizable value is defined as the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less\nreasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal, and transportation. The new guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after\nDecember 15, 2016, including interim periods within that reporting period and should be applied retrospectively, with early\napplication permitted. The Company will adopt this standard in its first quarter of its fiscal year ending September 30, 2018. Since\nthe Company is a manufacturer and the nature of its inventory is generally unique to its designs and applications thus preventing the\ngathering of relevant external market data, its practice for calculating net realizable value under the current standard is consistent with\nthe practice prescribed by the new guidance. Therefore, the Company does not expect the adoption of the new guidance to have a\nmaterial effect upon its consolidated financial statements.\nF-13\nGeospace Technologies Corporation and Subsidiaries\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements—(Continued)\nIn May 2014, the FASB issued guidance requiring entities to recognize revenue from contracts with customers by applying a\nfive-step model in accordance with the core principle to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount\nthat reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. In addition, this\nguidance specifies the accounting for some costs to obtain or fulfill a contract with a customer and expands disclosure requirements\nfor revenue recognition. In August 2015, the FASB issued guidance deferring the effective date of this guidance to annual periods\nbeginning after December 15, 2017, including interim reporting periods therein. Entities have the option to adopt this guidance either\nretrospectively or through a modified retrospective transition method. This new standard will supersede existing revenue guidance\nand affect the Company's revenue recognition process and the presentations or disclosures of the Company's consolidated financial\nstatements and footnotes. The Company recognizes revenue through three primary transactions types: (i) the immediate recognition\nof revenue through the routine delivery of products to its customers, (ii) the rental of equipment to its customers through short-term\noperating leases, and (iii) the recognition of revenue utilizing the percentage of completion method for the delivery of complex\nproducts requiring long manufacturing times and substantial engineering resources. The Company expects to adopt this standard in\nthe first quarter of its fiscal year ending September 30, 2019 and is in the early stages of evaluating the standard, including the method\nof adoption to determine the impact on its consolidated financial statements. Further disclosures around policy changes or quantitative\neffects will be made as the Company moves closer to the adoption of this standard.\n2. Short-term Investments\nDuring the fiscal years ended September 30, 2017, 2016 and 2015 the Company realized losses of $3,000, $5,000 and $7,000,\nrespectively, from the sale of short-term investments. The realized losses are recorded in Other Income (Expense) on the consolidated\nstatements of operations. At September 30, 2017, 2016 and 2015, the Company’s short-term investments were composed of the\nfollowing (in thousands):\nAS OF SEPTEMBER 30, 2017\nAmortized Unrealized Unrealized Estimated\nCost Gains Losses Fair Value\nShort-term investments\nCorporate bonds................................................................. $ 22,829 $ — $ (31) $ 22,798\nGovernment bonds............................................................. 13,363 — (24) 13,339\nTotal................................................................................... $ 36,192 $ — $ (55) $ 36,137\nAS OF SEPTEMBER 30, 2016\nAmortized Unrealized Unrealized Estimated\nCost Gains Losses Fair Value\nShort-term investments\nCorporate bonds................................................................. $ 17,342 $ — $ (19) $ 17,323\nGovernment bonds............................................................. 10,169 — (1) 10,168\nTotal................................................................................... $ 27,511 $ — $ (20) $ 27,491\nAS OF SEPTEMBER 30, 2015\nAmortized Unrealized Unrealized Estimated\nCost Gains Losses Fair Value\nShort-term investments\nCorporate bonds................................................................. $ 15,166 $ — $ (5) $ 15,161\nGovernment bonds............................................................. 2,948 3 — 2,951\nTotal................................................................................... $ 18,114 $ 3 $ (5) $ 18,112\nThe Company’s short-term investments have contractual maturities ranging from October 2017 to October 2019.\nF-14\nGeospace Technologies Corporation and Subsidiaries\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements—(Continued)\n3. Derivative Financial Instruments\nAt September 30, 2017, 2016 and 2015, the Company’s Canadian subsidiary had CAN$26.1 million, CAD$27.1 million and\nCAN$28.1 million, respectively, of Canadian dollar denominated intercompany accounts payable owed to one of the Company’s U.S\nsubsidiaries. In order to mitigate its exposure to movements in foreign currency rates between the U.S. dollar and Canadian dollar, the\nCompany routinely enters into foreign currency forward contracts to hedge a portion of its exposure to changes in the value of the\nCanadian dollar. On September 29, 2017, the Company entered into a CAN$9.0 million 90-day hedge contract with a United States\nBank to reduce the impact on cash flows from movements in the Canadian dollar/U.S. dollar currency exchange rate, but has not been\ndesignated as a hedge for accounting purposes.\nThe following table summarizes the gross fair value of all derivative instruments, which are not designated as hedging\ninstruments and their location in the consolidated balance sheets (in thousands):\nSeptember 30, September 30, September 30,\nDerivative Instrument Location 2017 2016 2015\nForeign Currency Forward\nContracts...................................

Fair Value of Financial Instruments\nAt September 30, 2016, the Company’s financial instruments included cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, a\nforeign currency forward contract, trade, notes and financing lease receivables and accounts payable. Due to the short-term maturities\nof cash and cash equivalents, trade and other receivables and accounts payable, the carrying amounts approximate fair value on the\nrespective balance sheet dates.\nThe Company measures short-term investments and derivatives at fair value on a recurring basis.\nThe following tables present the fair value of the Company’s short-term investments and foreign currency forward contracts\nat September 30, 2017, 2016 and 2015 respectively, by valuation hierarchy and input (in thousands):\nAS OF SEPTEMBER 30, 2017\nQuoted Prices\nin Active\nMarkets for Significant Other Significant\nIdentical Assets Observable Unobservable\n(Level 1) (Level 2) (Level 3) Totals\nShort-term investments\nCorporate bonds................................................................. $ 22,798 $ — $ — $ 22,798\nGovernment bonds............................................................. 13,339 — — 13,339\nTotal................................................................................... $ 36,137 $ — $ — $ 36,137\nF-15\nGeospace Technologies Corporation and Subsidiaries\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements—(Continued)\nAS OF SEPTEMBER 30, 2016\nQuoted Prices\nin Active\nMarkets for Significant Other Significant\nIdentical Assets Observable Unobservable\n(Level 1) (Level 2) (Level 3) Totals\nShort-term investments\nCorporate bonds................................................................. $ 17,323 $ — $ — $ 17,323\nGovernment bonds............................................................. 10,168 — — 10,168\nForeign currency forward contract.......................................... — 5 — 5\nTotal................................................................................... $ 27,491 $ 5 $ — $ 27,496\nAS OF SEPTEMBER 30, 2015\nQuoted Prices\nin Active\nMarkets for Significant Other Significant\nIdentical Assets Observable Unobservable\n(Level 1) (Level 2) (Level 3) Totals\nShort-term investments\nCorporate bonds................................................................. $ 15,161 $ — $ — $ 15,161\nGovernment bonds............................................................. 2,951 — — 2,951\nForeign currency forward contract.......................................... — (18) — (18)\nTotal................................................................................... $ 18,112 $ (18) $ — $ 18,094\nAssets and liabilities measured on a nonrecurring basis\nThe measurements utilized to determine the implied fair value of long-lived assets as of September 30, 2017, 2016 and 2015\nrepresented significant unobservable inputs (Level 3).\n5.

The\nimpairment expense is included as a component of cost of revenue in the consolidated statement of operations.\n10. Long-Term Debt\nThe Company had no long-term debt outstanding at September 30, 2017, 2016 and 2015.\nOn March 2, 2011, the Company entered into a credit agreement with Frost Bank with borrowing availability of $50.0\nmillion (the “Credit Agreement”). On May 4, 2015, the Company amended the Credit Agreement which reduced its borrowing\navailability to $30.0 million with amounts available for borrowing determined by a borrowing base. The borrowing base is\ndetermined based upon certain of the Company’s and its U.S. subsidiaries’ assets which include (i) 80% of certain accounts receivable\nplus (ii) 50% of certain notes receivable (such result not to exceed $10 million) plus (iii) 25% of certain inventories (excluding work-\nin-process inventories). As of September 30, 2017, the Company’s borrowing base was $24.1 million. As of September 30, 2017, the\namount available for borrowing was $23.8 after consideration of $0.3 million of outstanding letters of credit. The Company’s\ndomestic subsidiaries have guaranteed the obligations of the Company under the Credit Agreement and such subsidiaries have secured\nF-18\nGeospace Technologies Corporation and Subsidiaries\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements—(Continued)\ntheir obligations under such guarantees by the pledge of substantially all of the assets of such subsidiaries, except real property assets.\nThe Company is required to make monthly interest payments on borrowed funds. The Credit Agreement as amended limits the\nincurrence of additional indebtedness, requires the maintenance of a single financial ratio that compares certain of the Company’s\nassets to certain of its liabilities, restricts the Company and its subsidiaries’ ability to pay cash dividends and contains other covenants\ncustomary in agreements of this type. The interest rate for borrowings under the Credit Agreement as amended is based on the Wall\nStreet Journal prime rate, which was 4.25% at September 30, 2017. At September 30, 2017, the Company was in compliance with all\ncovenants under the Credit Agreement.\nOn October 25, 2017, the Company entered into another amendment to the Credit Agreement which extended its maturity\nfrom May 4, 2018 to April 30, 2019. The amendment also modified the borrowing base to be determined based upon certain of the\nCompany’s assets which include (i) 80% of certain accounts receivable plus (ii) 50% of certain notes receivable (such result not to\nexceed $10 million) plus (iii) 25% of certain inventories (such result not to exceed $20 million) and requires the Company to maintain\nunencumbered liquid assets of $10 million. The amendment also removed a requirement that the Company maintain a financial ratio\nthat compares certain of the Company’s assets to certain of its liabilities and imposed a new financial covenant that the Company\nmaintain a minimum amount of certain liquid assets.\n11.

The Company has purchased stop-loss\ncoverage for individual claims in excess of $175,000 per claimant per year in order to limit its exposure to any significant levels of\nemployee medical claims. Self-insured losses are accrued based on the Company’s historical experience and on estimates of\naggregate liability for uninsured claims incurred using certain actuarial assumptions followed in the insurance industry.\n12. Employee Benefits\nThe Company’s U.S. employees are participants in the Geospace Technologies Corporation’s Employee’s 401(k) Retirement\nPlan (the “Plan”), which covers substantially all eligible employees in the United States. The Plan is a qualified salary reduction plan\nin which all eligible participants may elect to have a percentage of their compensation contributed to the Plan, subject to certain\nguidelines issued by the Internal Revenue Service. The Company’s share of discretionary matching contributions was approximately\n$0.8 million, $0.8 million and $1.0 million in fiscal years 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.\nThe Company’s stock incentive plans in which key employees may participate are discussed in Note 13 to these Consolidated\nFinancial Statements.\n13. Stockholders’ Equity\nIn September 1997, the board of directors and stockholders approved the 1997 Key Employee Stock Option Plan (as\namended the “1997 Plan”) and, following amendments thereto, there has been reserved an aggregate of 2,250,000 shares of common\nstock for issuance thereunder. The1997 Plan expired in November 2017.\nF-19\nGeospace Technologies Corporation and Subsidiaries\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements—(Continued)\nIn February 2014, the board of directors and stockholders approved the 2014 Long Term Incentive Plan (the “2014 Plan”),\nwhich replaced the 1997 Plan. Under the 2014 Plan, an aggregate of 1,500,000 shares of common stock may be issued. The\nCompany is authorized to issue nonqualified and incentive stock options to purchase common stock and restricted stock awards of\ncommon stock to key employees, directors and consultants under the 2014 Plan. Options have a term not to exceed ten years, with the\nexception of incentive stock options granted to employees owning ten percent or more of the outstanding shares of common stock,\nwhich have a term not to exceed five years. The exercise price of any option may not be less than the fair market value of the\ncommon stock on the date of grant. In the case of incentive stock options granted to an employee owning ten percent or more of the\noutstanding shares of common stock, the exercise price of such option may not be less than 110% of the fair market value of the\ncommon stock on the date of grant. Under the 2014 Plan, the Company may issue shares of restricted stock to employees for no\npayment by the employee or for a payment below the fair market value on the date of grant. The restricted stock is subject to certain\nrestrictions described in the 2014 Plan.\nAt September 30, 2017, an aggregate of 923,175 shares of common stock were available for issuance under the 2014 Plan.\nNo shares of common stock were available for issuance under the 1997 Plan.\nThe following table summarizes the combined activity under the equity incentive plans for the indicated periods:\nWeighted Weighted\nNumber of Average Average\nNonqualified Exercise Number of Grant-date\nOptions Price per Restricted Fair Value\nOutstanding Share Stock Awards per Share\nOutstanding at October 1, 2014............................................... 89,700 $ 17.27 189,000 $ 95.03\nGranted............................................................................... — — 3,000 19.13\nExercised............................................................................ — — — —\nForfeited............................................................................. — — (2,500) 98.68\nVested................................................................................. — — (47,000) 95.02\nOutstanding at September 30, 2015......................................... 89,700 17.27 142,500 93.80\nGranted............................................................................... 69,300 14.87 182,400 14.84\nExercised............................................................................ — — — —\nForfeited............................................................................. — — (2,250) 77.33\nVested................................................................................. — — (49,000) 90.73\nOutstanding at September 30, 2016......................................... 159,000 16.23 273,650 39.98\nGranted............................................................................... 51,300 21.42 109,500 21.12\nExercised............................................................................

The weighted average\ngrant date fair value of the restricted stock was $21.12 per share. The grant date fair value of these awards was $2.3 million, which\nwill be charged to expense over the next four years as the restrictions lapse. Compensation expense for restricted stock awards was\ndetermined based on the closing market price of the Company’s stock on the date of grant applied to the total number of shares that\nare anticipated to fully vest. Recipients of restricted stock awards are entitled to vote such shares and are entitled to dividends, if paid.\nDuring fiscal year 2017, the Company also issued 51,300 nonqualified stock options under the Plan. The options issued are\nbased upon three tiers, each with separate service based vesting conditions and market conditions that affect exercisability. The\nmarket based conditions are based on achieving a specified market return on the Company’s stock price. Compensation expense for\nthe nonqualified stock option awards was determined based on a Monte Carlo simulation, which incorporates the possibility that the\nmarket conditions may not be satisfied. The weighted average grant date fair value of the options issued was determined to be $9.35\nper option. The requisite service period of the options issued ranges from 18 to 36 months.\nThe restricted stock outstanding at September 30, 2017, 2016 and 2015 was issued from the 2014 Plan. The stock options\noutstanding at September 30, 2015 were issued under the 1997 Plan. The stock options granted during fiscal year 2017 and 2016 were\nissued under the 2014 Plan. All stock options outstanding represent nonqualified options.\nThe total intrinsic value of nonqualified stock options exercised during fiscal year 2017 was $45,000.

Loss Per Common Share\nThe Company applies the two-class method in calculating per share data. Basic loss per share is computed by dividing net\nloss available to common stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares used in basic loss per share during the\nperiod. Diluted loss per share is determined on the assumption that outstanding dilutive stock options have been exercised and the\naggregate proceeds as defined were used to reacquire common stock using the average price of such common stock for the period.\nThe following table summarizes the calculation of net loss and weighted average common shares and common equivalent\nshares outstanding for purposes of the computation of loss per share (in thousands, except share and per share amounts):\nYEAR ENDED SEPTEMBER 30,\n2017 2016 2015\nNet loss...................................................................................... $ (56,791) $ (45,970) $ (32,641)\nLess: Income allocable to unvested restricted stock................. — — —\nLoss available to common shareholders...................................

No stock\noptions were excluded in the calculation of weighted average shares outstanding for fiscal year 2015.\n16. Related Party Transactions\nThe Company regularly transacts business with Creative Marketing Services, LP (“CMS”), a company owned by the spouse\nof Richard F. Miles, a director of the Company. CMS is a marketing company which has historically provided marketing,\ncommunications, and support services to the Company, including product photography, video shoots, brochure design, magazine\nadvertising, website design, annual report production and various other marketing and advertising services. For fiscal years 2017,\n2016 and 2015, the Company incurred expenses of $7,000, $39,000, and $79,000, respectively, to CMS for these services.\n17. Exit and Disposal Activities\nDuring the first quarter of fiscal year 2016, the Company initiated a program to reduce operating costs in light of the decrease\nin demand for its seismic products. The program included workforce reductions, a facility consolidation and other cost reductions\nrelated to the Company’s seismic business segment. In connection with its workforce reductions, the Company incurred $1.0 million\nof termination costs in its second fiscal quarter of 2016. The costs related to the program are recorded to both cost of revenue and\noperating expenses in the consolidated statement of operations. No further costs are expected and there were no outstanding liabilities\nrelated to this program as of September 30, 2017 and 2016.\n18. Commitments and Contingencies\nOperating Leases\nThe Company leases office space and certain equipment on a month to month basis. Rent expense was approximately $0.1\nmillion, $0.2 million and $0.4 million during fiscal years 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.\nF-24\nGeospace Technologies Corporation and Subsidiaries\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements—(Continued)\nLegal Proceedings\nThe Company is involved in various pending legal actions in the ordinary course of its business.

If any director\nnominee is not available, the proxy holders may vote your shares for a substitute if you have submitted a signed and dated\nproxy card that does not withhold authority to vote for director nominees.\nThe Company is not aware of any matters to be brought before the Annual Meeting other than those described in\nthis proxy statement. If any other matters not now known are properly brought by the Company before the Annual Meeting,\nand if you return a signed, dated proxy card, the proxy holders may vote your shares in their discretion as to those other\nmatters.\nA quorum is required to conduct business at the Annual Meeting. The holders of a majority of the outstanding shares\nof Common Stock of the Company having voting power with respect to a subject matter (excluding shares held by the\nCompany for its own account) present or represented by proxy will constitute a quorum at the Annual Meeting of stockholders\nfor the transaction of business with respect to such subject matter. Abstentions and broker non-votes are counted as shares\npresent for determining a quorum.\nEach of the director nominees will be elected if such nominee receives the affirmative vote of the majority of the\nvotes cast for an open directorship so long as the number of nominees for election equals the number of nominees to be\nelected (an “Uncontested Election”). For the purpose of an Uncontested Election, a majority of votes cast means that the\nnumber of votes “for” a nominee’s election must exceed 50% of the votes cast with respect to that nominee’s election. Votes\n“against” a nominee’s election will count as votes cast, but “abstentions” and “broker non-votes” will not count as votes cast\nwith respect to that nominee’s election. In order for any person to become a member of the Board, such person must agree to\nsubmit upon appointment or first election to the Board an irrevocable resignation, which resignation shall provide that it shall\nbecome effective (contingent upon acceptance of the resignation by the Board), in the event of a stockholder vote in an\nUncontested Election in which that person does not receive a majority of the votes cast with respect to that person’s election\nas a director, at the earlier of (i) the selection of a replacement director by the Board, (ii) 180 days after certification of such\nstockholder vote, or (iii) acceptance by the Board.

Abstentions will have the same effect as a vote “against” these proposals and broker non-votes will have\nno effect on the vote for these proposals.\nBroker non-votes occur when nominees, such as brokers and banks holding shares on behalf of the beneficial owners,\nare prohibited from exercising discretionary voting authority for beneficial owners who have not provided voting instructions.\nIf you do not give instructions to your bank, brokerage firm or other agent, the bank, brokerage firm or other agent will\nnevertheless be entitled to vote your shares of Common Stock in its discretion on “routine matters” and may give or authorize\nthe giving of a proxy to vote the shares of Common Stock in its discretion on such matters. The ratification of independent\npublic accountants is generally a routine matter whereas the election of directors is not considered a routine matter.

Mr. Owens was the Company’s previous President and\nChief Executive Officer from 1997 until his retirement in December 2013. The Company has not established a written position\ndescription for our Chairman of the Board. A primary function of that position is to set the agenda for and lead meetings of\nthe Company’s Board.

The\nCompany believes that the Lead Independent Director position strikes an appropriate balance between Mr. Owens’ significant\nexecutive, customer, and industry knowledge in his position as Chairman and the Board’s fiduciary duties to stockholders.\nAs a governance best practice, all members of the audit, compensation, and nominating and corporate governance\ncommittees are independent. The Board has established processes for the effective oversight of critical issues charged to\nindependent Directors such as the integrity of our financial statements, senior executive compensation, succession planning,\nelection of the Lead Independent Director, membership of independent Board committees, evaluations of the Board,\ncommittee and Directors, and nominations for Directors.\nSuccession planning and leadership development are top priorities for the Board and management.

To assist the Board, the CEO periodically reports on individual senior executives’ potential to succeed to the\nposition of CEO and provides an assessment of potential successors to other key positions.\nThe Company further believes that separation of the Chairman and executive officer roles allows Mr. Wheeler to\nfocus his time and energy on operating and managing the Company while leveraging the experience and perspectives of the\nChairman.

A representative of RSM is expected to be present at the Annual Meeting and will be available to make\na statement if such representative desires to do so and to respond to appropriate questions.\nThe Board recommends voting “FOR” this proposal.\nAudit Committee Report\nThe Audit Committee of the Board of Directors of the Company, which operates under a written charter adopted by the entire\nBoard of Directors of the Company (the “Board”), serves as the representative of the Board for general oversight of the\nCompany’s financial accounting and reporting process, system of internal control, audit process and process for monitoring\ncompliance with laws and regulations and the Company’s standards of business conduct. The Company’s management has\nprimary responsibility for preparing the Company’s financial statements and for the Company’s internal controls and the\nfinancial reporting process. The Company’s independent registered public accounting firm, RSM US LLP (“RSM”), is\nresponsible for expressing an opinion on the conformity of the Company’s financial statements to generally accepted\naccounting principles in the United States in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight\nBoard (the “PCAOB”).\nIn this context, the Audit Committee hereby reports as follows:\n1) The Audit Committee regularly meets and holds discussions with the Company’s management, Internal Audit\ndepartment, and RSM. Discussions with the Internal Audit department and RSM occur either in private sessions\n(without the attendance of the Company’s management) or in conjunction with the Company’s management.\nDiscussions include, but are not limited to: (i) the quality of significant accounting principles, (ii) the reasonableness\nof critical accounting estimates, (iii) and critical audit matters and the disclosures of those matters in the consolidated\nfinancial statements identified by RSM during the audit.\n2) The Audit Committee reviews the internal audit plan, determines the adequacy of internal audit independence, and\nreviews internal audit reports.\n3) The Audit Committee has reviewed and discussed the audited financial statements as of and for the year ended\nSeptember 30, 2023 with management and RSM.\n4) The Audit Committee has discussed with RSM the matters required to be discussed by the applicable requirements\nof the PCAOB and the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”).\n5) The Audit Committee has received and reviewed the written disclosures and the letter from RSM required by the\napplicable requirements of the PCAOB regarding RSM’s communications with the Audit Committee concerning\nindependence and has discussed with RSM RSM’s independence. In reviewing the independence of RSM, the Audit\nCommittee considered non-audit services provided by the independent auditors and the fees and costs billed for\nthese services.\n6) Based on the review and discussions referred to in paragraphs (1) through (5) above, the Audit Committee\nrecommended to the Board, and the Board approved, that the audited financial statements be included in the\nCompany’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023 for filing with the SEC.\nEach of the members of the Audit Committee is independent as defined under the SEC’s independence rules and the listing\nstandards of the NASDAQ market exchange.\nEdgar R. Giesinger, Jr. – Chairman\nThomas L. Davis, Ph.D.\nRichard F. Miles\nIndependent Public Accountants\nRSM served as the Company’s principal independent public accountants for fiscal years 2023 and 2022. A\nrepresentative of RSM is expected to attend the Annual Meeting, will have the opportunity to make a statement if they so\ndesire and will be available to respond to appropriate questions.\nAudit Fees\nThe aggregate fees billed by RSM for professional services rendered for the audit of the Company’s annual financial\nstatements and the reviews of the financial statements included in the Company’s Forms 10-Q were $543,300 and $509,300,\nrespectively, for fiscal years 2023 and 2022.\nThe Company uses firms other than RSM for certain of its statutory audit-related services for its international\nsubsidiaries.\nAudit-Related Fees\nThere were no fees billed by RSM for audit-related services for fiscal years 2023 and 2022.\nTax Fees\nThe Company used a firm other than RSM for its tax services for fiscal years 2023 and 2022.\nAll Other Fees\nThere were no fees billed by RSM for other services not disclosed above for fiscal years 2023 and 2022.\nCompatibility of Certain Fees with Independent Accountants’ Independence\nThe audit committee has adopted pre-approval policies and procedures pursuant to which the engagement of the\nCompany’s independent accountant is approved. Such procedures govern the ways in which the audit committee will pre-\napprove audit and various categories of non-audit services that the independent accountant provides to the Company and its\nsubsidiaries. In accordance with this policy, the audit committee had given its approval for the provision of audit services by\nRSM for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023. Services which have not received pre-approval must receive specific\napproval of the audit committee. The audit committee is informed of each such engagement in a timely manner, and such\nprocedures do not include delegation of the audit committee’s responsibilities to management. The audit contract that was\nentered into in fiscal year 2023 was pre-approved by the audit committee.\nPROPOSAL III: ADVISORY (NON-BINDING) VOTE ON EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION\nAs required pursuant to Section 14A of the Securities Exchange Act, at the Annual Meeting, the stockholders will\nvote on a non-binding, advisory resolution regarding the compensation of the Company’s named executive officers.\nThe Company believes that its compensation policies and procedures are competitive, focused on pay-for-\nperformance and strongly aligned with the long-term interests of its stockholders. This advisory stockholder vote, commonly\nknown as “Say-on-Pay,” gives you as a stockholder the opportunity to endorse or not endorse the compensation the Company\npays its named executive officers through voting for or against the following resolution:\n“RESOLVED, that the stockholders approve the compensation of the Company’s named executive officers\nas disclosed in the Company’s 2024 proxy statement pursuant to Item 402 of Regulation S-K, (which disclosure\nincludes the Overview of Company Executive Compensation Program, the Summary Compensation Table and the\nother executive compensation tables and related discussion).”\nThe Company and the compensation committee remain committed to the compensation philosophy, policies and\nobjectives outlined under the heading “Overview of Company Compensation” in this proxy statement. As always, the\ncompensation committee will continue to review all elements of the executive compensation program and take any steps it\ndeems necessary to continue to fulfill the objectives of the program.\nStockholders are encouraged to carefully review the “Overview of Company Compensation” section of this\nproxy statement for a detailed discussion of the Company’s executive compensation program.\nBecause your vote is advisory, it will not be binding upon the Company or the Board. However, the compensation\ncommittee will take into account the outcome of the vote when considering future executive compensation arrangements.\nAdditionally, your advisory vote will not be construed (i) as overruling a decision by the Company or the Board, (ii) to create\nor imply any change to the fiduciary duties of the Company or the Board, (iii) to create or imply any additional fiduciary\nduties for the Company or the Board, or (iv) to restrict or limit the ability of stockholders to make proposals for inclusion in\nproxy materials related to executive compensation.\nThe Board recommends voting “FOR” this proposal.\nSmaller Reporting Company\nBecause the Company qualifies as a “smaller reporting company” under the SEC rules, the Company has elected to\nprepare this proxy statement and other annual and periodic reports as a “Smaller Reporting Company” pursuant to the rules\nof the SEC. Under the scaled disclosure obligations, the named executive officer’s group generally consists of only three\nexecutive officers, specifically the principle executive officer and the Company’s two other most highly compensated\nexecutive officers serving at the end of the last completed fiscal year and the Company is not required to provide, among\nother things, Compensation Discussion and Analysis and certain other tabular and narrative disclosures relating to executive\ncompensation.\nExecutive Officers and Compensation\nThe Company considers the following individuals to be its only executive officers. Information regarding such\nexecutive officers follows:\nName Age Position\nWalter R. Wheeler ..................... 70 President and Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”)\nRobert L. Curda ......................... 50 Vice President and Chief Financial Officer\nRobbin B. Adams ....................... 66 Senior Vice President and Chief Technical Officer\nRobert L. Curda was appointed as the Company’s Vice President and Chief Financial Officer on January 1, 2020.\nMr. Curda has previously served as the Company’s Operational Controller since 2005. Prior to 2005, Mr. Curda worked for\neight years in various accounting and finance roles at National Oilwell (now known as National Oilwell Varco). Mr. Curda\nhas been a licensed certified public account in the State of Texas since 1999.\nRobbin B. Adams was appointed as the Company’s Senior Vice President and Chief Technical Officer on June 30,\n2023. Mr. Adams served as the Company’s Executive Vice President and Chief Project Engineer since 2012. Mr. Adams has\nbeen a design engineer with the Company since 1997. Prior to 1997, Mr. Adams worked for 16 years as a design engineer at\nInput/Output, Inc. (now known as ION Geophysical Corp.).\nMr. Wheeler’s background is described above under “Background of Nominees and Continuing Directors.”\nOverview of Company Executive Compensation Program\nObjectives of Compensation Programs\nThe Company’s executive compensation program is designed to attract, motivate and retain highly talented and\nexperienced management personnel and drive organizational performance that is in the best interest of our stockholders in\nthe long-term. The Company uses traditional compensation elements of base salary, annual performance bonuses and long-\nterm incentive stock-based awards.\nExecutive officers generally receive the same benefits as other employees. Any differences are typically due to\nposition, seniority, or local requirements. Consistent with this philosophy, executive officers receive minimal perquisites. Mr.\nWheeler and Mr. Adams have entered into employment agreements with the Company, which, under certain circumstances,\nprovide them with certain severance benefits upon their terminations of employment. See “Potential Payments upon\nTermination or Change-in-Control” below for more information on these benefits. The Company’s compensation policies are\ndesigned to enhance financial performance and stockholder value by aligning the financial interests of the executive officers\nand employees with those of its stockholders.\nWhat the Company’s Compensation Is Designed to Reward\nThe Company’s compensation program is designed to reward teamwork and each individual’s contribution to the\nCompany, including the impact of such contribution on the Company’s overall financial performance, as well as to produce\npositive long-term results for its stockholders and employees.\nAdministration\nThe compensation committee is composed of three independent members of the Board. No compensation committee\nmember participates in any of the Company’s employee compensation programs. The Company’s non-employee directors\nare eligible to and do participate in its 2014 Long-Term Incentive Plan (the “2014 Plan”). The compensation committee (i)\nsets and recommends annual compensation, including equity awards and discretionary goal-oriented cash bonuses for the\nCompany’s named executive officers to the full Board for approval, (ii) reviews and approves the overall compensation\npolicy, philosophy and strategy for all other employees, and (iii) reviews and approves awards under equity incentive plans\nand the non-equity incentive program to all employees as recommended to the compensation committee by management.\nThe compensation committee frequently utilizes the services of Frederic W. Cook & Co, Inc., an independent\ncompensation consultant (the “Compensation Consultant”) to advise the Company on its performance-based equity grants.\nThe Compensation Consultant performs an evaluation of the Company’s compensation program concerning future\nperformance-based equity grants and how to balance those grants with base salary and cash bonus compensation.\nAt the 2023 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, the stockholders approved, by a non-binding, advisory resolution, the\ncompensation of the Company’s named executive officers. The compensation committee considered this resolution of the\nstockholders in its review of executive compensation in fiscal year 2023 and determined that the stockholders supported the\ncompensation packages awarded to the Company’s named executive officers and the objectives and policies by which those\npackages were determined. We submit the compensation of the Company’s named executive officers for stockholder approval\non a non-binding advisory basis annually. Pursuant to a non-binding advisory resolution adopted by the stockholders at the\n2022 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, the stockholders approved this frequency.\nElements of Compensation\nGeneral\nThe primary elements of the executive compensation program consist of (1) base salary, (2) annual cash bonuses\npursuant to a non-equity, incentive annual bonus program, (3) goal-oriented discretionary cash bonuses, and (4) long term\nincentives in the form of equity-based compensation awards. Equity-based compensation awards have historically included\nnonqualified stock options, restricted stock awards, and restricted stock unit awards. Each executive officer’s current and\nprior compensation is considered in setting future compensation and, while consideration is given to the vesting and value of\npreviously granted equity-based compensation awards, the total compensation package is not regularly adjusted for such\nvalues. In addition, the Company focuses on the relative roles of the executive officers throughout the organization when\ndetermining compensation.\nThe Company chooses to pay each element of compensation to reward executives through various means. The base\nsalary and employee benefits compensate executives for their daily efforts as management of the Company. The annual non-\nequity incentive annual bonus program, described in more detail below, encourages executives to not only meet goals for the\nCompany, measured in terms of consolidated pretax profits (before bonus), but also encourages other employees to meet\ngoals as well. The equity-based compensation awards provide a long-term incentive to executives and other key employees\nto improve the performance of the Company as viewed by the market as reflected in the market price for Common Stock.\nAn executive officer’s annual base salary and annual cash bonuses do not fluctuate as a result of increases or\ndecreases in the market value of equity-based compensation awards. For example, if the stock price has grown significantly,\nresulting in large potential gains on vested stock awards, an executive officer’s base salary or bonus potential is not adjusted\nfor that reason. However, the compensation committee may consider those gains in awarding additional equity-based\ncompensation. Similarly, the compensation committee would not consider a large cash bonus award under the Company’s\nannual performance bonus program or a large goal-oriented discretionary cash bonus to be a reason to reduce the equity-\nbased compensation awards or annual base salary received by the executive in the following fiscal year. The Company views\neach compensation element as a different means of encouraging and promoting performance. These compensation elements\nare designed to work in tandem.\nThe compensation committee considers the base salary levels supplemented by bonus awards and equity\ncompensation in evaluating the total executive compensation package. The executive officers are encouraged to earn their\nbonuses and equity compensation in order to realize the full value of their compensation package. The Company intends that\nthe attainment of the performance goals established by the compensation committee will benefit its stockholders.\nThe compensation committee does not believe that there is another public company that is a direct peer to the\nCompany in the seismic industry. The Company is primarily a manufacturer of seismic products and does not provide\ntraditional seismic services or maintain a seismic data library like other seismic companies. One of the Company’s most\ndirect competitors is a subsidiary of a much larger company, and there is no access to compensation information of that\nsubsidiary. The compensation committee from time to time does review publicly available information on seismic and other\nenergy industry participants to help understand the marketplace in which the Company competes. The Compensation\nConsultant assists the committee in gathering executive compensation information from a broad group of energy industry\ncompanies. The compensation committee strives to maintain a reasonable compensation package for each executive officer\nand uses this information to retain such officer and provide incentives for such officer to continue to improve the Company’s\nperformance in the future.\nThe conclusion of the compensation committee after its most recent examination of the publicly available executive\ncompensation of energy industry companies was that the Company’s total compensation of each of its executive officers,\nparticularly their base salaries and cash bonuses, were typically lower than the compensation of executive officers in other\nenergy industry companies, adjusting for various factors such as size, location and seniority of the executive officer. The\nCompany places a high priority on the retention of its key employees, particularly its executive officers. The Board of the\nCompany believes that these executive officers have made significant contributions to the growth and development of the\nCompany and have developed a synergy among themselves that fosters progress and support. The Board believes that a loss\nof any one of these executive officers could have a significant adverse impact on the Company. Based upon these\nconsiderations, the compensation committee designed compensation packages for the Company’s executive officers.\nRelative Size of Major Compensation Elements\nThe combination of base salary, non-equity incentive annual bonus program, goal-oriented discretionary cash\nbonuses, and equity incentive awards comprise total direct compensation. In setting named executive officer compensation,\nthe compensation committee considers the aggregate compensation payable to the executive officer and the form of the\ncompensation. The compensation committee seeks to achieve the appropriate balance between immediate cash rewards and\nincentives for the achievement of both annual and long-term financial and non-financial objectives.\nGenerally, the compensation committee targets overall compensation packages for the Company’s executive officers\nthat are competitive with the total value received by executive officers at other energy companies. Due to the nature of the\nCompany’s business and the compensation committee’s use of performance based stock options, performance based restricted\nstock unit awards, and a performance based annual cash bonus plan, it is possible for its executive officers to receive above\ntarget compensation when the Company’s stock price increases and total shareholder return and financial performance hurdles\nare met. Conversely, in years when the Company’s stock price remains unchanged or total shareholder return and financial\nperformance hurdles are not met, its executive officers will receive minimal financial compensation, if any, in addition to\ntheir base salaries. The compensation committee attempts to maintain annual base salary ranges that are intended to be\nreasonably competitive with salaries at other energy industry companies, therefore improving the likelihood of retaining the\nexecutive officers that we believe are crucial to the long-term success of the Company. A substantial portion of target\ncompensation is in the form of “at-risk” performance-based compensation that is linked to the Company’s financial\nperformance. The compensation committee believes that this blend strikes an appropriate balance between effectively\nretaining key employees and aligning the interests of our executives with those of our stockholders.\nBase Annual Salaries\nThe base annual salaries of the Company’s named executive officers were as follows:\nFiscal Year Ended\nSeptember 30, 2023\nMr. Wheeler, President and Chief Executive Officer ............................................................................ $ 350,000\nMr. Curda, Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Secretary ....................................................... $ 250,000\nMr. Sheen, Senior Vice President and Chief Technical Officer (1) ........................................................ $ 300,000\nMr. Adams, Senior Vice President and Chief Technical Officer (since June 30, 2023) ....................... $ 310,000\n(1) Mr. Sheen resigned on June 30, 2023.\nAnnual Performance Bonuses\nFor fiscal year 2023, the Board adopted comprehensive company-wide bonus compensation criteria (the “2023\nBonus Criteria”) for all employees. The 2023 Bonus Criteria, which follows the same principles, goals and criteria as in the\nbonus program and criteria previously established for prior fiscal years, set forth various targets and criteria for the Company’s\noperating performance and established a cash bonus, assessed on an individual basis, for employees of the Company. The\nfinancial targets were designed to provide incentives for the employees to work as a team to improve the Company’s financial\nresults.\nUnder the 2023 Bonus Criteria, every employee of the Company is eligible to participate in Tier I of the bonus plan,\nexcept for employees in the Russian Federation who participate in a local plan. Under Tier I, employees share proportionally\nin the Company’s profits based on each employee’s relative payroll. The Tier I bonus pool is established by accruing 20% of\nconsolidated pretax profits (before bonus) above a specified range. Various management teams, including the executive\nofficers, and selected key employees are eligible to participate in Tier II of the 2023 Bonus Criteria, which applies after Tier\nI is fully funded. The Tier II bonus pool is established by accruing 20% of consolidated pretax profits (before bonus) within\na specified range above Tier I. Under Tier II, certain participants share in the bonus pool depending on the satisfaction of\npredefined goals by their respective working groups. Should the Company’s pretax profits (before bonus) exceed the amount\nrequired to achieve fully funded Tier I and Tier II bonus pools, the bonus pools will be additionally funded at the rate of 10%\nof subsequent excess pretax profits (before bonus), divided between Tier 1 and Tier II according to the ratio of their initial\ntargeted amounts. None of the named executive officers were required to satisfy individual predefined goals under the 2023\nBonus Criteria. Tier I bonuses are paid if the Company reaches a predetermined pretax profit (before bonus) level. Tier II is\nbased on attaining a predetermined consolidated pretax profits (before bonus) level as well as, in most cases (but not in the\ncase of named executive officers), specific performance criteria of the group eligible for the bonus. The predetermined pretax\nprofits (before bonus) levels as well as the specific performance criteria are re-evaluated annually. The groups eligible for\nTier II bonuses in one year are not necessarily eligible the following year. The eligible groups are selected based on\nmanagement’s goals for improvement across the Company.\nThe Company’s named executive officers were not required to achieve individual performance targets in order to\nearn their respective annual cash incentive payments under the 2023 Bonus Criteria. However, the consolidated pretax profits\n(before bonus) of the Company must reach a predetermined threshold before Tier I or Tier II bonus payments will be made.\nThe difficulty of attaining the performance criteria fluctuates in response to the Company’s industry, market and overall\nperformance. While each of Messrs. Wheeler, Curda, Sheen and Adams had the ability to influence the Company’s financial\nperformance, none of them can ensure that the Company’s performance will rise to the level of satisfying the Tier I or Tier\nII thresholds. For fiscal year 2023, the Tier I bonus pool was funded in the amount of $1,622,000. No Tier II bonuses were\nfunded or paid. The bonuses were paid in December 2023. The Tier I bonuses earned by the Company’s named executive\nofficers were $15,812 for Mr. Wheeler, $11,294 for Mr. Curda, $10,165 for Mr. Sheen and $14,005 for Mr. Adams. For fiscal\nyear 2022, no bonuses were funded or paid.\nGoal Oriented Discretionary Cash Bonuses\nIf certain executive officers do not receive any payments under the bonus program described above, they are eligible\nto receive goal oriented discretionary cash bonuses up to 30% of their respective base salary based on individualized goals\nand other factors which are evaluated on an on-going basis by the compensation committee and Board. For fiscal year 2023\nand 2022 no goal oriented bonuses paid.\nLong-Term Stock-Based Compensation\nThe Company believes that long-term incentive compensation is an important component of its compensation\nprogram and that the value of this compensation should be directly related to increases in stockholder value. In addition to\nbase salaries, annual performance bonuses, and goal-oriented discretionary cash bonuses, the executive officers have\nhistorically participated in the 2014 Plan, which allows the Company to grant long-term incentive compensation to its\nexecutive officers and directors in the form of stock options, restricted stock awards, restricted stock unit (“RSU”) awards,\nand other awards. RSU awards represent a contingent right to receive one share of Common Stock upon vesting.\nHistorically, equity incentive compensation awards were determined based on an individual’s annual compensation\nand his or her contribution to the Company. The compensation committee independently sets and recommends stock option\ngrants, restricted stock awards, and RSU awards for the Company’s executive officers to the full Board for approval. Such\nawards may include service-based vesting and performance goal based vesting provisions.

No restricted stock awards or stock options were awarded in fiscal year 2022. On\nNovember 17, 2022, based on the Company’s total revenue for fiscal year 2022, the compensation committee determined\nthat none of the vesting provisions had been met on the performance-based RSU awards granted on November 18, 2021 and\nthese awards were forfeited.\nOn November 21, 2022, the Company granted the following RSU awards, with Mr. Wheeler receiving 4,000 RSU\nawards with service-based vesting provisions and 15,000 RSU awards with both service-based and performance-based\nvesting provisions; each of Messrs.

No restricted stock awards or stock options were awarded in fiscal year 2023.\nOn November 16, 2023, based on the Company’s total revenue for fiscal year 2023, the compensation committee determined\nthat all of the vesting provisions had been met on the performance-based RSU awards granted on November 21, 2022, with\nthe exception of Mr. Sheen, in which 3,250 of his awards were forfeited.\nThe Board and the compensation committee intend to make annual grants of RSU awards to the Company’s senior\nexecutive officers which may include service-based vesting and performance based vesting provisions to be determined by\nthe compensation committee each year. The compensation committee will review the long-term incentive program each year\nto ensure that the key elements of the program continue to meet the objectives described above.\nBenefits\nThe Company offers a variety of health and welfare and retirement programs to all eligible employees. Executive\nofficers generally are eligible for the same benefit programs on the same basis as the rest of the broad-based employees. The\nhealth and welfare programs are intended to protect employees against catastrophic loss and encourage a healthy lifestyle.\nThe Company’s health and welfare programs include medical, wellness, pharmacy, dental, life insurance and accidental death\nand disability. Each employee receives life insurance equal to the employee’s annual salary with a maximum payout of\n$100,000 and accidental death and dismemberment coverage.\nThe Company maintains a defined contribution retirement plan that is intended to qualify under Section 401(k) of\nthe Code. The plan covers all full-time employees who meet age and service requirements. The plan provides for pre-tax,\nelective employee contributions with a matching contribution from us ranging from 50% to 100% of employee contributions,\nup to a maximum of 3.5% of the employee’s annual salary.\nThe Company offers vacation time determined by years of service. As of September 30, 2023, Mr. Curda had accrued\n146 hours of vacation; Mr. Adams had accrued 258 hours of vacation; and Mr. Wheeler had accrued 262 hours of vacation.\nEmployees, including executive officers, may roll over up to 160 hours of unused vacation time to subsequent years.\nThe Company also maintains key man life insurance policies on Messrs. Wheeler, Curda and Adams exclusively for\nits benefit.\nImpact of Accounting and Tax Treatment\nA standard issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board requires a public company to measure the cost of\nemployee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant date fair value of the award.\nThe equity awards the Company grants are structured to comply with the requirements of the standard to maintain the\nappropriate equity accounting treatment.\nSection 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code generally disallows a tax deduction to public corporations for\ncompensation paid in excess of $1,000,000 for any fiscal year to the corporation’s chief executive officer, chief financial\nofficer and three other most highly compensated executive officers as of the end of any fiscal year (and certain former\nexecutive officers). As a result, we generally expect that compensation paid to our applicable named executives in excess of\n$1 million will not be deductible.\nSection 409A of the Code, as amended (“Section 409A”), provides that deferrals of compensation under a\nnonqualified deferred compensation plan for all taxable years are currently includible in gross income to the extent not subject\nto a substantial risk of forfeiture and not previously included in gross income, unless certain requirements are met. The\nCompany intends to structure any deferred compensation items to be in compliance with or exempt from Section 409A.\nSummary Compensation Table\nThe following table sets forth certain information regarding compensation paid for services rendered during the\nfiscal years ended September 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively, to each of the Company’s named executive officers:\n2023 SUMMARY COMPENSATION TABLE\nNon-Equity\nStock Incentive All Other\nSalary Awards Compensation Compensation Total\nName and Principal Position Year ($) ($)(2)(3) ($)(4) ($)(5) ($)\nWalter R.

CAP to both the Company’s CEO and\nNon-CEO NEOs increased in fiscal year 2023 when compared to fiscal year 2022. The increase in CAP resulted from (i) an\nincrease in the fair value of awards granted in prior years to its CEO and Non-CEO NEOs that were outstanding and unvested\nat September 30, 2022, and (ii) awards granted to its CEO and Non-CEO NEOs in fiscal year 2023 which met their\nperformance-based vesting requirements in their entirety.\nOutstanding Equity Awards at Fiscal Year-End\nThe following table summarize certain information regarding unvested stock and equity incentive plan awards\noutstanding as of the end of the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023 for each of the named executive officers:\n2023 OUTSTANDING EQUITY AWARDS AT FISCAL YEAR-END TABLE\nStock Awards\nEquity Incentive Plan\nEquity Incentive Plan Awards: Market Value or\nMarket Value of Awards: Number of Payout Value of Unearned\nNumber of Shares Shares of Stock Unearned Shares, Units Shares, Units or Other\nof Stock That Have That Have Not or Other Rights That Rights That Have Not\nName Not Vested (#)(1) Vested ($)(3) Have Not Vested (#)(2) Vested ($)(3)\nWalter R.

The performance-based criteria required for the vesting of these awards were based on the achievement of\nrevenue thresholds for the Company’s fiscal year ended September 30, 2023. In November 2023, the Company’s\ncompensation committee determined that the criteria required to lapse the performance-based vesting provisions for these\nawards were fully achieved. These units will vest in four equal annual installments on November 16, 2023, November\n21, 2024, November 21, 2025 and November 21, 2026.\n(3) Represents the closing price of $12.95 per share of Common Stock on September 30, 2023.\nClawback Policy\nThe Company believes it is important to foster and maintain a culture that emphasizes integrity and accountability.\nFor this reason, the Board adopted a clawback policy effective December 15, 2016 and adopted a new amended and restated\npolicy effective December 1, 2023. The new policy is designed to comply with Section 10D of the Securities Exchange Act\nof 1934 (the “Exchange Act”), Rule 10D-1 promulgated under the Exchange Act and Listing Rule 5608 of the Nasdaq Stock\nMarket. This policy applies to all current and former executive officers and other senior executives or employees who the\ncompensation committee may deem subject to the policy from time to time. The policy applies to equity grants awarded under\nthe 2014 Plan, as well as annual bonuses and any other compensation earned or vested based on the attainment of a financial\nreporting measure.\nIn the event the Company restates its financial statements due to material noncompliance with any financial reporting\nrequirement under the U.S. federal securities laws, a person covered by this clawback policy will be required to reimburse or\nforfeit certain incentive compensation received. The amount to be reimbursed or forfeited will be the amount of the incentive\ncompensation paid or awarded to the person based on the erroneous financial data exceeding the amount that would have\nbeen paid based on restated results, as determined by the Board. The Board will also determine the method for recouping\nsuch amounts, which may include: (1) requiring reimbursement of cash incentive compensation previously paid to the person,\n(2) seeking recovery of any gain realized on the vesting, sale or other disposition of any equity-based awards, (3) offsetting\nthe recouped amount from any compensation otherwise owed by the Company to the person, (4) cancelling outstanding\nvested or unvested equity awards made to the person, and/or (5) taking any other remedial and recovery action permitted by\nlaw.\nPolicies and Practices Related to the Grant of Certain Equity Awards Close in Time to the Release of Material Public\nInformation\nThe Board typically grants equity awards on a pre-determined schedule. The compensation committee does not take\nmaterial nonpublic information into account when determining the timing and terms of such awards. The Company does not\ntime the disclosure of material nonpublic information for the purposes of affecting the value of executive compensation.\nPotential Payments upon Termination or Change-in-Control\nPursuant to his employment agreement, as amended, Mr. Adams is entitled to receive the severance benefits\ndescribed below upon termination of his employment unless the termination:\n● results from his death, disability or retirement;\n● is by the Company for Cause; or\n● is by the employee other than for Good Reason.\n“Cause” is defined to mean the employee’s willful and continued failure to perform his duties after a demand for his\nperformance of those duties or the employee’s willfully engaging in gross misconduct materially and demonstrably injurious\nto the Company. “Good Reason” is defined to mean a demotion, a reduction in base salary, a relocation of the employee’s\nbase location of employment, the discontinuation of any employee benefit without comparable substitution, the failure of any\nsuccessor of the Company to assume the employment agreement or a purported termination not in compliance with the\nemployment agreement.\nThe severance benefits to Mr. Adams would be entitled on termination would be an amount equal to the product of\n(a) his then-current annual salary plus the average of the bonus payments paid to the executive in respect of the three fiscal\nyears preceding the fiscal year in which the termination occurs, multiplied by (b) two. The executive would also receive any\nrelocation and indemnity payments to which he is entitled and any costs and legal fees incurred in connection with any dispute\nover his employment agreement.\nThese payments would be due in a lump sum on the tenth day following the date of termination. The amounts paid\nare based on the salary rate in effect at the time of termination, unless the employee is terminating employment for Good\nReason due to a reduction in salary, in which case the salary rate shall be the rate in effect prior to such reduction.\nSo long as Mr. Adams is terminated without Cause, he is not required to perform any further agreement or action in\norder to receive these benefits. However, in connection with his employment agreement, he has agreed that he will not\ndisclose or misappropriate any confidential information of the Company and that all intellectual property developed by him\nis the property of the Company.\nStock Ownership Guidelines\nThe Company believes that its executive officers and non-employee directors should own and hold an investment\nvalue position in the Common Stock of the Company to further align their interests and actions with the interests of the\nCompany’s stockholders. Our executive officers and directors owned approximately 8% of the Company’s outstanding\nCommon Stock as of December 15, 2023. In November 2020, based upon recommendations and benchmarking by Fredrick\nW. Cook & Co., Inc., the Board has adopted the Stock Ownership Guidelines described below.\nPosition Stock Ownership Guidelines\nExecutive Officers 1 time base salary\nNon-Employee Directors 1 time annual cash retainer\nThe compensation committee intends for executive officers and directors who are or become subject to these\nguidelines to achieve the applicable ownership guideline within five years from the date of adoption of the guidelines or the\ndate the participant becomes subject to the guidelines. The compensation committee may allow exceptions to be made for\nany executive officer or non-employee director who, due to his or her unique financial circumstances, would incur a hardship\nby complying with these guidelines.\nProhibition on Hedging or Pledging Stock\nDirectors and executive officers of the Company are prohibited from directly or indirectly engaging in any kind of\nhedging activity that limits such person’s investment or economic risk in Company securities through the use of derivatives,\nsuch as options or future contracts, or any kind of speculative transactions in Company securities such as puts, calls, swaps,\ncollars or short sales. In addition, directors and executive officers are prohibited from pledging any Company securities as\ncollateral or holding such securities in a margin account.\nCode of Ethics\nThe Company has adopted a general code of business conduct that applies to all employees, and a supplemental\ncode of ethics that applies to the Company’s Chief Executive Officer and senior financial officers. The general code of\nbusiness conduct and supplemental code of ethics may be accessed electronically under the Investor Relations section of the\nCompany’s website at www.geospace.com.\nEquity Compensation Plan Information\nThe following table summarizes information with respect to the Company’s equity compensation plans under which\nits equity securities are authorized for issuance as of September 30, 2023:\nNumber of securities\nNumber of securities to Weighted-average remaining available for\nbe issued upon exercise exercise price of future issuance\nof outstanding options, outstanding options, (excluding securities\nwarrants and rights warrants and rights reflected in column (a))\nPlan category (a) (b) (c)\n(In shares) (In dollars per share) (In shares)\nEquity compensation plans approved\nby security holders (1) ..................... 377,549 $ N/A 1,137,509\nEquity compensation plans not\napproved by security holders ........... -- -- --\nTotal .................................................... 377,549 $ N/A 1,137,509\n(1) The number of securities shown in column (c) represents the number of securities remaining available for issuance under\nthe Company’s 2014 Plan, which was approved by the stockholders in February 2014.

The Company uses traditional compensation elements of base salary, annual\nperformancebonusesandlong-termincentivestock-basedawards.\nExecutiveofficersgenerallyreceivethesamebenefitsasotheremployees.Anydifferencesaretypicallydue\nto position, seniority, or local requirements. Consistent with this philosophy, executive officers receive minimal\nperquisites. Mr. Wheeler, Mr. Sheen and Mr. Adams have entered into employment agreements with the\nCompany, which, under certain circumstances, provide them with certain severance benefits upon their\nterminations of employment. See “Potential Payments upon Termination or Change-in-Control” below for more\ninformation on these benefits. The Company’s compensation policies are designed to enhance financial\nperformance and stockholder value by aligning the financial interests of the executive officers and employees\nwiththoseofitsstockholders.\n20\nWhattheCompany’sCompensationIsDesignedtoReward\nThe Company’s compensation program is designed to reward teamwork and each individual’s contribution\nto the Company, including the impact of such contribution on the Company’s overall financial performance, as\nwellastoproducepositivelong-termresultsforitsstockholdersandemployees.\nAdministration\nThe compensation committee is composed of three independent members of the Board. No compensation\ncommittee member participates in any of the Company’s employee compensation programs. The Company’s\nnon-employee directors are eligible to and do participate in its 2014 Long-Term Incentive Plan (the “2014\nPlan”).Thecompensationcommittee(i)setsandrecommendsannualcompensation,includingequityawardsand\ndiscretionary goal-oriented cash bonuses for the Company’s named executive officers to the full Board for\napproval, (ii) reviews and approves the overall compensation policy, philosophy and strategy for all other\nemployees, and (iii) reviews and approves awards under equity incentive plans and the non-equity incentive\nprogramtoallemployeesasrecommendedtothecompensationcommitteebymanagement.\nSince 2015, the compensation committee has retained Frederic W. Cook & Co, Inc., an independent\ncompensationconsultant(the“CompensationConsultant”),eachyeartoadvisetheCompanyonitsperformance-\nbasedequitygrantsatthebeginningofthefiscalyear,includingfiscalyear2022.TheCompensationConsultant\nperforms an evaluation of the Company’s compensation program concerning future performance-based equity\ngrantsandhowtobalancethosegrantswithbasesalaryandcashbonuscompensation.\nAt the 2022 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, the stockholders approved, by a non-binding, advisory\nresolution, the compensation of the Company’s named executive officers. The compensation committee\nconsidered this resolution of the stockholders in its review of executive compensation in fiscal year 2022 and\ndetermined that the stockholders supported the compensation packages awarded to the Company’s named\nexecutive officers and the objectives and policies by which those packages were determined. Pursuant to a\nresolution adopted by the stockholders at the 2017 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, the stockholders will have\nanopportunitytoapproveorwithholdapprovalofexecutivecompensationbyanon-bindingadvisoryresolution\nonanannualbasisateachannualmeetingofstockholders.\nElementsofCompensation\nGeneral\nThe primary elements of the executive compensation program consist of (1) base salary, (2) annual cash\nbonusespursuanttoanon-equity,incentiveannualbonusprogram,(3)goal-orienteddiscretionarycashbonuses,\nand (4) long term incentives in the form of equity-based compensation awards. Equity-based compensation\nawards have historically included nonqualified stock options, restricted stock awards, and restricted stock unit\nawards. Each executive officer’s current and prior compensation is considered in setting future compensation\nand, while consideration is given to the vesting and value of previously granted equity-based compensation\nawards, the total compensation package is not regularly adjusted for such values. In addition, the Company\nfocuses on the relative roles of the executive officers throughout the organization when determining\ncompensation.\nThe Company chooses to pay each element of compensation to reward executives through various means.\nThe base salary and employee benefits compensate executives for their daily efforts as management of the\nCompany. The annual non-equity incentive annual bonus program, described in more detail below, encourages\nexecutives to not only meet goals for the Company, measured in terms of consolidated pretax profits (before\nbonus), but also encourages other employees to meet goals as well. The equity-based compensation awards\nprovide a long-term incentive to executives and other key employees to improve the performance of the\nCompanyasviewedbythemarketasreflectedinthemarketpriceforCommonStock.\n21\nAnexecutiveofficer’sannualbasesalaryandannualcashbonusesdonotfluctuateasaresultofincreasesor\ndecreases in the market value of equity-based compensation awards. For example, if the stock price has grown\nsignificantly,resultinginlargepotentialgainsonvestedstockawards,anexecutiveofficer’sbasesalaryorbonus\npotential is not adjusted for that reason. However, the compensation committee may consider those gains in\nawarding additional equity-based compensation. Similarly, the compensation committee would not consider a\nlarge cash bonus award under the Company’s annual performance bonus program or a large goal-oriented\ndiscretionary cash bonus to be a reason to reduce the equity-based compensation awards or annual base salary\nreceived by the executive in the following fiscal year. The Company views each compensation element as a\ndifferent meansofencouragingandpromotingperformance.Thesecompensationelementsaredesignedtowork\nintandem.\nThe compensation committee considers the base salary levels supplemented by bonus awards and equity\ncompensation in evaluating the total executive compensation package. The executive officers are encouraged to\nearntheirbonusesandequitycompensationinordertorealizethefullvalueoftheircompensationpackage.The\nCompany intends that the attainment of the performance goals established by the compensation committee will\nbenefititsstockholders.\nThe compensation committee does not believe that there is another public company that is a direct peer to\ntheCompanyintheseismicindustry.TheCompanyisprimarilyamanufacturerofseismicproductsanddoesnot\nprovide traditional seismic services or maintain a seismic data library like other seismic companies. One of the\nCompany’s most direct competitors is a subsidiary of a much larger company, and there is no access to\ncompensation information of that subsidiary. The compensation committee from time to time does review\npublicly available information on seismic and other energy industry participants to help understand the\nmarketplace in which the Company competes. The Compensation Consultant assists the committee in gathering\nexecutive compensation information from a broad group of energy industry companies. The compensation\ncommittee strives to maintain a reasonable compensation package for each executive officer and uses this\ninformation to retain such officer and provide incentives for such officer to continue to improve the Company’s\nperformanceinthefuture.\nThe conclusion of the compensation committee after its most recent examination of the publicly available\nexecutive compensation ofenergyindustrycompanieswasthattheCompany’stotalcompensation ofeachofits\nexecutive officers, particularly their base salaries and cash bonuses, were typically lower than the compensation\nof executive officers in other energy industry companies, adjusting for various factors such as size, location and\nseniority of the executive officer. The Company places a high priority on the retention of its key employees,\nparticularly its executive officers. The Board of the Company believes that these executive officers have made\nsignificant contributions to the growth and development of the Company and have developed a synergy among\nthemselvesthatfostersprogressandsupport.TheBoardbelievesthatalossofanyoneoftheseexecutiveofficers\ncould have a significant adverse impact on the Company. Based upon these considerations, the compensation\ncommitteedesignedcompensationpackagesfortheCompany’sexecutiveofficers.\nRelativeSizeofMajorCompensationElements\nThe combination of base salary, non-equity incentive annual bonus program, goal-oriented discretionary\ncashbonuses,andequityincentiveawardscomprisetotaldirectcompensation.Insettingnamedexecutiveofficer\ncompensation, the compensation committee considers the aggregate compensation payable to the executive\nofficerandtheformofthecompensation.Thecompensationcommitteeseekstoachievetheappropriatebalance\nbetween immediate cash rewards and incentives for the achievement ofbothannualandlong-term financial and\nnon-financialobjectives.\nGenerally,thecompensationcommitteetargetsoverallcompensationpackagesfortheCompany’sexecutive\nofficersthatarecompetitivewiththetotalvaluereceivedbyexecutiveofficersatotherenergycompanies.Dueto\nthenatureoftheCompany’sbusinessandthecompensationcommittee’suseofperformancebasedstockoptions,\nperformance based restricted stock unit awards, and a performance based annual cash bonus plan, it is possible\n22\nfor its executive officers to receive above target compensation when the Company’s stock price increases and\ntotal shareholder return and financial performance hurdles are met. Conversely, in years when the Company’s\nstock price remains unchanged or total shareholder return and financial performance hurdles are not met, its\nexecutive officers will receive minimal financial compensation, if any, in addition to their base salaries. The\ncompensation committee attempts to maintain annual base salary ranges that are intended to be reasonably\ncompetitive withsalaries atotherenergyindustrycompanies,therefore improvingthelikelihoodofretainingthe\nexecutive officers that we believe are crucial to the long-term success of the Company. A substantial portion of\ntargetcompensation isintheformof“at-risk”performance-based compensationthatislinkedtotheCompany’s\nfinancial performance. The compensation committee believes that this blend strikes an appropriate balance\nbetween effectively retaining key employees and aligning the interests of our executives with those of our\nstockholders.\nBaseAnnualSalaries\nThebaseannualsalariesoftheCompany’snamedexecutiveofficerswereasfollows:\nFiscalYearEnded\nSeptember30,\n2022\nMr.Wheeler,PresidentandChiefExecutiveOfficer .................................. $350,000\nMr.Sheen,SeniorVicePresidentandChiefTechnicalOfficer .......................... $315,000\nMr.Adams,ExecutiveVicePresidentandChiefProjectEngineer ....................... $310,000\nAnnualPerformanceBonuses\nFor fiscal year 2022, the Board adopted comprehensive company-wide bonus compensation criteria (the\n“2022BonusCriteria”)forallemployees.The2022BonusCriteria,whichfollowsthesameprinciples,goalsand\ncriteriaasinthebonusprogramandcriteriapreviouslyestablishedforpriorfiscalyears,setforthvarioustargets\nand criteria for the Company’s operating performance and established a cash bonus, assessed on an individual\nbasis, for employees of the Company.

Under Tier I,\nemployees share proportionally in the Company’s profits based on each employee’s relative payroll. The Tier I\nbonus pool is established by accruing approximately 26% of consolidated pretax profits (before bonus) above a\nspecified range. Various management teams, including the executive officers, and selected key employees are\neligibletoparticipateinTierIIofthe2022BonusCriteria,whichappliesafterTierIisfullyfunded.TheTierII\nbonus pool is established by accruing approximately 26% of consolidated pretax profits (before bonus) within a\nspecified range above Tier I. Under Tier II, certain participants share in the bonus pool depending on the\nsatisfaction of predefined goals by their respective working groups. None of the named executive officers were\nrequired to satisfy individual predefined goals under the 2022 Bonus Criteria. Tier I bonuses are paid if the\nCompany reaches a predetermined pretax profit (before bonus) level. Tier II is based on attaining a\npredetermined consolidated pretax profits (before bonus) level as well as, in most cases (but not in the case of\nnamed executive officers), specific performance criteria of the group eligible for the bonus. The predetermined\npretax profits (before bonus) levels as well as the specific performance criteria are re-evaluated annually.

For fiscal year 2022, after discussions with management, and in light of cost cutting measures\ninitiatedbytheCompany,nobonuspaymentswererecommendedbythecompensationcommittee.\nLong-TermStock-BasedCompensation\nThe Company believes that long-term incentive compensation is an important component of its\ncompensation program and that the value of this compensation should be directly related to increases in\nstockholdervalue.Inadditiontobasesalaries,annualperformancebonuses,andgoal-orienteddiscretionarycash\nbonuses, the executive officers have historically participated in the 2014 Plan, which allows the Company to\ngrant long-term incentive compensation to its executive officers and directors in the form of stock options,\nrestricted stock awards, restricted stock unit (“RSU”) awards, and other awards. RSU awards represent a\ncontingentrighttoreceiveoneshareofCommonStockuponvesting.\nHistorically, equity incentive compensation awards were determined based on an individual’s annual\ncompensation and his or her contribution to the Company. The compensation committee independently sets and\nrecommends stockoptiongrants,restricted stockawards,andRSUawardsfortheCompany’sexecutiveofficers\nto the full Board for approval. Such awards may include service-based vesting and performance goal based\nvesting provisions.
