After adjusting for the deconsolidation of CEIBS Publishing Group Limited (the “CEIBS PG”) (571 customers), the net change of 40 customers reflects the Company’s strategic shift toward large enterprise accounts with consistent demand for corporate learning solutions. This realignment resulted in a planned reduction of small and medium-sized customers from our portfolio.\n  * **Net revenue retention rates of subscription customers** decreased to 101.0% from 104.8% in the same period of last year. The change was due to the Company’s strategic shift toward large enterprise accounts with consistent demand for corporate learning solutions. This realignment resulted in a planned reduction of small and medium-sized customers from our portfolio.\n\n\n\nMr. Xiaoyan Lu, Director, Founder and Chairman of the Board of YXT.com, commented, “We are pleased to report our first financial results as a public company, covering the nine months ended September 30, 2024, following our successful IPO on the Nasdaq in August. While the period presented macro challenges that impacted enterprise training spending, we remained focused on executing our strategic priorities. We continued to deepen our relationships with large enterprise clients, as evidenced by our growing penetration among Fortune 500 companies. Our products’ new AI features have been well-received by key customers, enabling us to maintain healthy retention rates despite the challenging environment. Looking ahead, we remain cautiously optimistic about our long-term growth prospects, supported by the fundamental need for digital learning solutions, our strengthening position in the large enterprise segment, and our continuous product innovation and enhancement.”\n\nMr. Pun Leung Liu, Chief Financial Officer of YXT.com, added, “Our financial results for the first nine months of 2024 demonstrate the effectiveness of our operational optimization initiatives. Through strategic cost management and AI-enabled operational improvements across multiple functions, we significantly narrowed our net loss to RMB14.9 million from RMB245.3 million in the same period last year. We remain committed to disciplined cost control while continuing to invest in strategic areas that drive long-term growth, particularly our technology capabilities and enterprise-focused solutions.”\n\n**Financial Results for the First Nine Months of 2024**\n\n**Revenues**\n\nRevenues were RMB241.7 million (US$34.4 million), compared with RMB328.8 million in the same period of last year.\n\n  * _Revenues from corporate learning solutions_ were RMB240.3 million (US$34.2 million), compared with RMB318.6 million in the same period of last year. \n    * _Revenues from subscription based corporate learning solutions_ were RMB221.7 million (US$31.6 million), compared with RMB271.1 million in the same period of last year. The change was primarily due to (i) the deconsolidation of CEIBS PG effective on January 15, 2024, resulting in a decrease of RMB46.1 million; and (ii) a net impact of RMB3.3 million from operational adjustments, driven by our strategic suspension of certain ancillary online teaching tools, partially offset by growth in corporate learning platform services.\n    * _Revenues from non-subscription based corporate learning solutions_ were RMB18.6 million (US$2.7 million), compared with RMB47.5 million in the same period of last year. The change was primarily due to (i) the deconsolidation of CEIBS PG effective on January 15, 2024, resulting in a decrease of RMB20.9 million; and (ii) reduced offline activities reflecting our strategic shift towards subscription-based corporate learning solutions.\n  * _Revenues from others_ were RMB1.4 million (US$0.2 million), compared with RMB10.2 million in the same period of last year. The change primarily reflects fewer customized software projects completed in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, aligning with our strategic focus on corporate learning solutions.\n\n\n\n**Cost of revenues**\n\nCost of revenues was RMB95.8 million (US$13.6 million), compared with RMB133.8 million in the same period of 2023, representing a decrease of 28.4%, mainly due to (i) the deconsolidation of CEIBS PG effective on January 15, 2024, resulting in a decrease of RMB22.7 million; (ii) lower instructor compensation costs due to reduced offline activities, aligning with our strategic shift towards subscription-based corporate learning solutions; and (iii) decreased staff expenses and third-party infrastructure costs through operational optimization.\n\n**Sales and marketing expenses**\n\nSales and marketing expenses were RMB105.8 million (US$15.1 million), compared with RMB173.2 million in the same period of last year, representing a decrease of 38.9%, mainly due to (i) the deconsolidation of CEIBS PG effective on January 15, 2024, resulting in a decrease of RMB36.5 million; and (ii) reduced compensation and incentives through human resources optimization.\n\n**Research and development expenses**\n\nResearch and development expenses were RMB90.6 million (US$12.9 million), compared with RMB136.8 million in the same period of 2023, representing a decrease of 33.8%, mainly due to (i) the deconsolidation of CEIBS PG effective on January 15, 2024, resulting in a decrease of RMB18.8 million; and (ii) reduced compensation through human resources optimization.\n\n**General and administrative expenses**\n\nGeneral and administrative expenses were RMB75.0 million (US$10.7 million), compared with RMB117.1 million in the same period of 2023, representing a decrease of 35.9%, mainly due to (i) the deconsolidation of CEIBS PG effective on January 15, 2024, resulting in a decrease of RMB13.5 million; (ii) a RMB18.5 million decrease in share-based compensation following completion of certain share-based incentives amortization; and (iii) reduced professional fees.\n\n**Net loss and adjusted net loss**\n\nNet loss was RMB14.9 million (US$2.1 million), compared with a net loss of RMB245.3 million in the same period of last year. Adjusted net loss was RMB123.1 million (US$17.5 million), compared with an adjusted net loss of RMB196.1 million in the same period of last year.\n\n**Earnings/(loss) per share**\n\nBasic and diluted net income per share was RMB5.02 (US$0.72), compared with basic and diluted net loss per share of RMB7.06 in the same period of last year. The improvement in earnings per share was primarily attributable to the deemed contribution to common shareholders due to modification and extinguishment of the Company’s convertible redeemable preferred shares on July 1, 2024.\n\n**Balance Sheet**\n\nAs of September 30, 2024, the Company had cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, short-term investments and long-term bank deposits of RMB488.7 million (US$69.6 million), compared with RMB496.2 million as of December 31, 2023.\n\n**Conference Call Information**\n\nThe Company's management team will hold a conference call at 8:00 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time on Tuesday, November 26, 2024 (or 9:00 A.M. Beijing Time on Wednesday, November 27, 2024) to discuss the financial results. Details for the conference call are as follows:\n\nEvent Title:| YXT.com First Nine Months of 2024 Earnings Conference Call  \n---|---  \nRegistration Link:| <https://register.vevent.com/register/BI79cfe397cd984d14b7a1fab15a19b825>  \n  \nAll participants must use the link provided above to complete the online registration process in advance of the conference call. Upon registering, each participant will receive a set of participant dial-in numbers and a unique access PIN, which can be used to join the conference call.\n\nA live and archived webcast of the conference call will be available at the Company's investor relations website at https://ir.yxt.com/.\n\n**Non-GAAP Financial Measures** In evaluating our business, we consider and use adjusted net loss as a supplemental non-GAAP measure to review and assess our operating performance. Adjusted net loss is net loss excluding amortization of incremental intangible assets resulting from business combination, gain on deconsolidation of CEIBS PG, share-based compensation, change in fair value of derivative liabilities, net of income taxes, to the extent applicable. The presentation of the non-GAAP financial measure is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. We present the non-GAAP financial measure because it is used by our management to evaluate our operating performance and formulate business plans. We also believe that the use of the non-GAAP measure facilitates investors’ assessment of our operating performance.\n\nThe non-GAAP financial measure is not defined under U.S. GAAP and is not presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The non-GAAP financial measure has limitations as analytical tools. One of the key limitations of using the non-GAAP financial measure is that it does not reflect all items of income and expense that affect our operations. Further, the non-GAAP measure may differ from the non-GAAP information used by other companies, including peer companies, and therefore its comparability may be limited. We compensate for these limitations by reconciling the non-GAAP financial measure to the nearest U.S. GAAP performance measure, which should be considered when evaluating our performance. We encourage you to review our financial information in its entirety and not rely on a single financial measure.\n\n**Exchange Rate Information** This announcement contains translations of certain Renminbi (“RMB”) amounts into U.S. dollars (“US$”) at specified rates solely for the convenience of the reader. Unless otherwise stated, all translations from Renminbi to U.S. dollars were made at the rate of RMB7.0176 to US$1.00, the exchange rate on September 30, 2024, set forth in the H.10 statistical release of the Federal Reserve Board. The Company makes no representation that the Renminbi or U.S. dollars amounts referred to could be converted into U.S. dollars or Renminbi, as the case may be, at any particular rate or at all.\n\n**Safe Harbor Statements** This press release contains forward-looking statements.
