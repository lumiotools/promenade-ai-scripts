(\"Canadian Solar\") (NASDAQ: CSIQ) and a global developer, owner, and operator of solar and energy storage assets, announced today that it has signed two new tolling agreements with Arizona Public Service Company (APS).\n\nThe 20-year tolling agreements encompass the Desert Bloom Storage and Papago Solar projects. Both projects, located in Maricopa County, Arizona, are scheduled to start construction in 2025 and reach operation in 2026. Desert Bloom Storage is a 600 MWh standalone storage facility, while Papago Solar is a 150 MWac solar facility.\n\nLast year, Recurrent Energy announced that it had secured a 20-year tolling agreement with APS for its 1,200 MWh Papago Storage project. The Papago Storage project is currently in construction and scheduled to commence operations in 2025. Once operational, Papago Storage will be the largest standalone energy storage project in Arizona.\n\nTogether, the three announced tolling agreements with APS total 1,800 MWh of energy storage and 150 MWac of solar. This is enough energy storage to dispatch power for the equivalent of 72,000 homes for four hours and enough solar to power the equivalent of approximately 24,000 homes per year.\n\n**Brian Cole , APS Vice President of Resource Management,** said, \"With more people and businesses moving to Arizona, we expect our customers' energy needs to continue to increase significantly over the next several years. We are thoughtfully planning to meet that growing demand with reliable and clean electricity at the lowest cost possible through the addition of projects like Desert Bloom Storage, Papago Solar, and Papago Storage.\"\n\nRecurrent Energy is one of the world's largest clean energy platforms. To date, Recurrent Energy has brought online 3.7 GWh of battery energy storage and 11 GWp of solar power projects.\n\n**Ismael Guerrero , CEO of Recurrent Energy,** said, \"Our partnership with APS on 1.8 GWh of storage and 150 MW of solar capacity represents a remarkable build out of energy infrastructure in the Phoenix area. APS has long been a leader in clean energy innovation, and we are thankful for APS's trust as we provide the projects needed to help satisfy Arizona's growing electricity demand. We look forward to continuing to build an enduring partnership with APS.\"\n\nArizona currently has 1,000 MW of operating energy storage, and renewable energy makes up 12 percent of the state's electricity mix. To keep up with growing demand, by 2030, Arizona anticipates adding 7,600 MW of utility-scale solar power, 1,700 MW of wind power, and 5,900 MW of battery storage—enough clean electricity to power the equivalent of over 5 million homes. This projected clean energy capacity represents $14 billion in expected capital investment[1]. \n\n**Arizona Senator Mark Kelly,** said, \"As Arizona continues to grow and attract more technology and manufacturing investments, innovative solar and energy storage projects like this are a critical piece of providing clean, affordable, reliable power to our state's businesses and families. These new agreements will advance Arizona's transition towards a renewable energy future and leadership in clean energy innovation.\" \n\n**U.S. Representative Ruben Gallego,** said, \"Thanks to the Inflation Reduction Act, which I fought to pass, Arizona is benefiting from major investments to help us meet our energy demands. The projects announced today will create hundreds of good-paying jobs, and I look forward to seeing hundreds of thousands of Arizona homes powered by clean, affordable energy in the coming years.\"\n\n**Commissioner Lea Márquez Peterson, Arizona Corporation Commission,** said, \"Arizona has the natural resources here to support the increasing demand for electricity as the state's population and business opportunities continue to thrive. With standalone energy storage projects like Recurrent's Desert Bloom Storage and Papago Storage projects, we are proving ourselves as a forward-thinking state that has set the stage for economic and sustainable prosperity.\"\n\n**Jason Grumet , CEO of the American Clean Power Association,** said, \"Recurrent and APS are shining examples of Arizona's growing leadership in clean energy deployment. These projects enhance our country's energy security and help to meet rising energy demand with affordable, clean and reliable American-made power.\" \n\n[1] <https://www.fuelforthought.energy/press/clean-energy-powers-arizona>  \n---  \n  \n**About Recurrent Energy** Recurrent Energy is one of the world's largest and most geographically diversified utility-scale solar and energy storage project development, ownership and operations platforms, with an industry-leading team of in-house energy experts.

The suit alleges that the subsidiaries are directly or indirectly infringing on two U.S. patents held by Trina relating to tunnel oxide passivated contact solar photovoltaic module technology (commonly referred to in the solar industry as \"TOPCon\" technology).\n\nAs one of the largest solar product manufacturers in the world, Canadian Solar manufactures and sells many different types of solar products, including TOPCon solar modules, to customers both in the United States and elsewhere in the world. Canadian Solar has itself filed and received thousands of patents in various jurisdictions for solar cells and related technologies.\n\n\"Canadian Solar respects and takes very seriously its own intellectual property rights and those of third parties. In our view, this is a frivolous lawsuit, and we expect the court will find that our proprietary TOPCon technology does not infringe on the patents claimed by Trina,\" remarked **Adam Walters , General Counsel, Americas for Canadian Solar's Modules and Systems Solutions business**.\n\nCanadian Solar will continue to deliver high quality solar products in the United States and globally, as it has for more than 20 years since its founding in Guelph, Canada.\n\n**About Canadian Solar Inc.**\n\nCanadian Solar was founded in 2001 in Canada and is one of the world's largest solar technology and renewable energy companies.
