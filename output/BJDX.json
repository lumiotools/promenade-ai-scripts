(NASDAQ: BJDX) (“Bluejay” or the “Company”), a medical technology company developing rapid diagnostics on its Symphony platform to improve patient outcomes in critical care settings, today announced that the Company’s Board of Directors has approved a reverse stock split of its shares of common stock at a ratio of 1-for-50 (the “Reverse Stock Split”). The Reverse Stock Split will become effective at 12:01 a.m. Eastern Time on November 18, 2024, and the Company’s common stock will open for trading on The Nasdaq Capital Market on a post-split basis on November 18, 2024 under the Company’s existing trading symbol, “BJDX.” At such time, the Company’s common stock will also commence trading with a new CUSIP number, 095633509.\n\nAt the effective time of the reverse stock split, every fifty (50) shares of Bluejay common stock issued and outstanding will be combined into one (1) share of common stock issued and outstanding, with no change to the par value of $0.0001 per share. This will reduce the Company’s outstanding common stock from approximately 27,624,740 shares to approximately 552,854 shares. No fractional shares of common stock will be issued as a result of the reverse stock split and instead holders of Bluejay common stock will receive a cash payment in lieu of fractional shares to which they would otherwise be entitled. The shares underlying the Company’s outstanding equity awards and warrants will also be adjusted accordingly. The reverse stock split affects all stockholders uniformly and will not alter any stockholder’s percentage interest in the Company’s common stock, except for adjustments that may result from the treatment of fractional shares.\n\nThe Company has retained its transfer agent, Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company (“Continental”), to act as its exchange agent for the reverse stock split. Stockholders with shares held in certificate form will receive from Continental instructions regarding the exchange of their certificates. Stockholders that hold shares in book-entry form or hold their shares in brokerage accounts are not required to take any action and will see the impact of the reverse stock split reflected in their accounts, subject to brokers’ particular processes. Beneficial holders of Bluejay common stock are encouraged to contact their bank, broker, custodian or other nominee with questions regarding procedures for processing the reverse stock split.\n\n**_About Bluejay Diagnostics:_**\n\nBluejay Diagnostics, Inc. is a medical diagnostics company focused on improving patient outcomes using its Symphony System, a cost-effective, rapid, near-patient testing system for triage and monitoring of disease progression. Bluejay’s first product candidate, an IL-6 Test for sepsis triage, is designed to provide accurate, reliable results in approximately 20 minutes from ‘sample-to-result’ to help medical professionals make earlier and better triage/treatment decisions.
