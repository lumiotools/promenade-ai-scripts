(Nasdaq: GH) (“Guardant Health”), a leading precision oncology company, today announced that a jury in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California (the “Court”) unanimously found in favor of Guardant Health on all of its claims from its May 2021 lawsuit against Natera, Inc. (Nasdaq: NTRA) (“Natera”) for false advertising and unfair competition. The jury awarded $292.5 million to Guardant Health, including $175.5 million in punitive damages, representing one of the largest false advertising verdicts in history. The jury unanimously rejected all of Natera’s counterclaims.\n\nThe jury found that Natera engaged in a deliberate campaign to mislead cancer clinicians about Guardant Reveal™ – Guardant Health’s tissue-free minimal residual disease (MRD) test for early-stage colorectal cancer (CRC) – in favor of Signatera™, Natera’s competing product. \n\n“Today’s unanimous verdict holding Natera responsible for engaging in illegal and anticompetitive conduct represents a major victory for CRC patients who could benefit from our groundbreaking Reveal test, and we thank the jury and the Court for their careful consideration of our claims,” said John Saia, Chief Legal Officer at Guardant Health. “Every company in the cancer diagnostics space has a duty to prioritize patients above all else. In keeping with our mission to help cancer patients lead longer and healthier lives, we strongly believe it is vital that clinicians receive accurate, complete, and truthful information to inform their decisions about potentially life-saving patient treatments.”\n\n**About Guardant Health**\n\nGuardant Health is a leading precision oncology company focused on guarding wellness and giving every person more time free from cancer.

(Nasdaq: GH), a leading precision oncology company, today reported financial results for the quarter ended September 30, 2024. \n\n**Third Quarter 2024 Financial Highlights**\n\n  * Recorded revenue of $191.5 million for the third quarter of 2024, an increase of 34% over the third quarter of 2023 \n  * Reported 53,100 clinical tests (excluding Shield) and 10,500 biopharma tests in the third quarter of 2024, representing increases of 21% and 40%, respectively, over the third quarter of 2023 \n  * Achieved Guardant360 ASP of over $3,000 \n  * Raised 2024 annual guidance for revenue to a new range of $720 to $725 million, representing growth of 28% to 29% \n  * Improved free cash flow to $(55) million in the third quarter of 2024, compared to $(80) million in the prior year \n  * Revised annual free cash flow guidance to $(265) to $(275) million, an improvement of $70 to $80 million compared to 2023 \n\n\n\n**Recent Operating Highlights**\n\n  * Successfully launched Shield IVD with strong reception from physicians and patients \n  * Received Medicare pricing of $920 for Shield effective August 1, 2024 \n  * CMS finalized its policy to remove cost-sharing for a follow-on colonoscopy after a blood-based screening test for Medicare beneficiaries \n  * Announced Medicare pricing for TissueNext will increase from $3,100 to $3,500 effective January 1, 2025 \n  * Entered into laboratory partnership with Policlinico Gemelli in Italy, a leading European oncology center, to test advanced cancer patients locally \n  * Published data from SCRUM-Japan GOZILA study in _Nature Medicine_ showing patients receiving Guardant360 CDx guided treatment survived twice as long \n\n\n\n“We had another record quarter of revenue driven by significant Guardant360 reimbursement tailwinds and volume growth,” said Helmy Eltoukhy, co-founder and co-CEO. “With this momentum, we are raising revenue guidance for the third time this year and improving our free cash flow outlook for the full year. The upgrade of Guardant360 LDT to Smart Liquid Biopsy has already contributed to an increase in both breadth and depth of accounts, and we expect this to be a strong growth driver for our therapy selection business going forward.” \n\n“Shield has received a very positive reception from physicians and patients in the first few months of commercial launch following FDA approval,” said AmirAli Talasaz, co-founder and co-CEO. “We were very pleased to see Shield receive a Medicare price of $920, which recognizes it as an important new class of CRC screening. We look forward to continuing to execute our commercial scale-up as we make Shield one of the most impactful products in the history of diagnostics.” \n\n**Third Quarter 2024 Financial Results**\n\nRevenue was $191.5 million for the third quarter of 2024, a 34% increase from $143.0 million for the corresponding prior year period. Precision oncology revenue grew 35%, to $180.6 million for the third quarter of 2024, from $133.4 million for the corresponding prior year period, driven by an increase in the volume of clinical tests (i.e., Guardant360, TissueNext, Response, and Reveal tests) and biopharma tests, which grew 21% and 40%, respectively, over the prior year period. The increase in precision oncology revenue was also attributable to an increase in reimbursement for our tests, due to an increase in Medicare reimbursement for our Guardant360 LDT test to $5,000, effective January 1, 2024; and an increase in both Medicare Advantage and commercial payer reimbursement. Development services and other revenue was $10.9 million for the third quarter of 2024, compared to $9.6 million for the corresponding prior year period. \n\nGross profit, or total revenue less cost of precision oncology testing and cost of development services and other, was $117.0 million for the third quarter of 2024, an increase of $31.6 million from $85.4 million for the corresponding prior year period. Gross margin, or gross profit divided by total revenue, was 61%, as compared to 60% for the corresponding prior year period. Precision oncology gross margin was 63% in the third quarter of 2024, as compared to 60% in the prior year period. Development services and other gross margin was 23% in the third quarter of 2024, as compared to 59% in the prior year period. \n\nNon-GAAP gross profit was $121.1 million for the third quarter of 2024, an increase of $33.7 million, from $87.3 million for the corresponding prior year period. Non-GAAP gross margin was 63% for the third quarter of 2024, as compared to 61% for the corresponding prior year period. \n\nNon-GAAP gross profit excluding cost of screening was $124.0 million for the third quarter of 2024, an increase of $34.3 million, from $89.7 million for the corresponding prior year period. Non-GAAP gross margin excluding cost of screening was 65% for the third quarter of 2024, as compared to 63% for the corresponding prior year period. \n\nOperating expenses were $234.3 million for the third quarter of 2024, as compared to $199.0 million for the corresponding prior year period. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $187.3 million for the third quarter of 2024, as compared to $177.3 million for the corresponding prior year period. \n\nNet loss was $107.8 million for the third quarter of 2024, as compared to $86.1 million for the corresponding prior year period. Net loss per share was $0.88 for the third quarter of 2024, as compared to $0.73 for the corresponding prior year period. The year-over-year increase in net loss was primarily due to a $18.3 million increase in net unrealized and realized losses recorded for our investment in Lunit, Inc. \n\nNon-GAAP net loss was $55.0 million for the third quarter of 2024, as compared to $79.2 million for the corresponding prior year period. Non-GAAP net loss per share was $0.45 for the third quarter of 2024, as compared to $0.67 for the corresponding prior year period. \n\nAdjusted EBITDA loss was $56.2 million for the third quarter of 2024, as compared to a $79.7 million loss for the corresponding prior year period. \n\nFree cash flow for the third quarter of 2024 was $(55.3) million, as compared to $(80.2) million for the corresponding prior year period. Cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and marketable debt securities were $1.0 billion as of September 30, 2024. \n\n**2024 Guidance**\n\nGuardant Health now expects full year 2024 revenue to be in the range of $720 to $725 million, representing growth of 28% to 29% compared to full year 2023. This compares to the prior range of $690 to $700 million, representing growth of 22% to 24%. Guardant Health continues to expect full year 2024 non-GAAP gross margin excluding screening to be in the range of 61% to 63% and total non-GAAP operating expenses to be in the range of $720 to $730 million, representing a flat to 1% decrease compared to 2023. Guardant Health now expects free cash flow to be in the range of $(265) to $(275) million in 2024, representing an improvement of $70 million to $80 million compared to 2023. \n\n**Webcast Information**\n\nGuardant Health will host a conference call to discuss the third quarter 2024 financial results after market close on Wednesday, November 6, 2024 at 1:30 pm Pacific Time / 4:30 pm Eastern Time. A webcast of the conference call can be accessed at [http://investors.guardanthealth.com](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=http%3A%2F%2Finvestors.guardanthealth.com&esheet=54147510&newsitemid=20241106173129&lan=en-US&anchor=http%3A%2F%2Finvestors.guardanthealth.com&index=1&md5=54141599028ca4f2867c2e978cbf7a55). The webcast will be archived and available for replay for at least 90 days after the event. \n\n**Non-GAAP Measures**\n\nGuardant Health has presented in this release certain financial information in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) and also on a non-GAAP basis, including non-GAAP cost of precision oncology testing, non-GAAP cost of development services and other, non-GAAP cost of screening, non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP gross profit excluding cost of screening, non-GAAP research and development expense, non-GAAP sales and marketing expense, non-GAAP general and administrative expense, non-GAAP loss from operations, non-GAAP net loss, non-GAAP net loss per share, basic and diluted, adjusted EBITDA, and free cash flow. \n\nWe define our non-GAAP measures as the applicable GAAP measure adjusted for the impacts of stock-based compensation and related employer payroll tax payments, contingent consideration, amortization of intangible assets, unrealized and realized gains and losses on marketable equity securities, impairment of non-marketable equity securities and other related assets, and other non-recurring items. \n\nAdjusted EBITDA is defined as net loss adjusted for interest income; interest expense; other income (expense), net; provision for income taxes; depreciation and amortization expense; stock-based compensation expense and related employer payroll tax payments; contingent consideration; and other non-recurring items. Free cash flow is defined as net cash used in operating activities in the period less purchase of property and equipment in the period. \n\nWe believe that the exclusion of certain income and expenses in calculating these non-GAAP financial measures can provide a useful measure for investors when comparing our period-to-period core operating results, and when comparing those same results to that published by our peers. We exclude certain items because we believe that these income and expenses do not reflect expected future operating performance. Additionally, certain items are inconsistent in amounts and frequency, making it difficult to perform a meaningful evaluation of our current or past operating performance. We use these non-GAAP financial measures to evaluate ongoing operations, for internal planning and forecasting purposes, and to manage our business. \n\nThese non-GAAP financial measures are not intended to be considered in isolation from, as substitute for, or as superior to, the corresponding financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. There are limitations inherent in non-GAAP financial measures because they exclude charges and credits that are required to be included in a GAAP presentation, and do not present the full measure of our recorded costs against its revenue. In addition, our definition of the non-GAAP financial measures may differ from non-GAAP measures used by other companies. \n\n**About Guardant Health**\n\nGuardant Health is a leading precision oncology company focused on guarding wellness and giving every person more time free from cancer.

Description of Business\nGuardant Health, Inc., or the Company, is a leading precision oncology company focused on guarding wellness and giving every person more time free from cancer.\nThe Company is transforming patient care by providing critical insights into what drives disease through its advanced blood and tissue tests, and real-world data. The\nCompany's tests help improve outcomes across all stages of care, including screening to find cancer early, monitoring for recurrence in early-stage cancer, and helping\ndoctors select the best treatment for patients with advanced cancer. For patients with advanced stage cancer, the Company has commercially launched Guardant360\nLDT and Guardant360 CDx, the first comprehensive liquid biopsy test approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or the FDA, to provide tumor mutation\nprofiling with solid tumors and to be used as a companion diagnostic in connection with non-small cell lung cancer, or NSCLC, and breast cancer. The Company has\nalso launched the Guardant360 TissueNext tissue test for advanced-stage cancer, Guardant Reveal blood test to detect residual and recurring disease in early-stage\ncolorectal, breast and lung cancer patients, and Guardant360 Response blood test to predict patient response to immunotherapy or targeted therapy eight weeks earlier\nthan current standard-of-care imaging.\nThe Company also collaborates with biopharmaceutical companies in clinical studies by providing the above-mentioned tests, as well as the GuardantOMNI blood test\nfor advanced-stage cancer, and the GuardantINFINITY blood test, a next-generation smart liquid biopsy that provides new, multi-dimensional insights into the\ncomplexities of tumor molecular profiles and immune response to advance cancer research and therapy development. Using data collected from its tests, the Company\nhas also developed its GuardantINFORM platform to help biopharmaceutical companies accelerate precision oncology drug development through the use of this in-\nsilico research platform to unlock further insights into tumor evolution and treatment resistance across various biomarker-driven cancers.\nFor early cancer detection, in May 2022, the Company launched the Shield LDT test to address the needs of individuals eligible for colorectal cancer screening. From\na simple blood draw, Shield uses a novel multimodal approach to detect colorectal cancer signals in the bloodstream, including DNA that is shed by tumors. In\nDecember 2022, the Company announced that the ECLIPSE study, a registrational study evaluating the performance of its Shield blood test for detecting colorectal\ncancer in average-risk adults, met co-primary endpoints. In addition, in March 2023, the Company submitted a premarket approval application, or PMA, for its Shield\nblood test to the FDA. In July 2024, the Company received FDA approval of its Shield blood test for colorectal cancer screening in adults age 45 and older who are at\naverage risk for the disease, and in August 2024, the Company's Shield blood test became commercially available in the U.S. as the first blood test approved by the\nFDA for primary colorectal cancer screening, meaning healthcare providers can offer Shield in a manner similar to all other non-invasive methods recommended in\nscreening guidelines. Shield is also the first blood test for colorectal cancer screening that meets coverage requirements by Medicare.\nThe Company was incorporated in Delaware in December 2011 and is headquartered in Palo Alto, California.\n2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\nBasis of Presentation and Consolidation\nThe Company’s condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of\nAmerica, or GAAP, and in conjunction with the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission, or the SEC. The accompanying condensed\nconsolidated financial statements include the accounts of Guardant Health, Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiaries. All intercompany balances and transactions have\nbeen eliminated in consolidation. The Company adjusted the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2023 to separately present\naccounts payable and accrued expenses, inclusive of accrued compensation. In addition, certain other reclassifications of prior period amounts were made to conform\nwith the current period presentation. The Company determined the adjustment is immaterial based on consideration of quantitative and qualitative factors.\n9\nTable of Contents\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make certain estimates, judgments and assumptions\nthat affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the related disclosures at the date of the condensed consolidated financial statements, as well as the\nreported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented. The Company bases its estimates on historical experience and other market-specific or other\nrelevant assumptions that it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances. Estimates are used in several areas including, but not limited to, estimation of variable\nconsideration, estimation of credit losses, standalone selling price allocation included in contracts with multiple performance obligations, goodwill and identifiable\nintangible assets, stock-based compensation, incremental borrowing rate for operating leases, contingencies, certain inputs into the provision for income taxes,\nincluding related reserves, valuation of non-marketable securities, among others. These estimates generally involve complex issues and require judgments, involve the\nanalysis of historical results and prediction of future trends, can require extended periods of time to resolve and are subject to change from period to period. Actual\nresults may differ materially from management’s estimates.\nUnaudited Interim Condensed Financial Statements\nThe accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with GAAP for interim financial information and in\naccordance with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Rule 10-01 of Regulation S-X of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Securities Act. Accordingly, they\ndo not include all of the information and notes required by GAAP for complete financial statements. These unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements\ninclude all adjustments, consisting only of normal recurring accruals that the Company believes are necessary to fairly state the financial position and the results of the\nCompany’s operations and cash flows for interim periods in accordance with GAAP. Interim-period results are not necessarily indicative of results of operations or\ncash flows for a full year or any subsequent interim period.\nThe accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the Company’s audited financial statements and notes thereto\nincluded in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.\nRestricted Cash\nAs of September 30, 2024, the Company had restricted cash balance of $103.3 million, included in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash on the Company's\ncondensed consolidated balance sheets, of which substantially all was related to cash held as collateral under surety bond requirements related to the intellectual\nproperty dispute with TwinStrand Biosciences, Inc. and the University of Washington, as described in Note 8 Commitments and Contingencies - Legal Proceedings to\nthe Company's condensed consolidated financial statements.\nNon-Marketable Securities\nThe Company acquires certain equity investments in private companies to promote business and strategic objectives. The Company's investments in non-marketable\nequity securities do not give the Company the ability to control or exercise significant influence over the investees. One of the investees is concluded to be a variable\ninterest entity, or VIE, but the Company is deemed not to be the primary beneficiary as the Company does not have the power to direct the activities that most\nsignificantly impact the VIE’s economic performance. The Company's non-marketable equity and other related investments totaled $11.1 million and $8.6 million as\nof September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, respectively, and are included in other assets, net on the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheets.\nNon-marketable securities are recorded at cost, subject to periodic impairment reviews and adjustments for observable price changes from orderly transactions. The\nCompany's evaluation of impairment of such non-marketable securities is based on adverse changes in market conditions and the regulatory or economic environment;\nqualitative and quantitative analysis of the operating performance and financial condition of the investee; changes in operating structure or management of the\ninvestee; and additional funding requirements of the investee. As a result of the evaluation, for one of its non-marketable equity security investments, the Company\nrecorded an impairment of $22.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, included in other income (expense), net on the Company's condensed\nconsolidated statements of operations. In addition, in connection with the investment in non-marketable securities purchased by the Company, the Company acquired\nrights to purchase the investee at a pre-determined price subject to additional adjustments based on the performance of the investee, on or before December 31, 2022.\nIn September 2022, the Company decided not to exercise such rights to purchase the investee and recorded an impairment of $5.3 million for the year ended December\n31, 2022, included in other income (expense), net on the Company's condensed consolidated statements of operations.\n10\nTable of Contents\nPursuant to another investment in non-marketable securities purchased by the Company, the Company acquired rights to purchase the investee at a pre-determined\nprice subject to additional adjustments based on the performance of the Company, on or before October 1, 2023, and acquired rights to obtain the exclusive license of\nthe investee's certain technologies. In June 2023, the Company decided not to exercise such rights and recorded an impairment of $7.0 million for the nine months\nended September 30, 2023, included in other income (expense), net on the Company's condensed consolidated statements of operations.\nNo other impairment or downward adjustments to the carrying value of the Company's non-marketable securities have been otherwise recorded.\nConcentration of Risk\nThe Company is subject to credit risk from its portfolio of cash equivalents held at one commercial bank and investments in marketable debt securities. The Company\nlimits its exposure to credit losses by investing in money market funds through a U.S. bank with high credit ratings. The Company’s cash may consist of deposits held\nwith banks that may at times exceed federally insured limits, however, its exposure to credit risk in the event of default by the financial institution is limited to the\nextent of amounts recorded on the condensed consolidated balance sheets. The Company performs evaluations of the relative credit standing of these financial\ninstitutions to limit the amount of credit exposure.\nThe Company also invests in investment-grade debt instruments and has policy limits for the amount it can invest in any one type of security, except for securities\nissued or guaranteed by the U.S. government. The goals of the Company’s investment policy, in order of priority, are as follows: safety and preservation of principal\nand diversification of risk; liquidity of investments sufficient to meet cash flow requirements; and a competitive after-tax rate of return. Under its investment policy,\nthe Company limits amounts invested in such securities by credit rating, maturity, investment type and issuer, as a result, the Company is not exposed to any\nsignificant concentrations of credit risk from these financial instruments.\nThe Company is subject to credit risk from its accounts receivable. The majority of the Company’s accounts receivable arises from the provision of precision oncology\nservices, and development services and other, primarily with biopharmaceutical companies and international laboratory partners, all of which have high credit ratings.\nThe Company has not experienced any material losses related to receivables from individual customers, or groups of customers. The Company does not require\ncollateral. Accounts receivable are recorded net of allowance for credit losses, if any.\nA significant customer is any biopharmaceutical customer, clinical testing payer, or international laboratory partner that represents 10% or more of the Company’s total\nrevenue or accounts receivable balance. Revenue attributable to each significant customer, including its affiliated entities, as a percentage of the Company’s total\nrevenue, for the respective period, and accounts receivable balance attributable to each significant customers, including its affiliated entities, as a percentage of the\nCompany’s total accounts receivable balance, at the respective condensed consolidated balance sheet date, are as follows:\nTotal Revenue Accounts Receivable, Net\nThree Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023 September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023\n(unaudited) (unaudited)\nCustomer A * * * * 14 % 12 %\nCustomer B 28 % 33 % 29 % 32 % 11 % 12 %\nCustomer C * * * * * 10 %\n* less than 10%\nAccounts Receivable, Net\nAccounts receivable represent valid claims against commercial and governmental payers, biopharmaceutical companies, research institutes, international laboratory\npartners and distributors, including unbilled receivables, and royalty payments due from third parties for licensing the Company’s technologies. Unbilled receivables\ninclude balances due from biopharmaceutical customers related to development services and other revenues that are recognized upon the achievement of performance-\nbased milestones but prior to the achievement of contractual billing rights. As of September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, the Company had unbilled receivables\nof $4.6 million and $4.9 million, respectively.\n11\nTable of Contents\nThe Company evaluates the collectability of its accounts receivable based on historical collection trends, the financial condition of payment partners, and external\nmarket factors and provides for an allowance for potential credit losses based on management’s best estimate of the amount of probable credit losses. The Company\nrecorded immaterial credit losses related to its accounts receivable for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023.\nGoodwill and Intangible Assets, net\nGoodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net identifiable assets and liabilities. Goodwill is not amortized but is tested for impairment\nat least annually during the fourth fiscal quarter, or if circumstances indicate its value may no longer be recoverable. The Company continues to operate\nin one segment, which is considered to be the sole reporting unit and, therefore, goodwill is tested for impairment at the enterprise level. As of September 30, 2024,\nthere has been no impairment of goodwill.\nIntangible assets with finite useful lives are carried at cost, net of accumulated amortization. The Company does not have intangible assets with indefinite useful lives\nother than goodwill. Amortization is recorded on a straight-line basis over the intangible asset's useful life, which is approximately 6—12 years.\nLeases\nThe Company determines if an arrangement contains a lease at inception. Operating lease right-of-use, or ROU, assets and operating leases liabilities are recognized\nbased on the present value of the future minimum lease payments over the lease term at the commencement date. ROU assets also include any initial direct costs\nincurred and any lease payments made at or before the lease commencement date, less lease incentives received or receivable. The Company uses its incremental\nborrowing rate based on the information available at the commencement date in determining the lease liabilities, as the Company's leases generally do not provide an\nimplicit rate. Lease terms may include options to extend or terminate when the Company is reasonably certain the option will be exercised. Lease expense is\nrecognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. The Company also has lease arrangements with lease and non-lease components. The Company elected the\npractical expedient not to separate non-lease components from lease components for the Company’s facility leases. The Company also elected to apply the short-term\nlease measurement and recognition exemption in which ROU assets and lease liabilities are not recognized for leases with terms of 12 months or less.\nConvertible Senior Notes\nConvertible senior notes are accounted for as a liability and measured at their amortized cost. Transaction costs related to the issuance of the notes are netted with the\nliability and are amortized to interest expense over the term of the notes, using an effective interest rate method.\nRevenue Recognition\nThe Company derives revenue from the provision of precision oncology testing services, as well as from development services and other. Precision oncology testing\nrevenue includes amounts derived from the delivery of the Company’s precision oncology tests, including those tests delivered by labs operated by our strategic\npartners. Development services include companion diagnostic development and regulatory approval, clinical study setup, monitoring and maintenance, testing\ndevelopment and support, GuardantConnect and GuardantINFORM. Other revenue includes amounts derived from licensing the Company's technologies, kit\nfulfillment, and delivery of the Company's Shield screening tests. The Company currently receives payments from third-party commercial and governmental payers,\ncertain hospitals and oncology centers and individual patients, as well as biopharmaceutical companies, research institutes, international laboratory partners and\ndistributors.\nRevenues are recognized when control of services is transferred to customers, in an amount that reflects the consideration the Company expects to be entitled to in\nexchange for those services. FASB ASC Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, provides for a five-step model that includes identifying the contract with\na customer, identifying the performance obligations in the contract, determining the transaction price, allocating the transaction price to the performance obligations,\nand recognizing revenue when, or as, an entity satisfies a performance obligation.\n12\nTable of Contents\nPrecision oncology testing\nThe Company recognizes revenue from the sale of its precision oncology tests for clinical customers, including certain hospitals, cancer centers, other institutions and\npatients, at the time results of the test are reported to physicians. Most precision oncology tests requested by clinical customers are sold without a written agreement;\nhowever, the Company determines an implied contract exists with its clinical customers. The Company identifies each sale of its test to a clinical customer as a single\nperformance obligation. With the exception of certain limited contracted arrangements with insurance carriers and other institutions where the transaction price is\nfixed, a stated contract price does not exist and the transaction price for each implied contract with clinical customers represents variable consideration. The Company\nestimates the variable consideration under the portfolio approach and considers the historical reimbursement data from third-party commercial and governmental\npayers and patients, as well as known or anticipated reimbursement trends not reflected in the historical data. The Company monitors the estimated amount to be\ncollected in the portfolio at each reporting period based on actual cash collections in order to assess whether a revision to the estimate is required. Both the estimate\nand any subsequent revision contain uncertainty and require the use of significant judgment in the estimation of the variable consideration and application of the\nconstraint for such variable consideration. The Company analyzes its actual cash collections over the expected reimbursement period and compares it with the\nestimated variable consideration for each portfolio and any difference is recognized as an adjustment to estimated revenue after the expected reimbursement period,\nsubject to assessment of the risk of future revenue reversal.\nRevenue from sales of precision oncology tests to biopharmaceutical customers are based on a negotiated price per test or on the basis of an agreement to provide\ncertain testing volume over a defined period. The Company identifies its promise to transfer a series of distinct tests to biopharmaceutical customers as a single\nperformance obligation. Precision oncology tests to biopharmaceutical customers are generally billed at a fixed price for each test performed. For agreements\ninvolving testing volume to be satisfied over a defined period, revenue is recognized over time based on the number of tests performed as the performance obligation\nis satisfied over time. Results of the Company’s precision oncology services are delivered electronically, and as such there are no shipping or handling fees incurred by\nthe Company or billed to customers.\nDevelopment services and other\nThe Company performs development services for its biopharmaceutical customers utilizing its precision oncology information platform. Development services\ntypically represent a single performance obligation as the Company performs a significant integration service, such as analytical validation and regulatory submissions.\nThe individual promises are not separately identifiable from other promises in the contracts and, therefore, are not distinct. However, under certain contracts, a\nbiopharmaceutical customer may engage the Company for multiple distinct development services which are both capable of being distinct and separately identifiable\nfrom other promises in the contracts and, therefore, distinct performance obligations.\nThe Company collaborates with biopharmaceutical companies in the development of new drugs. As part of these collaborations, the Company provides services\nrelated to regulatory filings to support companion diagnostic device submissions for the Company’s testing panels. Under these collaborations, the Company generates\nrevenue from achievement of milestones, as well as provision of on-going support. For the companion diagnostic development and regulatory approval services\nperformed, the Company is compensated through a combination of an upfront fee and performance-based, non-refundable regulatory and other developmental\nmilestone payments. The transaction price of these contracts typically represents variable consideration. Application of the constraint for variable consideration to\nmilestone payments is an area that requires significant judgment. The Company evaluates factors such as the scientific, clinical, regulatory, commercial, and other risks\nthat must be managed to achieve the respective milestone and the level of effort and investment required to achieve the respective milestone. In making this\nassessment, the Company considers its historical experience with similar milestones, the degree of complexity and uncertainty associated with each milestone, and\nwhether achievement of the milestone is dependent on parties other than the Company. The constraint for variable consideration is applied such that it is probable a\nsignificant reversal of revenue will not occur when the uncertainty associated with the contingency is resolved. Application of the constraint for variable consideration\nis assessed and updated at each reporting period as a revision to the estimated transaction price.\n13\nTable of Contents\nThe Company recognizes companion diagnostic development and regulatory approval services revenue over the period in which biopharmaceutical research and\ndevelopment services are provided. Specifically, the Company recognizes revenue using an input method to measure progress, utilizing costs incurred to-date relative\nto total expected costs as its measure of progress. The Company assesses the changes to the total expected cost estimates as well as any incremental fees negotiated\nresulting from changes to the scope of the original contract in determining the revenue recognition at each reporting period. For development of new products or\nservices under these arrangements, costs incurred before technological feasibility is reached are included as research and development expenses in the Company’s\ncondensed consolidated statements of operations, while costs incurred thereafter are recorded as cost of development services and other.\nThe Company also recognizes revenue from other development services, in addition to companion diagnostic development and regulatory approval services noted\nabove, such as clinical study setup, monitoring and maintenance, testing development and support, GuardantConnect and GuardantINFORM. These revenues are\ngenerally recognized over time based on an input method to measure progress in the period when the associated services have been performed.\nIn addition, the Company licenses its digital sequencing technologies to its domestic customers and international laboratory partners. For the licensed technology, the\nCompany is compensated through royalty-based payments, non-refundable upfront payments, guaranteed minimum payments, and/or sample milestone payments.\nDepending on the nature of the technology licensing arrangements, and considering factors including but not limited to enforceable right to payment and payment\nterms, and if an asset with alternative use is created, these revenues are recognized in the period when royalty-bearing sales occur, when the technology transfer is\ncomplete, or over the technology transfer period. Other revenue also includes kit fulfillment, which is recognized when such products are delivered. In addition, other\nrevenue includes amounts derived from delivery of the Company's Shield screening tests.\nFor the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company recorded $18.2 million and $31.9 million, respectively, as revenue related to performance\nobligations satisfied in prior periods. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Company recorded $7.4 million and $12.2 million, respectively, as\nrevenue related to performance obligations satisfied in prior periods.\nContracts with multiple performance obligations\nContracts with biopharmaceutical customers and international laboratory partners may include multiple distinct performance obligations, such as provision of\nprecision oncology testing, the above-mentioned development services, and digital sequencing technology licensing, among others. The Company evaluates the terms\nand conditions included within its contracts with biopharmaceutical customers and international laboratory partners to ensure appropriate revenue recognition,\nincluding whether services are considered distinct performance obligations that should be accounted for separately versus together. The Company first identifies\nmaterial promises, in contrast to immaterial promises or administrative tasks, under the contract, and then evaluates whether these promises are both capable of being\ndistinct and distinct within the context of the contract. In assessing whether a promised service is capable of being distinct, the Company considers whether the\ncustomer could benefit from the service either on its own or together with other resources that are readily available to the customer, including factors such as the\nresearch, development, and commercialization capabilities of a third party as well as the availability of the associated expertise in the general marketplace. In assessing\nwhether a promised service is distinct within the context of the contract, the Company considers whether it provides a significant integration of the services, whether\nthe services significantly modify or customize one another, or whether the services are highly interdependent or interrelated.\nFor contracts with multiple performance obligations, the transaction price is allocated to the separate performance obligations on a relative standalone selling price\nbasis. The Company determines standalone selling price by considering the historical selling price of these performance obligations in similar transactions as well as\nother factors, including, but not limited to, the price that customers in the market would be willing to pay, competitive pricing of other vendors, industry publications\nand current pricing practices, and expected costs of satisfying each performance obligation plus appropriate margin; or by using the residual approach if standalone\nselling price is not observable, by reference to the total transaction price less the sum of the observable standalone selling prices of other performance obligations\npromised in the contract.\n14\nTable of Contents\nDeferred revenue\nDeferred revenue, which is a contract liability, consists primarily of payments received in advance of revenue recognition from contracts with customers. For example,\ndevelopment services and other contracts with biopharmaceutical customers often contain upfront payments which results in the recording of deferred revenue to the\nextent cash is received prior to the Company's performance of the related services. Contract liabilities are relieved as the Company performs its obligations under the\ncontract and revenue is consequently recognized. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the deferred revenue balance was $32.5 million and $22.9\nmillion, respectively, of which $3.0 million and $5.0 million was considered long-term and recorded within other long-term liabilities on the accompanying condensed\nconsolidated balance sheets. Revenue recognized in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 that was included in the deferred revenue balance as of December 31,\n2023 was $12.6 million, and revenue recognized in the nine months ended September 30, 2023 that was included in the deferred revenue balance as of December 31,\n2022 was $12.7 million, respectively.\nTransaction price allocated to the remaining performance obligations\nTransaction price allocated to remaining performance obligations represents contracted revenue that has not yet been recognized, which includes deferred revenue and\nnon-cancelable amounts that will be invoiced and recognized as revenues in future periods. The Company expects to recognize substantially all of the remaining\ntransaction price in the next 1-2 years.\nCosts of Precision Oncology Testing\nCost of precision oncology testing generally consists of cost of materials, cost of labor, including bonus, benefit and stock-based compensation, equipment and\ninfrastructure expenses associated with processing test samples (including sample accessioning, library preparation, sequencing, and quality control analyses), freight,\ncuration of test results for physicians, phlebotomy, and license fees due to third parties. Infrastructure expenses include depreciation of laboratory equipment, lease\ncosts, amortization of leasehold improvements, and information technology costs. Costs associated with performing the Company’s tests are recorded as the tests are\nperformed regardless of whether revenue was recognized with respect to that test.\nCost of Development Services and Other\nCost of development services and other primarily includes costs incurred for the performance of development services requested by the Company’s biopharmaceutical\ncustomers, and costs associated with the Company's partnership agreements and delivery of Shield screening tests. For development of new products, costs incurred\nbefore technological feasibility has been achieved are reported as research and development expenses, while costs incurred thereafter are reported as cost of\ndevelopment services and other.\nResearch and Development Expenses\nResearch and development expenses consist of costs incurred to develop technology and include salaries and benefits including stock-based compensation, reagents\nand supplies used in research and development laboratory work, infrastructure expenses, including facility occupancy and information technology costs, contract\nservices, other outside costs and costs to develop the Company's technology capabilities. Research and development expenses also include costs related to activities\nperformed under contracts with biopharmaceutical companies before technological feasibility has been achieved. Research and development costs are expensed as\nincurred. Payments made prior to the receipt of goods or services to be used in research and development are deferred and recognized as expense in the period in\nwhich the related goods are received or services are rendered. Costs to develop technology capabilities are recorded as research and development expenses unless they\nmeet the criteria to be capitalized as internal-use software costs.\nStock-Based Compensation\nStock-based compensation related to stock options granted to the Company’s employees, directors and nonemployees is measured at the grant date based on the fair\nvalue of the award. The fair value is recognized as expense over the requisite service period, which is generally the vesting period of the respective awards.\nCompensation expense for stock options with performance metrics is calculated based upon expected achievement of the metrics specified in the grant.\n15\nTable of Contents\nThe Company uses the Black-Scholes option-pricing model to estimate the fair value of stock options granted under the 2012 Stock Plan (as amended and restated), or\nthe 2012 Plan, the 2018 Incentive Award Plan, or the 2018 Plan, the 2023 Employment Inducement Incentive Award Plan, or the 2023 Plan, and stock purchase rights\ngranted under the 2018 Employee Stock Purchase Plan. The Black-Scholes option-pricing model requires assumptions to be made related to the expected term of an\naward, expected volatility, risk-free rate and expected dividend yield.\nThe Company measures the grant date fair value of its service-based and performance-based restricted stock units issued to employees and non-employees based on\nthe closing market price of the common stock on the date of grant. For restricted stock units with only service-based vesting conditions, compensation expense is\nrecognized in the Company’s condensed consolidated statement of operations on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period. Compensation expense for\nrestricted stock units with performance metrics, or PSUs, is calculated based upon expected achievement of the metrics specified in the grant, and is recognized in the\nCompany’s condensed consolidated statement of operations using an accelerated attribution model over the requisite service period for each separately vesting portion\nof the award. No stock-based compensation expense is recorded for PSUs, unless it is determined to be probable that the related performance metrics will be met. In\naddition, a cumulative adjustment will be recorded in the period when the probability of achieving the related performance metrics is adjusted. Any PSUs that remain\nunvested at the end of the performance period will be forfeited. Forfeitures are accounted for as they occur.\nNet Loss Per Share\nThe Company calculates basic net loss per share by dividing the net loss by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding for the period. The\ndiluted net loss per share is computed by giving effect to all potential dilutive common stock equivalents outstanding for the period determined using the treasury stock\nmethod or the as-if converted method, as appropriate. For purposes of this calculation, stock options, restricted stock units, shares issuable pursuant to the employee\nstock purchase plan, and contingently issuable shares under the convertible senior notes are considered common stock equivalents but have been excluded from the\ncalculation of diluted net loss per share as their effect is anti-dilutive.\nNew Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted\nIn November 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, issued ASU No. 2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable\nSegment Disclosures, which requires an enhanced disclosure of significant segment expenses on an annual and interim basis. This guidance will be effective for the\nannual reporting periods beginning the year ended December 31, 2024, and for interim reporting periods beginning January 1, 2025, with early adoption permitted, and\nshould be applied retrospectively. The Company expects to provide required disclosures upon the effective date.\nIn December 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-09, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures, which amended existing income tax\ndisclosure guidance, primarily requiring more detailed disclosures on the effective tax rate reconciliation and income taxes paid. This guidance will be effective for\nannual reporting periods beginning the year ended December 31, 2025, with early adoption permitted and can be applied on either a prospective or retroactive basis.\nThe Company expects to provide required disclosures upon the effective date.\nIn November 2024, the FASB issued ASU No. 2024-03, Income Statement-Reporting Comprehensive Income (Topic 220): Expense Disaggregation Disclosures, which\nrequires additional disclosures of specified information about certain costs and expenses in the notes to financial statements. This guidance will be effective for annual\nreporting periods beginning the year ended December 31, 2027, and for interim reporting periods beginning January 1, 2028, with early adoption permitted and can be\napplied on either a prospective or retroactive basis. The Company is currently assessing the impact of adopting this accounting pronouncement on its consolidated\nfinancial statements.\n16\nTable of Contents\n3.

Fair Value Measurements, Cash Equivalents and Marketable Securities\nFinancial instruments consist of cash equivalents, marketable securities, accounts receivable, net, prepaid expenses and other current assets, net, and accounts payable\nand accrued liabilities. Cash equivalents and marketable securities are stated at fair value. Prepaid expenses and other current assets, net, and accounts payable and\naccrued liabilities are stated at their carrying value, which approximates fair value due to the short time to the expected receipt or payment date.\nFair value is defined as the exchange price that would be received from sale of an asset or paid to transfer a liability in the principal or most advantageous market for\nthe asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. The identification of market participant assumptions provides a\nbasis for determining what inputs are to be used for pricing each asset or liability. A financial instrument’s classification within the fair value hierarchy is based upon\nthe lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement.\nA fair value hierarchy has been established which gives precedence to fair value measurements calculated using observable inputs over those using unobservable\ninputs. This hierarchy prioritized the inputs into three broad levels as follows:\nLevel 1 - Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.\n17\nTable of Contents\nLevel 2 - Inputs other than Level 1 that are observable, either directly or indirectly, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities; quoted prices in markets that\nare not active; or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities.\nLevel 3 - Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities.\nThe Company’s financial assets and liabilities subject to fair value measurements on a recurring basis and the level of inputs used in such measurements were as\nfollows:\nSeptember 30, 2024\nFair Value Level 1 Level 2 Level 3\n(unaudited)\n(in thousands)\nFinancial Assets:\nMoney market funds $ 112,142 $ 112,142 $ — $ —\nIncome deposit funds 102,412 — 102,412 —\nU.S. government debt securities 398,485 — 398,485 —\nTotal cash equivalents and restricted cash $ 613,039 $ 112,142 $ 500,897 $ —\nU.S. government debt securities $ 310,701 $ — $ 310,701 $ —\nTotal short-term marketable debt securities $ 310,701 $ — $ 310,701 $ —\nShort-term marketable equity securities $ 31,280 $ 31,280 $ — $ —\nTotal $ 955,020 $ 143,422 $ 811,598 $ —\nFinancial Liabilities:\nContingent consideration $ 7,300 $ — $ — $ 7,300\nTotal $ 7,300 $ — $ — $ 7,300\nDecember 31, 2023\nFair Value Level 1 Level 2 Level 3\n(in thousands)\nFinancial Assets:\nMoney market funds $ 1,032,500 $ 1,032,500 $ — $ —\nTotal cash equivalents $ 1,032,500 $ 1,032,500 $ — $ —\nU.S. government debt securities $ 35,097 $ — $ 35,097 $ —\nTotal short-term marketable debt securities $ 35,097 $ — $ 35,097 $ —\nLong-term marketable equity securities $ 98,002 $ 98,002 $ — $ —\nTotal $ 1,165,599 $ 1,130,502 $ 35,097 $ —\nFinancial Liabilities:\nContingent consideration $ 6,540 $ — $ — $ 6,540\nTotal $ 6,540 $ — $ — $ 6,540\n18\nTable of Contents\nThe Company measures the fair value of money market funds based on quoted prices in active markets for identical securities. Income deposit funds and U.S.\ngovernment debt securities are valued taking into consideration valuations obtained from third-party pricing services. The pricing services utilize industry standard\nvaluation models, including both income and market-based approaches, for which all significant inputs are observable, either directly or indirectly, to estimate fair\nvalue. These inputs include reported trades of and broker/dealer quotes on the same or similar securities, issuer credit spreads; benchmark securities;\nprepayment/default projections based on historical data and other observable inputs.\nIn July 2022, one of the Company's equity investees, Lunit Inc., or Lunit, completed its initial public offering, or IPO, subsequent to which, the Company started to\naccount for the investment in Lunit at fair value on a recurring basis, and classified the investment as marketable equity securities within Level 1 of the fair value\nhierarchy as the investment is valued using the quoted market price. The Company was subject to a 2-year lock-up period from Lunit's IPO date, during which the\nCompany shall not transfer Lunit's shares between accounts, establish or cancel pledges, sell, or withdraw such shares, without approval from the Korea Exchange. In\nNovember 2023, Lunit issued bonus shares to its existing shareholders by allocating one new share for each existing share, and the Company was subject to the same\nlock-up period with the same restrictions for these bonus shares which expired in July 2024. In the third quarter of 2024, the Company sold a portion of its investment\nin Lunit. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the balance of the investment in Lunit was $31.3 million and $98.0 million, included in prepaid expenses\nand other current assets, net, and other assets, net, respectively, on the Company's condensed consolidated balance sheets. In addition, the Company recorded $1.2\nmillion and $29.3 million unrealized losses during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, on the investment in Lunit held as of\nSeptember 30, 2024, and recorded $16.6 million and $84.5 million unrealized gains during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively, on the\ninvestment in Lunit held as of September 30, 2023, included in other income (expense), net on the Company's condensed consolidated statement of operations.\nThere were no transfers between Level 1, Level 2 and Level 3 during the periods presented.\nAcquisition-related contingent consideration is measured at fair value on a quarterly basis and changes in estimated contingent consideration to be paid are included in\ngeneral and administrative expense in the condensed consolidated statements of operations. The fair value of acquisition-related contingent consideration is estimated\nusing a multiple-outcome discounted cash flow valuation technique. Contingent consideration is classified within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy, as it is based on a\nprobability that includes significant unobservable inputs. The significant unobservable inputs include a probability-weighted estimate of achievement of certain\ncommercialization milestones, and discount rate to present value the expected payments. A significant change in any of these input factors in isolation could have a\nmaterial impact to fair value measurement. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company's acquisition-related contingent consideration liability\nwas $7.3 million and $6.5 million, respectively, of which $1.8 million and $5.0 million was considered long-term and recorded within other long-term liabilities on the\nCompany's condensed consolidated balance sheets.\nThe following table summarizes the activities for the Level 3 financial instruments:\nContingent Consideration\nThree Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\n(unaudited)\n(in thousands)\nFair value — beginning of period $ 6,960 $ 6,440 $ 6,540 $ 6,430\nIncrease in fair value 340 220 760 230\nFair value — end of period $ 7,300 $ 6,660 $ 7,300 $ 6,660\nThe Company considers the fair value of the Convertible Notes as of September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, to be a Level 2 measurement. The fair value of the\nConvertible Notes is primarily affected by the trading price of the Company's common stock and market interest rates. As such, the carrying value of the Convertible\nNotes does not reflect the market rate. See Note 6, Debt, for additional information related to the fair value of the Convertible Notes.\n19\nTable of Contents\nThe following tables summarize the Company’s cash equivalents, restricted cash and marketable debt securities’ amortized costs, gross unrealized gains, gross\nunrealized losses and estimated fair values by significant investment category:\nSeptember 30, 2024\nAmortized Cost Gross Unrealized Gain Gross Unrealized Loss Estimated Fair Value\n(unaudited)\n(in thousands)\nMoney market funds $ 112,142 $ — $ — $ 112,142\nIncome deposit funds 102,412 — — 102,412\nU.S. government debt securities 708,731 480 (25) 709,186\nTotal $ 923,285 $ 480 $ (25) $ 923,740\nDecember 31, 2023\nAmortized Cost Gross Unrealized Gain Gross Unrealized Loss Estimated Fair Value\n(in thousands)\nMoney market funds $ 1,032,500 $ — $ — $ 1,032,500\nU.S. government debt securities 35,108 — (11) 35,097\nTotal $ 1,067,608 $ — $ (11) $ 1,067,597\nNone of the Company’s marketable debt securities had been in a continuous unrealized loss position for more than one year as of September 30, 2024 and\nDecember 31, 2023, respectively.\nThere have been no material realized gains or losses on marketable debt securities for the periods presented.

Debt\nConvertible Senior Notes\nIn November 2020, the Company issued $1.15 billion principal amount of its 0% Convertible Senior Notes due 2027, or the 2027 Notes. The 2027 Notes do not bear\ninterest, and the principal amount of the Notes will not accrete. However, special interest and additional interest may accrue on the 2027 Notes at a rate per annum not\nexceeding 0.50% (subject to certain exceptions) upon the occurrence of certain events such as the failure to file certain reports to the Securities and Exchange\nCommission, or to remove certain restrictive legends from the Notes. The Notes will mature on November 15, 2027, unless repurchased, redeemed or converted\nearlier.\n21\nTable of Contents\nBefore August 15, 2027, holders of the 2027 Notes will have the right to convert their 2027 Notes only under the following circumstances:\n• during any calendar quarter (and only during such calendar quarter) commencing after the calendar quarter ending on March 31, 2021, if the last reported sale\nprice of the Company's common stock exceeds 130% of the conversion price for each of at least 20 trading days (whether or not consecutive) during the 30\nconsecutive trading days ending on the last trading day of the immediately preceding calendar quarter, or the sale price condition;\n• during the five consecutive business days immediately after any ten consecutive trading day period, or the measurement period, if the trading price per $1,000\nprincipal amount of the Notes for each trading day of the measurement period is less than 98% of the product of the last reported sale price of the Company's\ncommon stock on such trading day and the conversion rate on such trading day; or\n• upon the occurrence of specified corporate events\nFrom and after August 15, 2027, holders of the 2027 Notes may convert their 2027 Notes at any time at their election until the close of business on the second\nscheduled trading day immediately before the maturity date.\nThe Company will settle conversions by paying or delivering, as applicable, cash, shares of its common stock or a combination of cash and shares of its common\nstock, at the Company’s election.\nThe initial conversion rate is 7.1523 shares of common stock per $1,000 principal amount of 2027 Notes, which represents an initial conversion price of approximately\n$139.82 per share of common stock. The conversion rate and conversion price will be subject to customary adjustments upon the occurrence of certain events. In\naddition, if certain corporate events that constitute a “Make-Whole Fundamental Change” occur, then the conversion rate will, in certain circumstances, be increased\nfor a specified period of time.\nThe Company may not redeem the 2027 Notes at its option at any time before November 20, 2024. The Notes will be redeemable, in whole or in part, at the\nCompany’s option at any time, and from time to time, on or after November 20, 2024 and on or before the 25th scheduled trading day immediately before the maturity\ndate, at a cash redemption price equal to the principal amount of the Notes to be redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid special interest and additional interest, if any, to,\nbut excluding, the redemption date, but only if the last reported sale price per share of the Company’s common stock exceeds 130% of the conversion price on (i) each\nof at least 20 trading days, whether or not consecutive, during the 30 consecutive trading days ending on, and including, the trading day immediately before the date\nthe Company sends the related redemption notice; and (ii) the trading day immediately before the date the Company sends such notice. In addition, calling any Note\nfor redemption will constitute a Make-Whole Fundamental Change with respect to that Note, in which case the conversion rate applicable to the conversion of that\nNote will be increased in certain circumstances if it is converted after it is called for redemption.\nIf certain corporate events that constitute a “Fundamental Change” occur, then, subject to a limited exception for certain cash mergers, holders of Notes may require\nthe Company to repurchase their 2027 Notes at a cash repurchase price equal to the principal amount of the 2027 Notes to be repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid\nspecial interest and additional interest, if any, to, but excluding, the fundamental change repurchase date. The definition of Fundamental Change includes certain\nbusiness combination transactions involving the Company and certain de-listing events with respect to the Company’s common stock.\nSince the 2027 Notes were not convertible as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the net carrying amount of the 2027 Notes was classified as a long-term\nliability.\nThe following table sets forth the net carrying amounts of the 2027 Notes as of September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023:\nSeptember 30, 2024 December 31, 2023\n(unaudited)\n(in thousands)\nPrincipal $ 1,150,000 $ 1,150,000\nLess: debt issuance costs, net of amortization (8,099) (10,034)\nNet carrying amount $ 1,141,901 $ 1,139,966\n22\nTable of Contents\nThe total estimated fair value of the 2027 Notes was $897.0 million and $809.3 million as of September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, respectively. The fair value\nwas determined based on the closing trading price per $100 of the 2027 Notes as of the last day of trading for the period.\nThe interest expense recognized in relation to amortization of debt issuance costs was $0.6 million and $1.9 million for the three and nine months ended September 30,\n2024 and 2023, respectively, which represented an effective interest rate of 0.2% and 0.2% for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023,\nrespectively.\nNote Hedges\nTo minimize the impact of potential economic dilution upon conversion of the 2027 Notes, the Company entered into convertible note hedge transactions, or the 2027\nNote Hedges, with respect to its common stock concurrent with the issuance of the Notes. The 2027 Note Hedges cover, subject to customary adjustments, the number\nof shares of common stock initially underlying the Notes. The strike price of the 2027 Note Hedges will initially be approximately $182.60 per share, which represents\na premium of 75% over the last reported sale price of the Company’s common stock of $104.34 per share on November 16, 2020, and is subject to certain adjustments\nunder the terms of the 2027 Note Hedges.\nThe 2027 Note Hedges will expire upon maturity of the 2027 Notes. The 2027 Note Hedges are separate transactions and are not part of the terms of the 2027 Notes.\nHolders of the 2027 Notes will not have any rights with respect to the 2027 Note Hedges. The shares receivable related to the 2027 Note Hedges are excluded from the\ncalculation of diluted earnings per share as they are anti-dilutive.\nAs these transactions meet certain accounting criteria, the 2027 Note Hedges are recorded in stockholders’ equity and are not accounted for as derivatives. The\nCompany paid an aggregate amount of $90.0 million for the 2027 Note Hedges, which has been recorded as a reduction to additional paid-in capital and will not be\nremeasured.\n7. Leases\nThe Company has entered into various operating lease agreements for office space, data center, lab and warehouse use, with remaining terms ranging from 0.2 to 8.8\nyears, some of which include one or more options to renew. As leases approach maturity, the Company considers various factors such as market conditions and the\nterms of any renewal options that may exist to determine whether it will renew the lease, as such, the Company does not include renewal options in its lease terms for\ncalculating its lease liability, as the renewal options allow it to maintain operational flexibility and the Company is not reasonably certain it will exercise these renewal\noptions at the time of the lease commencement.\nOperating lease expense was $8.1 million and $7.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023, respectively, and $23.4 million and $22.1\nmillion for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023, respectively, which includes both lease and non-lease components (primarily common area\nmaintenance charges and property taxes).\nSeptember 30, 2024 December 31, 2023\n(unaudited)\nWeighted-average remaining lease term (in years)\n7.7 8.3\nWeighted-average discount rate\n3.82 % 3.87 %\n23\nTable of Contents\nThe following table summarizes the Company's future principal contractual obligations for operating lease commitments as of September 30, 2024:\nYear Ending December 31,\n(unaudited)\n(in thousands)\nRemainder of 2024 $ 8,924\n2025 33,733\n2026 29,369\n2027 25,717\n2028 24,238\n2029 and thereafter 103,780\nTotal operating lease payments $ 225,761\nLess: imputed interest (28,247)\nTotal operating lease liabilities $ 197,514\nFinance leases are not material to the Company's condensed consolidated financial statements.\n8. Commitments and Contingencies\nLegal Proceedings\nIn addition to commitments and obligations incurred in the ordinary course of business, from time to time the Company may be subject to a variety of claims and legal\nproceedings, including claims from customers and vendors, pending and potential legal actions for damages, governmental investigations and other matters. For\nexample, the Company has received, and may in the future continue to receive letters, claims or complaints from others alleging false advertising, patent infringement,\nviolation of employment practices and trademark infringement. The Company has also instituted, and may in the future institute, additional legal proceedings to\nenforce its rights and seek remedies, such as monetary damages, injunctive relief and declaratory relief. The Company cannot predict the results of any such disputes,\nand despite the potential outcomes, the existence thereof may have an adverse material impact on the Company because of diversion of management time and attention\nas well as the financial costs related to resolving such disputes.\nThe Company and its affiliates are parties to the legal claims and proceedings described below. The Company is vigorously defending itself against those claims and in\nthose proceedings. Significant developments in those matters are described below. If the Company is unsuccessful in defending, or if it determines to settle, any of\nthese matters, it may be required to pay substantial sums, be subject to injunction and/or be forced to change how it operates its business, which could have a material\nadverse impact on its financial position or results of operations.\nUnless otherwise stated, the Company is unable to reasonably estimate the loss or a range of possible loss for the matters described below. Often, it is not reasonably\npossible for the Company to determine that a loss is probable for a claim, or to reasonably estimate the amount of loss or a range of loss, because of the limited\ninformation available and the potential effects of future events and decisions by third parties, such as courts and regulators, that will determine the ultimate resolution\nof the claim. Many of the matters described are at preliminary stages, raise novel theories of liability or seek an indeterminate amount of damages. It is not uncommon\nfor claims to be resolved over a number of years. The Company reviews loss contingencies at least quarterly to determine whether the loss probability has changed and\nwhether it can make a reasonable estimate of the possible loss or range of loss. When the Company determines that a loss from a claim is probable and reasonably\nestimable, it records a liability in the amount of its estimate for the ultimate loss. The Company also provides disclosure when it is reasonably possible that a loss may\nbe incurred or when it is reasonably possible that the amount of a loss will exceed its recorded liability.\n24\nTable of Contents\nIntellectual Property Disputes\nIn August 2021, TwinStrand Biosciences, Inc., or TwinStrand Biosciences, and the University of Washington filed a patent infringement suit in the United States\nDistrict Court for the District of Delaware alleging that the Company infringes U.S. Patent Nos. 10,287,631; 10,689,699; 10,752,951; and 10,760,127. The Company\nanswered the complaint in October 2021, denying TwinStrand Biosciences’ allegations and asserted counterclaims of invalidity, unenforceability due to inequitable\nconduct and infringement of four of the Company’s patents. Discovery in the case has concluded. In October 2023, the District Court dismissed with prejudice\nTwinStrand’s infringement claims related to U.S. Patent Nos. 10,689,699 and 10,752,951.\nOn November 14, 2023, a jury verdict was entered in favor of TwinStrand Biosciences and the University of Washington and against the Company. The jury found that\nthe Company willfully infringed U.S. Patent Nos. 10,287,631 and 10,760,127, and awarded TwinStrand Biosciences and the University of Washington $83.4 million in\ndamages, representing a 6% royalty on past sales. As a result, the Company recorded a liability of $83.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2023, which was reflected as a\ncharge to other operating expense on its consolidated statements of operations, and as a component of other long-term liabilities on its consolidated balance sheets.\nPost-trial motions were filed on March 4, 2024, where the Company moved to overturn the jury’s verdict, seek a new trial, and/or amend the judgment, and\nTwinStrand Biosciences moved for enhanced damages based on the jury's finding of willful infringement, pre- and post-judgment interest, and a go-forward running\nroyalty. A hearing date has not yet been set on the post-trial motions. The Company strongly disagrees with the jury verdict and will vigorously contest the verdict and\njudgment through post-trial motions in the District Court, and if needed, through appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit.\nOn August 1, 2023, the Company publicly announced that it entered into a Collaboration and Settlement Agreement, or the Collaboration Agreement, with Illumina,\nInc., or Illumina. Under the terms of the Collaboration Agreement, the parties have agreed to extend their long-standing commercial relationship by agreeing to\ncollaborate on the sharing of specimen samples in order to advance cancer research, and by entering into a new long-term purchase and supply commitment.\nFurthermore, the parties agreed to dismiss with prejudice the March 2022 lawsuit filed by Illumina in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware, Illumina,\nInc. v. Guardant Health, Inc. et al, Case No. 1:22-cv-00334-GBW-CJB, including any allegations related to the subject intellectual property.\nOn June 11, 2024, the Company filed a patent infringement suit against Tempus AI, Inc., or Tempus, in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware\nalleging that Tempus infringes U.S. Patent Nos. 11,149,306; 9,902,992; 10,501,810; 10,793,916; and 11,643,693. The Company is seeking an injunction to stop\nTempus’ infringement and compensatory damages. The case Guardant Health, Inc. v. Tempus AI, Inc., Case No. 1:24-cv-00687, has been assigned to Judge Richard\nAndrews and does not yet have a scheduling order. On October 21, 2024, Tempus moved to dismiss the Company’s suit alleging that some of the asserted patents were\ninvalid. The Company disagrees and will be responding accordingly.\nFalse Advertising Dispute\nIn May 2021, the Company also filed a lawsuit against Natera, Inc., or Natera, in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California, wherein the\nCompany alleged that Natera is misleading healthcare providers about the performance of the Company’s new oncology test, Guardant Reveal, by suggesting the test\nis inaccurate and/or insensitive, and inferior to Natera’s Signatera assay. The Company is seeking an injunction to prevent Natera from continuing to make false and\nmisleading statements and to require Natera to take corrective actions. Natera has asserted counterclaims of false and misleading statements, false advertising,\nunlawful trade practices and unfair competition. The Company moved to dismiss Natera’s counterclaims, and in January 2022, the court granted in part and denied in\npart the Company's motion to dismiss. The Company and Natera have both moved for summary judgment on various claims, with the court granting in part non-\ndispositive motions brought by each party. Trial is scheduled to commence in November 2024.\nCivil Investigative Demand\nIn January 2022, the Company received a Civil Investigative Demand, or CID, from the United States Attorney for the Northern District of California in connection\nwith an investigation under the False Claims Act. The CID requests information and documents regarding billing of government-funded programs for the Company’s\npanel of genetic tests known as Guardant360. The Company is fully cooperating with the investigation. At this time, the Company is unable to predict the outcome of\nthis investigation.\n25\nTable of Contents\n9. Common Stock\nThe Company’s common stockholders are entitled to dividends if and when declared by the Company’s Board of Directors, or the Board of Directors. As of\nSeptember 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, no dividends on the Company's common stock had been declared by the Board of Directors.\nThe Company’s common stock has been reserved for the following potential future issuances:\nSeptember 30, 2024 December 31, 2023\n(unaudited)\nShares underlying outstanding stock options 3,742,881 4,012,903\nShares underlying unvested restricted stock units 4,965,567 4,346,785\nShares underlying unvested market-based restricted stock units — 2,260,764\nShares underlying unvested performance-based restricted stock units 1,291,889 412,490\nShares available for issuance under the 2018 Incentive Award Plan 11,441,400 7,053,406\nShares available for issuance under the 2018 Employee Stock Purchase Plan 2,414,509 1,679,635\nShares available for issuance under the 2023 Employment Inducement Incentive Award Plan 4,126,868 4,949,988\nTotal 27,983,114 24,715,971\nEquity Offering\nIn May 2023, the Company completed a follow-on underwritten public offering, in which it issued and sold 14,375,000 shares of its common stock at a price of $28.00\nper share, and received net proceeds of $381.4 million after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and other offering costs of $21.1 million.

Stock-Based Compensation\n2023 Employment Inducement Incentive Award Plan\nIn August 2023, the Company’s Board of Directors adopted the 2023 Employment Inducement Incentive Award Plan, or the 2023 Plan, under which the Company may\nexclusively grant awards to its new employees as an inducement material to the employee’s entry into employment with the Company. The 2023 Plan was approved by\nthe Company's Board of Directors without stockholder approval in accordance with Rule 5635(c)(4) of the Nasdaq Listing Rules.\n26\nTable of Contents\nStock Option Activity\nA summary of the Company’s stock option activity under the 2012 Plan, the 2018 Plan and the 2023 Plan, and related information is as follows:\nOptions Outstanding\nWeighted-Average\nRemaining\nShares Shares Subject to Weighted-Average Contractual Life Aggregate Intrinsic\nAvailable for Grant Options Outstanding Exercise Price (Years) Value\n(unaudited)\n(in thousands)\nBalance as of January 1, 2024 12,003,394 4,012,903 $ 31.76 6.6 $ 39,115\n2018 Plan annual increase(1) 3,689,000 —\nGranted (478,263) 478,263 23.96\nExercised — (581,495) 4.47\nCanceled 166,790 (166,790) 50.77\nRestricted stock units granted (1,874,273) — —\nRestricted stock units canceled 682,506 — —\nMarket-based restricted stock units canceled 2,260,764 — —\nPerformance-based restricted stock units\ngranted (870,268) — —\nPerformance-based restricted stock units\nadjusted for performance achievement (48,234) — —\nPerformance-based restricted stock units\ncanceled 36,852 — —\nBalance as of September 30, 2024 15,568,268 3,742,881 $ 34.15 6.7 $ 21,302\nVested and Exercisable as of September 30, 2024 2,178,301 $ 33.96 5.1 $ 20,696\n(1) Effective as of January 1, 2024, an additional 3,689,000 shares of common stock became available for issuance under the 2018 Plan, as a result of the operation of an automatic annual increase provision\ntherein.\nAggregate intrinsic value represents the difference between the estimated fair value of the underlying common stock and the exercise price of outstanding, in-the-\nmoney options. The total intrinsic value of the options exercised was $0.1 million and $0.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023,\nrespectively, and $9.1 million and $0.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023, respectively.\nThe weighted-average grant date fair value of options granted was $19.42 and $24.42 per share for the three months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023,\nrespectively, and $15.35 and $22.39 per share for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023, respectively.\nFuture stock-based compensation for unvested options as of September 30, 2024 was $29.3 million, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average\nperiod of 1.9 years.\n27\nTable of Contents\nRestricted Stock Units\nA summary of the Company’s restricted stock unit activity excluding the performance-based and market-based restricted stock units under the 2018 Plan and the 2023\nPlan, and related information is as follows:\nRestricted Stock Units Weighted-Average Grant\nOutstanding Date Fair Value\n(unaudited)\nBalance as of January 1, 2024 4,346,785 $ 42.63\nGranted 1,874,273 21.31\nVested and released (572,985) 53.74\nCanceled (682,506) 46.73\nBalance as of September 30, 2024 4,965,567 $ 32.74\nFuture stock-based compensation for unvested restricted stock units as of September 30, 2024 was $119.1 million, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted-\naverage period of 2.0 years.\nPerformance-based Restricted Stock Units\nSince November 2020, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors started to approve, and the Company started to grant performance-based restricted\nstock units, or PSUs, to its employees and non-employees. The PSUs granted consist of financial and/or operational metrics to be met over a performance period of\napproximately 0.6 to 4 years and an additional service period requirement of up to 2 years after the performance metrics are met. In addition, granted units might be\nadjusted when certain performance metrics are met. The PSUs are expected to be expensed over a period of approximately 0.6 to 4.5 years subject to meeting the\nrespective performance metrics and service requirements.\nIn November 2020 and May 2021, and as part of these PSU programs, the Company granted PSUs consisting of a performance period of 4 years combined with an\nadditional service period requirement of six months should the vesting criteria be met, with a grant date fair value of $113.40 per share and $148.19 per share,\nrespectively. Before the third quarter of 2024, no compensation expense for these PSUs had been recorded since the achievement of the performance metrics did not\nmeet the criteria for accrual. In the third quarter of 2024, the performance metrics of these PSUs were considered to be achieved; as such the Company recorded a\ncumulative charge of $23.5 million in stock-based compensation expense related to these PSUs, based on 221,347 shares granted with fair values of $113.40 per share\nand $148.19 per share.\nA summary of the Company’s PSU activity under the 2018 Plan and related information is as follows:\nPerformance-based\nRestricted Stock Units Weighted-Average Grant\nOutstanding Date Fair Value\n(unaudited)\nBalance as of January 1, 2024 412,490 $ 91.25\nGranted 870,268 18.09\nVested and released (2,251) 32.86\nAdjusted for performance achievement 48,234 32.84\nCanceled (36,852) 76.65\nBalance as of September 30, 2024 1,291,889 $ 40.30\nStock-based compensation recorded for the PSUs was $22.7 million and $0.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023, respectively, and\n$26.3 million and $1.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023, respectively. Future stock-based compensation for unvested PSUs that are\nprobable to vest as of September 30, 2024 was $13.9 million, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 1.9 years.\n28\nTable of Contents\nMarket-based Restricted Stock Units\nIn May 2020, the Board of Directors approved and granted 1,695,574 market-based restricted stock units, or MSUs, under the 2018 Plan to each of the Company's Co-\nChief Executive Officers, which is subject to the achievement of market-based share price goals established by the Board of Directors. The MSUs consist of three\nseparate tranches and the vesting of each tranche is subject to the Company's common stock closing price being maintained at or above a predetermined share price\ngoal for a period of 30 consecutive calendar days. The grant date fair values of the MSUs were determined using a Monte Carlo valuation model for each tranche. The\nrelated stock-based compensation expense for each tranche was recognized based on an accelerated attribution method over the estimated derived service period,\nwhich was the median duration of the successful stock price paths to meet the price goal for each tranche as simulated in the Monte Carlo valuation model.\nOn January 1, 2021, Tranche 1 of the MSUs became vested because it had met both service requirement and market-based performance metrics. All three tranches of\nthe MSUs were fully expensed as of June 30, 2022. As of December 31, 2023, 2,260,764 shares of the MSUs, with a weighted-average grant date fair value of $65.20\nper share, were outstanding under the 2018 Plan. In March 2024, the Board of Directors approved to cancel the unvested MSUs and concurrently approved to grant\nnew awards to the Co-Chief Executive Officers, which was accounted for as a modification, however no stock-based compensation expense was reversed as the\nCompany's Co-Chief Executive Officers had fulfilled the service requirement.\nStock-Based Compensation Expense\nThe following table presents the effect of employee and non-employee related stock-based compensation expense:\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\n(unaudited)\n(in thousands)\nCost of precision oncology testing $ 1,484 $ 1,092 $ 4,020 $ 3,470\nCost of development services and other 2,410 436 3,400 1,387\nResearch and development expense 18,643 8,491 38,413 25,390\nSales and marketing expense 13,215 5,061 27,633 18,387\nGeneral and administrative expense 14,017 6,739 30,579 17,805\nTotal stock-based compensation expense $ 49,769 $ 21,819 $ 104,045 $ 66,439\nValuation of Stock Options\nThe grant date fair value of stock options was estimated using a Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the following weighted-average assumptions:\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\n(unaudited)\nExpected term (in years) 5.81 - 6.09 5.97 5.50 - 6.09 5.50 – 6.10\nExpected volatility 68.7% - 69.2% 69.4% 67.8% - 69.4% 69.4% –70.5%\nRisk-free interest rate 3.8% - 4.1% 4.2% 3.8% - 4.5% 3.4% – 4.2%\nExpected dividend yield —% —% —% —%\nThe determination of the fair value of stock options on the date of grant using a Black-Scholes option-pricing model is affected by the estimated fair value of common\nstock of the Company, as well as assumptions regarding a number of variables that are complex, subjective and generally require significant judgment to determine.\nThe valuation assumptions were determined as follows:\nFair Value of Common Stock\nThe fair value of the Company’s common stock is determined by the closing price, on the date of grant, of its common stock, which is traded on the Nasdaq Global\nSelect Market.\n29\nTable of Contents\nExpected Term\nThe expected term represents the period that the options granted are expected to be outstanding and is determined using the simplified method (based on the mid-point\nbetween the vesting date and the end of the contractual term) as the Company has concluded that its stock option exercise history does not provide a reasonable basis\nupon which to estimate expected term.\nExpected Volatility\nPrior to the commencement of trading of the Company’s common stock on the Nasdaq Global Select Market on October 4, 2018 in connection with its IPO, there was\nno active trading market for the Company's common stock. Due to limited historical data for the trading of the Company’s common stock, expected volatility is\nestimated based on the average volatility for comparable publicly traded peer group companies in the same industry plus the Company's expected volatility for the\navailable periods. The comparable companies are chosen based on their similar size, stage in the life cycle or area of specialty.\nRisk-Free Interest Rate\nThe risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury rate, with maturities similar to the expected term of the stock options.\nExpected Dividend Yield\nThe Company does not anticipate paying any dividends in the foreseeable future and, therefore, uses an expected dividend yield of zero.\n2018 Employee Stock Purchase Plan\nIn September 2018, the Company’s Board of Directors adopted and its stockholders approved the 2018 Employee Stock Purchase Plan, or the ESPP. A total of 922,250\nshares of common stock were initially reserved for issuance under the ESPP. Effective as of January 1, 2020, March 2, 2023 and February 23, 2024, an additional\n942,614, 1,026,194 and 1,106,700 shares of common stock became available for issuance under the ESPP.\nSubject to any plan limitations, the ESPP allows eligible employees to contribute, normally through payroll deductions, up to 10% of their earnings for the purchase of\nthe Company’s common stock at a discounted price per share. The price at which common stock is purchased under the ESPP is equal to 85% of the fair market value\nof the Company’s common stock on the first or last day of the offering period, whichever is lower. The ESPP provides for separate six-month offering periods\nbeginning on May 15 and November 15 of each year.\nShares of common stock purchased under the ESPP were nil for the three months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023, respectively, and 371,826 and 298,781 for the\nnine months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023, respectively.\nThe grant date fair value of the stock purchase right granted under the ESPP was estimated on the first day of each offering period using the Black-Scholes option\npricing model. The valuation assumptions used were substantially consistent with the assumption used to value stock options with the exception of the expected term\nwhich was based on the term of each purchase period.\nNo stock purchase rights were granted under the ESPP for the three months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023. The grant date fair value of the stock purchase rights\ngranted under the ESPP for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023 was estimated using a Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the following\nassumptions:\nNine Months Ended September 30,\n2024 2023\n(unaudited)\nExpected term (in years) 0.50 0.50\nExpected volatility 64.2% 76.6%\nRisk-free interest rate 5.4% 5.2%\nExpected dividend yield —% —%\n30\nTable of Contents\nThe total compensation expense related to the ESPP was $0.9 million and $0.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023, respectively, and\n$3.4 million and $3.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023, respectively. As of September 30, 2024, the unrecognized stock-based\ncompensation expense related to the ESPP was $0.5 million, which is expected to be recognized over the remaining term of the offering period of 0.1 years.\n11. Net Loss Per Share\nThe following table sets forth the computation of the basic and diluted net loss per share:\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\n(unaudited)\n(in thousands, except per share data)\nNet loss, basic and diluted $ (107,754) $ (86,102) $ (325,367) $ (292,406)\nNet loss per share, basic and diluted $ (0.88) $ (0.73) $ (2.66) $ (2.66)\nWeighted-average shares used in computing net loss per share, basic and\ndiluted 123,051 117,736 122,406 109,791\nSince the Company was in a loss position for all periods presented, basic net loss per share is the same as diluted net loss per share, as the inclusion of all potential\nshares of common stock outstanding would have been anti-dilutive. The following weighted-average common stock equivalents were excluded from the calculation of\ndiluted net loss per share for the periods presented as they had an anti-dilutive effect:\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\n(unaudited)\n(in thousands)\nStock options 3,753 3,662 3,892 3,485\nRestricted stock units 5,104 3,219 4,938 3,382\nMSUs — 2,261 646 2,261\nPSUs 1,292 438 1,071 379\nESPP obligation 197 132 228 191\nConvertible senior notes 8,225 8,225 8,225 8,225\nTotal 18,571 17,937 19,000 17,923\n12. Income Taxes\nThe income tax expense for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 was determined based upon estimates of the Company’s effective income tax rates in\nvarious jurisdictions. The difference between the Company’s effective income tax rate and the U.S. federal statutory rate is primarily attributable to state income taxes,\nforeign income taxes, the effect of certain permanent differences, and full valuation allowance against domestic net deferred tax assets.\nThe income tax expense for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023, relates primarily to state minimum income tax and income tax on the\nCompany’s earnings in foreign jurisdictions.\n13. Segment and Geographic Information\nThe Company operates as one operating segment. The Company's chief operating decision makers are its Co-Chief Executive Officers, who review financial\ninformation presented on a consolidated basis for the purposes of making operating decisions, assessing financial performance and allocating resources.\n31\nTable of Contents\nThe following table sets forth the Company’s revenue by geographic areas based on the customers’ locations:\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\n(unaudited)\n(in thousands)\nUnited States $ 180,105 $ 135,735 $ 505,568 $ 383,908\nInternational 11,371 7,295 31,634 24,986\nTotal revenue $ 191,476 $ 143,030 $ 537,202 $ 408,894\nAs of September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, 99% and 98%, respectively, of the Company’s long-lived assets and right-of-use assets are located in the United\nStates.\n32\nTable of Contents\nItem 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nYou should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with the unaudited condensed consolidated\nfinancial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. This discussion and other parts of this Quarterly Report on Form\n10-Q contain forward-looking statements that involve risk and uncertainties, such as statements of our plans, objectives, beliefs, expectations and intentions. Our\nactual results could differ materially from those discussed in these forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include, but\nare not limited to, those discussed in Part I, Item 1A, “Risk Factors,” of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 and in Part II, Item\n1A, “Risk Factors” of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.\nOverview\nWe are a leading precision oncology company focused on guarding wellness and giving every person more time free from cancer. We are transforming patient care by\nproviding critical insights into what drives disease through our advanced blood and tissue tests, and real-world data. Our tests help improve outcomes across all stages\nof care, including screening to find cancer early, monitoring for recurrence in early-stage cancer, and helping doctors select the best treatment for patients with\nadvanced cancer. For patients with advanced-stage cancer, we have commercially launched Guardant360 laboratory developed test, or LDT, and Guardant360 CDx,\nthe first comprehensive liquid biopsy test approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or the FDA, to provide tumor mutation profiling with solid tumors and\nto be used as a companion diagnostic in connection with non-small cell lung cancer, or NSCLC, and breast cancer. We have also launched the Guardant360 TissueNext\ntissue test for advanced-stage cancer, Guardant Reveal blood test to detect residual and recurring disease in early-stage colorectal, breast and lung cancer patients, and\nGuardant360 Response blood test to predict patient response to immunotherapy or targeted therapy eight weeks earlier than current standard-of-care imaging.\nWe also collaborate with biopharmaceutical companies in clinical studies by providing the above-mentioned tests, as well as the GuardantOMNI blood test for\nadvanced-stage cancer, and the GuardantINFINITY blood test, a next-generation smart liquid biopsy that provides new, multi-dimensional insights into the\ncomplexities of tumor molecular profiles and immune response to advance cancer research and therapy development. Using data collected from our tests, we have also\ndeveloped our GuardantINFORM platform to help biopharmaceutical companies accelerate precision oncology drug development through the use of this in-silico\nresearch platform to unlock further insights into tumor evolution and treatment resistance across various biomarker-driven cancers.\nFor early cancer detection, in May 2022, we launched the Shield LDT test to address the needs of individuals eligible for colorectal cancer screening. From a simple\nblood draw, Shield uses a novel multimodal approach to detect colorectal cancer signals in the bloodstream, including DNA that is shed by tumors. In December 2022,\nwe announced that the ECLIPSE study, a registrational study evaluating the performance of our Shield blood test for detecting colorectal cancer in average-risk adults,\nmet co-primary endpoints. In addition, in March 2023, we submitted a premarket approval application, or PMA, for our Shield blood test to the FDA. In July 2024, we\nreceived FDA approval of our Shield blood test for colorectal cancer screening in adults age 45 and older who are at average risk for the disease, and in August 2024,\nour Shield blood test became commercially available in the U.S. as the first blood test approved by the FDA for primary colorectal cancer screening, meaning\nhealthcare providers can offer Shield in a manner similar to all other non-invasive methods recommended in screening guidelines. Shield is also the first blood test for\ncolorectal cancer screening that meets coverage requirements by Medicare. We also expect to expand into lung and multi-cancer screening with our investigational,\nnext-generation Shield assay.\nWe currently perform clinical, research use only, and investigation use only tests in our laboratory located in Redwood City, California. Our Redwood City laboratory\nis certified pursuant to the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of 1988, or CLIA, accredited by the College of American Pathologists, or CAP, permitted\nby the New York State Department of Health, or NYSDOH, and licensed in California and four other states. We also perform research use only tests in our laboratory\nlocated in San Diego, California. In addition, our Redwood City, San Diego and Palo Alto, California laboratories are currently operated as centers for our research and\ntechnology development.\n33\nTable of Contents\nWe generated total revenue of $191.5 million and $143.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023, respectively, and $537.2 million and\n$408.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023, respectively. We also incurred net losses of $107.8 million and $86.1 million for the three\nmonths ended September 30, 2024, and 2023, respectively, and $325.4 million and $292.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023,\nrespectively. We have funded our operations to date principally from the sale of our stock, convertible senior notes, and revenue from our precision oncology testing\nand development services and other. In May 2023, we completed a follow-on underwritten public offering, in which we issued and sold 14,375,000 shares of our\ncommon stock at a price of $28.00 per share and received net proceeds of $381.4 million after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and other offering\ncosts of $21.1 million. In December 2023, we completed a registered direct offering with an investment management firm, in which we issued and sold 3,387,446\nshares of our common stock at a price of $26.77 per share, and received net proceeds of $90.6 million. As of September 30, 2024, we had cash, cash equivalents,\nrestricted cash and marketable debt securities of approximately $1.0 billion.\nFactors affecting our performance\nWe believe there are several important factors that have impacted and that we expect will impact our operating performance and results of operations, including:\n• Testing volume, pricing and customer mix. Our revenue and costs are affected by the volume of testing and mix of customers from period to period. We evaluate\nboth the volume of tests that we perform for patients on behalf of clinicians and the number of tests we perform for biopharmaceutical companies. Our\nperformance depends on our ability to retain and broaden adoption with existing customers, as well as attract new customers. We believe that the test volume we\nreceive from clinicians and biopharmaceutical companies are indicators of growth in each of these customer verticals. Customer mix for our tests has the potential\nto significantly affect our results of operations, as the average selling price for biopharmaceutical sample testing is currently higher than our average\nreimbursement for clinical tests because we are not a contracted provider for, or our tests are not covered by clinical patients’ insurance for, the majority of the\ntests that we perform for patients on behalf of clinicians. Precision oncology revenue from clinical tests for patients covered by Medicare represented\napproximately 38% and 45% of our precision oncology revenue from clinical customers for the three months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023, respectively,\nand approximately 40% and 44% of our precision oncology revenue from clinical customers for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023,\nrespectively.\n• Payer coverage and reimbursement. Our revenue depends on achieving broad coverage and reimbursement for our tests from third-party payers, including both\ncommercial and government payers. Precision oncology revenue from tests for clinical customers is calculated based on our expected cash collections, using the\nestimated variable consideration. The variable consideration is estimated based on historical collection patterns as well as the potential for changes in future\nreimbursement behavior by one or more payers. Estimation of the impact of the potential for changes in reimbursement requires significant judgment and\nconsiders payers' past patterns of changes in reimbursement as well as any stated plans to implement changes. Any cash collections over the expected\nreimbursement period exceeding the estimated variable consideration are recorded in future periods based on actual cash received. Payment from commercial\npayers can vary depending on whether we have entered into a contract with the payers as a “participating provider” or do not have a contract and are considered a\n“non-participating provider”. Payers often reimburse non-participating providers, if at all, at a lower amount than participating providers. Because we are not\ncontracted with these payers, they determine the amount that they are willing to reimburse us for any of our tests and they can prospectively and retrospectively\nadjust the amount of reimbursement, adding to the complexity in estimating the variable consideration. When we contract with a payer to serve as a participating\nprovider, reimbursements by the payer are generally made pursuant to a negotiated fee schedule and are limited to only covered indications or where prior\napproval has been obtained. Becoming a participating provider can result in higher reimbursement amounts for covered uses of our tests and, potentially, no\nreimbursement for non-covered uses identified under the payer’s policies or the contract. As a result, the potential for more favorable reimbursement associated\nwith becoming a participating provider may be offset by a potential loss of reimbursement for non-covered uses of our tests. Current Procedural Terminology, or\nCPT, coding plays a significant role in how our tests are reimbursed both from commercial and governmental payers. In addition, Z-Code Identifiers are used by\ncertain payers, including under Medicare's Molecular Diagnostic Services Program, or MolDx, to supplement CPT codes for our molecular diagnostics tests.\nChanges to the codes used to report to payers may result in significant changes in its reimbursement. If their policies were to change in the future to cover\nadditional cancer indications, we anticipate that our total reimbursement would increase. In January 2021, a proprietary laboratory analyses, or PLA code was\nissued for our Guardant360 CDx with an effective date in April 2021. Additionally, based on this new PLA code, we applied to the Centers for Medicare and\nMedicaid Services, or CMS, for our Guardant360\n34\nTable of Contents\nCDx test to become an advanced diagnostic laboratory test, or ADLT. In March 2021, CMS approved ADLT status to the Guardant360 CDx test, based on which\nMedicare paid us at the lowest available commercial rate per test, from April 1, 2021 to December 31, 2021. Effective January 1, 2022, Medicare started to\nreimburse Guardant360 CDx services at the median rate of claims paid by commercial payers. In March 2022, Palmetto GBA, the Medicare administrative\ncontractor for MolDX, conveyed coverage for our Guardant360 TissueNext test under the existing local coverage determination. The policy covers our\nGuardant360 TissueNext test for Medicare fee-for-service patients with advanced solid tumor cancers. In July 2022, Palmetto GBA conveyed coverage for our\nGuardant Reveal test for fee-for-service Medicare patients in the United States with stage II or III colorectal cancer whose testing is initiated within three months\nfollowing curative intent therapy, with an effective date of December 2021. In April 2023, Palmetto GBA conveyed coverage for our Guardant360 Response test\nfor fee-for-service Medicare patients in the U.S. with metastatic or inoperable solid tumors who are on an immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy, tested four to ten\nweeks from therapy initiation. Effective January 1, 2024, Medicare has increased the reimbursement rate for our Guardant360 LDT test to the same rate as our\nGuardant360 CDx test.\nIn August 2024, following the FDA approval, our Shield blood test met the coverage requirements by Medicare based on the criteria established in its National\nCoverage Determination for blood-based colorectal cancer screening tests. The test is covered once every three years for eligible Medicare beneficiaries.\nDue to the inherent variability and unpredictability of the reimbursement landscape, including related to the amount that payers reimburse us for any of our tests,\nwe estimate the amount of revenue to be recognized at the time a test is provided and record revenue adjustments if and when the cash subsequently received\ndiffers from the revenue recorded. Due to this variability and unpredictability, previously recorded revenue adjustments are not indicative of future revenue\nadjustments from actual cash collections, which may fluctuate significantly. Additionally, if coding changes were to occur, payments for certain uses of our tests\ncould be reduced, put on hold, or eliminated. This variability and unpredictability could increase the risk of future revenue reversal and result in our failing to\nmeet any previously publicly stated guidance we may provide.\n• Biopharmaceutical customers. Our revenue also depends on our ability to attract, maintain and expand relationships with biopharmaceutical customers. As we\ncontinue to develop these relationships, we expect to support a growing number of clinical studies globally and continue to have opportunities to offer our\nplatform to such customers for development services, including companion diagnostic development, novel target discovery and validation, as well as clinical\nstudy enrollment. For example, our tests are being developed as companion diagnostics under collaborations with biopharmaceutical companies.\n35\nTable of Contents\n• Research and development. A significant aspect of our business is our investment in research and development, including the development of new products. In\nparticular, we have invested heavily in clinical studies as we believe these studies are critical to gaining physician adoption and driving favorable coverage\ndecisions by payers. With respect to Guardant Reveal, in October 2021, we initiated a 1,000-patient prospective, observational, multi-center study, which we refer\nto as the ORACLE study, designed to evaluate the performance of our Guardant Reveal liquid biopsy test to predict cancer recurrence after curative intent\ntreatment, across 11 solid tumor types. In addition, with respect to Guardant Reveal, in December 2022, we entered into a partnership with Susan G. Komen®, the\nworld’s leading breast cancer organization, to bring the patient perspective to the development of clinical studies that help identify early-stage breast cancer\npatients who are at high risk of disease recurrence and may benefit from additional monitoring or therapy. With respect to Shield, in December 2022, we\nannounced that the ECLIPSE study, a registrational study evaluating the performance of our Shield blood test for detecting colorectal cancer in average-risk\nadults, met co-primary endpoints. The test demonstrated 83% sensitivity in detecting individuals with colorectal cancer. Specificity was 90% in both individuals\nwithout advanced neoplasia and in those who had a negative colonoscopy result. These results exceed the performance criteria set forth by the CMS for\nreimbursement. This test also demonstrated 13% sensitivity in detecting advanced adenomas. Based on these study results, in March 2023, we submitted a PMA to\nthe FDA for our Shield blood test. In July 2024, we received FDA approval of our Shield blood test for colorectal cancer screening in adults age 45 and older who\nare at average risk for the disease, and in August 2024, our Shield blood test became commercially available in the U.S. as the first blood test approved by the\nFDA for primary colorectal cancer screening, meaning healthcare providers can offer Shield in a manner similar to all other non-invasive methods recommended\nin screening guidelines. Shield is also the first blood test for colorectal cancer screening that meets coverage requirements by Medicare. In addition, to evaluate\nthe performance of our investigational, next-generation Shield assay in detecting lung cancer in high-risk individuals ages 50-80, in January 2022, we initiated a\nnearly 10,000-patient prospective, registrational study, which we refer to as the SHIELD LUNG study. We have expended considerable resources, and expect to\nincrease such expenditures over the next few years, to support our research and development programs with the goal of fueling further innovation.\n• International expansion. A component of our long-term growth strategy is to expand our commercial footprint internationally, and we expect to increase our sales\nand marketing expense to execute on this strategy. We currently offer our tests in countries outside the United States primarily through distributor relationships,\ndirect contracts with hospitals, and partnerships with local research organizations and laboratory companies.\nIn May 2018, we formed and capitalized Guardant Health AMEA, Inc., with SoftBank, relating to the sale, marketing and distribution of our tests generally\noutside the Americas and Europe, and to accelerate commercialization of our products in Asia, the Middle East and Africa. In June 2022, we purchased all of the\nshares held by SoftBank and its affiliates, and upon completion of the transaction, we obtained full control over operations of Guardant Health AMEA, Inc. In July\n2023, Japan's Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare granted national reimbursement approval for our Guardant360 CDx test for patients with advanced or\nmetastatic solid tumor cancers in Japan.\nIn December 2020, we signed our first public private partnership agreement with Vall D'Hebron Institute of Oncology, or VHIO, one of Europe’s leading cancer\nresearch institutions, and in May 2022, the first blood-based cancer testing services in Europe based on our digital sequencing platform became available at the\nVHIO testing facility in Spain. In October 2021, we signed a partnership agreement with The Royal Marsden NHS Foundation Trust, or Royal Marsden, a premier\ncancer center within the United Kingdom, or the UK, for patient care, research and teaching of all types of cancer, and in April 2023, the blood-based cancer\ntesting services based on our digital sequencing platform became available at Royal Marsden testing facility in the UK. In September 2024, we signed a\npartnership agreement with the Agostino Gemelli University Polyclinic Foundation IRCCS, one of Italy’s largest and most renowned hospitals known for its\nadvanced oncology services, including diagnostics, treatment, and research, to establish an in-house liquid biopsy testing service within its hospital system.\nIn June 2022, we signed a strategic partnership agreement with Adicon Holdings Limited, or Adicon, a leading independent clinical laboratory company based in\nChina, and in December 2023, the blood-based cancer testing services based on our digital sequencing platform became available at Adicon's testing facility,\nwhich offers our industry-leading comprehensive genomic profiling tests to biopharmaceutical companies to advance clinical research and the development of\nnew cancer therapies in China.\n36\nTable of Contents\nThe success of our international expansion strategy depends on a number of factors, including the internal and external constraints placed on our international\nlaboratory partners and biopharmaceutical companies in the context of broader global, regional and U.S. economic and geopolitical conditions. For example,\ndeterioration in the bilateral relationship between the United States and China may impact international trade, government spending, regional stability and\nmacroeconomic conditions. The impact of these potential developments, including any resulting sanctions, export controls or other restrictive actions that may be\nimposed against governmental or other entities in, for example, China, may contribute to disruption of our international partnerships and instability and volatility\nin the global markets, which in turn could adversely impact our operations and weaken our financial results.\n• Sales and marketing expense. Our financial results have historically, and will likely continue to, fluctuate significantly based upon the impact of our sales and\nmarketing expense, increase in headcount, and in particular, our various marketing programs around existing and new product introductions.\n• General and administrative expense. Our financial results have historically, and will likely continue to, fluctuate significantly based upon the impact of our\ngeneral and administrative expense, and in particular, our stock-based compensation expense. Our equity awards, including performance-based restricted stock\nunits, are intended to retain and incentivize employees to lead us to sustained, long-term superior financial and operational performance.\nWhile each of these areas presents significant opportunities for us, they also pose significant risks and challenges that we must address. See Part I, Item 1A, “Risk\nFactors” of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, and Part II, Item 1A, “Risk Factors” of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q,\nfor more information.\nComponents of results of operations\nRevenue\nWe derive our revenue from two sources: (i) precision oncology testing, and (ii) development services and other.\nPrecision oncology testing. Precision oncology testing revenue is generated from sales of our tests to clinical and biopharmaceutical customers, including those tests\ndelivered by labs operated by our strategic partners. In the United States, through September 30, 2024, we generally performed tests as an out-of-network service\nprovider without contracts with health insurance companies. We submit claims for payment for tests performed for patients covered by U.S. private payers. We also\nsubmit claims to Medicare for reimbursement for our Guardant360 CDx, Guardant360 LDT, Guardant360 TissueNext, Guardant Reveal and Guardant360 Response\nclinical testing performed for qualifying patients. Precision oncology revenue from clinical tests for patients covered by Medicare represented approximately 38% and\n45% of our precision oncology revenue from clinical customers during the three months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023, respectively, and 40% and 44% of our\nprecision oncology revenue from clinical customers during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023, respectively.\nDevelopment services and other. Development services revenue primarily represents services that we provide to biopharmaceutical companies, large medical\ninstitutions and international laboratory partners. We collaborate with biopharmaceutical companies in the development and clinical studies of new drugs. As part of\nthese collaborations, we provide services related to regulatory filings to support companion diagnostic device submissions for our test panels. Under these\narrangements, we generate revenue from progression of our collaboration efforts, as well as from provision of on-going support. In addition to companion diagnostic\ndevelopment and regulatory approval services, we also provide other development services, including clinical study setup, monitoring and maintenance, testing\ndevelopment and support, GuardantConnect and GuardantINFORM. Other revenue includes amounts derived from licensing our technologies, kit fulfillment, and\ndelivery of our Shield screening tests.\n37\nTable of Contents\nCosts and operating expenses\nCost of precision oncology testing. Cost of precision oncology testing generally consists of cost of materials, including inventory write-downs; cost of labor, including\nemployee benefits, bonus, and stock-based compensation; equipment and infrastructure expenses associated with processing test samples, such as sample accessioning,\nlibrary preparation, sequencing, and quality control analyses; freight; curation of test results for physicians; phlebotomy; and license fees due to third parties.\nInfrastructure expenses include depreciation of laboratory equipment, rent costs, depreciation of leasehold improvements and information technology costs. Costs\nassociated with performing our tests are recorded as the tests are performed regardless of whether revenue was recognized with respect to the tests. While we do not\nbelieve the technologies underlying the third-party licenses are necessary to permit us to provide our tests, we do believe these technologies are potentially valuable\nand of possible strategic importance to us or our competitors.\nWe expect the cost of precision oncology testing to generally increase in line with the increase in the number of tests we perform, but we expect the cost per test to\ndecrease modestly over time due to the efficiencies we may gain as test volume increases, and from automation and other cost reductions.\nCost of development services and other. Cost of development services and other primarily includes costs incurred for the performance of development services\nrequested by our biopharmaceutical customers, and costs associated with our partnership agreements and delivery of Shield screening tests, which comprise of labor\nand material costs including any inventory write-downs. For development of new products, costs incurred before technological feasibility has been achieved are\nreported as research and development expenses, while costs incurred thereafter are reported as cost of revenue. Cost of development services and other will vary\ndepending on the nature, timing and scope of customer projects.\nResearch and development expense. Research and development expenses consist of costs incurred to develop technology and include salaries and benefits including\nstock-based compensation, reagents and supplies used in research and development laboratory work, infrastructure expenses, including facility occupancy and\ninformation technology costs, contract services, other outside costs and costs to develop our technology capabilities. Research and development expenses also include\ncosts related to activities performed under contracts with biopharmaceutical companies before technological feasibility has been achieved. Research and development\ncosts are expensed as incurred. Payments made prior to the receipt of goods or services to be used in research and development are deferred and recognized as expense\nin the period in which the related goods are received or services are rendered. Costs to develop our technology capabilities are recorded as research and development\nunless they meet the criteria to be capitalized as internal-use software costs. We expect that our research and development expenses will continue to increase in\nabsolute dollars as we continue to innovate and develop additional products, expand our genomic and medical data management resources and conduct our ongoing\nand new clinical studies.\nSales and marketing expense. Our sales and marketing expenses are expensed as incurred and include costs associated with our sales organization, including our direct\nsales force and sales management, client services, marketing and reimbursement, medical affairs, as well as business development personnel who are focused on our\nbiopharmaceutical customers. These expenses consist primarily of salaries, commissions, bonuses, employee benefits, travel expenses and stock-based compensation,\nas well as marketing, sales incentives, and educational activities and overhead expenses. We expect our sales and marketing expenses to increase in absolute dollars as\nwe expand our sales force, increase our presence within and outside of the United States, and increase our marketing activities to drive further awareness and adoption\nof our tests.\nGeneral and administrative expense. Our general and administrative expenses include costs for our executive, accounting and finance, information technology, legal\nand human resources functions. These expenses consist principally of salaries, bonuses, employee benefits, travel expenses and stock-based compensation, as well as\nprofessional services fees such as consulting, audit, tax and legal fees, and general corporate costs and overhead expenses. In addition, our general and administrative\nexpenses also include severance costs related to workforce reduction. We expect that our general and administrative expenses will continue to increase as we incur\nadditional costs to support the growth of our business. These expenses, though expected to increase in absolute dollars, are expected to decrease modestly as a\npercentage of revenue in the long term, though they may fluctuate as a percentage of revenue from period to period due to the timing and extent of these expenses\nbeing incurred.\nInterest income\nInterest income consists of interest earned on our cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and marketable debt securities.\n38\nTable of Contents\nInterest expense\nInterest expense consists primarily of charges relating to amortization of debt issuance costs.\nOther income (expense), net\nOther income (expense), net consists of foreign currency exchange gains and losses, unrealized and realized gains and losses of marketable equity securities, and\nimpairment of non-marketable equity securities and other related assets. We expect our foreign currency gains and losses to continue to fluctuate in the future due to\nchanges in foreign currency exchange rates.\nResults of operations\nThe following tables set forth the significant components of our results of operations for the periods presented.\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\n(unaudited)\n(in thousands)\nRevenue:\nPrecision oncology testing $ 180,604 $ 133,423 $ 503,351 $ 372,060\nDevelopment services and other 10,872 9,607 33,851 36,834\nTotal revenue 191,476 143,030 537,202 408,894\nCosts and operating expenses:\nCost of precision oncology testing(1) 66,095 53,648 191,116 148,111\nCost of development services and other(1) 8,394 3,966 21,090 16,424\nResearch and development expense(1) 87,306 93,851 254,210 277,338\nSales and marketing expense(1) 97,880 68,934 260,172 216,100\nGeneral and administrative expense(1) 49,129 36,174 128,243 118,135\nTotal costs and operating expenses 308,804 256,573 854,831 776,108\nLoss from operations (117,328) (113,543) (317,629) (367,214)\nInterest income 13,257 11,690 42,038 21,477\nInterest expense (646) (644) (1,936) (1,933)\nOther income (expense), net (3,007) 16,885 (47,272) 56,490\nLoss before provision for income taxes (107,724) (85,612) (324,799) (291,180)\nProvision for income taxes 30 490 568 1,226\nNet loss $ (107,754) $ (86,102) $ (325,367) $ (292,406)\n(1) Amounts include stock-based compensation expense as follows:\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\n(unaudited)\n(in thousands)\nCost of precision oncology testing $ 1,484 $ 1,092 $ 4,020 $ 3,470\nCost of development services and other 2,410 436 3,400 1,387\nResearch and development expense 18,643 8,491 38,413 25,390\nSales and marketing expense 13,215 5,061 27,633 18,387\nGeneral and administrative expense 14,017 6,739 30,579 17,805\nTotal stock-based compensation expense $ 49,769 $ 21,819 $ 104,045 $ 66,439\nIn November 2020 and May 2021, we granted restricted stock units with certain performance metrics, or PSUs, consisting of a performance period of 4 years\ncombined with an additional service period requirement of six months\n39\nTable of Contents\nshould the vesting criteria be met, with a grant date fair value of $113.40 per share and $148.19 per share, respectively. Before the third quarter of 2024, no\ncompensation expense for these PSUs had been recorded since the achievement of the performance metrics did not meet the criteria for accrual. In the third quarter of\n2024, the performance metrics of these PSUs were considered to be achieved; as such we recorded a cumulative charge of $23.5 million in stock-based compensation\nexpense related to these PSUs, based on 221,347 shares granted with fair values of $113.40 per share and $148.19 per share, of which $2.2 million was recorded to\ncost of development services and other, and $11.1 million, $6.3 million and $3.9 million was recorded as components of research and development expense, sales and\nmarketing expense, and general and administrative expense, respectively.\nComparison of the Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023\nRevenue\nThree Months Ended September 30, Change\n2024 2023 $ %\n(unaudited)\n(in thousands)\nPrecision oncology testing $ 180,604 $ 133,423 $ 47,181 35 %\nDevelopment services and other 10,872 9,607 1,265 13 %\nTotal revenue $ 191,476 $ 143,030 $ 48,446 34 %\nTotal revenue was $191.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to $143.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, an\nincrease of $48.4 million, or 34%.\nPrecision oncology testing revenue increased to $180.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, from $133.4 million for the three months ended\nSeptember 30, 2023, an increase of $47.2 million, or 35%.\nPrecision oncology revenue from tests for clinical customers was $141.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, up 36% from $103.9 million for the\nthree months ended September 30, 2023.

This increase was primarily due to an increase of $12.8 million in stock-based compensation, including\n$3.9 million related to the PSUs discussed in the Results of operations section above, and an increase of $10.1 million in other personnel costs, partially offset by a\ndecrease of $7.5 million in severance costs related to a workforce reduction incurred in the first quarter of 2023, and a decrease of $7.1 million in legal expenses.\n44\nTable of Contents\nInterest income\nNine Months Ended September 30, Change\n2024 2023 $ %\n(unaudited)\n(in thousands)\nInterest income $ 42,038 $ 21,477 $ 20,561 96 %\nInterest income was $42.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to $21.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, an\nincrease of $20.6 million, primarily attributable to higher rates of return on our investments.\nInterest expense\nNine Months Ended September 30, Change\n2024 2023 $ %\n(unaudited)\n(in thousands)\nInterest expense $ (1,936) $ (1,933) $ (3) — %\nInterest expense was primarily attributable to the amortization of debt issuance costs related to our convertible senior notes issued in November 2020, for the nine\nmonths ended September 30, 2024, and 2023.\nOther income (expense), net\nNine Months Ended September 30, Change\n2024 2023 $ %\n(unaudited)\n(in thousands)\nOther income (expense), net $ (47,272) $ 56,490 $ (103,762) (184)%\nOther income (expense), net was a $47.3 million expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, primarily attributable to $47.2 million of net unrealized and\nrealized losses recorded for our marketable equity security investment in Lunit, Inc. during the period.

We\nexpect to incur additional operating losses in the near future and our operating expenses will increase as we continue to invest in clinical studies and develop new\nproducts, expand our sales organization, and increase our marketing efforts to drive market adoption of our tests. As demand for our tests are expected to continue to\nincrease from physicians and biopharmaceutical companies, we anticipate that our capital expenditure requirements could also increase if we require additional\nlaboratory capacity.\n45\nTable of Contents\nWe have funded our operations to date principally from the sale of stock, convertible debt and through revenue from precision oncology testing and development\nservices and other. As of September 30, 2024, we had cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and marketable debt securities of $1.0 billion. Cash in excess of\nimmediate requirements is invested in accordance with our investment policy, primarily with a view to provide liquidity while ensuring capital preservation.\nBased on our current business plan, we believe our current cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash and anticipated cash flows from operations, will be sufficient to\nmeet our anticipated cash requirements for more than 12 months from the date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. We may consider raising additional capital to\nexpand our business, to pursue strategic investments, to take advantage of financing opportunities or for other reasons. As revenue from precision oncology testing and\ndevelopment services and other is expected to grow long-term, we expect our accounts receivable and inventory balances to increase. Any increase in accounts\nreceivable and inventory may not be completely offset by increases in accounts payable and accrued liabilities, which could impact our working capital balances.\nIf our available cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash and anticipated cash flows from operations are insufficient to satisfy our liquidity requirements because of\nlower demand for our products as a result of lower than currently expected rates of reimbursement from our customers or other risks described in this Quarterly Report\non Form 10-Q and in our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, we may seek to sell additional common or preferred equity or convertible debt securities,\nenter into a credit facility or another form of third-party funding or seek other debt financing. The sale of equity and convertible debt securities may result in dilution to\nour stockholders and, in the case of preferred equity securities or convertible debt, those securities could provide for rights, preferences or privileges senior to those of\nour common stock. The terms of debt securities issued or borrowings pursuant to a credit agreement could impose significant restrictions on our operations. If we raise\nfunds through collaborations and licensing arrangements, we might be required to relinquish significant rights to our platform technologies or products or grant\nlicenses on terms that are not favorable to us. Additional capital may not be available to us on reasonable terms, or at all.\nAt-The-Market Offering Program\nIn August 2024, we entered into an Open Market Sales Agreement, or the Sales Agreement, with Jefferies LLC, or the Agent, with respect to an at-the-market offering\nprogram under which we may offer and sell, from time to time at our sole discretion, shares of our common stock, having aggregate gross proceeds of up to\n$400.0 million through the Agent, subject to the terms and conditions of the Sales Agreement. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, no shares of our\ncommon stock were sold under the Sales Agreement.\nCash flows\nThe following table summarizes our cash flows for the periods presented:\nNine Months Ended September 30,\n2024 2023\n(unaudited)\n(in thousands)\nNet cash used in operating activities $ (175,345) $ (246,247)\nNet cash (used in) provided by investing activities $ (271,838) $ 176,796\nNet cash provided by financing activities $ 1,939 $ 386,807\nOperating activities\nCash used in operating activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, was $175.3 million, which resulted from a net loss of $325.4 million, and cash\neffect of net change in our operating assets and liabilities of $58.0 million, partially offset by non-cash charges of $208.1 million. Non-cash charges primarily\nconsisted of $104.0 million of stock-based compensation, $47.2 million of net unrealized and realized losses on marketable equity security investment in Lunit, Inc.,\n$31.9 million of depreciation and amortization, and $23.4 million of operating lease costs. The cash effect of net change in our operating assets and liabilities was\nprimarily the result of a $27.0 million payment of operating lease liabilities net of receipt of tenant improvement allowance, a $19.8 million decrease in accounts\npayable and accrued liabilities, a $10.3 million increase in inventory, net, and a $9.2 million increase in prepaid expenses and other current assets, net, partially offset\nby a $9.6 million increase in deferred revenue.\n46\nTable of Contents\nCash used in operating activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was $246.2 million, which resulted from a net loss of $292.4 million, and cash\neffect of net change in our operating assets and liabilities of $10.3 million, partially offset by non-cash charges of $56.5 million. Non-cash charges primarily consisted\nof $66.4 million of stock-based compensation, $32.0 million of depreciation and amortization, $29.1 million of impairment of non-marketable equity securities and\nother related assets, and $22.1 million of operating lease costs, partially offset by $84.5 million of unrealized gains on marketable equity security investment in Lunit,\nInc, and $10.9 million of amortization of discount on marketable debt securities. The cash effect of net change in our operating assets and liabilities was primarily the\nresult of a $25.4 million increase in inventory, net, due to forecasted higher testing volumes, and a $22.7 million payment of operating lease liabilities net of receipt of\ntenant improvement allowance, partially offset by a $26.6 million increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities, primarily due to increased purchases of goods\nand services, a $8.4 million decrease in accounts receivable, net, and a $3.2 million increase in deferred revenue.\nInvesting activities\nCash used in investing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, was $271.8 million, which resulted primarily from purchases of marketable debt\nsecurities of $307.3 million, purchases of property and equipment of $16.2 million, and purchase of non-marketable equity securities of $2.5 million, partially offset\nby maturities of marketable debt securities of $35.0 million, and sales of marketable equity security investment in Lunit, Inc. of $19.2 million.\nCash provided by investing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2023, was $176.8 million, which resulted primarily from maturities of marketable\ndebt securities of $828.7 million, partially offset by purchases of marketable debt securities of $629.9 million, purchases of property and equipment of $16.4 million,\nand purchases of non-marketable equity securities and other related assets of $5.6 million.\nFinancing activities\nCash provided by financing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, was $1.9 million, which was primarily attributable to proceeds from\nissuances of common stock under our employee stock purchase plan of $7.2 million, and proceeds from exercise of stock options of $2.6 million, partially offset by\ntaxes paid related to net share settlement of restricted stock units of $7.7 million.\nCash provided by financing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2023, was $386.8 million, which was primarily attributable to gross proceeds from\nthe follow-on public offering of $402.5 million, and proceeds from issuances of common stock under our employee stock purchase plan of $6.7 million, partially offset\nby payment of offering costs related to the follow-on public offering of $20.5 million, and taxes paid related to net share settlement of restricted stock units of $8.1\nmillion.\nCritical accounting policies and estimates\nWe have prepared our consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, or GAAP. Our\npreparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates, assumptions and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities,\nexpenses and related disclosures at the date of the consolidated financial statements, as well as revenue and expenses recorded during the reporting periods. We\nevaluate our estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable\nunder the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from\nother sources. Actual results could therefore differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.\nOur significant accounting policies are described in more detail in Note 2 to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this\nQuarterly Report on Form 10-Q and in Item 7, “Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations”, in our Annual Report on\nForm 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, there were no material changes to our critical\naccounting policies from those discussed previously.\nRecent accounting pronouncements\nSee Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, to our condensed consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-\nQ for more information.\n47\nItem 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\nWe are exposed to market risk in the ordinary course of our business. Market risk represents the risk of loss that may impact our financial position due to adverse\nchanges in financial market prices and rates.\nInterest rate risk\nWe are exposed to market risk for changes in interest rates related primarily to our cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash, marketable debt securities and our\nindebtedness. As of September 30, 2024, we had cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and marketable debt securities of $1.0 billion held primarily in cash deposits,\nmoney market funds and U.S. government debt securities. Our primary exposure to market risk is interest income sensitivity, which is affected by changes in the\ngeneral level of the interest rates in the United States. As of September 30, 2024, a hypothetical 100 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates would have\nresulted in immaterial decline or increase of the fair value of our investments. This estimate is based on a sensitivity model that measures market value changes when\nchanges in interest rates occur.\nForeign currency risk\nThe majority of our revenue is generated in the United States. Through September 30, 2024, we have generated an insignificant amount of revenues denominated in\nforeign currencies. As we expand our presence in the international market, our results of operations and cash flows are expected to increasingly be subject to\nfluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates and may be adversely affected in the future due to changes in foreign exchange rates. As of\nSeptember 30, 2024, the effect of a hypothetical 10% change in foreign currency exchange rates would not be material to our financial condition or results of\noperations. To date, we have not entered into any hedging arrangements with respect to foreign currency risk. As our international operations grow, we will continue to\nreassess our approach to manage our risk relating to fluctuations in currency rates.\nItem 4. Controls and Procedures\nEvaluation of disclosure controls and procedures\nOur Co-Chief Executive Officers, or Co-CEOs, and our Chief Financial Officer, or CFO with the participation of other members of our management, have evaluated\nthe effectiveness of our “disclosure controls and procedures” (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as\namended, or Exchange Act) as of September 30, 2024, and our Co-CEOs and our CFO have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective based\non their evaluation of these controls and procedures as required by paragraph (b) of Exchange Act Rules 13a-15 or 15d-15.\nChanges in internal control\nThere was no change in our internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation required by Rule 13a-15(d) and 15d-15(d) of the\nExchange Act that occurred during the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect,\nour internal control over financial reporting.\n48\nTable of Contents\nLimitations on effectiveness of controls and procedures\nOur management, including our Co-CEOs and our CFO, believes that our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting are designed\nto provide reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives and are effective at the reasonable assurance level. However, our management does not expect that our\ndisclosure controls and procedures or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived\nand operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect\nthe fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control\nsystems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. These inherent limitations\ninclude the realities that judgments in decision making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of a simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be\ncircumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people or by management override of the controls. The design of any system of\ncontrols also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its\nstated goals under all potential future conditions; over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance with\npolicies or procedures may deteriorate. Because of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be\ndetected.\n49\nTable of Contents\nPART II—OTHER INFORMATION\nItem 1. Legal Proceedings\nThe information under the caption “Commitments and Contingencies – Legal Proceedings” in Note 8 to the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements\nincluded elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, concerning certain legal proceedings in which we are involved, is hereby incorporated by reference. The\nresolution of any such legal proceeding is subject to inherent uncertainty and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, cash flows or results of\noperations.\nItem 1A. Risk Factors\nOur business, financial condition and operating results are affected by a number of factors, whether currently known or unknown, including risks specific to us or the\nhealthcare industry as well as risks that affect businesses in general. In addition to the information set forth in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, you should\nconsider carefully the factors discussed in Part I, Item 1A, “Risk Factors” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, filed with\nthe SEC on February 22, 2024. The risks and uncertainties disclosed in such Annual Report and in this Quarterly Report could materially adversely affect our business,\nfinancial condition, cash flows or results of operations and thus our stock price. During the third quarter of fiscal 2024, there were no material changes to our\npreviously disclosed risk factors.\nThese risk factors may be important to understanding other statements in this Quarterly Report and should be read in conjunction with the unaudited condensed\nconsolidated financial statements and related notes in Part I, Item 1, “Financial Statements” and Part I, Item 2, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial\nCondition and Results of Operations” of this Quarterly Report. Because of such risk factors, as well as other factors affecting our financial condition and operating\nresults, past financial performance should not be considered to be a reliable indicator of future performance, and investors should not use historical trends to anticipate\nresults or trends in future periods.\nItem 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds.\nNone.\nItem 3. Defaults Upon Senior Securities.\nNot applicable.\nItem 4. Mine Safety Disclosures.\nNot applicable.\nItem 5.
