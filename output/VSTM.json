We also completed our rolling NDA submission for recurrent KRAS mutant low-grade serous ovarian cancer and strengthened our balance sheet,” said Dan Paterson, president and chief executive officer of Verastem Oncology. “Looking ahead to the fourth quarter of 2024, we anticipate an FDA decision on the acceptance of our NDA, plan to submit our updated RAMP 201 trial data for publication and expect to prepare a U.S. IND application for VS-7375, an oral KRAS G12D (ON/OFF) inhibitor.” \n\n**Third Quarter 2024 and Recent Updates**\n\n**_Avutometinib and Defactinib Combination in Low-Grade Serous Ovarian Cancer (LGSOC)_**\n\n  * Completed the rolling New Drug Application (NDA) submission for the combination of avutometinib and defactinib for adult patients with recurrent KRAS mutant LGSOC, who received at least one prior systemic therapy, in October 2024. The Company submitted the NDA under the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Accelerated Approval pathway and requested Priority Review based on the combination’s potential to address significant unmet medical need among patients with recurrent LGSOC. \n  * RAMP 301, which is currently enrolling patients with recurrent LGSOC regardless of KRAS mutation status across the U.S., UK, EU, Canada, and Australia, will serve as a confirmatory study for the initial indication and has potential to expand the indication regardless of KRAS mutation status. The Company plans to complete enrollment in RAMP 301 by the end of 2025. The Company plans to map out a path forward with the FDA for the KRAS wild-type indication, including the ability to leverage data from the ongoing RAMP 301 Phase 3 trial. \n  * [Announced](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Finvestor.verastem.com%2Fnews-releases%2Fnews-release-details%2Fverastem-oncology-presents-positive-updated-ramp-201-data&esheet=54148213&newsitemid=20241106260252&lan=en-US&anchor=Announced&index=1&md5=bc6123c9bff91cc1d671d27c39369178) mature data from the RAMP 201 trial that continued to show robust and durable response rates with low discontinuation rates due to adverse events in patients with recurrent KRAS mutant or KRAS wild-type LGSOC who had a minimum follow-up of 12 months, at the International Gynecologic Cancer Society (IGCS) 2024 Annual Meeting on October 17, 2024. The primary analysis of the RAMP 201 trial, with a data cutoff of June 30, 2024, showed a confirmed overall response rate (ORR) by blinded independent central review (BICR) of 31% (34/109; 95% CI: 23-41), 44% (25/57; 95% CI: 31-58) in KRAS mutant LGSOC, and 17% (9/52; 95% CI: 8-30) in KRAS wild-type LGSOC. The majority (82%) of all patients had a reduction in their tumors, regardless of KRAS status. The updated data continue to demonstrate avutometinib in combination with defactinib is generally well-tolerated, with a 10% discontinuation rate due to adverse events (AEs) and no new safety signals. \n  * The Company continued its commercial preparation activities for a potential U.S. launch in mid-2025. \n  * The Japanese Gynecologic Oncology Group (JGOG) dosed the first patient in a Phase 2 Verastem sponsored clinical trial, called RAMP201J, evaluating the safety and efficacy of avutometinib in combination with defactinib for recurrent LGSOC in Japan in October 2024. \n\n\n\n**_Avutometinib in Combination with KRAS G12C Inhibitors in Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC)_**\n\nFollowing a thorough evaluation of the Company’s lung cancer clinical development program, Verastem has decided to discontinue the Phase 1/2 RAMP 204 clinical trial evaluating the combination of avutometinib and adagrasib in patients with KRAS G12C-mutant NSCLC. There are no safety concerns with the RAMP 204 trial. The Company is prioritizing the Phase 1/2 RAMP 203 clinical trial, which is evaluating the doublet of avutometinib and sotorasib and the triplet combination of avutometinib and sotorasib plus defactinib in similar patient populations. \n\n  * Since the last update of RAMP 203 in October of 2023, enrollment to the doublet of avutometinib plus sotorasib for the KRAS G12C inhibitor naïve Stage I Part B cohort has recently completed, and per protocol patients are being followed to determine if the efficacy supports further expanded enrollment into Stage II. The KRAS G12C inhibitor prior-treated Stage I Part B cohort enrollment is nearly complete. \n  * Earlier this year, RAMP 203 was modified to include the triplet combination of avutometinib and sotorasib plus defactinib and the first safety cohort of this triplet has been fully enrolled. Preclinical data provide strong evidence that addition of a FAK inhibitor to the sotorasib and avutometinib doublet has the potential to deepen anti-tumor response and significantly delay tumor progression. \n  * Expect to report updated interim data from the doublet combination of avutometinib plus sotorasib and provide initial safety data and a status of enrollment for the triplet combination of avutometinib, sotorasib and defactinib in the RAMP 203 trial by the end of 2024. \n\n\n\n**_Avutometinib and Defactinib Combination in First-Line Metastatic Pancreatic Cancer_**\n\n  * Preclinical data outlining the scientific rationale for the combination of avutometinib plus defactinib with standard of care chemotherapy was published in the October 23, 2024 [edition](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.science.org%2Fdoi%2F10.1126%2Fscitranslmed.ado2402&esheet=54148213&newsitemid=20241106260252&lan=en-US&anchor=edition&index=2&md5=eff4ed87da42035edab0900b62460580) of _Science Translational Medicine_. \n  * Presented initial interim safety and efficacy results from the ongoing RAMP 205 trial of avutometinib and defactinib in combination with current standard of care gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel in first-line metastatic pancreatic cancer on June 1, 2024, at the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) Annual Meeting. \n  * Expect to report updated data from the ongoing RAMP 205 trial in Q1 2025. \n\n\n\n**_VS-7375/GFH375: Oral KRAS G12D (ON/OFF) Inhibitor_**\n\n  * GenFleet began dosing several patients in the Phase 1/2 trial in China evaluating VS-7375/GFH375 in patients with KRAS G12D-mutated advanced solid tumors in July 2024. \n  * After evaluating initial dose escalation data from the Phase 1 study of VS-7375/GFH375 in China, Verastem anticipates filing a U.S. investigational new drug (IND) application by Q1 2025​. \n  * Discovery/lead optimization continues for the second and third programs in the GenFleet collaboration. \n\n\n\n**Third Quarter 2024 Financial Results**\n\nVerastem Oncology ended the third quarter of 2024 with cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of $113.2 million which provides an expected cash runway through the potential approval of avutometinib and defactinib for recurrent LGSOC in mid-2025. \n\nTotal operating expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024 (the “2024 Quarter”) were $37.0 million, compared to $21.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023 (the “2023 Quarter”). \n\nResearch & development expenses for the 2024 Quarter were $24.8 million, compared to $13.9 million for the 2023 Quarter. The increase of $10.9 million, or 78.4%, was primarily related to contract research organization costs, consulting costs, investigator fees associated with ensuring continued rapid start-up of RAMP 301, and a clinical milestone expense that was reached in the GenFleet G12D program. \n\nSelling, general & administrative expenses for the 2024 Quarter were $12.3 million, compared to $7.4 million for the 2023 Quarter. The increase of $4.9 million, or 66.2%, was primarily related to a one-time cost associated with July 2024 financing activities, personnel costs, including non-cash stock compensation and additional costs in anticipation of a potential launch of avutometinib and defactinib in LGSOC. \n\nNet loss for the 2024 Quarter was $24.0 million, or $0.60 per share (basic and diluted), compared to $20.0 million, or $0.75 per share (basic and diluted) for the 2023 Quarter. \n\nFor the 2024 Quarter, non-GAAP adjusted net loss was $35.3 million, or $0.88 per share (diluted) compared to non-GAAP adjusted net loss of $19.0 million, or $0.71 per share (diluted) for the 2023 Quarter. Please refer to the GAAP to non-GAAP Reconciliation attached to this press release. \n\n**Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures**\n\nTo supplement Verastem Oncology’s condensed consolidated financial statements, which are prepared and presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (GAAP), the Company uses the following non-GAAP financial measures in this press release: non-GAAP adjusted net loss and non-GAAP net loss per share. These non-GAAP financial measures exclude certain amounts or expenses from the corresponding financial measures determined in accordance with GAAP. Management believes this non-GAAP information is useful for investors, taken in conjunction with the Company’s GAAP financial statements, because it provides greater transparency and period-over- period comparability with respect to the Company’s operating performance and can enhance investors’ ability to identify operating trends in the Company’s business. Management uses these measures, among other factors, to assess and analyze operational results and trends and to make financial and operational decisions. Non-GAAP information is not prepared under a comprehensive set of accounting rules and should only be used to supplement an understanding of the Company’s operating results as reported under GAAP, not in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP. In addition, these non-GAAP financial measures are unlikely to be comparable with non-GAAP information provided by other companies. The determination of the amounts that are excluded from non-GAAP financial measures is a matter of management judgment and depends upon, among other factors, the nature of the underlying expense or income amounts. Reconciliations between these non-GAAP financial measures and the most comparable GAAP financial measures for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 are included in the tables accompanying this press release after the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements. \n\n**About the Avutometinib and Defactinib Combination**\n\nAvutometinib is a RAF/MEK clamp that induces inactive complexes of MEK with ARAF, BRAF and CRAF potentially creating a more complete and durable anti-tumor response through maximal RAS/MAPK pathway inhibition. In contrast to currently available MEK-only inhibitors, avutometinib blocks both MEK kinase activity and the ability of RAF to phosphorylate MEK. This unique mechanism allows avutometinib to block MEK signaling without the compensatory activation of MEK that appears to limit the efficacy of other MEK-only inhibitors. \n\nVerastem Oncology is currently conducting clinical trials with avutometinib in RAS/MAPK driven tumors as part of its **R** af **A** nd **M** ek **P** rogram or RAMP. Verastem is currently enrolling patients and activating sites for RAMP 301 (NCT06072781) an international Phase 3 confirmatory trial evaluating the combination of avutometinib and defactinib, a selective FAK inhibitor, versus standard chemotherapy or hormonal therapy for the treatment of recurrent low-grade serous ovarian cancer (LGSOC). RAMP 201 (NCT04625270) is a Phase 2 registration-directed trial of avutometinib in combination with defactinib in patients with recurrent LGSOC and enrollment has been completed for the RAMP 201 trial. \n\nVerastem has completed its submission of a New Drug Application (NDA) to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the investigational combination of avutometinib and defactinib in adults with recurrent KRAS mutant LGSOC who received at least one prior systemic therapy in October 2024, with a potential FDA decision mid-2025. The FDA granted Breakthrough Therapy Designation of the investigational combination of avutometinib and defactinib for the treatment of patients with recurrent LGSOC after one or more prior lines of therapy, including platinum-based chemotherapy. Avutometinib alone or in combination with defactinib was also granted Orphan Drug Designation by the FDA for the treatment of LGSOC. \n\nVerastem Oncology has established a clinical collaboration with Amgen to evaluate LUMAKRAS™ (sotorasib) in combination with avutometinib and defactinib in both treatment naive and in patients who progressed on a G12C inhibitor as part of the RAMP 203 trial (NCT05074810). Verastem has received Fast Track Designation from the FDA for the triplet combination in April 2024. RAMP 205 (NCT05669482), a Phase 1b/2 clinical trial evaluating avutometinib and defactinib with gemcitabine/nab-paclitaxel in patients with front-line metastatic pancreatic cancer, is supported by the PanCAN Therapeutic Accelerator Award. FDA granted Orphan Drug Designation to avutometinib and defactinib combination for the treatment of pancreatic cancer. \n\n**About VS-7375/GFH375**\n\nVS-7375/GFH375 is a potential best-in-class, potent and selective oral KRAS G12D (ON/OFF) inhibitor, identified as the lead discovery program from the Verastem Oncology discovery and development collaboration with GenFleet Therapeutics. GenFleet’s IND for VS-7375/GFH375 was approved in China in June 2024 and the Phase 1/2 trial in KRAS G12D-mutant solid tumors was subsequently initiated and the first patient was dosed in July 2024. The collaboration includes three discovery programs, the first being the KRAS G12D inhibitor, and provides Verastem Oncology with exclusive options to license three compounds selected for collaboration after successful completion of pre-determined milestones in Phase 1 trials. The licenses would give Verastem Oncology development and commercialization rights outside of the GenFleet territories of mainland China, Hong Kong, Macau, and Taiwan. \n\n**About Verastem Oncology**\n\nVerastem Oncology (Nasdaq: VSTM) is a late-stage development biopharmaceutical company committed to the development and commercialization of new medicines to improve the lives of patients diagnosed with cancer. Our pipeline is focused on RAS/MAPK-driven cancers, specifically novel small molecule drugs that inhibit critical signaling pathways in cancer that promote cancer cell survival and tumor growth, including RAF/MEK inhibition and FAK inhibition.

Verastem submitted the NDA under the FDA’s Accelerated Approval pathway and requested a Priority Review based on the combination’s potential to address significant unmet medical need among patients with recurrent LGSOC. If granted, the FDA review will be completed within six months following the 60-day filing period. If approved, Verastem expects that avutometinib plus defactinib will be the first-ever FDA-approved treatment specifically for adult patients in the United States with recurrent KRAS mutant LGSOC. \n\n“We believe that avutometinib in combination with defactinib has the potential to change the treatment paradigm for patients with recurrent KRAS mutant low-grade serous ovarian cancer,” said Dan Paterson, president and chief executive officer of Verastem Oncology. “Completing our NDA submission is a significant milestone not only for Verastem as we plan for potential FDA approval in mid-2025, but also for patients as there are no FDA-approved treatments specifically for this rare ovarian cancer.” \n\nThe Company initiated the rolling NDA submission in May 2024 after reviewing preliminary data with the FDA. Updated results from the Phase 2 registration-directed RAMP 201 study were presented in a late-breaking oral plenary presentation at the International Gynecologic Cancer Society 2024 Annual Meeting and demonstrated in patients with KRAS mutant LGSOC, a confirmed overall response rate (ORR) of 44%, a median progression free survival (PFS) of 22 months, and a disease control rate at 6 months of 70%. The updated data continue to demonstrate avutometinib in combination with defactinib is generally well-tolerated, with a 10% discontinuation rate due to adverse events (AEs) across all patients (both KRAS mutant and KRAS wild-type). The NDA submission also includes supportive data from the FRAME Phase 1 trial, the first study conducted with the combination in recurrent LGSOC. \n\nThe FDA previously granted Breakthrough Therapy Designation for avutometinib plus defactinib for the treatment of patients with recurrent LGSOC after one or more prior lines of therapy, including platinum-based chemotherapy. Avutometinib alone or in combination with defactinib was also granted Orphan Drug Designation by the FDA for the treatment of LGSOC. \n\nThe Company is currently enrolling patients with recurrent LGSOC regardless of KRAS mutation status for RAMP 301, an international Phase 3 trial, which will serve as a confirmatory study for the initial indication and has potential to support an expanded indication regardless of KRAS mutation status. \n\n**About RAMP 201**\n\nRAMP 201 (ENGOTov60/GOG3052) is an adaptive, two-part multicenter, parallel cohort, randomized, open-label trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of avutometinib alone and in combination with defactinib in patients with recurrent low-grade serous ovarian cancer. The first part of the study (Part A) determined the selection of the go forward regimen, which was the combination of avutometinib and defactinib versus avutometinib alone, based on overall response rates. The expansion phases of the trial (Parts B and C) are evaluating the safety and efficacy of the go forward regimen of avutometinib 3.2 mg twice weekly and defactinib 200 mg twice daily. The Part D portion of the trial is evaluating a low dose of avutometinib in combination with defactinib to inform individualized dose reduction. \n\n**About Low-Grade Serous Ovarian Cancer (LGSOC)**\n\nLGSOC is a rare ovarian cancer that is insidious, persistent and ultimately fatal. LGSOC is distinct and different from high-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC) and requires different treatment. LGSOC is highly recurrent and less sensitive to chemotherapy compared to HGSOC. Approximately 6,000-8,000 women in the U.S. and 80,000 worldwide are living with this disease. LGSOC affects younger women with bimodal peaks of diagnosis at ages between 20-30 and 50-60 and has a median survival of approximately ten years. The majority of patients report a negative impact of LGSOC on their mental and physical health, fertility, and long-term quality of life. The current standard of care for this disease includes hormone therapy and chemotherapy, but there are no treatments specifically approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to treat LGSOC. \n\n**About the Avutometinib and Defactinib Combination**\n\nAvutometinib is a RAF/MEK clamp that induces inactive complexes of MEK with ARAF, BRAF and CRAF potentially creating a more complete and durable anti-tumor response through maximal RAS/MAPK pathway inhibition. In contrast to currently available MEK-only inhibitors, avutometinib blocks both MEK kinase activity and the ability of RAF to phosphorylate MEK. This unique mechanism allows avutometinib to block MEK signaling without the compensatory activation of MEK that appears to limit the efficacy of other MEK-only inhibitors. \n\nVerastem Oncology is currently conducting clinical trials with avutometinib in RAS/MAPK driven tumors as part of its **R** af **A** nd **M** ek **P** rogram or RAMP. Verastem is currently enrolling patients and activating sites for RAMP 301 (NCT06072781) an international Phase 3 confirmatory trial evaluating the combination of avutometinib and defactinib, a selective FAK inhibitor, versus standard chemotherapy or hormonal therapy for the treatment of recurrent low-grade serous ovarian cancer (LGSOC). RAMP 201 (NCT04625270) is a Phase 2 registration-directed trial of avutometinib in combination with defactinib in patients with recurrent LGSOC and enrollment has been completed for the RAMP 201 trial. \n\nVerastem completed its rolling New Drug Application (NDA) submission to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the investigational combination of avutometinib and defactinib in adults with recurrent KRAS mutant LGSOC who received at least one prior systemic therapy in October 2024, with a potential FDA decision mid-2025. The FDA granted Breakthrough Therapy Designation of the investigational combination of avutometinib and defactinib for the treatment of patients with recurrent LGSOC after one or more prior lines of therapy, including platinum-based chemotherapy. Avutometinib alone or in combination with defactinib was also granted Orphan Drug Designation by the FDA for the treatment of LGSOC. \n\nVerastem Oncology has established clinical collaborations with Amgen and Mirati to evaluate LUMAKRAS™ (sotorasib) in combination with avutometinib and defactinib and KRAZATI™ (adagrasib) in combination with avutometinib in KRAS G12C mutant NSCLC as part of the RAMP 203 (NCT05074810) and RAMP 204 (NCT05375994) trials, respectively. The RAMP 205 (NCT05669482), a Phase 1b/2 clinical trial evaluating avutometinib and defactinib with gemcitabine/nab-paclitaxel in patients with front-line metastatic pancreatic cancer, is supported by the PanCAN Therapeutic Accelerator Award. FDA granted Orphan Drug Designation to avutometinib and defactinib combination for the treatment of pancreatic cancer. \n\n**About Verastem Oncology**\n\nVerastem Oncology (Nasdaq: VSTM) is a late-stage development biopharmaceutical company committed to the development and commercialization of new medicines to improve the lives of patients diagnosed with cancer. Our pipeline is focused on RAS/MAPK-driven cancers, specifically novel small molecule drugs that inhibit critical signaling pathways in cancer that promote cancer cell survival and tumor growth, including RAF/MEK inhibition and FAK inhibition.
