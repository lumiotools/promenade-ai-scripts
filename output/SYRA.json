All Rights Reserved.\nREVENUE AND MARGINS ADVANCE\nRevenue up 101% year-over-year…\nCarmel, Indiana-based Syra Health Corp. (NASDAQ: SYRA) is a healthcare technology company\ndeveloping end-to-end solutions in multiple healthcare areas. The company released 2Q24 results last\nweek, with revenue of $2.0 million more than doubling (up 101%) from $1.0 million in 2Q23. Gross\nmargins in 2Q24 increased to 17.8% compared to 13.1% in 2Q23, as revenue at higher-margin business\nunits grew. For example, revenue at the company’s Population Health unit more than tripled to $451k,\ncompared to $120k in 2Q23. This unit comprised about 23% of total revenues in 2Q24, versus only 12%\nin 2Q23. The growth at the Population Health unit was driven by factors including the demand for data\nanalytics and evaluation of state health department initiatives. The company ended the period with cash\nof $1.6 million.\nRecent federal based sub-contractor awards…\nSYRA is optimistic about its prospects for federal contracts, as the company continues to win new\nbusiness, recently earning its second federal subcontractor award. Having introduced its federal\ngovernment solutions unit in December 2023, the company believes these subcontracts underscores the\nvalue of its growing portfolio of products, tools and services. The company has been selected as a sub-\ncontractor for prime contractor LUKE on a 10-year Defense Health Agency (DHA) contract (an Indefinite-\nDelivery, Indefinite-Quantity (IDIQ) contract for the Medical Q-Coded Support and Services – Next\nGeneration Program (MQS2-NG) contract). The contract is valued at $43 billion over the 10-year contract\nterm and is to provide medical staffing services at DHA facilities nationwide.\nLUKE apparently has been awarded all areas of responsibility for staffing several DHA labor categories\nincluding staffing physicians, nurses, dentists, ancillary services, and medical support personnel. Syra\nHealth will serve as a sub-contractor, helping LUKE perform the contracted services, including providing\ncontract workers across various healthcare labor categories to support the requirements within DHA\nhospitals, clinics, dental facilities, and health activities nationwide in the U.S., Washington DC, Puerto\nRico, Guam, and U.S. territories and possessions.\nThe contract is expected to run through May 31, 2034. The company expects that some task orders will\nbe received before year-end 2024. Task orders will determine the portion of contract revenue that is\nearmarked for Syra Health. However, we believe that billings and revenue in the door might lag the\nreceipt of task orders.\nSYRA had earlier announced a partnership for a federal contract that overall is valued at $75 billion.\nSpecifically, SYRA has been selected as a subcontractor for this contract, which was awarded to\nGeorgia-based Caduceus Healthcare by the federal Department of Health and Human Services (HHS),\nAdministration for Families and Children (ACR), Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR) Medical Staffing\nand Support. Syra Health will provide multiple services to Caduceus Healthcare as a sub-contractor to\nsupport this award. Overall, the contract is for Caduceus Healthcare to provide temporary shelter, care\nfacilities, direct care services, medical care, case management, education, and transportation in support\nof HHS’s Influx Care Facilities.\nAs it expands various business lines, the company also continues to diversify revenue streams both by\ngeographic markets and its business units. For instance, 1Q24 results specifically illustrate that SYRA’s\nrevenue is becoming more diversified. Specifically, SYRA’s business units excluding Healthcare\nWorkforce represented 19% of total revenues in 1Q24, up from only 7% in 1Q23. Aggregate revenues\nfrom SYRA’s other business units, excluding Healthcare Workforce, advanced 333% year-over-year.\nRevenue from the Healthcare Workforce unit was up 27.6% year-over-year off a significantly larger base.\nThe company’s Healthcare Workforce Solutions segment provides on-demand temporary medical\npersonnel, including nurses and nurses’ aides, among other healthcare workers. SYRA is optimistic\nZ acks Investment Research Page 2 scr.zacks.com\nabout the prospects for this segment, albeit run rates likely will not be at the same level as those\nrecorded during the pandemic when the need for higher staffing levels at medical venues was acute.\nGiven that the LUKE subcontract is for nationwide service, we believe this also supports SYRA’s goal to\ncontinue entering new domestic markets. SYRA ended 2023 with active business in 15 states. Recently,\nwith the award of a contract with the state of Maine, the company had expanded its domestic footprint\ninto its 19th state.\nMargin expansion as revenue mix shifts towards higher margin business lines …\nThe company continued to shift its services mix toward higher margin services such as population health,\ndigital health and other higher margin lines, a trend registered in 2023, as illustrated below. Gross\nmargins in 2Q24 increased to 17.8% compared to 13.1% in 2Q23, as noted. Revenue at higher-margin\nbusiness units such as Population Health and Digital Health recorded strong growth. As a result, the\ncompany’s Population Health unit contributed about 23% of total revenues in 2Q24, versus only 12% in\n2Q23. SYRA’s emerging Digital Health unit contributed about 5% of total revenues in 2Q24, while there\nwas no segment revenue in 2Q23.\nRevenue Distribution, Margin Expansion\nSource: Company presentation\n.\nCompany encouraged by traction it is seeing for Syrenity…\nSYRA is encouraged by the traction it is seeing for Syrenity, a key product the company has introduced\nrecently to support its growth strategy. By the end of 2Q24, SYRA had deployed Syrenity for two\nemployers. Syrenity is an AI-enabled mental health app. It is evidence-based and provides easy to\naccess tools to enable users to identify, record and prevent the progression of potentially harmful factors\ninfluencing their behavioral and mental health. Syrenity integrates telehealth to facilitate the user’s\naccess to therapy when needed. The various modules to help users manage their behavioral and mental\nhealth include education, coaching, telehealth, cognitive restructuring, wellness activities, tracker,\nhistorical data collection, which includes an AI-enabled diary and trend analysis to allow users to make\ninformed decisions about taking preventative measures or seeking treatment.\nZ acks Investment Research Page 3 scr.zacks.com\nContracts span services across 23 states; new wins in existing & additional markets expected …\nSYRA is optimistic about its growth plans and strategy as it expands its footprint in additional and existing\nmarkets via new contract wins. With the latest contract, SYRA has active business in 23 states. As the\ncompany continues discussions with existing and prospective customers, SYRA recently secured a four-\nyear, $5.8 million statewide health education and training contract with Indiana Family and Social\nServices to train home and community support professionals and a contract with the Wyoming\nDepartment of Health, Behavioral Health Division to assess Emergency response plans.\nBillings for contracts and / or task order receipts sometimes can lag work commencing. SYRA believes\nthat revenue initially expected in 2024 might be recognized in early 2025 and we are revising our model.\nVALUATION\nWhile there are companies that provide services similar to one or more SYRA offers, there does not\nseem to be a direct comprehensive competitor. Nevertheless, using the overall sector as a general\nbenchmark, on a price-to-sales (P/S) basis, these players trade at multiples that range from 3.5x to 7.5x\nrevenue. We would also expect SYRA to enjoy better growth rates than many companies operating in the\ndigital and tele healthcare space at this point in its development. As the company adds new contracts\nand diversifies its revenue streams, we expect it will help generate improving shareholder value. We\nbelieve it is difficult to compare SYRA shares to those of other publicly traded companies.\nGiven the early stage of the company’s ongoing strategy plus the flurry of recent business awards, we\nassign an 80% confidence multiple to our 2024 forecast and note that billings could lag contract\ncommencement, as noted. However, if revenue ramps faster than we anticipate, our confidence multiple\nmight prove conservative and we might increase / lower our confidence multiple in the future. At this\npoint, we believe using the P/S multiple at the midpoint of the range and applying the above-noted\nconfidence factor is appropriate. On this basis, on our revised 2024 topline forecast, we derive a near-\nterm valuation of about $3.60. If the company delivers milestones earlier than anticipated, it could impact\nthese multiples and adjustments. Specifically, if SYRA can deliver on its growth initiatives, in success we\nwould anticipate share price appreciation over time.\nAny delay or failure in successful execution of the strategy could represent a potential risk to The\ncompany’s valuation and cause the share price to decline. The company believe the risk / reward ratio\ncould be attractive for investors who have a higher than average risk tolerance and longer time horizon.\nZ acks Investment Research Page 4 scr.zacks.com\nRISKS\nWe believe risks to SYRA achieving its goals, and to our valuation, include the following, among others.\n SYRA might not gain market share as quickly as expected and revenue ramp could be slower.\n The company could incur unanticipated costs associated with its initiatives.\n Competition could increase.\n SYRA might need to raise capital that might be dilutive to current shareholders.\n Management collectively holds more than 50% of SYRA shares, making SYRA a controlled\ncompany, and more than 70% of the vote. Interests of insiders might differ from those of public\nshareholders.\n We believe the two classes of shares – A shares and convertible B shares – also present risks,\nincluding risk of dilution to public shareholders and the disparities in the two share classes.\n The majority of revenue comes from the FSSA (about 67.7% and 98.3% of total in 2023 and 2022).\nUnless it is renewed / extended, the agreement ends on June 30, 2025.\nRECENT NEWS\n SYRA announced 2Q24 results on August 7, 2024.\n On July 30, 2024, SYRA was awarded a contract by Wyoming Department of Health, Behavioral\nHealth Division, to assess emergency response plans.\n SYRA won a contract valued at nearly $6 million to train Indiana health workers on July 24, 2024.\n On June. 27, 2024, Syra Health won another contract in Missouri.\n On June. 20, 2024, Syra Health announced it will deliver its 4th training for Maricopa County\nDepartment of Public Health in Arizona.\n SYRA announced the LUKE subcontractor award on May 14, 2024.\n Syra Health reported it will deliver a comprehensive needs assessment and community health\nimprovement plan for Middlesex County, New Jersey.\n On April 24, 2024, Syra Health announced a new award to develop health equity accelerator plan\nfor Portland, Maine.\n Syra won a training contract from Sedgwick County Health Department in Kansas to combat\nsubstance use disorder on April 22, 2024.\n On April 17, 2024, Syra Health and Maricopa County partnered for a 3rd public health training.\n SYRA announced a new Healthcare contract in Missouri on March 28, 2024.\nZ acks Investment Research Page 5 scr.zacks.com\nPROJECTED FINANCIALS\nSYRA Health Income Statement & Projections ($)\n2022 1Q23 2Q23 3Q23 4Q23 2023A 1Q24A 2Q24A 3Q24E 4Q24E 2024E\nNet revenues:\nHealthcare workforce 5,260,370 1,110,840 855,565 1 ,121,238 4 ,259,292 1,417,661 1,416,234 1,430,396 1,444,700 5,708,992\nPopulation health 318,036 74,000 120,026 7 15,499 230,756 450,775 455,283 459,836 1,596,649\nDigital health - - 1 31,356 5 15,250 92,250 92,250 94,649 97,109 376,258\nBehavioral and mental health - 1,730 3,657 1 2,797 1,673 422 464 511 3,070\nHealth education 39,300 1,781 - 1 2,306 10,000 10,000 10,000 10,000 40,000\nOther - - - 3 28,750 - - - - - - -\nNet revenues 5,617,706 1,188,351 979,248 1 ,581,344 1 ,766,201 5 ,515,144 1,752,340 1,969,681 1,990,792 2,012,156 7,724,969\nCost of services 4,555,924 1,041,195 851,089 1 ,026,803 1 ,184,157 4 ,103,244 1,573,053 1,619,674 1,622,495 1,639,907 6,455,129\nGross profit 1,061,782 147,156 128,159 5 54,541 5 82,044 1 ,411,900 179,287 350,007 368,296 372,249 1,269,839\nOperating expenses:\nSalaries and benefits 1,524,971 457,745 562,619 5 92,241 6 79,690 2 ,292,295 736,303 847,064 855,535 872,645 3,311,547\nProfessional services 1,035,902 236,660 128,844 5 8,875 1 62,084 5 86,463 194,580 141,456 142,871 144,299 623,206\nR&D - - - - - 2 40,048 277,548 277,894 280,673 283,480 1,119,595\nS,G&A 575,755 215,463 208,357 2 34,084 4 74,018 1 ,131,922 402,265 456,572 461,138 465,749 1,785,724\nDepreciation 14,849 11,763 12,293 1 2,357 1 2,358 4 8,771 12,545 17,374 17,548 17,723 65,190\nTotal operating expenses 3,151,477 921,631 912,113 8 97,557 1 ,568,198 4 ,299,499 1,623,241 1,740,360 1,757,764 1,783,897 6,905,261\nOperating loss (2,089,695) (774,475) (783,954) (343,016) (986,154) (2,887,599) (1,443,954) (1,390,353) (1,389,467) (1,411,648) (5,635,422)\nOther income (expense):\nInterest income 63 2 4 2 ,820 1 16 2 ,942 981 3,826 3,635 3,271 11,713\nInterest expense (28,533) (11,419) (18,850) (14,180) (9,237) (53,686) (4,077) (3,729) (3,748) (3,766) (15,320)\nTotal other income (expense) (28,470) (11,417) (18,846) (11,360) (9,121) (50,744) (3,096) 97 (113) (495) (3,607)\nNet loss (2,118,165) (785,892) (802,800) (354,376) (995,275) (2,938,343) (1,447,050) (1,390,256) (1,389,580) (1,412,143) (5,639,029)\nNet loss / share (FD) ($0.70) ($0.18) ($0.18) ($0.08) ($0.16) ($0.60) ($0.22) ($0.21) ($0.21) ($0.21) ($0.86)\nWeighted average common shares o 3u,t0s4ta1n,0d8in5g - b a 4s,i3c6 a6n,0d6 d7ilut e d 4,378,751 4 ,360,426 5 ,731,587 4 ,877,861 6,495,213 6,602,421 6,607,421 6,612,421 6,579,369\nSource: Company reports, Zacks estimates\nShares only reflect A shares, not including B convertible shares\n© Copyright 2024, Zacks Investment Research.

Strong growth was driven by Population Health which grew 36% year over year, and Healthcare Workforce, which increased 54% year over year.\n\nGross profit margin was 30% in the third quarter of 2024, compared to 35% the previous year, attributed to revenue recognition in the third quarter of 2023 from our first milestone-based digital health product, Syrabot. With maintenance and operations for this project continuing for an additional three years, we believe we are well-positioned for future growth as we expand our digital health offerings and optimize our revenue streams.\n\nTotal operating expenses for the third quarter of 2024 were $1.1 million compared to $0.9 million in the third quarter of 2023, an increase of 22.2%.\n\nNet loss for the third quarter of 2024 was $(417,535) compared to $(354,376) in the third quarter of 2023.\n\nTotal Revenue in the third quarter of 2024 was $2.3 million representing a 14.4% increase compared to the second quarter of 2024.\n\nGross profit margin in the third quarter of 2024 was 29.7%, compared to 17.8% in the second quarter of 2024. The 1190-basis point increase in gross margins quarter-over-quarter was primarily driven by cost-saving initiatives and enhanced operational efficiency, achieved by adopting a lean approach and reducing redundancies.\n\nTotal operating expenses in the third quarter of 2024 decreased 37% to $1.1 million compared to $1.74 million in the second quarter of 2024 due to a strategic focus on streamlining our operations and optimizing our workforce with a determination to reduce our cost structure.\n\nNet loss for the third quarter of 2024 was $(417,535), a decrease of 69% from the net loss of $(1.4 million) in the second quarter of 2023.
