(“Verde” or “the Company”) (NASDAQ: VGAS) today reported results for third quarter 2024. \n\n“We remain focused on our plans to deploy our proprietary liquid fuels processing technology through the development of commercial production plants. During Q3 2024, we continued to progress the FEED for the proposed Permian Basin project with Diamondback, which could serve as a template for additional projects going forward. We also continue to evaluate other potential opportunities to deploy our technology while remaining disciplined with our resources,” said Ernest Miller, CEO of Verde. \n\nFor the three months ended September 30, 2024, the Company recorded net loss of $(2.5) million and diluted net loss per share of Class A common stock of ($0.12). For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company recorded net loss of $(7.9) million and diluted net loss per share of Class A common stock of ($0.39). The Company’s net loss for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily attributable to ongoing general and administrative expenses. \n\nAs of September 30, 2024, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of $21.7 million and no debt. Also as of September 30, 2024, the Company had capitalized $0.7 million of FEED costs related to the proposed Permian Basin project, net of amounts reimbursable under the joint development agreement between Verde and a wholly owned subsidiary of Diamondback Energy. \n\nSubsequent to September 30, 2024, the Company announced the appointment of George Burdette as Chief Financial Officer. Mr. Burdette will be responsible for all aspects of finance for the Company and brings more than 15 years of financial, commercial, corporate development, and investment management experience. \n\n**About Verde Clean Fuels, Inc.**\n\nVerde is a clean fuels company focused on the deployment of its innovative and proprietary liquid fuels processing technology through development of commercial production plants.

Reports First Quarter 2024 Results**\n\nMay 14, 2024 04:15 PM Eastern Daylight Time\n\nHOUSTON--([BUSINESS WIRE](https://www.businesswire.com/))--Verde Clean Fuels, Inc. (“Verde” or the “Company”) (Nasdaq: VGAS), a renewable energy company focused on the development of commercial production facilities to convert syngas derived from diverse feedstocks into gasoline, today reported first quarter 2024 GAAP diluted net loss per share of $(0.13). The first quarter net loss consists of ongoing general and administrative and research and development expenses related to the Company’s continuing focus on development of its first commercial facility based on Verde’s proprietary STG+® technology which is designed to produce gasoline utilizing either stranded natural gas or waste feedstocks. \n\nBusiness Update Highlights Through May 14, 2024\n\n  * **Verde is participating in a US Department of Energy (DOE) funded consortium that is studying the production of zero emission methanol.** A consortium, led by TDA Research, Inc. and which also includes the University of Colorado – Denver, plans to complete a conceptual design study for a system having the potential of capturing and then utilizing ambient CO2 to produce “green” methanol. TDA will design a direct air capture (DAC) process for sourcing of CO2 from the atmosphere and lead the integration of the DAC with the methanol plant. Verde plans to design and model the methanol production unit using its proprietary STG+® technology, with the goal to utilize CO2 from the DAC, and hydrogen from a carbon-free source, to potentially produce green methanol. Total funding under the award to the consortium is $400,000. An additional $100,000 is expected to come from non-DOE sources, for aggregate funding of up to $500,000 for the project. Based on the results of the study, other project phases may follow. The Company expects that methanol may play a vital role in decarbonizing the maritime and chemical industries. \n\n\n  * **Verde continues to proceed with the selection process for FEED/EPC services for the Cottonmouth Ventures Permian Basin project.** Since the execution of the Cottonmouth Ventures JDA in February 2024, Verde continues with the selection process of a front-end engineering and design (“FEED”) and engineering, procurement, and construction (“EPC”) partner. \n\n\n  * **Verde is in preliminary discussions with various potential offtake parties of carbon credits and gasoline.** Verde is in preliminary discussions with various parties with respect to long-term offtake arrangements for the purchase of D3 RINs, LCFS Credits, and gasoline that may be produced in any future projects. Such potential arrangements, if entered into, could help manage price risk associated with these commodities and could support expected project finance requirements. \n\n\n\n**VERDE CLEAN FUELS, INC.** **CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS** **(Unaudited)**  \n---  \n**Three Months Ended March 31,**  \n**2024** |  **2023**  \nGeneral and administrative expenses  |  $  |  2,789,376  |  $  |  4,265,640   \nContingent consideration  |  -  |  (1,299,000  |  )   \nResearch and development expenses  |  85,835  |  82,662   \n**Total operating loss** |  2,875,211  |  3,049,302   \nOther (income)  |  (346,128  |  )  |  -   \nInterest expense  |  -  |  67,825   \nLoss before income taxes  |  (2,529,083  |  )  |  (3,117,127  |  )   \nProvision for income taxes  |  -  |  -   \n**Net loss** |  $  |  (2,529,083  |  )  |  $  |  (3,117,127  |  )   \n**Net loss attributable to noncontrolling interest** |  $  |  (1,756,712  |  )  |  $  |  (2,542,666  |  )   \n**Net loss attributable to Verde Clean Fuels, Inc.** |  $  |  (772,371  |  )  |  $  |  (574,461  |  )   \n**Earnings per share**  \nWeighted average Class A common stock outstanding, basic and diluted  |  6,173,716  |  6,124,245   \nNet loss per share of Class A common stock  |  $  |  (0.13  |  )  |  $  |  (0.09  |  )   \n  \n**VERDE CLEAN FUELS, INC.** **CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS** **(Unaudited)**  \n---  \n**As of**  \n**March 31, 2024** |  **December 31, 2023**  \n**ASSETS**  \nCurrent assets:   \nCash and cash equivalents  |  $  |  25,941,604  |  $  |  28,779,177   \nRestricted cash  |  100,000  |  100,000   \nPrepaid expenses  |  1,406,010  |  373,324   \n**Total current assets** |  **27,447,614** |  **29,252,501**  \nNon-current assets:   \nSecurity deposits  |  160,669  |  160,669   \nProperty, plant and equipment, net  |  67,791  |  62,505   \nOperating lease right-of-use assets, net  |  453,862  |  524,813   \nIntellectual patented technology  |  1,925,151  |  1,925,151   \n**Total non-current assets** |  **2,607,473** |  **2,673,138**  \n**Total assets** |  **$** |  **30,055,087** |  **$** |  **31,925,639**  \n**LIABILITIES AND STOCKHOLDERS’ EQUITY**  \nCurrent liabilities:   \nAccounts payable  |  $  |  367,036  |  $  |  184,343   \nAccrued liabilities  |  2,227,546  |  1,976,812   \nOperating lease liabilities – current portion  |  326,446  |  297,380   \nOther current liabilities  |  32,027  |  -   \n**Total current liabilities** |  **2,953,055** |  **2,458,535**  \nNon-current liabilities:   \nPromissory note – related party  |  -  |  409,612   \nOperating lease liabilities  |  147,472  |  232,162   \n**Total non-current liabilities** |  **147,472** |  **641,774**  \n**Total liabilities** |  **3,100,527** |  **3,100,309**  \n**Stockholders’ equity**  \nClass A common stock, par value $0.0001 per share, 9,428,797 and 9,387,836 shares issued and outstanding as of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively  |  943  |  939   \nClass C common stock, par value $0.0001 per share, 22,500,000 shares issued and outstanding as of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023  |  2,250  |  2,250   \nAdditional paid in capital  |  35,673,145  |  35,014,836   \nAccumulated deficit  |  (24,695,101  |  )  |  (23,922,730  |  )   \nNoncontrolling interest  |  15,973,323  |  17,730,035   \n**Total stockholders’ equity** |  **26,954,560** |  **28,825,330**  \n**Total liabilities and stockholders’ equity** |  **$** |  **30,055,087** |  **$** |  **31,925,639**  \n  \n**About Verde Clean Fuels, Inc.**\n\nVerde Clean Fuels, Inc. is a renewable energy company focused on the development of commercial production plants to convert syngas, derived from diverse feedstocks including biomass or stranded or flared natural gas into gasoline through its innovative and proprietary liquid fuels technology, the STG+® process.

Reports 2023 Results**\n\nMarch 28, 2024 04:15 PM Eastern Daylight Time\n\nHOUSTON--([BUSINESS WIRE](https://www.businesswire.com/))--Verde Clean Fuels, Inc. (“Verde” or the “Company”) (Nasdaq: VGAS), a renewable energy company focused on the development of commercial production plants to convert syngas derived from diverse feedstocks into gasoline, today reported full year 2023 GAAP diluted net loss per share of $(0.45). The full year net loss consists of ongoing general and administrative and research and development expenses related to the Company’s continuing focus on development of its first commercial facility based on Verde’s proprietary STG+® technology which is designed to produce gasoline utilizing either stranded natural gas or waste feedstocks. \n\nBusiness Update Highlights Through March 28, 2024\n\n  * **Verde and Cottonmouth Ventures announced the execution of a Joint Development Agreement for the first deployment of Verde’s STG+ technology in the Permian Basin.** On February 13, 2024,Verde and Cottonmouth Ventures, a subsidiary of Diamondback Energy (NASDAQ: FANG), announced the execution of a joint development agreement (“JDA”) for the proposed development, construction, and operation of a facility to produce commodity-grade gasoline utilizing associated natural gas feedstock supplied from Diamondback’s operations in the Permian Basin. The expectation for the project is to produce approximately 3,000 barrels per day of fully-refined gasoline utilizing Verde’s patented STG+ process. By consuming natural gas in the pipeline-constrained Permian Basin as feedstock, the proposed project could demonstrate the ability to mitigate the flaring of up to 34 million cubic feet of natural gas per day, while also producing a high-value, salable product. The JDA provides a pathway forward for the parties to reach final definitive documents and final investment decision (“FID”). The JDA frames the contracts contemplated to be entered into between the parties, including an operating agreement, ground lease agreement, construction agreement, license agreement and financing agreements as well as conditions precedent to close such FID. \n  * **Verde is continuing the selection process for FEED/EPC services for the Cottonmouth Ventures Permian Basin project.** Verde is proceeding with selection of a front end engineering and design (“FEED”) partner and an engineering, procurement, and construction (“EPC”) partner. With the execution of the Cottonmouth Ventures JDA, Verde expects to finalize its partner selections soon. \n  * **Verde is in preliminary discussions with various potential offtake parties of carbon credits and gasoline.** Verde is in preliminary discussions with various parties with respect to long-term offtake arrangements for the purchase of D3 RINs, LCFS Credits, and gasoline produced by our facilities. Such a potential arrangement would help manage price risk associated with these commodities and would support project finance requirements. \n\n\n\n**VERDE CLEAN FUELS, INC.**  \n---  \n**CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS**  \n**(Unaudited)**  \n**For The Year Ended December 31,**  \n**2023** |  **2022**  \nGeneral and administrative expenses  |  $  |  11,515,192  |  $  |  4,514,994   \nContingent consideration  |  (1,299,000  |  )  |  (7,551,000  |  )   \nResearch and development expenses  |  329,194  |  316,712   \n**Total Operating loss (income)** |  10,545,386  |  (2,719,294  |  )   \nOther (income)  |  (447,074  |  )  |  -   \nInterest expense  |  236,699  |  -   \nLoss (income) before income taxes  |  10,335,011  |  (2,719,294  |  )   \nProvision for income taxes  |  166,265  |  -   \n**Net (loss) income** |  $  |  (10,501,276  |  )  |  $  |  2,719,294   \n**Net (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interest** |  (7,757,688  |  )  |  -   \n**Net (loss) income attributable to Verde Clean Fuels, Inc.** |  $  |  (2,743,588  |  )  |  $  |  2,719,294   \n**Earnings per share**  \nWeighted average Class A common stock outstanding, basic and diluted  |  6,140,529  |  N/A   \nLoss per Share of Class A common stock  |  $  |  (0.45  |  )  |  N/A   \n  \n**VERDE CLEAN FUELS, INC.**  \n---  \n**CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS**  \n**(Unaudited)**  \n**As of December 31,**  \n**2023** |  **2022**  \n**Current assets:**  \nCash and cash equivalents  |  $  |  28,779,177  |  $  |  463,475   \nRestricted cash  |  100,000  |  -   \nPrepaid expenses  |  373,324  |  113,676   \nDeferred transaction costs  |  -  |  3,258,880   \nDeferred financing costs  |  -  |  6,277   \n**Total current assets** |  **29,252,501** |  **3,842,308**  \n**Non-current assets:**  \nSecurity deposits  |  160,669  |  258,000   \nProperty, plant and equipment, net  |  62,505  |  7,414   \nOperating lease right-of-use assets, net  |  524,813  |  323,170   \nIntellectual patented technology  |  1,925,151  |  1,925,151   \n**Total non-current assets** |  2,673,138  |  2,513,735   \n**Total assets** |  **$** |  **31,925,639** |  **$** |  **6,356,043**  \n**LIABILITIES AND STOCKHOLDERS’ EQUITY**  \n**Current liabilities:**  \nAccounts payable  |  $  |  184,343  |  $  |  2,857,223   \nAccrued liabilities  |  1,976,812  |  762,119   \nOperating lease liabilities - current portion  |  297,380  |  237,970   \nNotes payable - insurance premium financing  |  -  |  11,166   \n**Total current liabilities** |  **2,458,535** |  **3,868,478**  \n**Non-current liabilities:**  \nContingent consideration  |  **`-** |  1,299,000   \nPromissory note – related party  |  409,612  |  -   \nOperating lease liabilities  |  232,162  |  85,200   \n**Total non-current liabilities** |  **641,774** |  **1,384,200**  \n**Total liabilities** |  **3,100,309** |  **5,252,678**  \n**Stockholders’ equity**  \nIntermediate Member's Equity  |  -  |  12,775,901   \nClass A common stock, par value $0.0001 per share, 9,387,836 issued and outstanding as of December 31, 2023  |  939  |  -   \nClass C common stock, par value $0.0001 per share, 22,500,000 issued and outstanding as of December 31, 2023  |  2,250  |  -   \nAdditional paid in capital  |  35,014,836  |  -   \nAccumulated deficit  |  (23,922,730  |  )  |  (11,672,536  |  )   \nNoncontrolling interest  |  17,730,035  |  -   \n**Total stockholders’ equity** |  28,825,330  |  1,103,365   \n**Total liabilities and stockholders’ equity** |  **$** |  **31,925,639** |  **$** |  **6,356,043**  \n  \n**About Verde Clean Fuels, Inc.**\n\nVerde Clean Fuels, Inc. is a renewable energy company focused on the development of commercial production plants to convert syngas, derived from diverse feedstocks including biomass or stranded or flared natural gas into gasoline through its innovative and proprietary liquid fuels technology, the STG+® process.

(NASDAQ: VGAS) (“Verde” or the “Company”) and Cottonmouth Ventures LLC, a subsidiary of Diamondback Energy (NASDAQ: FANG) (“Diamondback”), today announced that the parties have executed a Joint Development Agreement (“JDA”) for the proposed development, construction, and operation of a facility to produce commodity-grade gasoline utilizing associated natural gas feedstock supplied from Diamondback’s operations in the Permian Basin. \n\nThe JDA provides a pathway forward for the parties to reach final definitive documents and Final Investment Decision (“FID\") for the proposed project. The JDA frames the contracts contemplated to be entered into between the parties, including an operating agreement, ground lease agreement, construction agreement, license agreement and financing agreements as well as conditions precedent to close, such as FID. \n\nThe expectation for the project is to produce approximately 3,000 barrels per day of fully-refined gasoline utilizing Verde’s patented STG+® process. By consuming natural gas in the pipeline-constrained Permian Basin as feedstock, the proposed project could demonstrate the ability to mitigate the flaring of up to 34 million cubic feet of natural gas per day, while also producing a high-value, salable product. \n\n“The Verde Clean Fuels team is incredibly excited to finalize this JDA with Diamondback Energy with the goal to produce gasoline from natural gas in the Permian Basin,” said Ernie Miller, CEO of Verde. “This arrangement brings compounding economic and environmental benefits to West Texas. We believe that the ability to de-bottleneck midstream constraints along with the potential to reduce flaring of natural gas, while creating less carbon intensive gasoline, is of paramount interest to natural gas producers.” \n\n“This agreement, with the first planned project in Martin County, fits perfectly with Diamondback’s strategy to decarbonize the oil field while ensuring a return for our investors,” said Kaes Van’t Hof, President of Diamondback. “Additionally, the scalability of the project is incredibly exciting, with similar natural gas-to-gasoline facilities possible across Diamondback’s locations in West Texas. We are proud to partner with Verde to bring this technology to the market.” \n\nThe proposed facility, which is to be located in Martin County, Texas in the heart of the Permian Basin, could serve as a template for additional natural gas-to-gasoline projects throughout the Permian Basin and other pipeline-constrained basins in the U.S., as well as address flared or stranded natural gas opportunities internationally. \n\n**About Verde Clean Fuels, Inc.**\n\nVerde Clean Fuels, Inc. is a renewable energy company focused on the development of commercial production plants to convert syngas, derived from diverse biomass feedstocks, such as yard waste, agricultural waste, and sorted municipal solid waste, as well as stranded or flared natural gas (including renewable natural gas) into gasoline through its innovative and proprietary liquid fuels technology, the STG+® process.
