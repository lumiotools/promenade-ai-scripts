The increase in interest-bearing deposits was largely due to increases in money market and time deposits of $264.1 million and $24.4 million, respectively.\n\nThe increase in total shareholders’ equity from December 31, 2023 to September 30, 2024 was primarily a result of $80.9 million of additional common stock outstanding and net income recognized of $32.4 million, partially offset by $12.0 million in cash distributions paid during the period.\n\n**_Net Interest Income and Net Interest Margin_**\n\nThe following is a summary of the components of net interest income for the periods indicated:\n\n**Three months ended**  \n---  \n _(in thousands)_| **September 30,** **2024**| **June 30,** **2024**| **$ Change**| **% Change**  \nInterest and fee income| $| 52,667| $| 48,998| $| 3,669| 7.49| %  \nInterest expense| 22,281| 19,906| 2,375| 11.93| %  \nNet interest income| $| 30,386| $| 29,092| $| 1,294| 4.45| %  \nNet interest margin| 3.37| %| 3.39| %  \n**Three months ended**  \n _(in thousands)_| **September 30,** **2024**| **September 30,** **2023**| **$ Change**| **% Change**  \nInterest and fee income| $| 52,667| $| 45,098| $| 7,569| 16.78| %  \nInterest expense| 22,281| 17,622| 4,659| 26.44| %  \nNet interest income| $| 30,386| $| 27,476| $| 2,910| 10.59| %  \nNet interest margin| 3.37| %| 3.31| %  \n  \nThe following table shows the components of net interest income and net interest margin for the quarterly periods indicated:\n\n**Three months ended**  \n---  \n**September 30, 2024**| **June 30, 2024**| **September 30, 2023**  \n _(in thousands)_|  AverageBalance| InterestIncome/Expense| Yield/ Rate| AverageBalance| Interest Income/ Expense| Yield/ Rate| Average Balance| Interest Income/ Expense| Yield/ Rate  \nAssets  \nInterest-earning deposits in banks| $| 126,266| $| 1,657| 5.22| %| $| 148,936| $| 1,986| 5.36| %| $| 198,751| $| 2,584| 5.16| %  \nInvestment securities| 106,256| 620| 2.32| %| 105,819| 650| 2.47| %| 112,154| 653| 2.31| %  \nLoans held for investment and sale| 3,354,050| 50,390| 5.98| %| 3,197,921| 46,362| 5.83| %| 2,982,140| 41,861| 5.57| %  \nTotal interest-earning assets| 3,586,572| 52,667| 5.84| %| 3,452,676| 48,998| 5.71| %| 3,293,045| 45,098| 5.43| %  \nInterest receivable and other assets, net| 91,965| 84,554| 77,757  \nTotal assets| $| 3,678,537| $| 3,537,230| $| 3,370,802  \nLiabilities and shareholders’ equity  \nInterest-bearing transaction accounts| $| 302,188| $| 1,237| 1.63| %| $| 291,470| $| 1,104| 1.52| %| $| 296,230| $| 972| 1.30| %  \nSavings accounts| 124,851| 979| 3.12| %| 120,080| 856| 2.87| %| 134,920| 880| 2.59| %  \nMoney market accounts| 1,578,244| 14,688| 3.70| %| 1,547,814| 13,388| 3.48| %| 1,328,290| 9,536| 2.85| %  \nTime accounts| 326,640| 4,172| 5.08| %| 272,887| 3,369| 4.96| %| 399,514| 4,998| 4.96| %  \nSubordinated notes and other borrowings| 76,988| 1,205| 6.23| %| 75,747| 1,189| 6.31| %| 79,085| 1,236| 6.20| %  \nTotal interest-bearing liabilities| 2,408,911| 22,281| 3.68| %| 2,307,998| 19,906| 3.47| %| 2,238,039| 17,622| 3.12| %  \nDemand accounts| 852,872| 817,668| 825,254  \nInterest payable and other liabilities| 32,062| 41,429| 35,123  \nShareholders’ equity| 384,692| 370,135| 272,386  \nTotal liabilities & shareholders’ equity| $| 3,678,537| $| 3,537,230| $| 3,370,802  \nNet interest spread| 2.16| %| 2.24| %| 2.31| %  \nNet interest income/margin| $| 30,386| 3.37| %| $| 29,092| 3.39| %| $| 27,476| 3.31| %  \n  \nNet interest income during the three months ended September 30, 2024 increased $1.3 million, while net interest margin decreased two basis points compared to the three months ended June 30, 2024.

Average loan yields increased 15 basis points compared to the prior quarter and average balances increased 4.88% during the same period. The increase in interest income compared to the prior quarter was partially offset by a $2.4 million increase in interest expense, primarily due to larger average deposit balances at higher rates.

The $3.2 million increase in the allowance is due to a $6.0 million provision for credit losses recorded during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, partially offset by net charge-offs of $2.8 million, mainly attributable to commercial and industrial loans, during the same period.\n\nThe Company’s ratio of nonperforming loans to loans held for investment decreased from 0.06% at December 31, 2023 to 0.05% at September 30, 2024.

This was partially offset by a $0.1 million increase in loan origination costs due to a higher number of loan originations, net of purchased consumer loans, period-over-period.\n\n_Data processing and software._ The increase was primarily due to: (i) increased usage of our digital banking platform; (ii) higher transaction volumes related to the increased number of loan and deposit accounts; and (iii) an increased number of licenses required for new users on our loan origination and documentation system.\n\n_Professional services._ The increase was primarily due to a $0.1 million increase in fees for 2024 audits and examinations.\n\n_Other operating expenses._ The increase was primarily due to $0.1 million in operational losses on deposit accounts.\n\n**_Provision for Income Taxes_**\n\n_Three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to three months ended June 30, 2024_\n\nProvision for income taxes decreased slightly to $4.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from $4.4 million for the three months ended June 30, 2024, primarily driven by a slight decline in the effective tax rate.

This decline was primarily driven by an overall decrease in pre-tax income combined with a $0.2 million adjustment to the provision during the three months ended September 30, 2023 to true-up the year-to-date effective tax rate which did not occur during the three months ended September 30, 2024. The effective tax rates for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, were 28.21% and 30.07% respectively.\n\n**_Webcast Details_**\n\nFive Star Bancorp will host a live webcast for analysts and investors on Tuesday, October 29, 2024 at 1:00 pm ET (10:00 am PT) to discuss its third quarter financial results.

The Company believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful information to management and investors that is supplementary to the Company’s financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows computed in accordance with GAAP. However, the Company acknowledges that its non-GAAP financial measures have a number of limitations. As such, investors should not view these disclosures as a substitute for results determined in accordance with GAAP. Additionally, these non-GAAP measures are not necessarily comparable to non-GAAP financial measures that other banking companies use. Other banking companies may use names similar to those the Company uses for the non-GAAP financial measures the Company discloses, but may calculate them differently. Investors should understand how the Company and other companies each calculate their non-GAAP financial measures when making comparisons.\n\nTangible shareholders’ equity to tangible assets is defined as total equity less goodwill and other intangible assets, divided by total assets less goodwill and other intangible assets. The most directly comparable GAAP financial measure is total shareholders’ equity to total assets. We had no goodwill or other intangible assets at the end of any period indicated. As a result, tangible shareholders’ equity to tangible assets is the same as total shareholders’ equity to total assets at the end of each of the periods indicated.\n\nTangible book value per share is defined as total shareholders’ equity less goodwill and other intangible assets, divided by the outstanding number of common shares at the end of the period. The most directly comparable GAAP financial measure is book value per share. We had no goodwill or other intangible assets at the end of any period indicated. As a result, tangible book value per share is the same as book value per share at the end of each of the periods indicated.\n\nPre-tax, pre-provision income is defined as pre-tax income plus provision for credit losses. The most directly comparable GAAP financial measure is pre-tax income.\n\nThe following reconciliation table provides a more detailed analysis of this non-GAAP financial measure:\n\n**Three months ended**  \n---  \n _(in thousands)_| **September 30,** **2024**| **June 30,** **2024**| **September 30,** **2023**  \n**Pre-tax, pre-provision income**  \nPre-tax income| $| 15,241| $| 15,152| $| 15,795  \nAdd: provision for credit losses| 2,750| 2,000| 1,050  \nPre-tax, pre-provision income| $| 17,991| $| 17,152| $| 16,845  \n  \n**Investor Contact:** Heather C.

These forward-looking statements represent plans, estimates, objectives, goals, guidelines, expectations, intentions, projections, and statements of the Company’s beliefs concerning future events, business plans, objectives, expected operating results, and the assumptions upon which those statements are based. Forward-looking statements include without limitation, any statement that may predict, forecast, indicate, or imply future results, performance, or achievements, and are typically identified with words such as “may,” “could,” “should,” “will,” “would,” “believe,” “anticipate,” “estimate,” “expect,” “aim,” “intend,” “plan,” or words or phases of similar meaning. The Company cautions that the forward-looking statements are based largely on the Company’s expectations and are subject to a number of known and unknown risks and uncertainties that are subject to change based on factors which are, in many instances, beyond the Company’s control. Such forward-looking statements are based on various assumptions (some of which may be beyond the Company’s control) and are subject to risks and uncertainties, which change over time, and other factors, which could cause actual results to differ materially from those currently anticipated. New risks and uncertainties may emerge from time to time, and it is not possible for the Company to predict their occurrence or how they will affect the Company. If one or more of the factors affecting the Company’s forward-looking information and statements proves incorrect, then the Company’s actual results, performance, or achievements could differ materially from those expressed in, or implied by, forward-looking information and statements contained in this press release.

The increase in interest-bearing deposits was largely due to increases in money market and time deposits of $264.1 million and $24.4 million, respectively.\n\nThe increase in total shareholders’ equity from December 31, 2023 to September 30, 2024 was primarily a result of $80.9 million of additional common stock outstanding and net income recognized of $32.4 million, partially offset by $12.0 million in cash distributions paid during the period.\n\n**_Net Interest Income and Net Interest Margin_**\n\nThe following is a summary of the components of net interest income for the periods indicated:\n\n**Three months ended**  \n---  \n _(in thousands)_| **September 30,** **2024**| **June 30,** **2024**| **$ Change**| **% Change**  \nInterest and fee income| $| 52,667| $| 48,998| $| 3,669| 7.49| %  \nInterest expense| 22,281| 19,906| 2,375| 11.93| %  \nNet interest income| $| 30,386| $| 29,092| $| 1,294| 4.45| %  \nNet interest margin| 3.37| %| 3.39| %  \n**Three months ended**  \n _(in thousands)_| **September 30,** **2024**| **September 30,** **2023**| **$ Change**| **% Change**  \nInterest and fee income| $| 52,667| $| 45,098| $| 7,569| 16.78| %  \nInterest expense| 22,281| 17,622| 4,659| 26.44| %  \nNet interest income| $| 30,386| $| 27,476| $| 2,910| 10.59| %  \nNet interest margin| 3.37| %| 3.31| %  \n  \nThe following table shows the components of net interest income and net interest margin for the quarterly periods indicated:\n\n**Three months ended**  \n---  \n**September 30, 2024**| **June 30, 2024**| **September 30, 2023**  \n _(in thousands)_|  AverageBalance| InterestIncome/Expense| Yield/ Rate| AverageBalance| Interest Income/ Expense| Yield/ Rate| Average Balance| Interest Income/ Expense| Yield/ Rate  \nAssets  \nInterest-earning deposits in banks| $| 126,266| $| 1,657| 5.22| %| $| 148,936| $| 1,986| 5.36| %| $| 198,751| $| 2,584| 5.16| %  \nInvestment securities| 106,256| 620| 2.32| %| 105,819| 650| 2.47| %| 112,154| 653| 2.31| %  \nLoans held for investment and sale| 3,354,050| 50,390| 5.98| %| 3,197,921| 46,362| 5.83| %| 2,982,140| 41,861| 5.57| %  \nTotal interest-earning assets| 3,586,572| 52,667| 5.84| %| 3,452,676| 48,998| 5.71| %| 3,293,045| 45,098| 5.43| %  \nInterest receivable and other assets, net| 91,965| 84,554| 77,757  \nTotal assets| $| 3,678,537| $| 3,537,230| $| 3,370,802  \nLiabilities and shareholders’ equity  \nInterest-bearing transaction accounts| $| 302,188| $| 1,237| 1.63| %| $| 291,470| $| 1,104| 1.52| %| $| 296,230| $| 972| 1.30| %  \nSavings accounts| 124,851| 979| 3.12| %| 120,080| 856| 2.87| %| 134,920| 880| 2.59| %  \nMoney market accounts| 1,578,244| 14,688| 3.70| %| 1,547,814| 13,388| 3.48| %| 1,328,290| 9,536| 2.85| %  \nTime accounts| 326,640| 4,172| 5.08| %| 272,887| 3,369| 4.96| %| 399,514| 4,998| 4.96| %  \nSubordinated notes and other borrowings| 76,988| 1,205| 6.23| %| 75,747| 1,189| 6.31| %| 79,085| 1,236| 6.20| %  \nTotal interest-bearing liabilities| 2,408,911| 22,281| 3.68| %| 2,307,998| 19,906| 3.47| %| 2,238,039| 17,622| 3.12| %  \nDemand accounts| 852,872| 817,668| 825,254  \nInterest payable and other liabilities| 32,062| 41,429| 35,123  \nShareholders’ equity| 384,692| 370,135| 272,386  \nTotal liabilities & shareholders’ equity| $| 3,678,537| $| 3,537,230| $| 3,370,802  \nNet interest spread| 2.16| %| 2.24| %| 2.31| %  \nNet interest income/margin| $| 30,386| 3.37| %| $| 29,092| 3.39| %| $| 27,476| 3.31| %  \n  \nNet interest income during the three months ended September 30, 2024 increased $1.3 million, while net interest margin decreased two basis points compared to the three months ended June 30, 2024.

Average loan yields increased 15 basis points compared to the prior quarter and average balances increased 4.88% during the same period. The increase in interest income compared to the prior quarter was partially offset by a $2.4 million increase in interest expense, primarily due to larger average deposit balances at higher rates.

The $3.2 million increase in the allowance is due to a $6.0 million provision for credit losses recorded during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, partially offset by net charge-offs of $2.8 million, mainly attributable to commercial and industrial loans, during the same period.\n\nThe Company’s ratio of nonperforming loans to loans held for investment decreased from 0.06% at December 31, 2023 to 0.05% at September 30, 2024.

This was partially offset by a $0.1 million increase in loan origination costs due to a higher number of loan originations, net of purchased consumer loans, period-over-period.\n\n_Data processing and software._ The increase was primarily due to: (i) increased usage of our digital banking platform; (ii) higher transaction volumes related to the increased number of loan and deposit accounts; and (iii) an increased number of licenses required for new users on our loan origination and documentation system.\n\n_Professional services._ The increase was primarily due to a $0.1 million increase in fees for 2024 audits and examinations.\n\n_Other operating expenses._ The increase was primarily due to $0.1 million in operational losses on deposit accounts.\n\n**_Provision for Income Taxes_**\n\n_Three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to three months ended June 30, 2024_\n\nProvision for income taxes decreased slightly to $4.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from $4.4 million for the three months ended June 30, 2024, primarily driven by a slight decline in the effective tax rate.

This decline was primarily driven by an overall decrease in pre-tax income combined with a $0.2 million adjustment to the provision during the three months ended September 30, 2023 to true-up the year-to-date effective tax rate which did not occur during the three months ended September 30, 2024. The effective tax rates for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, were 28.21% and 30.07% respectively.\n\n**_Webcast Details_**\n\nFive Star Bancorp will host a live webcast for analysts and investors on Tuesday, October 29, 2024 at 1:00 pm ET (10:00 am PT) to discuss its third quarter financial results.

The Company believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful information to management and investors that is supplementary to the Company’s financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows computed in accordance with GAAP. However, the Company acknowledges that its non-GAAP financial measures have a number of limitations. As such, investors should not view these disclosures as a substitute for results determined in accordance with GAAP. Additionally, these non-GAAP measures are not necessarily comparable to non-GAAP financial measures that other banking companies use. Other banking companies may use names similar to those the Company uses for the non-GAAP financial measures the Company discloses, but may calculate them differently. Investors should understand how the Company and other companies each calculate their non-GAAP financial measures when making comparisons.\n\nTangible shareholders’ equity to tangible assets is defined as total equity less goodwill and other intangible assets, divided by total assets less goodwill and other intangible assets. The most directly comparable GAAP financial measure is total shareholders’ equity to total assets. We had no goodwill or other intangible assets at the end of any period indicated. As a result, tangible shareholders’ equity to tangible assets is the same as total shareholders’ equity to total assets at the end of each of the periods indicated.\n\nTangible book value per share is defined as total shareholders’ equity less goodwill and other intangible assets, divided by the outstanding number of common shares at the end of the period. The most directly comparable GAAP financial measure is book value per share. We had no goodwill or other intangible assets at the end of any period indicated. As a result, tangible book value per share is the same as book value per share at the end of each of the periods indicated.\n\nPre-tax, pre-provision income is defined as pre-tax income plus provision for credit losses. The most directly comparable GAAP financial measure is pre-tax income.\n\nThe following reconciliation table provides a more detailed analysis of this non-GAAP financial measure:\n\n**Three months ended**  \n---  \n _(in thousands)_| **September 30,** **2024**| **June 30,** **2024**| **September 30,** **2023**  \n**Pre-tax, pre-provision income**  \nPre-tax income| $| 15,241| $| 15,152| $| 15,795  \nAdd: provision for credit losses| 2,750| 2,000| 1,050  \nPre-tax, pre-provision income| $| 17,991| $| 17,152| $| 16,845  \n  \n**Investor Contact:** Heather C.
