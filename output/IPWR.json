We are collaborating with a third global automaker and recently secured initial orders from a global Tier 1 automotive supplier. We added our second and third distributors with expertise in demand-creation and they are already placing customer orders and providing quotes of our products to large global companies,\" said Dan Brdar, President and Chief Executive Officer of Ideal Power. \"Overall, the momentum we are building is working to advance companies to orders followed by potential custom development agreements and/or design wins to drive long-term value creation for our shareholders.\"\n\n**Key Third Quarter and Recent Business Highlights**\n\nExecution to our B-TRAN™ commercial roadmap continues, including:\n\n  * Secured orders from a Global Tier 1 automotive supplier for numerous discrete [B-TRAN™](https://www.idealpower.com/product-applications/ \"Opens in a new window\") devices, a [SymCool®](https://www.idealpower.com/product-applications/ \"Opens in a new window\") power module, a solid-state circuit breaker (SSCB) evaluation board and a driver. This customer is interested in using B-TRAN™ for solid-state electric vehicle (EV) contactor applications.\n  * Meeting regularly with Stellantis' technical and production teams with Phase III expected to begin shortly after Stellantis selects a Tier 1 supplier to design and build the drivetrain inverter for its new EV platform. In a parallel initiative, Stellantis continues working with the Company and a large semiconductor company with expertise in driver control circuity for the B-TRAN™ inverter drivers.\n  * Collaborating with a third global automaker. This auto OEM is evaluating B-TRAN™-enabled contactors as a potential replacement for electromechanical contactors in its EVs. The Company recently delivered a SSCB evaluation board to this automaker.\n  * Added our second distributor, RYOSHO. RYOSHO already placed orders with Ideal Power from a large global customer interested in the Company's products for solid-state circuit protection applications and introduced B-TRAN™ to global automakers based in Japan.\n  * Added our third distributor, Sekorm Advanced Technology (Shenzhen) Co., Ltd. In response to customer requests, Sekorm began quoting our products to large companies for SSCB applications.\n  * Initiated third-party automotive qualification and reliability testing of B-TRAN™ devices. This testing requires over a thousand packaged B-TRAN™ devices from multiple wafer runs. Initial test results are positive with no failures to date.\n  * Increased the current rating of our SymCool® power module from 160A to 200A, a 25% increase, based on the results of testing. In conjunction with a power module size reduction of approximately 50%, this significantly increases the power density of the SymCool® power module.\n  * B-TRAN™ Patent Estate: Currently at 90 issued B-TRAN™ patents with 42 of those issued outside of the United States and 50 pending B-TRAN™ patents. Current geographic coverage includes North America, China, Japan, South Korea, India, Europe, and Taiwan.\n\n\n\n**Third Quarter 2024 Financial Results**\n\n  * Cash used in operating and investing activities in the third quarter of 2024 was $2.4 million compared to $1.9 million in the third quarter of 2023.\n  * Warrant proceeds in the third quarter of 2024 were $1.0 million.\n  * Cash used in operating and investing activities in the first nine months of 2024 was $6.6 million compared to $5.6 million in the first nine months of 2023.\n  * Cash and cash equivalents totaled $18.7 million at September 30, 2024.\n  * No long-term debt was outstanding at September 30, 2024.\n  * Operating expenses in the third quarter of 2024 were $2.9 million compared to $2.8 million in the third quarter of 2023.\n  * Net loss was $2.7 million in both the third quarter of 2024 and the third quarter of 2023.\n\n\n\n**2024 Milestones**\n\nFor 2024, the Company has set or achieved the following milestones:\n\n√ Successfully completed Phase II of development program with Stellantis• Secure Phase III of development program with Stellantis√ Completed qualification of second high-volume production fab•  Convert large OEMs in our test and evaluation program to design wins/custom development agreements√ Added distributors for SymCool® products•  Initial sales of SymCool® IQ intelligent power module√ Began third-party automotive qualification testing\n\n**Conference Call and Webcast: Third Quarter 2024**\n\nThe Company will hold a conference call on Thursday, November 14, 2024 at 10:00 AM Eastern Time to discuss its results and a question-and-answer session.

Such risks, uncertainties, and other factors include, but are not limited to, the success of our B-TRAN™ technology, including whether the patents for our technology provide adequate protection and whether we can be successful in maintaining, enforcing and defending our patents, our inability to predict with precision or certainty the pace and timing of development and commercialization of our B-TRAN™ technology, the rate and degree of market acceptance for our B-TRAN™, the impact of global health pandemics on our business, supply chain disruptions, and the expected performance of future products incorporating our B-TRAN™, and uncertainties set forth in our quarterly, annual and other reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Furthermore, we operate in a highly competitive and rapidly changing environment where new and unanticipated risks may arise. Accordingly, investors should not place any reliance on forward-looking statements as a prediction of actual results.

This global customer serves many automotive OEMs and is a leading supplier of sensors and electrical protection component solutions for automobile electrification and electric vehicles (EVs). They represent the latest addition to the Company's customer list of Tier 1 suppliers targeting the EV market.\n\nThe Company is meeting regularly with this Tier 1 auto supplier and educating them on the benefits of B-TRAN™ in EV applications. As a result of these ongoing discussions, the customer placed orders for numerous discrete [B-TRAN™](https://www.idealpower.com/product-applications/ \"Opens in a new window\") devices, a [SymCool®](https://www.idealpower.com/product-applications/ \"Opens in a new window\") power module, a solid-state circuit breaker evaluation board and a driver. This customer is interested in using B-TRAN™ for solid-state EV contactor applications.\n\n\"We are pleased to see another global Tier 1 automotive supplier securing B-TRAN™ products as part of their desire to bring lower cost, more efficient semiconductor solutions to their numerous automotive OEM customers. We are also working to advance other Tier 1 auto suppliers in our sales pipeline to orders and then to custom development agreements and/or design wins,\" stated Dan Brdar, President and Chief Executive Officer of Ideal Power. \"Overall, we are leveraging our success with Stellantis to attract and engage other auto OEMs as well as the Tier 1 auto suppliers that provide sub-systems to these global automakers.\"\n\nContactors serve as cutoff switches for high voltage applications in EVs. They play a critical role in isolating the battery, inverter, and onboard charger to ensure safety when the vehicle is off or being serviced. In a collision, power must be shut off from downstream systems to prevent further complications or damage. Contactors are bidirectional and there are typically 4 to 6 high-power contactors in every EV. The high-power EV contactor market is forecasted to grow to over $3.7 billion in 2025 and the Company believes that, over time, solid-state contactors will potentially displace electromechanical contactors in half or more of this market.\n\nSolid-state contactors provide several benefits over electromechanical contactors. They act much faster, thereby eliminating arcing and improving safety, and are more reliable as they do not include physical contacts subject to wear. In addition, they provide programmable settings for trip and current limits as well as built-in safety diagnostics. Solid-state contactors are also expected to cost less than electromechanical contactors in EV applications.\n\n**About Ideal Power Inc.**\n\nIdeal Power (NASDAQ: IPWR) is pioneering the development and commercialization of its broadly patented bidirectional semiconductor power switch, creating highly efficient and ecofriendly energy control solutions for electric vehicle, electric vehicle charging, renewable energy, energy storage, UPS/data center, solid-state circuit breaker and other industrial and military applications.
