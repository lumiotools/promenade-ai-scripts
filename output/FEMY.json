(NASDAQ: FEMY), a leading biomedical company focused on addressing significant unmet needs of women worldwide with a broad portfolio of in-office, accessible, and innovative therapeutic and diagnostic products, announces the peer-reviewed publication of positive data from its pivotal trial of FemaSeed® intratubal insemination (ITI) in the [_Journal of Gynecology & Reproductive Medicine (JGRM)_](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=PqJgquHQFnI09lFc4AZ8ki1OcKvPs4q5KVULeLqRkR6tnmmdoEhWCgQf6ZPyxZDhqthTFYNOcxGutT3lBkODaHjFLmtHbWEMEGp0vU_ajFryGwxunCWp5hXKsQ4mGpcgv-jZT-u0jBKRuTFqdkDs3FwZDCeoIJTBKG8IYD5mYEV4MZfX0zj8meP5n4feeypwSK95xPajZFXmnmBwxFC1y8LqxPe-CnjxHVhz8iu4pOmuvR-T2JzX8VT01dILQ4LK)_,_ a leading peer-reviewed journal covering gynecology and reproductive medicine.\n\n“We are grateful for the renowned investigators from leading academic medical centers and private practices that participated in this landmark trial,” stated Kathy Lee-Sepsick, CEO of Femasys. “Our impressive pivotal data for FemaSeed, showed significantly improved pregnancy rates, over double that of intrauterine insemination (IUI) for low male sperm count, a primary or contributing cause of infertility for approximately 50% of couples. FemaSeed offers a highly effective, first-line solution for women and couples seeking a less invasive and more affordable option than in vitro fertilization (IVF).”\n\n**About the Data**\n\nThe publication titled, “FemaSeed directional intratubal artificial insemination for couples with male-factor or unexplained infertility associated with low male sperm count,” includes positive data from the pivotal trial (_[Clinicaltrials.gov](http://Clinicaltrials.gov) NCT04968847_). The trial met its primary endpoint with a pregnancy rate per subject of 26.3% (95%CI: 13.4‒43.1%; n=10/38) and 17.5% per cycle (95%LCB: 7.6%, 95%CI: 5.7‒29.4%; n=10/57), which was significantly higher than the performance goal of 7% based on the historical control (one-sided _P_ =0.041). Safety reports were consistent with IUI. The vast majority of subjects stated they would probably or definitely recommend FemaSeed, and investigator satisfaction was similarly high.\n\nTargeted intratubal insemination of washed spermatozoa using the FemaSeed ITI device is a safe artificial insemination technique that demonstrated high effectiveness for couples with male-factor/unexplained infertility associated with low male sperm count. Delivery of washed spermatozoa directly into the utero-tubal ostium and fallopian tube without catheterization likely increases sperm-oocyte interaction, suggestive of improved efficiency over conventional intrauterine insemination particularly for male-factor infertility.1\n\n**About FemaSeed**\n\nFemaSeed® is an innovative advancement in artificial insemination, designed to enhance fertilization by precisely delivering sperm into the fallopian tube, the natural site of conception. It is intended to be a first-line therapeutic choice for infertile women, men, and couples seeking pregnancy through insemination, offering a safe, accessible, and cost-effective approach. FemaSeed is a revolutionary device that allows for the expansion of practice services by enabling healthcare professionals with a more affordable and safer alternative to assisted reproductive methods, such as in vitro fertilization (IVF). FemaSeed received U.S. FDA clearance (September 2023), regulatory approval in Canada (April 2023) and CE mark for Europe (June 2024). At the end of 2023, Femasys concluded a prospective, multi-center, pivotal clinical trial (NCT0468847) for those seeking intratubal insemination with FemaSeed. Positive data was published demonstrating FemaSeed as a safe and effective treatment option to achieve pregnancy in couples with male-factor/ unexplained infertility and low male sperm count.1 Learn more at [www.femaseed.com](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=5usf3L3o7C73mZmmuBpJq8Ctp8rPCA2iPvh7iMVe0nolrXU4FbLKpMd4TuMLmeV_7jsrTnqUIzaF_PMg0dsKBg==).\n\n**About Femasys**\n\nFemasys is a leading biomedical company focused on addressing significant unmet needs of women worldwide with a broad portfolio of in-office, accessible, and innovative therapeutic and diagnostic solutions, including a lead revolutionary product candidate and FDA-cleared products.
