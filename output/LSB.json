This submission is based on the results that met the primary endpoints of the vaccine’s global pivotal trial and demonstrated the vaccine’s potential to achieve accelerated protection and meet the WHO’s goal of a one-week rabies vaccine regimen to replace the conventional three- or four-week regimens.\n\nRabies has an almost 100% fatality rate once clinical symptoms appear, leading to approximately 59,000 deaths annually in over 150 countries. More than 95% of rabies fatalities result from bites by infected dogs, with 40% of victims being children under 15. While rabies is typically fatal without treatment, timely post-exposure prophylaxis can effectively prevent death.\n\nPakistan ranks among the top five countries in the world for human rabies prevalence, with over 1.5 million reported dog bites and an estimated 2,000–5,000 human deaths annually. The true impact is likely underestimated due to underreporting. Rabies vaccines remain costly and are often inaccessible in public health sectors. LakeShore Biopharma’s PIKA rabies vaccine could play a pivotal role in addressing this urgently unmet medical need.\n\nThe PIKA Rabies Vaccine, which utilizes LakeShore Biopharma’s proprietary PIKA adjuvant technology based on Toll-like receptor 3 immunological pathway, is designed to produce a more robust immune response in an accelerated timespan compared to existing rabies vaccines. It was granted orphan drug designation by the US FDA for prevention of rabies virus infection including post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) for rabies.\n\nThe pivotal registration Phase 3 Trial was a randomized, comparator-controlled, double-blind, multicenter trial which includes 4,500 participants from the Philippines and Pakistan. It is designed to assess the immunogenicity, safety, and lot-to-lot consistency of three lots of the PIKA Rabies Vaccine in healthy adults using a 7-day vaccine schedule, versus a globally marketed comparator following the standard 28-day regimen. The primary immunogenicity endpoints of the study were geometric mean titers (GMTs) of rabies virus neutralizing antibodies (RVNA) and RVNA seroconversion rate at Day 14 in the first 900 participants. This accelerated and higher seroconversion rate came at no cost to safety, with the safety profile of the PIKA Rabies Vaccine remaining highly tolerable.\n\nDr. Zenaida Mojares, Chief Medical Officer of LakeShore Biopharma, commented, “Our existing rabies vaccine, YSJA, has protected tens of millions of patients in China from this deadly disease. We are committed to advancing next-generation PIKA adjuvanted rabies vaccines to enhance patient protection. The promising results from our pivotal trial validate the potential of PIKA technology to generate a stronger and faster immune response. We remain committed to working closely with drug regulatory agencies in various countries regarding the product registration and marketing application. We eagerly anticipate the early approval of this innovative therapy for the benefit of patients worldwide.”\n\n**About LakeShore Biopharma**\n\nLakeShore Biopharma, previously known as YS Biopharma, is a global biopharmaceutical company dedicated to discovering, developing, manufacturing, and delivering new generations of vaccines and therapeutic biologics for infectious diseases and cancer.

This simplified immunization schedule has the potential to provide patients with more immunization options, reduce physician workload, minimize hospital visits, improve patient adherence to vaccination and also reduce the financial burden on patients under comparable immunogenicity, boosting the vaccine's utility and aiding in the prevention of rabies deaths.\n\n[ ![\\(PRNewsfoto/YS Biopharma Co., Ltd.\\)](https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/2421456/LakeShore_Bio_Logo.jpg) ](https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/2421456/LakeShore_Bio_Logo.html)\n\nThe Trial, which is expected to begin in December 2024, will evaluate the immunogenicity and safety of the YSJA rabies vaccine across two distinct four-dose immunization schedules to determine their immunogenicity and safety compared to the existing Essen regimen (1-1-1-1-1). It will be a single center, randomized, double-blind, controlled study. The two four-dose immunization regimens which will be explored are the Zagreb Regimen (2-1-1), which involves two shots in the first session and one shot each across two subsequent sessions; and the Modified Essen Regimen (1-1-1-1), which involves four sessions of a single shot each. Compared to the conventional five-dose, Essen regimen (1-1-1-1-1), both options offer greater flexibility for medical professionals and patients and stand to improve the existing standard of rabies care.\n\nMr. Xu Wang, Chief Executive Officer of LakeShore Biopharma, commented, \"The approval of this Phase III clinical trial for our YSJA rabies vaccine marks a significant milestone in our efforts to expand the regimen profile of our product. By evaluating simplified immunization schedules, we aim to make our vaccine more competitive in the rapidly expanding rabies vaccine market. We believe that this trial will validate the clinical superiority of the YSJA rabies vaccine, and will help attract increased recognition and support from researchers, academics, and industry players around the world.\"\n\n\"The YSJA rabies vaccine is our flagship product and has already proven to be a game-changer in preventing deaths and disabilities related to rabies,\" Mr. Wang continued. \"The potential impact of this clinical trial, combined with our efforts to become a leading rabies vaccine supplier, strengthens our confidence in continuing expanding our market share in China. We are proud to be making another critical contribution to the global fight against this disease, and are eager to forge ahead as a leading innovator in rabies vaccine development.\"\n\nRabies has an almost 100% fatality rate upon emergence of clinical symptoms. Each year, it claims the lives of approximately 59,000 individuals in more than 150 countries. Transmission through bites from infected dogs accounts for over 95% of rabies-related fatalities, and 40% of these deaths occur in children under the age of 15. Although rabies is typically lethal without treatment, the administration of post-exposure prophylaxis can effectively prevent fatalities when initiated following possible exposure.\n\n**About LakeShore Biopharma** LakeShore Biopharma, previously known as YS Biopharma, is a global biopharmaceutical company dedicated to discovering, developing, manufacturing, and delivering new generations of vaccines and therapeutic biologics for infectious diseases and cancer.
