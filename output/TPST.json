(Nasdaq: TPST), a clinical-stage biotechnology company developing first-in-classi targeted and immune-mediated therapeutics to fight cancer, today reported financial results for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, and provided a corporate update.\n\n“During the third quarter, the team continued to move amezalpat successfully towards the pivotal study, achieving important milestones on both the regulatory and business fronts,” said Stephen Brady, president and chief executive officer of Tempest. “Based on the positive randomized Phase 2 data and a Phase 3 plan we believe is designed for success, we were thrilled to receive broad agreement with the FDA. Coupled with Roche’s support for the Phase 3 study, the third quarter further solidified the foundation of a pivotal study that we hope will result in a new and meaningful therapy for first-line HCC patients.”\n\n**Recent Highlights**\n\n  * **Amezalpat (TPST-1120)**(clinical PPARα antagonist): \n    * Received a “Study May Proceed” letter from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to evaluate amezalpat in combination with atezolizumab (Tecentriq®) and bevacizumab (Avastin®), the current standard of care for unresectable or metastatic hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), in a pivotal Phase 3 trial for the first-line treatment of unresectable or metastatic hepatocellular carcinoma.\n    * Announced an agreement with F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd. (Roche) to advance the evaluation of amezalpat in combination with atezolizumab and bevacizumab into a pivotal Phase 3 trial for the first-line treatment of unresectable or metastatic HCC, a form of liver cancer with high unmet need. \n      * Under the agreement, Roche will supply atezolizumab globally and Tempest will sponsor and lead the pivotal study. The agreement builds on a clinical collaboration between the companies pursuant to which amezalpat was combined with atezolizumab and bevacizumab in first-line HCC patients and compared to atezolizumab and bevacizumab alone in a randomized Phase 1b/2 study. Tempest retains all development and commercial rights to amezalpat.\n    * Announced positive feedback from the end-of-Phase 2 meeting with the FDA for amezalpat in combination with atezolizumab and bevacizumab to treat first-line unresectable or metastatic HCC. Key outcomes included: \n      * Agreement on Phase 3 study design, including the standard-of-care control arm and the primary and secondary study endpoints.\n      * Agreement on appropriateness of the current amezalpat dose and schedule for the Phase 3 study.\n      * Agreement on the Phase 3 statistical plan, including a pre-specified early efficacy analysis that the company currently estimates could shorten the time to primary analysis by up to 8 months.\n  * **Corporate:**\n    * Expanded leadership team to strengthen global clinical expertise with the appointments of Troy M. Wagner as Vice President of Quality Assurance and Sheldon Mullins as Vice President of Regulatory Affairs.\n\n\n\n**Other Potential Future Milestones**\n\n  * **TPST-1495** (clinical dual EP2/4 prostaglandin receptor antagonist) \n    * Plan to advance TPST-1495 into a Phase 2 study in patients with Familial Adenomatous Polyposis (FAP) in 2024 or early 2025 under the auspices of the Cancer Prevention Clinical Trials Network and funded by the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Division of Cancer Prevention.\n    * Expect to disclose data from the TPST-1495 Phase 1 combination arm in patients with advanced endometrial cancer in 2025.\n\n\n\n**Financial Results**\n\n__Third Quarter 2024__\n\n  * Tempest ended the quarter with $22.1 million in cash and cash equivalents, compared to $39.2 million on December 31, 2023. Subsequent to September 30, 2024, Tempest raised an additional $19.9 million in net proceeds through the sale of 17 million shares of common stock under the Company’s at-the-market (ATM) program.\n  * Net loss and net loss per share for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, were $10.6 million and $0.41, respectively, compared to $6.8 million and $0.48, respectively, for the same period in 2023.\n  * Research and development expenses for the quarter were $7.6 million compared to $4.2 million for the same period in 2023. The $3.4 million increase was primarily due to an increase in costs incurred from contract research and manufacturing organizations.\n  * General and administrative expenses for the quarter were $3.0 million compared to $2.4 million for the same period in 2023. The $0.6 million increase was primarily due to an increase in stock-based compensation, and consulting and professional services.\n\n\n\n__Year-to-Date__\n\n  * Cash used in operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was $22.9 million.\n  * Net loss and net loss per share for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were $28.0 million and $1.19, respectively, compared to $22.0 million and $1.57, respectively, for the same period in 2023.\n  * Research and development expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were $17.7 million compared to $13.3 million for the same period in 2023. The $4.4 million increase was primarily due to an increase in costs incurred from contract research and manufacturing organizations, as well as an increase in stock-based compensation.\n  * General and administrative expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were $10.4 million compared to $8.3 million for the same period in 2023. The $2.1 million increase was primarily due to an increase in stock-based compensation as well as legal and consulting services.\n\n\n\n**About Tempest Therapeutics**\n\nTempest Therapeutics is a clinical-stage biotechnology company advancing a diverse portfolio of small molecule product candidates containing tumor-targeted and/or immune-mediated mechanisms with the potential to treat a wide range of tumors.
