(NASDAQ: ZYXI), an innovative medical technology company specializing in the manufacture and sale of non-invasive medical devices for pain management, rehabilitation, and patient monitoring, today reported its financial and operational results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2024.\n\n[ ![Zynex](https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/373722/Zynex_Medical_Logo.jpg) ](https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/373722/Zynex_Medical_Logo.html)\n\n**Key Third Quarter Highlights and Business Update**\n\n  * Q3 2024 orders increased 13% year-over-year.\n  * Q3 2024 net revenue of $50.0 million.\n  * Q3 2024 net income of $2.4 million; Diluted EPS $0.07.\n  * Q3 2024 cash flow from operations of $7.1 million.\n  * Received FDA Clearance for new TensWave device.\n\n\n\n**Management Commentary**\n\n\"In the third quarter of 2024 we continued our steady growth in orders as we positioned the company for long-term profitable growth,\" said Thomas Sandgaard, President and CEO of Zynex. \"Positive cash flow remains strong and both revenue and earnings were within guidance for the third quarter.\n\n\"Our Pain Management division delivered a 13% improvement in orders year-over-year. We continue to see success evolving our pain management division to achieve our strategic goal of diversifying revenue streams through increased orders in orthopedic products. Revenue per sales rep increased 25% year-over-year to approximately $530,000 in the third quarter of 2024. We are working to expedite the onboarding of new sales reps while maintaining a high standard for productivity.\n\n\"Our focus on FDA approvals of next-generation devices and new therapy products delivered FDA clearance of our new TensWave device during the quarter. FDA clearance for the new TensWave device builds on our strong legacy of innovation in pain management, providing effective pain relief through TENS (Transcutaneous Electrical Nerve Stimulation) therapy, which has been clinically proven to reduce chronic and acute pain without opioids. We recognized a gap in the market for a high-quality TENS device that meets the specific criteria for insurance reimbursement, and TensWave is our answer to that demand. It complements our flagship multi-modality device, the NexWave, where Interferential current is the main modality and driver of obtaining prescriptions. This device broadens our product portfolio with the potential to become an essential tool for patients suffering from chronic pain conditions, offering them a safe, effective, and drug-free alternative to pain management.\n\n\"Looking ahead, we will continue to diversify our pain management revenue stream with the introduction of new therapy products. Aggressive promotion of products from our salesforce will ensure sustained profitable growth. In 2025, we should return to our normal top-line growth in our pain management division of approximately 20%. Taken together, we believe our strategy is positioning us to become the world's premier provider of holistic, non-invasive approaches to pain management,\" concluded Sandgaard.\n\n**Third Quarter 2024 Financial Results**\n\nNet revenue was $50.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to $49.9 million in the prior year quarter.\n\nGross profit in the quarter ended September 30, 2024, was $39.8 million, or 80% of revenue, as compared to $40.4 million or 81% of revenue, in 2023.\n\nSales and marketing expense for the three months ended September 30, 2024, decreased 6% to $20.7 million from $22.1 million for the same period in 2023, primarily due to decreased headcount in the sales force.\n\nGeneral and administrative expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024, were $15.3 million, versus $12.7 million in the prior year period.\n\nNet income for the three months ended September 30, 2024, totaled $2.4 million, or $0.07 per basic and diluted share, as compared to net income of $3.6 million, or $0.10 per basic and diluted share, in the quarter ended September 30, 2023.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA for the three months ended September 30, 2024, was $5.1 million, as compared to $7.3 million in the quarter ended September 30, 2023.\n\nCash flows from operations for the three months ended September 30, 2024, was $7.1 million and $10.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024.\n\nAs of September 30, 2024, the Company had working capital of $58.5 million.

In addition, the Company is providing in this news release financial information in the form of Adjusted EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, other income/expense, stock compensation, restructuring, receivables adjustment and non-cash lease charges). Management believes these non-GAAP financial measures are useful to investors and lenders in evaluating the overall financial health of the Company in that they allow for greater transparency of additional financial data routinely used by management to evaluate performance. Adjusted EBITDA can be useful for investors or lenders as an indicator of available earnings. Non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered in isolation from, or as an alternative to, the financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP.\n\n**Safe Harbor Statement**\n\nThis press release contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, as amended. our results of operations and the plans, strategies and objectives for future operations; the timing and scope of any potential stock repurchase; and other similar statements.\n\nWords such as \"anticipate,\" \"believe,\" \"continue,\" \"could,\" \"designed,\" \"endeavor,\" \"estimate,\" \"expect,\" \"intend,\" \"may,\" \"might,\" \"plan,\" \"potential,\" \"predict,\" \"project,\" \"seek,\" \"should,\" \"target,\" \"preliminary,\" \"will,\" \"would\" and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements. The express or implied forward-looking statements included in this press release are only predictions and are subject to a number of risks, uncertainties and assumptions. Forward-looking statements are neither historical facts nor assurances of future performance. Instead, they are based only on our current beliefs, expectations and assumptions regarding the future of our business, future plans and strategies, projections, anticipated events and trends, the economy and other future conditions. Because forward-looking statements relate to the future, they are subject to inherent uncertainties, risks and changes in circumstances that are difficult to predict and many of which are outside of our control.

(NASDAQ: ZYXI), an innovative medical technology company specializing in the manufacture and sale of non-invasive medical devices for pain management, rehabilitation, and patient monitoring, today reported its financial and operational results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2024.\n\n[ ![Zynex](https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/373722/Zynex_Medical_Logo.jpg) ](https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/373722/Zynex_Medical_Logo.html)\n\n**Key First Quarter Highlights and Business Update**\n\n  * Q1 2024 revenue increased 10% year-over-year to $46.5 million; Q1 2024 revenue underperformed guidance of $47.5 million due to payments from a number of insurers being delayed due to a cyber incident which impacted industry-wide payers. Zynex expects the revenue for the full year to remain as originally forecasted and recognize delayed revenue over the remainder of the year.\n  * Q1 2024 net income of $10,000; Diluted EPS $0.00.\n  * Q1 2024 orders increased 23% year-over-year, the highest number of orders in Company history for the eighth consecutive quarter.\n  * Q1 2024 cash flow from operations of $2.1 million, a 7% year-over-year increase.\n  * Repurchased $13.4 million of the Company's common stock in Q1 2024.\n\n\n\n**Management Commentary**\n\n\"During the first quarter of 2024, we continued our focus on order growth, FDA approvals of next-generation devices, and new therapy products,\" said Thomas Sandgaard, President and CEO of Zynex. \"Approximately $1.0 million in revenue for the quarter was impacted by payments from a large number of insurers being delayed due to a cyber incident which impacted payers industry-wide. We expect to recognize that revenue over the remainder of the year and reaffirm 2024 guidance of at least $227 million. In the first quarter, increasing sales and profitable growth for our pain management division delivered a 23% improvement in orders year-over-year. We continued our share repurchase plan and repurchased $13.4 million of our common stock in Q1 2024 and $78.5 million over the last twenty-four months.\n\n\"During the quarter, the pain management division received clearance from to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (\"FDA\") for the next-generation M-Wave Neuromuscular Electrical Stimulation (\"NMES\") device. NMES treatments have several uses, including aiding recovery from surgery, managing chronic conditions, and enhancing exercise performance in healthy individuals. The M-Wave introduces the next evolution in NMES devices, allowing for more customizable treatments within clinical and home settings.\n\n\"We continued to diversify our pain management revenue stream with the introduction of two new therapy products: the Zynex Pro Hybrid LSO, a versatile 3-in-1 spinal orthosis, and the Zynex DynaComp Cold Compression, which combines cold therapy and compression to accelerate recovery. These products allow our salespeople to compete effectively against other industry leaders in the cold compression and bracing markets and complement our other products in low-back support, bracing, cervical traction, cold/hot therapy equipment, and compression.\n\n\"We have four pre-revenue hospital monitoring products in the pipeline, including a laser-based pulse oximeter, NiCO™; a monitor for noninvasive detection of blood and fluid loss; a monitor for early detection of sepsis; and a noninvasive, laser-based monitor of total hemoglobin levels, HemeOx™. For NiCO, the FDA 510(k) submission is now tracking to the second half of 2024.\n\n\"We expect 2024 net revenue to increase approximately 23% compared to 2023.

In addition, the Company is providing in this news release financial information in the form of Adjusted EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, other income/expense, stock compensation, restructuring, receivables adjustment and non-cash lease charges). Management believes these non-GAAP financial measures are useful to investors and lenders in evaluating the overall financial health of the Company in that they allow for greater transparency of additional financial data routinely used by management to evaluate performance. Adjusted EBITDA can be useful for investors or lenders as an indicator of available earnings. Non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered in isolation from, or as an alternative to, the financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP.\n\n**Safe Harbor Statement**\n\nThis press release contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, as amended. our results of operations and the plans, strategies and objectives for future operations; the timing and scope of any potential stock repurchase; and other similar statements.\n\nWords such as \"anticipate,\" \"believe,\" \"continue,\" \"could,\" \"designed,\" \"endeavor,\" \"estimate,\" \"expect,\" \"intend,\" \"may,\" \"might,\" \"plan,\" \"potential,\" \"predict,\" \"project,\" \"seek,\" \"should,\" \"target,\" \"preliminary,\" \"will,\" \"would\" and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements.

PRESENTATION**\n\n**Organization**\n\nZynex, Inc. (a Nevada corporation) has its headquarters in Englewood, Colorado. The term “the Company” refers to Zynex, Inc. and its active and inactive subsidiaries. The Company operates in one primary business segment, medical devices which include electrotherapy and pain management products. As of March 31, 2024, the Company’s only active subsidiaries are Zynex Medical, Inc. (“ZMI,” a wholly-owned Colorado corporation) through which the Company conducts most of its operations, and Zynex Monitoring Solutions, Inc. (“ZMS,” a wholly-owned Colorado corporation). ZMS has developed a fluid monitoring system which received approval by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) during 2020 and is still awaiting CE Marking in Europe. ZMS has achieved no revenues to date. The Company’s inactive subsidiaries include Zynex Europe, Zynex NeuroDiagnostics, Inc. (“ZND,” a wholly-owned Colorado corporation) and Pharmazy, Inc. (“Pharmazy”, a wholly-owned Colorado Corporation). The Company’s compounding pharmacy operated as a division of ZMI dba as Pharmazy through January 2016.\n\nIn December 2021, the Company acquired 100% of Kestrel Labs, Inc. (“Kestrel”), a laser-based, noninvasive patient monitoring technology company. Kestrel’s laser-based products include the NiCOTM CO-Oximeter, a multi-parameter pulse oximeter, and HemeOxTM, a total hemoglobin oximeter that enables continuous arterial blood monitoring. Both NiCO and HemeOx are yet to be presented to the FDA for market clearance. All activities related to Kestrel flow through the ZMS subsidiary.\n\n**Nature of Business**\n\nThe Company designs, manufactures, and markets medical devices that treat chronic and acute pain, as well as activate and exercise muscles for rehabilitative purposes with electrical stimulation. The Company’s devices are intended for pain management to reduce reliance on medications and provide rehabilitation and increased mobility through the utilization of non-invasive muscle stimulation, electromyography technology, interferential current (“IFC”), neuromuscular electrical stimulation (“NMES”) and transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (“TENS”). All the Company’s medical devices are designed to be patient friendly and designed for home use. The devices are small, portable, battery operated, and include an electrical pulse generator which is connected to the body via electrodes. All of the medical devices are marketed in the U.S. and are subject to FDA regulation and approval. All of the products require a physician’s prescription before they can be dispensed in the U.S. The Company’s primary product is the NexWave device. The NexWave is marketed to physicians and therapists by the Company’s field sales representatives. The NexWave requires consumable supplies, such as electrodes and batteries, which are shipped to patients on a recurring monthly basis, as needed.\n\nDuring the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company generated all of its revenue in North America from sales and supplies of its devices to patients and healthcare providers.\n\n**Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements**\n\nThe unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included herein have been prepared by the Company pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) and accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”). Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP have been condensed or omitted pursuant to such rules and regulations, although the Company believes that the disclosures included herein are adequate to make the information presented not misleading. A description of the Company’s accounting policies and other financial information is included in the audited consolidated financial statements as filed with the SEC in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. Amounts as of December 31, 2023 are derived from those audited consolidated financial statements. These interim condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the annual audited financial statements, accounting policies and notes thereto, included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.\n\nIn the opinion of management, the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements contain all adjustments necessary to present fairly the financial position of the Company as of March 31, 2024 and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the periods presented. The results of operations for the three months ended March 31, 2024 are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be achieved for a full fiscal year and cannot be used to indicate financial performance for the entire year. \n\n​\n\n7\n\n​\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC)\n\n**ZYNEX, INC.**\n\n**NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS**\n\n**(2)****SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES**\n\n**Principles of Consolidation**\n\nThe accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Zynex, Inc. and its subsidiaries. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.\n\n**Use of Estimates**\n\nPreparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. The most significant management estimates used in the preparation of the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements are associated with the allowance for billing adjustments and uncollectible accounts receivable, the reserve for obsolete and damaged inventory, stock-based compensation, assumptions related to the valuation of contingent consideration, valuation of long-lived assets, and realizability of deferred tax assets.\n\n**Cash, Cash Equivalents, and Short-Term Investments**\n\nCash equivalents consist of highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less at the date of purchase. We classify investments with maturities of greater than three months but less than one year as short-term investments. Short-term investments are classified as held-to-maturity as the Company has the positive intent and ability to hold the investments until maturity. Held-to-maturity investments are carried at amortized cost. Due to the short-term nature, the carrying amounts reported in the consolidated balance sheet approximate fair value. \n\n**Accounts Receivable, Net**\n\nThe Company’s accounts receivable represent unconditional rights to consideration and are generated when a patient receives one of the Company’s devices, related supplies, or complementary products. In conjunction with fulfilling the Company’s obligation to deliver a product, the Company invoices the patient’s third-party payer and/or the patient. Billing adjustments represent the difference between the list price and the reimbursement rates set by third-party payers, including Medicare, commercial payers, and amounts billed directly to the patient. Specific amounts, if uncollected over a period of time, may be written-off after several appeals, which in some cases may take longer than twelve months. Primarily all of the Company’s receivables are due from patients with commercial or government health plans and worker’s compensation claims with a smaller portion related to private pay individuals, attorney, and auto claims. The Company maintains a constraint for third-party payer refund requests, deductions, and adjustments. See Note 14 – Concentrations for discussion of significant customer accounts receivable balances.\n\n**Inventory, Net**\n\nInventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Cost is computed using standard costs, which approximates actual costs on an average cost basis.\n\nThe Company monitors inventory for turnover and obsolescence and records losses for excess and obsolete inventory, as appropriate. The Company provides reserves for estimated excess and obsolete inventories based upon assumptions about future demand. If future demand is less favorable than currently projected by management, additional inventory write-downs may be required.\n\n**Long-lived Assets**\n\nThe Company records intangible assets based on estimated fair value on the date of acquisition. Long-lived assets consist of net property and equipment and intangible assets. The finite-lived intangible assets are patents and are amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated lives of the assets. \n\nThe Company assesses impairment of long-lived assets when events or changes in circumstances indicates that their carrying value amount may not be recoverable. Circumstances which could trigger a review include but are not limited to: (i) significant decreases in \n\n8\n\n​\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC)\n\n**ZYNEX, INC.**\n\n**NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS**\n\nthe market price of the asset; (ii) significant adverse changes in the business climate or legal or regulatory factors; or (iii) expectations that the asset will more likely than not be sold or disposed of significantly before the end of its estimated useful life.\n\nIf the estimated future undiscounted cash flows, excluding interest charges, from the use of an asset are less than the carrying value, a write-down would be recorded to reduce the related asset to its estimated fair value. \n\nUseful lives of finite-lived intangible assets by each asset category are summarized below:\n\n​\n\n​| ​| ​  \n---|---|---  \n​| ​| **Estimated**  \n​| ​| **Useful Lives**  \n​| **in years**  \nPatents|  11  \n  \n​\n\n**Goodwill**\n\nGoodwill is recorded as the difference between the fair value of the purchase consideration and the estimated fair value of the net identifiable tangible and intangible assets acquired. \n\nGoodwill is not subject to amortization but is subject to impairment testing. The Company utilizes the simplified test for goodwill impairment. The amount recognized for impairment is equal to the difference between the carrying value and the asset’s fair value. The valuation methods used in the quantitative fair value assessment was a discounted cash flow method and required management to make certain assumptions and estimates regarding certain industry trends and future profitability of our reporting units. The Company tests more frequently if indicators are present or changes in circumstances suggest that impairment may exist. These indicators include, among others, declines in sales, earnings, or cash flows, or the development of a material adverse change in the business climate. The Company assesses goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level. The estimates of fair value and the determination of reporting units requires management judgment.\n\n**Revenue Recognition**\n\nRevenue is derived from sales and leases of the Company’s electrotherapy devices and sales of related supplies and complementary products. Device sales can be in the form of a purchase or a lease. Supplies needed for the device can be set up as a recurring shipment or ordered through the customer support team or online store as needed. The Company recognizes revenue when the performance obligation has been met and the product has been transferred to the patient, in the amount that reflects the consideration the Company expects to receive. In general, revenue from sales of devices and supplies is recognized once the product is delivered to the patient, which is when the performance obligation has been met and the product has been transferred to the patient. \n\nSales of devices and supplies are primarily shipped directly to the patient, with a small amount of revenue generated from sales to distributors. In the healthcare industry there is often a third party involved that will pay on the patients’ behalf for purchased or leased devices and supplies. The terms of the separate arrangement impact certain aspects of the contracts, with patients covered by third party payers, such as contract type, performance obligations and transaction price, but for purposes of revenue recognition the contract with the customer refers to the arrangement between the Company and the patient. The Company does not have any material deferred revenue in the normal course of business as each performance obligation is met upon delivery of goods to the patient. There are no substantial costs incurred through support or warranty obligations.\n\n9\n\n​\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC)\n\n**ZYNEX, INC.**\n\n**NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS**\n\nThe following table provides a breakdown of disaggregated net revenues for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023 related to devices accounted for as purchases subject to Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 606 – “Revenue from Contracts with Customers” (“ASC 606”), leases subject to ASC 842 – “Leases” (“ASC 842”), and supplies (in thousands):\n\n​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​  \n---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \n​| ​| **For the Three Months Ended March 31,**|  ​  \n​| **2024**| **2023**  \n**Device revenue**|  ​| ​| ​| ​  \nPurchased| ​| $|  6,515| ​| $|  4,642| ​  \nLeased| ​|  7,510| ​|  7,302| ​  \n**Total device revenue**|  ​| $|  14,025| ​| $|  11,944| ​  \nSupplies revenue| ​| ​|  32,506| ​| ​|  30,226| ​  \n**Total revenue**|  ​| $|  46,531| ​| $|  42,170| ​  \n  \n​\n\nRevenues are estimated using the portfolio approach by third-party payer type based upon historical rates of collection, aging of receivables, trends in historical reimbursement rates by third-party payer types, and current relationships and experience with the third-party payers, which includes estimated constraints for third-party payer refund requests, deductions, allowance for uncollectible accounts, and billing allowance adjustments. Inherent in these estimates is the risk they will have to be revised as additional information becomes available and constraints are released. If initial estimates are updated, these changes are accounted for as increases or decreases in the transaction price. Assuming the underlying performance obligation to which the change in price relates has already been satisfied, those changes in transaction price are immediately recognized as increases or decreases in revenue (not credit losses (bad debt expense)) in the period in which the estimate changes. Additionally, the complexity of third-party payer billing arrangements, the uncertainty of reimbursement amounts for certain products from third-party payers, or unanticipated requirements to refund payments previously received may result in adjustments to amounts originally recorded. Settlements with third-party payers for retroactive revenue adjustments due to audits, reviews, or investigations are considered variable consideration and are included in the determination of the estimated transaction price using the expected amount method. These adjustments to transaction price are estimated based on the terms of the payment agreement with the payer, correspondence from the payer, and historical settlement activity, including an assessment to ensure that it is probable that a significant reversal in the amount of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur when the uncertainty associated with the retroactive adjustment is subsequently resolved. Due to continuing changes in the healthcare industry and third-party payer reimbursement, it is possible the Company’s forecasting model to estimate collections could change, which could have an impact on the Company’s results of operations and cash flows. Any differences between estimated and actual collectability are reflected in the period in which payment is received. \n\nThe Company monitors the variability and uncertain timing over third-party payer types in the portfolios. If there is a change in the Company’s third-party payer mix over time, it could affect net revenue and related receivables. The Company believes it has a sufficient history of collection experience to estimate the net collectible amounts by third-party payer type. However, changes to constraints related to billing adjustments and refund requests have historically fluctuated and may continue to fluctuate significantly from quarter-to-quarter and year-to-year.\n\n**Leases**\n\nThe Company determines if an arrangement is a lease at inception or modification of a contract.\n\nThe Company recognizes finance and operating lease right-of-use assets and liabilities at the lease commencement date based on the estimated present value of the remaining lease payments over the lease term. For the finance leases, the Company uses the implicit rate to determine the present value of future lease payments. For operating leases that do not provide an implicit rate, the Company uses incremental borrowing rates to determine the present value of future lease payments. The Company includes options to extend or terminate a lease in the lease term when it is reasonably certain to exercise such options. The Company recognizes leases with an initial term of 12 months or less as lease expense over the lease term and those leases are not recorded on the Company’s condensed consolidated balance sheets. For additional information on the leases where the Company is the lessee, see Note 13 - Leases.\n\n10\n\n​\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC)\n\n**ZYNEX, INC.**\n\n**NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS**\n\nA significant portion of device revenue is derived from patients who obtain devices under month-to-month lease arrangements where the Company is the lessor. Revenue related to devices on lease is recognized in accordance with ASC 842. Using the guidance in ASC 842, the Company concluded the transactions should be accounted for as operating leases based on the following criteria below:\n\n●| The lease does not transfer ownership of the underlying asset to the lessee by the end of the lease term.  \n---|---  \n●| The lease does not grant the lessee an option to purchase the underlying asset that the lessee is reasonably certain to exercise.  \n---|---  \n●| The lease term is month-to-month, which does not meet the major part of the remaining economic life of the underlying asset. However, if the commencement date falls at or near the end of the economic life of the underlying asset, this criterion shall not be used for purposes of classifying the lease.  \n---|---  \n●| There is no residual value guaranteed and the present value of the sum of the lease payments does not equal or exceed substantially all of the fair value of the underlying asset.  \n---|---  \n●| The underlying asset is expected to have alternative uses to the lessor at the end of the lease term.  \n---|---  \n  \nLease commencement occurs upon delivery of the device to the patient. The Company retains title to the leased device and those devices are classified as property and equipment on the balance sheet. Since the leases are month-to-month and can be returned by the patient at any time, revenue is recognized monthly for the duration of the period in which the patient retains the device.\n\n**Debt Issuance Costs**\n\nDebt issuance costs are costs incurred to obtain new debt financing. Debt issuance costs are presented in the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheets as a reduction in the carrying value of the debt and are accreted to interest expense using the effective interest method.\n\n**Stock-based Compensation**\n\nThe Company accounts for stock-based compensation through recognition of the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments, which is measured based on the grant date fair value of the award that is ultimately expected to vest during the period. The stock-based compensation expenses are recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award (the requisite service period, which in the Company’s case is the same as the vesting period). For awards subject to the achievement of performance metrics, stock-based compensation expense is recognized when it becomes probable that the performance conditions will be achieved over the respective performance period.\n\n**Segment Information**\n\nThe Company defines operating segments as components of the business enterprise for which separate financial information is reviewed regularly by the chief operating decision-makers to evaluate performance and to make operating decisions. The Company has identified our Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, and Chief Operating Officer as our Chief Operating Decision-Makers (“CODM”).\n\nThe Company currently operates business as one operating segment which includes two revenue types: Devices and Supplies.\n\n**Income Taxes**\n\nThe Company records deferred tax assets and liabilities for the estimated future tax effects of temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and amounts reported in the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheets, as well as operating loss and tax credit carry-forwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to be applied to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance if, based on available evidence, it is more likely than not that these benefits will not be realized.\n\nTax benefits are recognized from uncertain tax positions if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position.\n\n11\n\n​\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC)\n\n**ZYNEX, INC.**\n\n**NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS**\n\nThe Inflation Reduction Act (“IRA”) was enacted into law on August 16, 2022. Included in the IRA was a provision to implement a 15% corporate alternative minimum tax on corporations whose average annual adjusted financial statement income during the most recently completed three year period exceeds $1 billion. This provision is effective for tax years beginning after December 31, 2022. The IRA did not have a material impact on our reported results, cash flows, or financial position during the period ended March 31, 2024.\n\n**Recent Accounting Pronouncements**\n\nIn October 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued ASU (“Accounting Standards Update”) 2023-06, “Disclosure Improvements: Codification Amendments in Response to the SEC’s Disclosure Update and Simplification Initiative” (“ASU 2023-06”). This ASU incorporates certain SEC disclosure requirements into the FASB ASC. The amendments in the ASU are expected to clarify or improve disclosure and presentation requirements of a variety of ASC Topics, allow users to more easily compare entities subject to the SEC’s existing disclosures with those entities that were not previously subject to the requirements, and align the requirements in the ASC with the SEC’s regulations. The ASU has an unusual effective date and transition requirements since it is contingent on future SEC rule setting. If the SEC fails to enact required changes by June 30, 2027, this ASU is not effective for any entities. Early adoption is not permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact that the adoption of this standard will have on its consolidated financial statements.\n\nIn November 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic 280): “Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures” (“ASU 2023-07”) to update reportable segment disclosure requirements, primarily through enhanced disclosures about significant segment expenses and information used to assess segment performance. This update is effective beginning with the Company’s 2024 fiscal year annual reporting period, with early adoption permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact that the adoption of this standard will have on its consolidated financial statements.\n\nIn December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09, “Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures” (“ASU 2023-09”) to enhance the transparency and decision-usefulness of income tax disclosures, particularly in the rate reconciliation table and disclosures about income taxes paid. This ASU applies to all entities subject to income taxes. This ASU will be effective for public companies for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2024. The Company is currently evaluating the impact that the adoption of this standard will have on its consolidated financial statements.\n\nIn March 2024, the FASB issued ASU 2024-02 “Codification Improvements – Amendments to Remove References to the Concepts Statements.” This amendments to the Codification that remove references to various Concepts Statement. The amendments in this update are effective for public business entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024. For all other entities, the amendments are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2025. Early application of the amendments in this update is permitted for all entities, for any fiscal year or interim period for which financial statements have not yet been issued (or made available for issuance). If an entity adopts the amendments in an interim period, it must adopt them as of the beginning of the fiscal year that includes that interim period. The Company is currently evaluating the impact that the adoption of this standard will have on its consolidated financial statements. \n\n​\n\nManagement does not believe that any other recently issued accounting pronouncements will have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.\n\n**(3)****FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS**\n\nThe Company’s financial instruments include cash, accounts receivable, accounts payable, accrued liabilities, and contingent consideration. The carrying amounts of financial instruments, including cash, accounts receivable, accounts payable, and accrued liabilities approximate their fair value due to their short maturities. The Company measures its long-term debt at fair value which approximates book value as the long-term debt bears market rates of interest. The fair value of acquisition-related contingent consideration is based on a Monte Carlo model. The valuation policies are determined by management, and the Company’s Board of Directors is informed of any policy change.\n\nAuthoritative guidance defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The guidance establishes a hierarchy for inputs used in \n\n12\n\n​\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC)\n\n**ZYNEX, INC.**\n\n**NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS**\n\nmeasuring fair value that maximizes the use of observable inputs and minimizes the use of unobservable inputs by requiring that the most observable inputs be used when available. Observable inputs are inputs that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability developed based on market data obtained from sources independent of the Company. Unobservable inputs are inputs that reflect the Company’s assumptions of what market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability developed based on the best information available in the circumstances. The hierarchy is broken down into three levels based on reliability of the inputs as follows:\n\nLevel I: Inputs that reflect unadjusted quoted prices in active markets that are accessible to Zynex for identical assets or liabilities;\n\nLevel II: Inputs include quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active or inactive markets or that are observable for the asset or liability either directly or indirectly; and\n\nLevel III: Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity.\n\nThe Company’s assets and liabilities, which are measured at fair value, on a recurring basis, are classified in their entirety based on the lowest level of input that is significant to their fair value measurement. The Company’s policy is to recognize transfers in and/or out of fair value hierarchy as of the date in which the event or change in circumstances caused the transfer. The Company has consistently applied the valuation techniques discussed below in all periods presented.\n\nThe Company classified its contingent consideration liability in connection with the acquisition of Kestrel within Level 3 as factors used to develop the estimated fair value are unobservable inputs that are not supported by market activity.\n\nThe contingent consideration related to Kestrel was valued at $9.7 million using a Monte Carlo simulation as of December 22, 2021. As of December 31, 2022 and March 31, 2023, the value of contingent consideration was estimated at $10.0 million and $8.6 million, respectively. An adjustment of $1.4 million during the quarter ended March 31, 2023 was recorded as a gain on change in fair value of contingent consideration in the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Income. The fair value of acquisition-related contingent consideration was based on a Monte Carlo model prior to December 31, 2023. See Note 6 - Business Combinations for additional details on the removal of contingent consideration during the year ended December 31, 2023. Contingent consideration was fully removed during the year ended December 31, 2023 and there was no contingent consideration during the three months ended March 31, 2024. The following table presents the Company’s financial liabilities that were accounted for at fair value on a recurring basis prior to December 31, 2023, which were included within Level III of the fair value hierarchy for the quarter ended March 31, 2023:\n\n​\n\n​| ​| ​| ​  \n---|---|---|---  \n​| **Contingent Consideration**  \nBalance as of December 31, 2022| ​| $|  10,000  \nChange in fair value of contingent consideration| ​|  (1,400)  \nBalance as of March 31, 2023| $|  8,600  \n  \n​\n\n​\n\n​\n\n​\n\n​\n\n**(4)****INVENTORY**\n\nThe components of inventory are as follows (in thousands):\n\n​\n\n​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​  \n---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \n​| **March 31, 2024**| **December 31, 2023**  \nRaw materials| ​| $|  4,296| ​| $|  4,601  \nWork-in-process| ​|  1,535| ​|  530  \nFinished goods| ​| ​|  7,357| ​| ​|  6,929  \nInventory in transit| ​|  2,588| ​|  1,346  \n​| ​| $|  15,776| ​| $|  13,406  \nLess: reserve| ​| ​|  (300)| ​| ​|  (300)  \n​| ​| $|  15,476| ​| $|  13,106  \n  \n​\n\n​\n\n13\n\n​\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC)\n\n**ZYNEX, INC.**\n\n**NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS**\n\n**(5)****PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT**\n\nThe components of property and equipment are as follows (in thousands):\n\n​\n\n​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​  \n---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \n​| **March 31, 2024**| **December 31, 2023**  \nProperty and equipment| ​| ​| ​  \nOffice furniture and equipment| ​| $|  2,907| ​| $|  2,768  \nAssembly equipment| ​|  314| ​|  178  \nVehicles| ​|  75| ​|  75  \nLeasehold improvements| ​|  1,832| ​|  1,174  \nLeased devices| ​| ​|  910| ​| ​|  796  \nCapital projects| ​|  128| ​|  869  \n​| ​| $|  6,166| ​| $|  5,860  \nLess accumulated depreciation| ​|  (2,932)| ​|  (2,746)  \n​| ​| $|  3,234| ​| $|  3,114  \n  \n​\n\nTotal depreciation expense related to our property and equipment was $0.2 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023. \n\nTotal depreciation expense related to devices out on lease was $0.4 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023.

Under the Agreement, the Selling Shareholders agreed to sell all of the outstanding common stock of Kestrel (the “Kestrel Shares”) to the Company. The consideration for the Kestrel Shares consisted of $16.1 million cash and 1,467,785 shares of the Company’s common stock (the “Zynex Shares”). All of the Zynex Shares were subject to a lock-up agreement for a period of one year from the closing date under the Agreement (the “Closing Date”). The Agreement provides the Selling Shareholders with piggyback registration rights. 978,524 of the Zynex Shares were deposited in escrow (the “Escrow Shares”). The number of Escrow Shares were subject to adjustment on the one-year anniversary of the Closing Date (or in connection with any Liquidation Event (as defined in the Agreement) that occurs prior to such anniversary date) based on the number of shares equal to $10.0 million divided by a 30-day volume weighted average closing price of the Company’s common stock. The Escrow Shares were adjusted on the anniversary date, which resulted in the cancellation of 156,673 Escrow Shares. Half of the Escrow Shares were to be released on submission of a dossier on a laser-based photoplethysmographic device (the “Device”) to the FDA for permission to market and sell the Device in the United States. The other half of the Escrow Shares were to be released upon determination by the FDA that the Device can be marketed and sold in the United States.\n\nOn July 27, 2023, the Company, ZMS, Kestrel, and the Selling Shareholders, entered into an amendment to the Stock Purchase Agreement (the “Amendment”). The parties entered into the Amendment to modify certain terms of the Agreement related to the conditions to be satisfied for the release of the Escrow Shares to the Selling Shareholders. The Escrow Shares were released from escrow, simultaneously, the selling stockholders entered into a lock-up agreement. The lock-up agreement includes two lock-up periods which release certain restrictions on the Selling Shareholders on December 31, 2023 and June 30, 2024, respectively. \n\nThe amount of Escrow Shares were recalculated at March 31, 2023, and are included in the calculation of diluted earnings per share. No additional calculation was required at March 31, 2024, as the Escrow Shares were released from escrow, and the shares are included in the Company’s calculation of basic earnings per share. \n\nThe acquisition of Kestrel has been accounted for as a business combination under ASC 805 – “Business Combinations” (“ASC 805”). Under ASC 805, assets acquired, and liabilities assumed in a business combination must be recorded at their fair values as of the acquisition date.\n\n​\n\n14\n\n​\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC)\n\n**ZYNEX, INC.**\n\n**NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS**\n\n**(7)****GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS**\n\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2021 the Company completed the acquisition of Kestrel, which resulted in Goodwill of $20.4 million (see Note 6 – Business Combinations).\n\nAs of March 31, 2024, there was no change in the carrying amount of goodwill, and there were no impairment indicators of the Company’s net asset value. \n\nThe following table provides the summary of the Company’s intangible assets as of March 31, 2024.\n\n​\n\n​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​  \n---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \n​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| **Weighted-**  \n​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| **Average**  \n​| **Gross**|  ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| **Remaining**  \n​| **Carrying**| **Accumulated**| **Net Carrying**| **Life (in**  \n​| **Amount**| **Amortization**| **Amount**| **years)**  \nAcquired patents at December 31, 2023| ​| $|  10,000| ​| $|  (1,842)| ​| $|  8,158| ​|  9.00  \nAmortization expense| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​|  (226)| ​| ​|  (226)| ​| ​  \nAcquired patents at March 31, 2024| ​| $|  10,000| ​| $|  (2,068)| ​| $|  7,932|  8.73  \n  \n​\n\nThe following table summarizes the estimated future amortization expense to be recognized over the remainder of 2024, next five fiscal years, and periods thereafter:\n\n​\n\n​| ​| ​| ​  \n---|---|---|---  \n​| **(In thousands)**  \nApril 1, 2024 through December 31, 2024| ​| ​|  684  \n2025| ​|  908  \n2026| ​|  908  \n2027| ​|  908  \n2028| ​|  911  \nThereafter| ​|  3,613  \nTotal future amortization expense| ​| $|  7,932  \n  \n​\n\n​\n\n**(8)****EARNINGS PER SHARE**\n\nBasic earnings per share are computed by dividing net income by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period.

For the three months ended March 31, 2024 discrete items \n\n19\n\n​\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC)\n\n**ZYNEX, INC.**\n\n**NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS**\n\nadjusted were minimal. For the three months ended March 31, 2023 discrete items adjusted were $1.5 million. At March 31, 2024, the Company is estimating an annual effective tax rate of approximately 25%. As of March 31, 2023 the Company estimated an annual effective tax rate of approximately 25%. Each quarter, the estimate of the annual effective tax rate is updated, and if the estimated effective tax rate changes, a cumulative adjustment is made. There is a potential for volatility of the effective tax rate due to various factors.\n\nThe provision for income taxes is recorded at the end of each interim period based on the Company’s best estimate of its effective income tax rate expected to be applicable for the full fiscal year. The Company’s effective income tax rate was 23% and 2% for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Discrete items, primarily related to the tax impact of stock option exercises were minimal for the three months ending March 31, 2024. Discrete items related to the tax impact of the change in fair value of contingent consideration and stock option exercises were $0.4 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023, which are recognized as a benefit against income tax expense. For the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company recorded an income tax expense of approximately $3,000 and an income tax expense of $33,000, respectively.\n\nNo taxes were paid during the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023.\n\n**(13)****LEASES**\n\nThe Company categorizes leases at their inception as either operating or financing leases. Leases include various office and warehouse facilities which have been categorized as operating leases while certain equipment is leased under financing leases.\n\nDuring February 2023, the Company entered into a lease agreement for approximately 41,427 square feet of office space for the operations of ZMS in Englewood, CO. The lease commenced on July 1, 2023 and runs through December 31, 2028. At the expiration of the lease term the Company has the option to renew the lease for one additional five year period. The Company is entitled to rent abatements for the first six months of the lease and tenant improvement allowances. Payments based on the initial rate of $24.75 per square foot begin in January 2024. The price per square foot increases by an additional $0.50 during each subsequent twelve-month period of the lease after the abatement period. Upon lease commencement, the Company recorded an operating lease liability of $4.2 million and a corresponding right-of-use asset for $2.8 million. \n\nThe Company’s operating leases do not provide an implicit rate, and therefore the Company uses its incremental borrowing rate as the discount rate when measuring the lease liability. The incremental borrowing rate represents an estimate of the interest rate the Company would incur at lease commencement to borrow an amount equal to the lease payments on a collateralized basis over the term of a lease. The Company’s weighted average borrowing rate was determined to be 4.80% for its operating lease liabilities. The Company’s equipment lease agreements have a weighted average rate of 2.83% which was used to measure its finance lease liability. The weighted average remaining lease term was 4.08 years and 3.73 years for operating and finance leases, respectively, as of March 31, 2024.\n\n​\n\nAs of March 31, 2024, the maturities of the Company’s future minimum lease payments were as follows (in thousands):\n\n​\n\n​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​  \n---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \n​| **Operating Lease Liability**| **Finance Lease Liability**  \nApril 1, 2024 through December 31, 2024| ​|  3,454| ​|  82  \n2025| ​|  4,632| ​|  169  \n2026| ​|  4,428| ​|  108  \n2027| ​|  4,237| ​|  93  \n2028| ​|  2,172| ​|  93  \nThereafter| ​| ​|  —| ​| ​|  —  \nTotal undiscounted future minimum lease payments| ​| $|  18,923| ​| $|  545  \nLess: difference between undiscounted lease payments and discounted lease liabilities:| ​|  (1,858)| ​|  (15)  \nTotal lease liabilities| ​| $|  17,065| ​| $|  530  \n  \n​\n\n20\n\n​\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC)\n\n**ZYNEX, INC.**\n\n**NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS**\n\nThe components of lease expenses were as follows:\n\n​\n\n​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​  \n---|---|---|---|---|---  \n​| **Three Months Ended**  \n​| **March 31,**  \n​| **2024**|  ​| **2023**  \n**Lease cost:**|  ​| ​| ​| ​| ​  \nOperating lease cost:| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​  \nTotal operating lease expense| $|  894| $|  1,121  \nFinance lease cost:| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​  \nTotal amortization of leased assets| ​|  50| ​| ​|  30  \nInterest on lease liabilities| ​|  4| ​| ​|  7  \nTotal net lease cost| $|  948| ​| $|  1,158  \n  \n​\n\nFor the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, $0.8 million and $1.0 million, respectively, of operating lease costs were included in selling, general and administrative expenses on the condensed consolidated statement of income.

For the same period in 2023, the Company sourced approximately 39% of the supplies for its electrotherapy products from three significant vendors.\n\nAt March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023 the Company had no gross receivables from any third-party payers that made up over 10% of the net accounts receivable balance. \n\n**(15)****COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES**\n\nSee Note 13 for details regarding commitments under the Company’s long-term leases.\n\nFrom time to time, the Company may become party to litigation and other claims in the ordinary course of business. To the extent that such claims and litigation arise, management would accrue the estimated exposure for such events when losses are determined to be both probable and estimable. On occasion, the Company engages outside counsel related to a broad range of topics including employment law, third-party payer matters, intellectual property and regulatory and compliance matters. \n\nThe Company is currently not a party to any material pending legal proceedings that would give rise to potential loss contingencies.\n\n​\n\n​\n\n​\n\n**(16)****SUBSEQUENT EVENTS**\n\nThere were no subsequent events identified through April 30, 2024.\n\n​\n\n​\n\n​\n\n21\n\n​\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC)\n\n**ITEM 2.

Net revenue increased 10% for the three months ended March 31, 2024. For the three months ended March 31, 2024, device orders increased 23% from the same period in 2023. Net income was $10,000 for the three months ended March 31, 2024 compared with net income of $1.6 million during the same period in 2023. Cash provided by operating activities was $2.1 million during the three months ended March 31, 2024 compared with $1.9 million during the same period in 2023. Working capital was $56.2 million and $69.3 million as of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively.\n\n**Net Revenue**\n\nNet revenues are comprised of device and supply sales, constrained by estimated third-party payer reimbursement deductions. The reserve for billing allowance adjustments and allowance for uncollectible accounts are adjusted on an ongoing basis in conjunction with the processing of third-party payer insurance claims and other customer collection history. Product device revenue is primarily comprised of sales and rentals of our electrotherapy products and also includes complementary products such as our cervical traction, lumbar support and hot/cold therapy products.\n\nSupplies revenue is primarily comprised of sales of our consumable supplies to patients using our electrotherapy products, consisting primarily of surface electrodes and batteries. Revenue related to both devices and supplies is reported net, after adjustments for estimated third-party payer reimbursement deductions and estimated allowance for uncollectible accounts. The deductions are known throughout the healthcare industry as billing adjustments whereby the healthcare insurers unilaterally reduce the amount they reimburse for our products as compared to the sales prices charged by us. The deductions from gross revenue also take into account the estimated denials, net of resubmitted billings of claims for products placed with patients which may affect collectability. See our Significant Accounting Policies in Note 2 to the condensed financial statements for a more complete explanation of our revenue recognition policies.\n\nWe occasionally receive, and expect to continue to receive, refund requests from insurance providers relating to specific patients and dates of service. Billing and reimbursement disputes are very common in our industry. These requests are sometimes related to a few patients and other times include a significant number of refund claims in a single request. We review and evaluate these requests and determine if any refund is appropriate. We also review claims that have been resubmitted or where we are pursuing additional reimbursement from that insurance provider. We frequently have significant offsets against such refund requests which may result in amounts that are due to us in excess of the amounts of refunds requested by the insurance providers. Therefore, at the time of receipt of such refund requests we are generally unable to determine if a refund request is valid.\n\nNet revenue increased $4.4 million or 10% to $46.5 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024, from $42.2 million for the same period in 2023. For the three months ended March 31, 2024, the growth in net revenue from the same period in 2023 is primarily related to a 23% growth in device orders during the three months ended March 31, 2024 and a 43% growth in device orders during the year ended December 31, 2023, which resulted from a larger customer base and led to increased sales of consumable supplies.\n\n**Device Revenue**\n\nDevice revenue is related to the sale or lease of our products. Device revenue increased $2.1 million or 17% to $14.0 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024, from $11.9 million for the same period in 2023.\n\nFor the three months ended March 31, 2024, the growth in net revenue from the same period in 2023 is primarily related to a 23% growth in device orders.\n\n**Supplies Revenue**\n\nSupplies revenue is related to the sale of supplies, primarily electrodes and batteries, for our electrotherapy products. Supplies revenue increased $2.3 million or 8% to $32.5 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024, from $30.2 million for the same period in 2023.\n\nThe increase in supplies revenue is primarily related to an increased customer base from increased device orders in 2023 and Q1 2024.\n\n23\n\n​\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC)\n\n**Operating Expenses**\n\n**Cost of Revenue – Devices and Supplies**\n\nCost of Revenue – devices and supplies consist primarily of device and supply costs, facilities, operations labor and overhead, shipping and depreciation. Cost of revenue for the three months ended March 31, 2024 remained flat at $9.3 million from the same period in 2023. As a percentage of revenue, cost of revenue – devices and supplies decreased to 20% from 22% for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\n\nThe decrease in cost of revenue – devices and supplies as percentage of revenue for the three months ended March 31, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023 is due to increased volumes and expanding our supplier portfolio mix, both of which have allowed us to negotiate lower costs.\n\n**Sales and Marketing Expense**\n\nSales and marketing expenses primarily consist of employee-related costs, including commissions and other direct costs associated with these personnel including travel expenses and marketing campaign and related expenses.\n\nSales and marketing expense for the three months ended March 31, 2024 increased $2.2 million or 10% to $23.4 million from $21.2 million for the same period in 2023. The increase in sales and marketing expense is primarily due to increased commission pay from increased orders, increased wages from increased headcount in our sales operations department, and increases due to rising wages in the U.S. due to a very competitive job market. As a percentage of revenue, sales and marketing expense remained flat at 50% for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, primarily due to the aforementioned expenses, offset by increased revenue.\n\n**General and Administrative Expense**\n\nGeneral and administrative expenses primarily consist of employee-related costs, and other direct costs associated with these personnel including facilities and travel expenses and professional fees, depreciation and amortization. General and administrative expense for the three months ended March 31, 2024 increased $1.9 million or 17% to $13.3 million from $11.4 million for the same period in 2023. The increase in general and administrative expense for the three months ended March 31, 2024 is primarily due to increased compensation and benefit expense related to headcount growth within the reimbursement departments, ZMS and the corporate office. As a percentage of revenue, general and administrative expense increased to 29% for the three months ended March 31, 2024 from 27% for the same period in 2023. The increase as a percentage of revenue is primarily due to the items noted above, partially offset by the increase in revenue during the period. \n\n**Income Taxes**\n\nThe provision for income taxes is recorded at the end of each interim period based on the Company’s best estimate of its effective income tax rate expected to be applicable for the full fiscal year. The Company’s effective income tax rate was 23% and 2% for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Discrete items, primarily related to the tax impact of stock option exercises were minimal for the three months ending March 31, 2024. Discrete items related to the tax impact of the change in fair value of contingent consideration and stock option exercises were $0.4 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023, which are recognized as a benefit against income tax expense. For the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company recorded an income tax expense of approximately $3,000 and an income tax expense of $33,000, respectively.\n\n​\n\n**LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES**\n\nWe have historically financed operations through cash flows from operations, debt and equity transactions. At March 31, 2024, our principal source of liquidity was $32.9 million in cash and cash equivalents and $25.4 million in accounts receivable.\n\nNet cash provided by operating activities for the three months ended March 31, 2024 was $2.1 million compared with net cash provided by operating activities of $1.9 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023. The increase in cash provided by operating activities for the three months ended March 31, 2024 was primarily due to a decrease in the receivables balance and an \n\n24\n\n​\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC)\n\nincrease in accounts payable. The increase was partially offset by the decrease in net income for the quarter ended March 31, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023.\n\nNet cash used in investing activities for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023 was $0.2 million. Cash used in investing activities for the three months ended March 31, 2024 was primarily related to the purchase of property and equipment related to the build out of our facility for the operations of ZMS. Cash used in investing activities for the three months ended March 31, 2023 was primarily related to the purchase of property and equipment.\n\nNet cash used in financing activities for the three months ended March 31, 2024 was $13.6 million compared with net cash used in financing activities of $5.1 million for the same period in 2023. Net cash provided by financing activities for the three months ended March 31, 2024 was primarily due to purchases of $13.3 million in treasury stock. Net cash used in financing activities for the three months ended March 31, 2023 was primarily due to purchases of $3.4 million in treasury stock, and principal payments on term debt totaling $1.3 million.\n\nWe believe our cash and cash equivalents, together with anticipated cash flow from operations will be sufficient to meet our working capital, and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next twelve months. In making this assessment, we considered the following:\n\n●| Our cash and cash equivalents balance at March 31, 2024 of $32.9 million;  \n---|---  \n●| Our working capital balance of $56.2 million;  \n---|---  \n●| Our projected income and cash flows for the next 12 months.  \n---|---  \n  \n**CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES**\n\nOur discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\n\nPlease refer to the “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation” and Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements located within our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on March 12, 2024.\n\n**COVID-19 UPDATE**\n\nIn December 2019, a novel strain of coronavirus (“COVID-19”) emerged and spread to other countries, including the United States. In March 2020, the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 as a pandemic (the “COVID-19 pandemic”). The COVID-19 pandemic, including multiple variants, resulted in governments around the world implementing stringent measures to help control the spread of the virus, including quarantines, “shelter in place” and “stay at home” orders, travel restrictions, business interruptions and other measures.\n\nAlthough the World Health Organization declared an end to the COVID-19 pandemic on May 5, 2023, we continue to actively monitor the impact of COVID-19. While the Company did not incur significant disruptions to its operations during the three months ended March 31, 2024 from COVID-19, the full extent of COVID-19 on our operations and the markets we serve remains uncertain and will depend largely on future developments related to COVID-19, including infection rates increasing or returning in various geographic areas, variations of COVID-19, actions by government authorities to contain the outbreak or treat its impact, such as reimposing previously lifted measures or putting in place additional restrictions, and the widespread distribution and acceptance of an effective vaccine, among other things. Future developments regarding COVID-19 and its effects cannot be accurately predicted.\n\n​\n\n**ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK**\n\nN/A.\n\n​\n\n**ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES**\n\nDisclosure Controls and Procedures\n\n _Evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures_\n\n25\n\n​\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC)\n\nOur management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, have evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934), as amended, or the Exchange Act, as of March 31, 2024. Based on management’s review, with participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that, as of the quarter ended March 31, 2024, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective due to the material weakness in internal control over financial reporting as described below.\n\n_Material Weakness in Internal Control_\n\nA material weakness is a control deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the Company's annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. The following material weaknesses have been identified and included in “Management's Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting”:\n\n​\n\nIt was determined that as of December 31, 2023, the Company's primary change management controls were not designed and implemented effectively to ensure IT program and data changes affecting the Company’s financial IT applications and underlying accounting records, are identified, tested, authorized and implemented appropriately to validate that data produced by its relevant IT system(s) were complete and accurate Other Information Technology General Controls, automated process-level controls, and manual controls that are dependent upon the information derived from such financially relevant systems were also determined to be ineffective as a result of such deficiency. Business process controls (automated and manual) that are dependent on the affected ITGCs were also deemed ineffective because they could have been adversely impacted;\n\n​\n\nIneffective design and implementation of controls over the valuation of accounts receivable to properly address the risk of material misstatement.\n\n​\n\nThe material weaknesses identified above did not result in any material misstatements in our financial statements or disclosures, and there were no changes to previously released financial results. Our management concluded that the consolidated financial statements included in the Annual Report on Form 10-K, present fairly, in all material respects, our financial position, results of operations, and cash flows for the periods presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, or U.S. GAAP. \n\nThe effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023, has been audited by Marcum LLP as stated in their report, which is included in Item 8 of the Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n\n_Remediation Plan_\n\nOur management is committed to maintaining a strong internal control environment. In response to the identified material weakness above, management will take comprehensive actions to remediate the material weakness in internal control over financial reporting. We are in the process of developing and implementing remediation plans to address the material weakness described above.\n\n_Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting_\n\nExcept for the items referred to above, there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation required by Rule 13a-15(d) and 15d-15(d) of the Exchange Act that occurred during the quarter ended March 31, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal controls over financial reporting.\n\n_Inherent Limitation on the Effectiveness of Internal Control_\n\nOur management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, do not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system will be met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of a simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people or by management override of the controls. The design of any system of controls is also based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions; over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance with policies or procedures may deteriorate. Due to inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.\n\n26\n\n​\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC)\n\n​\n\n**PART II.

The program was fully utilized during the Company's first quarter.\n\nOn February 29, 2024, the Company announced that its board of directors had approved a repurchase program of up to $20.0 million of the Company’s common stock (the “March 2024 Repurchase Program”) beginning on March 4, 2024, and continuing through the earlier of March 4, 2025, or when all $20.0 million worth of shares have been repurchased.\n\nUnder the Company’s repurchase programs, the Company may repurchase its common stock from time to time in open market and negotiated transactions. Repurchases will be made subject to market conditions, available liquidity, cash flow, applicable legal requirements, and other factors. The specific prices, numbers of shares, and timing of purchase transactions will be determined by the Company from time to time. The repurchase programs do not obligate the Company to acquire any particular amount of common stock and may be suspended or discontinued at any time. The repurchase programs are intended to comply with Rule 10b-18 promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.\n\nThe following table sets forth a summary of the Company’s purchases of common stock during the first quarter of 2024 pursuant to the Company’s authorized share repurchase programs:\n\n​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​  \n---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \n​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​  \n​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| **Total Number of**|  ​| **In Thousands**  \n​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| **Shares**|  ​| **Maximum Value**  \n​| ​| ​| ​| **Purchased as**| **of Shares That**  \n​| ​| **Total**|  ​| **Average**|  ​| **Part of a**|  ​| **May Yet Be**  \n​| ​| **Number of**|  ​| **Price**|  ​| **Publicly**|  ​| **Purchased**  \n​| ​| **Shares**|  ​| **Paid Per**|  ​| **Announced**|  ​| **Under the**  \n**Period**|  ​| **Purchased**|  ​| **Share**|  ​| **Plan**|  ​| **Plan**  \nJanuary 1 - January 31, 2024| ​| ​  \nShare repurchase program (1)| ​|  458,000| ​| $|  10.90|  1,470,200|  5,426  \n​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​  \nFebruary 1 - February 29, 2024| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​  \nShare repurchase program (1)| ​|  363,000| ​| $|  12.58| ​|  1,833,200| ​|  859  \n​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​  \nMarch 1 - March 31, 2024| ​| ​  \nShare repurchase program (1)| ​|  66,820| ​| $|  12.86| ​|  1,900,020| ​|  —  \nShare repurchase program (2)|  234,015| ​| $|  12.83|  234,015|  16,997  \n​| ​  \nQuarter Total| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​  \n​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​  \nShare repurchase program (1)| ​|  887,820| ​| $|  11.73| ​|  1,900,020| ​|  —  \nShare repurchase program (2)| ​|  234,015| ​| $|  12.83| ​|  234,015| ​|  16,997  \n  \n27\n\n​\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC)\n\n(1)| Shares were purchased through the Company’s publicly announced November 2023 Repurchase Program.

(NASDAQ: ZYXI), an innovative medical technology company specializing in the manufacture and sale of non-invasive medical devices for pain management, rehabilitation, and patient monitoring, today reported its financial and operational results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2024.\n\n[ ![Zynex](https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/373722/Zynex_Medical_Logo.jpg) ](https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/373722/Zynex_Medical_Logo.html)\n\n**Key Third Quarter Highlights and Business Update**\n\n  * Q3 2024 orders increased 13% year-over-year.\n  * Q3 2024 net revenue of $50.0 million.\n  * Q3 2024 net income of $2.4 million; Diluted EPS $0.07.\n  * Q3 2024 cash flow from operations of $7.1 million.\n  * Received FDA Clearance for new TensWave device.\n\n\n\n**Management Commentary**\n\n\"In the third quarter of 2024 we continued our steady growth in orders as we positioned the company for long-term profitable growth,\" said Thomas Sandgaard, President and CEO of Zynex. \"Positive cash flow remains strong and both revenue and earnings were within guidance for the third quarter.\n\n\"Our Pain Management division delivered a 13% improvement in orders year-over-year. We continue to see success evolving our pain management division to achieve our strategic goal of diversifying revenue streams through increased orders in orthopedic products. Revenue per sales rep increased 25% year-over-year to approximately $530,000 in the third quarter of 2024. We are working to expedite the onboarding of new sales reps while maintaining a high standard for productivity.\n\n\"Our focus on FDA approvals of next-generation devices and new therapy products delivered FDA clearance of our new TensWave device during the quarter. FDA clearance for the new TensWave device builds on our strong legacy of innovation in pain management, providing effective pain relief through TENS (Transcutaneous Electrical Nerve Stimulation) therapy, which has been clinically proven to reduce chronic and acute pain without opioids. We recognized a gap in the market for a high-quality TENS device that meets the specific criteria for insurance reimbursement, and TensWave is our answer to that demand. It complements our flagship multi-modality device, the NexWave, where Interferential current is the main modality and driver of obtaining prescriptions. This device broadens our product portfolio with the potential to become an essential tool for patients suffering from chronic pain conditions, offering them a safe, effective, and drug-free alternative to pain management.\n\n\"Looking ahead, we will continue to diversify our pain management revenue stream with the introduction of new therapy products. Aggressive promotion of products from our salesforce will ensure sustained profitable growth. In 2025, we should return to our normal top-line growth in our pain management division of approximately 20%. Taken together, we believe our strategy is positioning us to become the world's premier provider of holistic, non-invasive approaches to pain management,\" concluded Sandgaard.\n\n**Third Quarter 2024 Financial Results**\n\nNet revenue was $50.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to $49.9 million in the prior year quarter.\n\nGross profit in the quarter ended September 30, 2024, was $39.8 million, or 80% of revenue, as compared to $40.4 million or 81% of revenue, in 2023.\n\nSales and marketing expense for the three months ended September 30, 2024, decreased 6% to $20.7 million from $22.1 million for the same period in 2023, primarily due to decreased headcount in the sales force.\n\nGeneral and administrative expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024, were $15.3 million, versus $12.7 million in the prior year period.\n\nNet income for the three months ended September 30, 2024, totaled $2.4 million, or $0.07 per basic and diluted share, as compared to net income of $3.6 million, or $0.10 per basic and diluted share, in the quarter ended September 30, 2023.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA for the three months ended September 30, 2024, was $5.1 million, as compared to $7.3 million in the quarter ended September 30, 2023.\n\nCash flows from operations for the three months ended September 30, 2024, was $7.1 million and $10.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024.\n\nAs of September 30, 2024, the Company had working capital of $58.5 million. Cash and cash equivalents were $37.6 million at September 30, 2024, up 22% from June 30, 2024.\n\n**Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2024 Guidance**\n\nFourth quarter 2024 revenue is estimated to be at least $53.6 million.

In addition, the Company is providing in this news release financial information in the form of Adjusted EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, other income/expense, stock compensation, restructuring, receivables adjustment and non-cash lease charges). Management believes these non-GAAP financial measures are useful to investors and lenders in evaluating the overall financial health of the Company in that they allow for greater transparency of additional financial data routinely used by management to evaluate performance. Adjusted EBITDA can be useful for investors or lenders as an indicator of available earnings. Non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered in isolation from, or as an alternative to, the financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP.\n\n**Safe Harbor Statement**\n\nThis press release contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, as amended. our results of operations and the plans, strategies and objectives for future operations; the timing and scope of any potential stock repurchase; and other similar statements.\n\nWords such as \"anticipate,\" \"believe,\" \"continue,\" \"could,\" \"designed,\" \"endeavor,\" \"estimate,\" \"expect,\" \"intend,\" \"may,\" \"might,\" \"plan,\" \"potential,\" \"predict,\" \"project,\" \"seek,\" \"should,\" \"target,\" \"preliminary,\" \"will,\" \"would\" and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements.
