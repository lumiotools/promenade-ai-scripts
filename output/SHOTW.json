Unless stated\notherwise or as the context otherwise requires, all references to dollar amounts in this prospectus and any prospectus supplement are references to United States dollars.\nReferences to “$”, “US$” or “USD” are to United States dollars.\nMarket and Industry Data\nUnless otherwise indicated, information contained in this prospectus supplement, the accompanying prospectus or in documents incorporated by reference the\nprospectus supplement or the accompanying prospectus concerning the Company’s industry and the markets in which it operates or seeks to operate is based on information from\nthird party sources, industry reports and publications, websites and other publicly available information, and management studies and estimates. Unless otherwise indicated, the\nCompany’s estimates are derived from publicly available information released by third party sources as well as data from the Company’s own internal research, and include\nassumptions which the Company believes to be reasonable based on management’s knowledge of the Company’s industry and markets. The Company’s internal research and\nassumptions have not been verified by any independent source, and the Company has not independently verified any third-party information. While the Company believes that\nsuch third-party information to be generally reliable, such information and estimates are inherently imprecise. In addition, projections, assumptions and estimates of the Company’s\nfuture performance or the future performance of the industry and markets in which the Company operates are necessarily subject to a high degree of uncertainty and risk due to a\nvariety of factors, including those described in this prospectus supplement, in our most recently filed Annual Report on Form 10-K under “Risk Factors”.\nPresentation of Financial Information\nThe financial statements of the Company incorporated by reference in this prospectus supplement are presented in United States dollars and have been prepared in\naccordance with International Financial Reporting Standards, as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board, which we refer to as IFRS. Certain calculations included\nin tables and other figures in this prospectus supplement have been rounded for clarity of presentation.\nThe financing statements incorporated by reference herein have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. The Company has incurred\nrecurring losses and negative cash flows from operating activities since inception, such that as of September 30, 2024, the Company had accumulated losses of $101,558,757 and a\nnet loss in the amount of $35,878,042 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. As of the date of the issuance of these financial statements, the Company has not yet\ncommenced generating sufficient revenues to fund its operations, and therefore depends on fundraising from new and existing investors to finance its activities.\nConsidering the above, the Company’s dependency on external funding for its operations raises a substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going\nconcern. The condensed consolidated interim consolidated financial statements for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, incorporated by reference herein, do not include\nany adjustments that might result from the outcome of these uncertainties.\nS-iii\nSPECIAL NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS\nSome of the statements in this prospectus and in any prospectus supplement we may file constitute “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of Section 27A of\nthe Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Securities Act, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act. These statements relate to\nfuture events concerning our business and to our potential revenues, operating results, and financial condition. In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements by\nterminology such as “may”, “will”, “could”, “would”, “should”, “expect”, “plan”, “anticipate”, “intend”, “believe”, “estimate”, “forecast”, “predict”, “propose”, “potential”, or\n“continue” or the negative of those terms or other comparable terminology.\nAny forward-looking statements contained in this prospectus supplement or any prospectus supplement are only estimates or predictions of future events based on\ninformation currently available to our management and management’s current beliefs about the potential outcome of future events. Whether these future events will occur as\nmanagement anticipates, whether we will achieve our business objectives, and whether our potential revenues, operating results, or financial condition will improve in future\nperiods are subject to numerous risks. There are a number of important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results anticipated by these forward-\nlooking statements. These important factors include those that we discuss under the heading “Risk Factors” and in other sections of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal\nyear ended December 31, 2023, as well as in our other reports filed from time to time with the SEC that are incorporated by reference into this prospectus. You should read these\nfactors and the other cautionary statements made in this prospectus and in the documents we incorporate by reference into this prospectus as being applicable to all related\nforward-looking statements wherever they appear in this prospectus or the documents we incorporate by reference into this prospectus. Our actual results, performance or\nachievements may vary materially from any future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements.

This summary is not complete and does not contain all of the information that you should consider before deciding whether to invest in our Common Stocks. For a\nmore complete understanding of our company and this offering, we encourage you to read and consider carefully the more detailed information in this prospectus supplement\nand the accompanying prospectus, including the information included under the heading “Risk Factors” in this prospectus supplement beginning on page S-7, the information\nincluded under the heading “Risk Factors” in the accompanying prospectus beginning on page 14, and the information incorporated by reference in this prospectus\nsupplement and the accompanying prospectus, which is described under “Where You Can Find More Information” and “Incorporation of Information by Reference.”\nCompany Overview\nSafety Shot Inc. (NASDAQ: SHOT) was formerly known as Jupiter Wellness Inc. In August 2023, the Company successfully completed the asset purchase of the Safety Shot\nDietary Supplement from GBB Drink Lab, Inc. (“GBB”), thereby gaining ownership of various assets, including the intellectual property, trade secrets, and trademarks associated\nwith its dietary supplement (the “Safety Shot Dietary Supplement”). Concurrently with the asset purchase, the Company changed its name to Safety Shot, Inc. and changed its\nNASDAQ trading symbol to SHOT. The Company launched its e-commerce sale of the Safety Shot Dietary Supplement in December 2023. On October 9, 2024, the Company\nrenamed the Safety Shot Dietary Supplement as the “Sure Shot Dietary Supplement”\nThe Sure Shot Dietary Supplement has been formulated to reduce the accumulation of blood alcohol. Noteworthy is the fact that the Sure Shot Dietary Supplement comprises 28\nactive ingredients, all falling under the Generally Regarded As Safe (GRAS) category. Under sections 201(s) and 409 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the Act), any\nsubstance that is intentionally added to food is a dietary supplement, that is subject to premarket review and approval by the FDA, unless the substance is generally recognized,\namong qualified experts, as having been adequately shown to be safe under the conditions of its intended use, or unless the use of the substance is otherwise excepted from the\ndefinition of a dietary supplement.\nIt’s crucial to note that the Sure Shot Dietary Supplement is currently manufactured in a facility adhering to Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP), ensuring the highest standards\nof quality and safety throughout its production process. The Company currently maintains a workforce comprising eight full-time employees of its own.\nSpecializing in Consumer Packaged Goods, our focus centers on the commercialization of a 12-ounce product positioned as a dietary supplement. Beyond our existing product, we\nare actively pursuing a future product line, including a convenient powdered stick pack version and a 4-ounce version of the Sure Shot Dietary Supplement.\nThe Company has discontinued the historical product lines of Jupiter Wellness which included a diverse range of products, such as hair loss treatments, vitiligo solutions, and\nsexual wellness products, that catered to different health and wellness needs and our commitment to supporting health and wellness by developing innovative solutions to a range\nof conditions. In connection therewith, on September 24, 2024 the Company entered into a Separation and Exchange Agreement with its subsidiary Caring Brands, Inc. whereby\nCaring Brands will seek to commercialize this product line. Caring Brands will be responsible for all costs associated with the operation of that line of business. The Company will\nfocus its efforts on the commercialization of the Sure Shot Dietary Supplement. The Company will retain ownership of 3,000,000 shares of Caring Brands, Inc.\nThe Company entered into a stock exchange agreement (the “Exchange Agreement”) with SRM Entertainment, Inc. (“SRM”) to govern the separation of SRM and the Company.\nOn May 26, 2023, we amended and restated the Exchange Agreement (the “Amended and Restated Exchange Agreement”) to include additional information regarding the\ndistribution and the separation of SRM and the Company. The separation as set forth in the Amended and Restated Exchange Agreement with the Company closed August 14,\n2023. Pursuant to the Amended and Restated Exchange Agreement, on May 31, 2023, SRM issued to the Company 6,500,000 shares of SRM Common Stock (representing 79.3% of\nSRM’s outstanding shares of Common Stock) in exchange for 2 ordinary shares of SRM Ltd owned by the Company (representing all of the issued and outstanding ordinary\nshares of SRM) (the “Share Exchange”). On August 14, 2023, SRM consummated its Initial Public Offering (“IPO”), pursuant to which it sold 1,250,000 shares of its common stock\nat a price of $5.00 per share. In connection with the Share Exchange and SRM’s IPO, the Company distributed 2,000,000 shares of SRM’s common stock to the Company’s\nstockholders and certain warrant holders (out of the 6.5 million shares issued in May 2023) which occurred on the effective date of the Registration Statement but prior to the\nclosing of the IPO. Following such distribution, the Company owns 4.0 million of the 9,450,000 shares of common stock outstanding and SRM is now a minority owned subsidiary\nof the Company.\nTo achieve our mission, we rely on our team of highly skilled and experienced professionals who are committed to advancing our vision of health and wellness. Our team includes\nindividuals with scientific backgrounds, an experienced researcher, product developers, and business experts who collaborate to create new products and enhance existing ones.\nWe also seek to partner with industry leaders and organizations to gain access to the latest technologies and expand our reach.\nThe Sure Shot Dietary Supplement is currently sold through e-commerce and in stores such as BevMo!. In addition, we are seeking to collaborate with other companies to license\nour intellectual property, to create additional revenue streams and expand our global presence. At present, we do not experience concentration risk or dependence on major\ncustomers.\nWe maintain a diverse network of raw material suppliers integral to our production processes. Acquisition strategies encompass both direct procurement and collaborative efforts\nwith our co-packers. The selection of suppliers is contingent upon various factors, including ingredient specificity, availability, and other essential considerations. Notably, these\nsuppliers coincide with those currently providing materials to other facilities engaged in the manufacturing of drinks, powders, tablets, and capsules. Our roster of suppliers\ncomprises reputable entities such as Jiaherb, Compound Solutions, Kyowa-Hakko, Mitsubishi Ingredients, Nura, Sensapure Flavors, Brenntag, E3 Ingredients, Ingredients Online,\namong others. This strategic alliance with established industry players underscores our commitment to sourcing high-quality raw materials essential for the production of our\ninnovative product line. Furthermore, our approach to supplier relationships reflects a dedication to maintaining a seamless and reliable supply chain. We believe that this not only\nensures the consistency of our current offerings but also positions us favorably for future developments. The Management believes that as we continue to expand our product\nportfolio, we believe that these partnerships with trusted suppliers play a pivotal role in upholding the standards that we expect of our brand.\nS-1\nProducts Roadmap\nThe Sure Shot Dietary Supplement was launched on our own website and through Amazon in December 2023 and with several Big Box stores. The Company is advancing several\nproduct formats and formulations to continue to offer a wide array of products that can be purchased at various locations that coincide with consumer shopping habits. In\nparticular, the Company plans to continue to develop new flavors for each of its current SKUs (12oz., 4 oz. and “Stick Pack”. In addition, the current formula will be offered at\nvarious dosages and the Company plans to conduct additional research studies as follows: assessing varying dosages of the Sure Shot Dietary Supplement against body weight,\ngender and age, examining several current and proposed ingredients with respect to their specific role in reducing BAC and how they affect the enzymatic activity associated with\nthe metabolism of alcohol, and finally, examining additional markers with respect to improving post-alcohol consumption symptoms and feelings.\nThe Company intends to perform the additional research studies in Q2 and Q3 of 2025. The Company will continue to sponsor the studies and intends to work with the Center for\nApplied Health Sciences (“CAHS”) in Canfield, OH. The participants will be selected based upon the parameters of the individual studies and the Company will follow the same\nprotocols employed in the clinical trials at the CAHS described in more detail below in “Research and Development.”\nResearch and Development\nOur research and development team in continually looking to develop new therapeutic products, while continually improving and enhancing our existing products and product\ncandidates to address customer demands and emerging trends.\nWe have conducted extensive informal research and experimentation involving a substantial number of volunteers under the influence of alcohol. Our findings indicate that the\nSure Shot Dietary Supplement can reduce a person’s Blood Alcohol Content, as measured by the premier Breathalyzer on the market. We have recently completed our clinical trials\nof the Sure Shot Dietary Supplement which have shown a statistically significant reduction in the Blood Alcohol Content (“BAC”) of the participants. The observable\nenhancements in cognitive abilities among the test subjects have been carefully documented.\nThe clinical trials took place from January 29, 2024, through June 10, 2024, at the CAHS located at 6570 Seville Drive, Canfield, OH 44406. The clinical trials were sponsored and paid\nfor by the Company and consisted of 36 participants with a mean age of 36.3 years that were selected through advertising of the study. The Company did not inquire about the\nparticipants typical level of alcohol consumption but each participant had to qualify based upon a complete medical history questionnaire, release from physicians and submitting\nto a standard bloodwork panel. Each participant consumed exactly 100 mL of alcohol and the BAC of the participants ranged from 0.047 % to 0.068 %. The participants were not\nemployees of the Company nor affiliated with the Company in any way. The clinical trials were a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study that found that within 30\nminutes of the consumption of the Sure Shot Dietary Supplement, the monitored participants saw a statistically significant drop of p=.002 in BAC and continued to see measurable\ndrops in successive 30-minute increments. The results were measured by using a DOT-approved BACtrack S80 Breathalyzer on the participants to determine their BAC after\ningesting several alcoholic beverages, followed by drinking 12 ounces of the Sure Shot Dietary Supplement and then measuring the participants’ BAC 30 minutes later. In addition,\ncognitive responses were measured using the Visual Analogue Scale (“VAS”) and physical function assessed at the same intervals as the blood draws and breathalyzer\nassessments to correlate to function. The VAS consisted of a 10 cm, straight line with end points that measured from low-to-high for a number of physical feelings and sensations.\nThe participants were asked to mark a point on the line that corresponded with their experience. The distance from the end to the point marked by the participant was then\nmeasured in millimeters to quantify their level of sensation. On each visit, participants were asked to perform the VAS tests and the VAS assessed subjective ratings for head\ndiscomfort (headache), nausea, fatigue, energy, tiredness, thirst and ability to concentrate. The Company also conducted further physical assessment by monitoring biometric\nmeasurements such as blood pressure and heart rate at various intervals. The key assumptions in the study were that the participants would demonstrate a marked decrease in\nBAC following the consumption of the Sure Shot Dietary Supplement versus that of the placebo. In addition, the study assumed that the participants would feel better and\ndemonstrate marked improvement in cognitive skills and physical function following the consumption of the Sure Shot Dietary Supplement versus that of the placebo. The\nCompany had previously observed in our numerous, pre-clinical tests that participants who consumed significant amounts of alcohol (more than two drinks) experienced marked\nand rapid reductions in their BAC when measured by BACTrack S80 breathalyzers after consumption of the Sure Shot Dietary Supplement. In addition, the Company observed in\nthe pre-clinical tests that the participants showed significant improvement in motor function and reduction in slurred speech and other markers commonly associated with alcohol\nconsumption. These findings led the Company to continue to develop the Sure Shot Dietary Supplement and commission a clinical study to prove our hypothesis. There were five\nadverse events amongst the participants in the study. Four of the adverse events were associated with the Sure Shot Dietary Supplement (three felt nauseous and one developed a\nrash) and none of the adverse events were serious. The final adverse event was associated with congestion of the placebo.\nS-2\nSince approximately 2010, the Company has performed 100s of pre-clinical tests in an effort to develop and perfect the Sure Shot Dietary Supplement. These informal, pre-clinical\ntests included friends, family and other volunteers who consumed alcohol at varying levels and then were tested prior to the consumption of the Sure Shot Dietary Supplement.\nThe pre-clinical tests were neither peer reviewed nor were the subjects screened prior to their participation. In addition, the VAS was not used nor were there any placebos or other\ncontrol measures taken in the pre-clinical tests and as such these tests are considered informal and non-clinical. The participants’ BAC was measured by using the BacTrack S80\nafter the consumption of various amounts of alcohol and prior to the consumption of the Sure Shot Dietary Supplement and then at 30 minutes, 45 minutes and one-hour intervals\nafter consumption of the Sure Shot Dietary Supplement so we could assess the efficacy of the Company’s R&D efforts at that point in time. The Company also observed motor\nfunction skills such as walking, balancing and speech at the same intervals following the consumption of 12 ounces of the Sure Shot Dietary Supplement. The Company defined\nand noted the significant improvement in each area by observing participants’ walk and whether a participant’s gait was unsteady, or whether their balance was off while standing\nand whether their speech was clear or slurred. The Company incurred research and development expenses of $100,591 and $1,637,117 for the years ended December 31, 2022, and\n2023, respectively.\nSales and Marketing\nWe primarily sell our products through e-commerce websites including Amazon and through retail stores such as BevMo!. To drive loyalty, word-of-mouth marketing, and\nsustainable growth, we invest in customer experience and customer relationship management. Our marketing investments are directed towards driving profitable growth through\nadvertising, public relations, and brand promotion activities, including digital platforms, sponsorships, collaborations, brand activations, and channel marketing. Additionally, we\ncontinue to invest in our marketing and brand development efforts by investing capital expenditures on product displays to support our channel marketing via our retail partners.\nWe launched the Sure Shot Dietary Supplement in stores such as BevMo! in the second quarter of 2024.\nManufacturing, Logistics and Fulfillment\nWe outsource the manufacturing of our products to contract manufacturers, who produce them according to our formulation specifications. Our products are manufactured by\ncontract manufacturers in India and the US. The majority of our products will then be shipped to third-party warehouses and to our corporate offices, which can either transport\nthem to our distributors, retailers, or directly to our customers. Our third-party warehouses are located in the US. We use a limited number of logistics providers to deliver our\nproducts to both distributors and retailers, which allows us to lessen order fulfillment time, cut shipping costs, and improve inventory flexibility.\nOur Competitive Strengths\nWe are committed to driving continuous improvement through innovation. Since our inception, we have made significant investments in research and development and have\nacquired a substantial portfolio of intellectual property, which continues to grow each year.

By staying committed to innovation, we are confident in our ability to meet the\never-changing needs of the health and wellness market. We believe that the Sure Shot Dietary Supplement stands as a unique product in the liquid dietary supplement market.\nNevertheless, our competitive landscape includes many companies involved in the production of health and welfare products, including beverages.\nS-3\nIntellectual Property\nAs of the date hereof, the Company owns five patents, including the patent (US 9,186,350 B2) and patent (US 10,028,991 B2) for the composition of the Sure Shot Dietary\nSupplement used for minimizing the harmful effects associated with alcohol consumption by supporting the metabolism of alcohol.

We are unable to predict whether a component found in our product might be added to\nthe California list in the future. Furthermore, we are also unable to predict when or whether the increasing sensitivity of detection methodology may become applicable under this\nlaw and related regulations as they currently exist, or as they may be amended. If we are required to add warning labels to any of our products or place warnings in certain locations\nwhere our products are sold, it will be difficult to predict whether, or to what extent, such a warning would have an adverse impact on sales of our products in those locations or\nelsewhere. In addition, there has been increasing regulatory activity globally regarding constituents in packaging materials, including PFAS. Regardless of whether perceived\nhealth consequences of these constituents are justified, such regulatory activity could result in additional government regulations that impact the packaging of our beverages.\nIn addition, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (the “FDA”) has regulations with respect to serving size information and nutrition labeling on food and beverage products,\nincluding a requirement to disclose the amount of added sugars in such products and regulations about whether a product qualifies as a drug. Further, the U.S. Department of\nAgriculture promulgated regulations requiring that, by January 1, 2022, the labels of certain bioengineered foods include a disclosure that the food is bioengineered. These\nregulations may impact, reduce and/or otherwise affect the purchase and consumption of our products by consumers.\nAll ingredients in the Sure Shot Dietary Supplement are deemed Generally Recognized as Safe (GRAS) and align with FDA standards, permitting their inclusion in supplements. In\nthe event that the FDA or any governmental agency identifies an ingredient or aspect of our product as unsafe, we commit to promptly withdrawing that component in accordance\nwith regulatory directives. From a product and sales perspective, there are no impediments or concerns raised by any governmental agency. It is essential to note that the Sure\nShot Dietary Supplement is classified as a dietary supplement, exempt from the approval or filing requirements mandated for pharmaceutical drugs by the FDA or other regulatory\nauthorities.\nEmployees\nAs of this prospectus, we had eight full-time employees. We believe our relations with our employees to be good.\nProperties\nCurrently, we do not own any real property. We rent office space at 1061 E. Indiantown Rd., Ste. 110, Jupiter, FL 33477 for $15,038 per month. The Company entered into the office\nlease effective July 1, 2021, which has a primary term of the lease of five years with one renewal option for an additional three years. As part of the Separation Agreement, Caring\nBrands, Inc. has agreed to assume to lease obligations upon it reaching certain milestones.\nS-5\nTHE OFFERING\nSecurities offered by us 743,716 shares of Common Stock.\nOffering price per Common Stock $0.67 per Common Stock.\nCommon Stocks outstanding as of 61,191,357 shares of Common Stock.(1)\nNovember 21, 2024 before this\noffering\nCommon Stocks to be outstanding 61,896,824 shares of Common Stock.(1)\nimmediately after this offering\nUse of Proceeds We estimate that our net proceeds from this offering will be approximately $473,970, however, we are unable to predict the timing or amount\nof potential warrant exercises.

Before making an investment decision, you should carefully consider any risk factors set forth in the\napplicable prospectus supplement and the documents incorporated by reference in this prospectus, including the factors discussed under the heading “Risk Factors” in our (i)\nmost recent Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, as filed with the SEC on April 01, 2024 ; (ii) most recent quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the nine months\nended September 30, 2024, as filed with the SEC on November 14, 2024 and (ii) the Registration Statement on Form POS-AM, filed with SEC on February 09, 2024, as updated\nby our subsequent annual, quarterly and other reports and documents that are incorporated by reference into this prospectus. See “Where You Can Find More Information”\nand “Information We Incorporate By Reference.” Each of the risks described in these documents could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results\nof operations and prospects, and could result in a partial or complete loss of your investment. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us, or that we\ncurrently deem immaterial, may also adversely affect our business. In addition, past financial performance may not be a reliable indicator of future performance and historical\ntrends should not be used to anticipate results or trends in future periods.\nUSE OF PROCEEDS\nThe net proceeds to us, after deducting estimated fees and expenses of the offering, will be approximately $473,970. As of the date of this prospectus supplement, we\ncannot specify with certainty all of the particular uses of the proceeds from this offering. Accordingly, we will retain broad discretion over the use of such proceeds. There may be\ncircumstances where, for sound business reasons, a re-allocation of funds may be necessary or advisable. The actual amount that we spend in connection with each of the\nintended uses of proceeds may vary significantly from the amounts specified above. If we do not invest or apply the proceeds of this offering in ways that improve our operating\nresults, we may fail to achieve expected financial results, which could cause our share price to decline.\nS-7\nDILUTION\nIf you invest in this offering, your ownership interest will be diluted immediately to the extent of the difference between the offering price per Common Stock and the pro\nforma as adjusted net tangible book value per Common Stock immediately after this offering.\nOur net tangible book value is determined by dividing our total tangible assets, less total liabilities, by the number of our Common Stocks outstanding as of September 30,\n2024. Our net tangible book value as of September 30, 2024, was $6,378,488, or $0.11 per Common Stock. Dilution in net tangible book value per share represents the difference\nbetween the amount per share paid by purchasers of Common Stocks in this offering and the net tangible book value per share of our Common Stock immediately after this\noffering.\nAfter giving effect to the sale of the shares of Common Stock in this offering at a public offering price of $0.67 per Common Stock, after deducting estimated offering\nexpenses, after deducting estimated offering expenses, our pro forma as adjusted net tangible book value as of September 30, 2024, would have been approximately $6,852,458, or\napproximately $0.11 per Common Stock. This represents an immediate increase in net tangible book value of approximately $0.00 per Common Stock to our existing security holders\nand an immediate dilution in as adjusted net tangible book value of approximately $0.56 per share to purchasers of our Common Stocks in this offering, as illustrated by the\nfollowing table:\nOffering price per share $ 0.67\nNet tangible book value per share as of September 30, 2024 $ 0.11\nPro forma net tangible book value per share as of September 30, 2024 $ 0.11\nIncrease in net tangible book value per share attributable to this offering $ 0.00\nPro forma as adjusted net tangible book value per share as of September 30, 2024, after giving effect to this offering $ 0.11\nDilution in as adjusted net tangible book value per share to investors participating in this offering $ 0.56\nThe above discussion and table are based on approximately 59,482,554 shares of our common stock outstanding as of September 30, 2024 and does not include any\noptions, warrants or other convertible securities\nTo the extent that options and warrants outstanding as of September 30, 2024, have been or may be exercised or converted or we issue other shares, investors may\nexperience further dilution. In addition, we may seek to raise additional capital in the future through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities. To the extent we raise\nadditional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, the issuance of such securities could result in further dilution to our shareholders.\nS-8\nCAPITALIZATION\nThe following table sets forth our cash and cash equivalents and consolidated capitalization as of September 30, 2024:\n● On an actual basis; and\n● On an as adjusted pro forma basis to give effect to the sale of the shares of Common Stock in this offering at a public offering price of $0.67 per Common Stock, and after\ndeducting estimated offering expenses.\nThe pro forma as adjusted amounts shown below are unaudited and represent management’s estimate.

The Company’s clinical pipeline of prescription CBD-\nenhanced skin care therapeutics address indications including eczema, burns, herpes cold sores, and skin cancer. We are in the early stage of manufacturing, distributing, and\nmarketing a diverse line of consumer products infused with CBD. We have a proprietary, line of products: CaniSun, CaniSkin and CaniDermRX. Under the CaniSun brand, we are\nmarketing patent pending CBD-infused sun care lotion formulas containing various sun protection factors, or SPFs. In addition, we are exploring the use of CBD with other\nprescription and/or over-the-counter, or OTC, consumer products that have potentially therapeutic and medical applications. Specifically, we are exploring the use of such topical\nsolutions for the treatment of eczema, dermatitis (JW-100), and actinic keratosis (JW-_100), a non-prescription lotion/lip balm (JW-200) for the treatment of symptoms of cold sores,\nand a prescription product for the treatment of burns (JW-101). The CaniDermRX (JW-100) topical solution for the treatment of eczema dermatitis is the lead product candidate and\nwill be further tested in humans as an investigational cosmetic ingredient followed by clinical trials subject to the regulations of the United States Food and Drug Administration\n(“FDA”) under an investigational new drug, or IND, application.\nIn February 2021, we announced the results of our novel Cannabidiol-Aspartame combination treatment JW-100 clinical trial which has shown it significantly Reduces ISGA Score\nin Eczema patients. A double blinded placebo controlled interventional study was conducted. Subjects were assigned to apply, at home, one of three treatments: JW-100 (a CBD\nand aspartame combination topical formulation), a CBD only topical formulation, or a placebo topical formulation. After 14 days, the average reduction in the Investigators Static\nGlobal Assessment (ISGA) score was calculated for each group. Additionally, the proportion of subjects achieving (ISGA) score 0 (clear) or 1 (almost clear) with at least 2 grade\nimprovement from baseline was recorded for each arm of the study. 50% of subjects in the JW-100 arm achieved ISGA clear or almost clear (1 or 2) with at least a 2-grade\nimprovement from baseline after treatment versus 20% and 15% in the CBD-only and placebo arms, respectively. The percentage of subjects achieving clear or almost clear with at\nleast a 2-grade improvement from baseline was found to be statistically significant (p=0.028). JW-100, a novel topical formulation containing CBD and aspartame, was shown to\nsignificantly reduce ISGA score in atopic dermatitis patients after two weeks of use. The combination of CBD and aspartame was more effective at reducing ISGA scores than CBD\nalone. In parallel, we plan to initiate the development of other products. We originally anticipated developmental studies to be completed in 2020, however, these studies were\ndelayed due to COVID-19. We are also actively seeking to acquire or license products in the OTC skin care market that can be infused with CBD and marketed under our CaniSkin\nand CaniDermRX brand names. There can be no assurances that we will acquire or enter into such partnership or licensing agreements.\nIn November 2021, Jupiter Wellness received an official written response from a Type B pre-Investigational New Drug (IND) meeting with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration\n(FDA) for JW-100, a topical drug the treatment of eczema. The main purpose of the pre-IND meeting was to evaluate the drug development plan for JW-100. Jupiter Wellness\nbelieves that the written response from the FDA supports the Company’s approach and its overall drug development strategy to enable the filing of an IND for its clinical studies\non JW-100.\nOn November 16, 2021, Jupiter Wellness announced the results of a double-blinded placebo controlled clinical trial on JW-300 showing efficacy for the treatment of developing\nburns (sunburn).\nThe endocannabinoid system, which is a body system affected by CBD, plays a pivotal role in maintaining a healthy skin through modulating pain sensation, cell proliferation and\ninflammation. Our strategy for treatment of skin indications is, therefore, to focus on the use of CBD containing topical formulations and to explore potential combinations of CBD\nand other agents that may augment and act synergistically with CBD. We will explore this strategy by conducting controlled clinical trials to try to ultimately gain FDA approval for\nspecific indications.\nOn November 30, 2020, the Company acquired SRM Entertainment, Limited, a Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of the People’s Republic of China limited company\n(“SRM”). SRM has relationships with and supplies the amusement park industry with exclusive products that are often only available to consumers inside the relevant amusement\npark, entertainment venues and theme hotels in Orlando Florida, Beijing China, Japan and other places throughout the worldwide theme park industry.\n4\nOrganizational History\nJupiter Wellness, Inc. was originally incorporated in the State of Delaware on October 24, 2018. Our principal business address is 1061 E. Indiantown Rd., Suite. 110, Jupiter, FL\n33477.\nDescription of Business\nCompany Overview\nJupiter Wellness, Inc. is a cutting-edge developer of cannabidiol (CBD) based medical therapeutics and wellness products.

JW-\n100, a novel topical formulation containing CBD and aspartame, was shown to significantly reduce ISGA score in atopic dermatitis patients after two weeks of use. The\ncombination of CBD and aspartame was more effective at reducing ISGA scores than CBD alone.\n5\nIn parallel, we plan to initiate the development of other products. We originally anticipated developmental studies to be completed in 2020, however, these studies were delayed\ndue to COVID-19. We are also actively seeking to acquire or license products in the OTC skin care market that can be infused with CBD and marketed under our CaniSkin and\nCaniDermRX brand names. There can be no assurances that we will acquire or enter into such partnership or licensing agreements.\nThe endocannabinoid system, which is a body system affected by CBD, plays a pivotal role in maintaining a healthy skin through modulating pain sensation, cell proliferation and\ninflammation. Our strategy for treatment of skin indications is, therefore, to focus on the use of CBD containing topical formulations and to explore potential combinations of CBD\nand other agents that may augment and act synergistically with CBD. We will explore this strategy by conducting controlled clinical trials to try to ultimately gain FDA approval for\nspecific indications.\nOn November 30, 2020, the Company acquired SRM Entertainment, Limited, a Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of the People’s Republic of China limited company\n(“SRM”). SRM has relationships with and supplies the amusement park industry with exclusive products that are often only available to consumers inside the relevant amusement\npark, entertainment venues and theme hotels in Orlando Florida, Beijing China, Japan and other places throughout the worldwide theme park industry.\nCaniSun Brand\nUnder our CaniSun Brand, we developed a patent pending CBD-infused sunscreen with broad-spectrum SPF protection. We have completed lab testing for CBD solubility–\ninfusing clear, colorless, odorless, and 99.5% pure CBD isolate with three different sun care active ingredients, homosalate, octisalate and octocrylene, which have already been\napproved by the FDA. The CBD-infused sun care market is fairly nascent in the United States; we believe that there are currently no major competitors in the category. We see an\nopportunity to become the leading manufacturer of CBD-infused sun care products, marketing the CaniSun brand through an extensive digital and social media awareness\ncampaign. We announced the launch of our CaniSun sun care line of SPF 30, SPF 55 and SPF 50 face lotion on June 6, 2019. We also sell our CBD-infused lip balm and CBD-\ninfused SPF 30 sunscreen spray on our website Canisun.com.\nWe currently have additional CaniSun products in various stages of development as follows:\ni) CBD-infused SPF 30 Lip Balm, Peppermint and Acai Fragrance\nii)CBD-infused SPF 15 sunscreen daily lotion; and\niii)Mineral-based sunscreen lotions (SPF 30 and 50).\nAll of the products listed above are in the developmental stage, whereby we are finalizing the formula to be used in each product, respectively. For CBD-infused product\ncandidates in development, such as our CBD-infused SPF 30 Lip Balm and CBD-infused SPF 15 sunscreen lotion, we have already identified the sun care active ingredient formula\n(which has already been FDA approved) to be infused with CBD. Once the respective formulas for each of our product candidates are created, the product candidates will undergo\nthree months of stability testing. Provided that the product candidates pass the stability testing, we intend to sell the products on our CaniSun website. The formula for our\nmineral-based sunscreen lotion (SPF 30 and 50) (product iii) above) includes certain minerals instead of chemicals typically used in sunscreen lotions.\nOverall, we believe that our currently offered sunscreen products comply with the FDA Final Rule for sunscreen products under 21 CFR 352 Sunscreen products for Over-the-\nCounter Human Use. Therefore, we believe that our sunscreen products fall within the FDA monograph. Our products have been tested for SPF Evaluation (SPF rating), Critical\nWave Length (Broad Spectrum claim) and Water Resistance, each of which is defined within the monograph and labeled accordingly.\n6\nAll of the testing on these products is standard testing for suncare products. Such testing protocols are not intended to test for any effects of adding CBD. In addition to these\ntests that were conducted to support the claims on the package, each batch is also tested for appearance, color, odor, pH, viscosity, specific gravity, analytical for the sunscreen\nactive ingredients, and microbial content testing.\nOur products are tested each time they are manufactured. DCR Labs manufactures our products and has represented to us that it is compliant with the FDA’s Current Good\nManufacturing Practice, or CGMP, regulations in accordance with 21 CFR 210/211 required for Over-the-Counter drug products. DCR Labs has self-imposed health and safety\nstandards to ensure compliance with the FDA’s CGMPs.\nWe expect to continually update and expand upon our corporate website and further refine our online retail strategies on an ongoing basis. JupiterWellness.com is our primary\ncorporate website, which will serve as the primary source of information about us for investors and contain press releases, clinical trial pipeline, lab reports, blog posts, and\nadditional information about each of our brands. We anticipate that each brand will have its own front-facing website dedicated to retail sales and brand specific information. For\nexample, our line of sun care products, CaniSun, has its own website at CaniSun.com and allows for online retail purchase of the entire product line. As we expand our brands\n(CaniSkin and CaniDermRX), we anticipate utilizing the same strategy and dedicating a new e-commerce website to each brand moving forward. We are also building a website\ndedicated to servicing our wholesale and larger distributor clients. This website will have more information about each product and provide a central location for larger retailers to\nfind more in-depth information about all of our brands in one place.\nWe plan to leverage our websites with a social media presence across multiple platforms designed to utilize product reviews to increase brand loyalty, brand recognition and sales.\nThe references to our website in this prospectus are inactive textual references only. The information on our website is neither incorporated by reference into this prospectus nor\nintended to be used in connection with this offering. We also see growth potential in developing retail locations. We intend to utilize cross-promotion marketing campaigns with\nour products and product category expansion that leverages our existing distribution channels. We have built an e-commerce platform designed to connect us directly to\nconsumers. We use the platform to sell products, educate customers and build brand loyalty.\nCaniSkin Brand and CaniDermRX Brand\nWe are currently developing other products such as CBD-infused skin care lotion under the CaniSkin brand. Specifically, a CBD-infused moisturizing face serum is under\ndevelopment. We must first finalize the formula to be used in the face serum, and, once approved, the product candidate will undergo stability testing. We intend to sell the\nproduct, provided it first passes stability testing, on our website for CaniSkin products. Additionally, we are developing innovative dermatological treatments under the\nCaniDermRX brand that are specialized to treat atopic dermatitis and other dermatological conditions such as burns, skin cancer and herpes cold sores, respectively. Subject to\nobtaining FDA approval, we intend for our experimental-stage product for the treatment of atopic dermatitis to compete with Dupixent, an FDA-approved product for treating\natopic dermatitis, and for our experimental-stage product for the treatment of herpes cold sores to compete with Silvadene and Abreva, FDA-approved products for treating herpes\ncold sores. These products require more extensive testing to show both safety and efficacy.\nIn addition, we plan to seek acquisition opportunities in the branded consumer products space, including but not limited to other OTC therapeutic brands and skin care brands that\ncan be developed, manufactured, marketed and distributed under our CaniSkin and CaniDermRX brand names.\nWe filed a provisional patent number 62/884,955 on 08/09/2019 on an Aspartame/CBD combination and intend to develop products containing a combination of CBD and\nAspartame under the CaniDermRX name for the treatment of pain and inflammation. On February 11, 2021, the US Patent Published our US Patent Application 20210038513 and on\nApril 5, 2021 we filed the International filing through PCT Application PCT/US 2020/045408. On April 6, 2021, we filed a PCT Application No.: PCT/US2021/025947* on CBD\nsunscreens.\n7\nWe believe that our CaniDermRX product candidates have the potential to treat many skin indications such as atopic dermatitis, pruritis-itch, non-atopic dermatitis/eczema,\npsoriasis, dermatomyositis, scleroderma, seborrheic dermatitis, actinic keratosis, epidermolysis bullosa and cutaneous neoplasias. Aspartame is a rigorously tested food ingredient.\nReviews by major governmental regulatory bodies have previously found the ingredient safe for consumption at higher levels than we contemplate using in our CaniDermRX\nproduct candidates. We believe that our formulations that include Aspartame, such as topical crème, lip balm, powder and dog treats, are well-tolerated by, and safe for, users. We\nbelieve that infusing CBD in our products may help alleviate irritation that may be caused by applying sun care products and may lead to reduced inflammation. In human skin,\nreceptors of the endocannabinoid system are found in differentiated keratinocytes, hair follicle cells, sebaceous glands, immune cells, and sensory neurons. Activation of\ncannabinoid receptor type 2, or CB2, for which CBD is a ligand receptor in these cells has been shown to reduce pain and itch sensation, regulate keratinocyte differentiation and\nproliferation, decrease hair follicle growth, and modulate the release of damage-induced keratins and inflammatory mediators to control the homeostasis of the skin environment.\nMarket Opportunity\nThe market for hemp, and for products based on extracts of hemp, is expected to grow substantially over the coming years. It is estimated by BDS Analytics and Arcview Market\nResearch that the collective market for CBD sales in the U.S. will surpass $20 billion by 2024 and that there will be a compound annual growth rate of 49 percent by 2024 across all\ndistribution channels. We see great potential to grow and generate revenues in this expanding market.\nAccording to Grand View Research, the U.S. sun care market size was estimated at $1.95 billion in 2016. The growing consumer awareness regarding the ill-effects of over exposure\nto ultraviolet, or UV, rays on the undefended skin is expected to propel growth. The sun care market is a highly competitive market and product differentiation in the sun care\nmarket is low. Given the relatively low amount of product differentiation, we see an opportunity to carve out a unique market share with our CBD-infused sun care products. We\ncannot make any claims as to such benefits prior to performing certain testing. We see an opportunity, although there can be no assurance that we will be successful, to become\nthe leading manufacturer of CBD-infused sun care products, marketing the CaniSun brand through an extensive digital and social media awareness campaign. We announced the\nlaunch of our CaniSun sun care line of SPF 30, SPF 50 and SPF 55 face lotion on June 6, 2019. We also sell our CBD-infused lip balm and CBD-infused SPF 30 sunscreen spray on\nour website Canisun.com.\nMarket Strategy\nWe plan to seek acquisition opportunities in the branded consumer products space, including but not limited to other non-CBD OTC therapeutic brands and skin care brands that\ncan be manufactured, marketed and distributed under our CaniSkin and CaniDermRX brand names. We may market such products as they are currently comprised or may seek to\nadd CBD to the product. In the event we decide to add CBD to such products, we intend to first conduct FDA regulated clinical trials for safety and efficacy testing. We have no\ndefinitive agreements in place to acquire any other entities.\nWe also intend to sell the product online directly through our own website, and other third-party marketplaces as these sites permit.\nNidaria Distribution Agreement\nOn November 5, 2020, we entered into the Nidaria Distribution Agreement with Nidaria, Pursuant to which we purchase, market, promote, distribute and sell Nidaria’s Safe Sea®\nsunscreen that provides protection against jellyfish stings. Pursuant to the Nidaria Distribution Agreement, the Company shall serve as Nidaria’s exclusive distributor of Safe Sea\nin the state of Florida. The Nidaria Distribution Agreement shall have a term of two (2) years, commencing December 1, 2020, and may be renewed for one (1) additional year upon\nthe mutual consent of us and Nidaria. This agreement was not renewed for 2022 by mutual consent.\nWebsite\nWe expect to continually update and expand upon our corporate website and further refine our online retail strategies on an ongoing basis. Jupiterwellness.com is our primary\ncorporate website, which will serve as the primary source of information about us for investors and contain press releases, clinical trial pipeline, lab reports, blog posts, and\nadditional information about each of our brands. We anticipate that each brand will have its own front-facing website dedicated to retail sales and brand specific information. For\nexample, our line of sun care products, CaniSun, has its own website at CaniSun.com and allows for online retail purchase of the entire product line. As we expand our brands\n(CaniSkin and CaniDermRX), we anticipate utilizing the same strategy and dedicating a new e-commerce website to each brand moving forward. We are also building a website\ndedicated to servicing our wholesale and larger distributor clients. This website will have more information about each product and provide a central location for larger retailers to\nfind more in-depth information about all of our brands in one place.\n8\nSRM Acquisition\nOn November 30, 2020, we entered into and closed the Exchange Agreement with SRM, a Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of the People’s Republic of China limited\ncompany and wholly owned subsidiary of Vinco, and SRM Shareholders, pursuant to which we acquired 100% of the SRM Common Stock from the SRM Shareholders in exchange\nfor 200,000 shares of the Company’s common stock, the resale of which is subject to a leak out provision and escrow of 50,000 shares of the Company’s common stock. Upon\nclosing, and pursuant to the Exchange Agreement, the Company delivered the 150,000 shares of its common stock to SRM and placed 50,000 shares in escrow (“Escrow Shares”).\nPursuant to the Exchange Agreement, the Company shall release the Escrow Shares upon SRM generating $200,000 in cash receipts and revenue prior to January 15, 2021. The\nEscrow shares have not been released as of the date hereof. Pursuant to the Exchange Agreement, the Company assumed all of the financial obligations of SRM, as well as its\nemployees and offices. As a result of the Exchange Agreement, SRM became a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company.\nSRM has relationships with and supplies the amusement park industry with exclusive products such as toys, lights, fans and other items that are sold in amusement parks. SRM\nhas developed, manufactured and supplied the amusement park industry with exclusive products that are often only available to consumers inside the relevant amusement park,\nentertainment venues and theme hotels in Orlando Florida, Beijing China, Japan and other places throughout the worldwide theme park industry. . SRM has developed unique\nproducts in conjunction with suppliers of products for core licensed items for major well-known brands, themes, characters and movies.\nProducts developed by SRM are generally shipped directly to the theme park without warehousing at the Company’s facilities. SRM does not have long-term agreements with its\ncustomers, and instead develops products on an item-by-item basis subject to purchase orders from its customers.\nThrough SRM, we additionally intend to seek to sell our sun care products in the amusement parks. We are currently developing a line of non-CBD infused sun care products for\nsale in the amusement parks.\nSRM has four full time employees.\nCompetition\nThere are several companies developing cannabinoid therapeutics for a range of medical indications. The cannabinoid therapeutic area currently includes formulated extracts of the\nCannabis plant and synthetic formulations. These formulations include CBD and THC, or a combination of CBD/THC as the active pharmaceutical ingredient. Certain companies\nsuch as GW Pharmaceuticals, PLC have focused on hemp-based CBD formulations; while other companies such as Zynerba Pharmaceuticals Inc. and Insys Therapeutics Inc. have\nfocused on synthetic CBD formulations.\nThe CBD-based consumer product industry is highly fragmented with numerous companies, consisting of publicly- and privately-owned companies. There are also large, well-\nfunded companies that have indicated their intention to compete in the hemp-based product category in the U.S. We routinely evaluate internal and external opportunities to\noptimize value for stockholders through new product development or by asset acquisitions or sales, and believe we are well-positioned to capitalize in the growing CBD product\ncategory. We face competition from larger companies that are, or may be, in the process of offering similar products to ours. Many of our current and potential competitors have\nlonger operating histories, significantly greater financial, marketing and other resources than we have or may be expected to have.\n9\nCompetitors may include major pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies and public and private research institutions. Our management cannot be certain that we will be able\nto compete against current or future competitors or that competitive pressure will not seriously harm our business prospects. These competitors may be able to react to market\nchanges, respond more rapidly to new regulations or allocate greater resources to the development and promotion of their products than we can.\nFurthermore, some of these competitors may make acquisitions or establish collaborative relationships among themselves to increase their ability to rapidly gain market share.\nLarge pharmaceutical companies may eventually enter the market.\nGiven the rapid changes affecting the global, national, and regional economies in general and cannabis-related medical research and development in particular, we may not be able\nto create and maintain a competitive advantage in the marketplace. Time-to-market is an important factor in our industry and our success will depend on our ability to develop\ninnovative products that will be accepted by patients as efficient and helpful to use.\nOur success will also depend on our ability to respond quickly to, among other things, changes in the economy, market conditions, and competitive pressures. Any failure to\nanticipate or respond adequately to such changes could have a material effect on our financial condition, operating results, liquidity, cash flow and our operational performance.\nWhat distinguishes us in the marketplace is our clinical trials approach (double-blinded, placebo-controlled trials) that have demonstrated the clinical efficacy of our topical\nproducts.\nIntellectual Property\nWe filed Provisional Patent (CBD Formulations and Uses Thereof: USAN: 62/884,995) on a combination of CBD and Aspartame on August 8, 2019. The patent is to cover any\nproducts that contain a combination of CBD and Aspartame. This initially will cover the products under the CaniDermRX Brand. The provisional patent application was converted\ninto a full US patent application (No.: 16/987,941) and PCT application (PCT/US2020/045408I) on August 9, 2020. If issued, the patent will give patent protection until 2040.\nWe filed Provisional Patent (CBD Sunscreen Formulations and Uses Thereof: USAN: 63/005,854) on our CBD-infused sunscreen products on August 6, 2020. The patent is to\ncover any products under our CaniSun product line that contains CBD. The priority date starts at the time the provisional is converted into a full patent application, which will\noccur on April 6, 2021. If issued, the patent will give patent protection until 2041.\nWe filed Provisional Patent (Oroanasal CBD formulations and uses thereof (No.: 63/042,458) on June 22, 2020. This covers the use of CBD products for the treatment of respiratory\nviruses.\nResearch and Development\nOur research and development programs are generally pursued by engineers and scientists employed by us in on a full-time basis or hired as per diem consultants or through\npartnerships with industry leaders in manufacturing and design and researchers and academia. We are also working with subcontractors in developing specific components of our\ntechnologies.\nThe primary objective of our research and development program is to advance the development of our existing and proposed products, to enhance the commercial value of such\nproducts.\nThe Company incurred research and development expenses of $1,079,362 and $308,367 for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\nOn July 12, 2021, we entered into a clinical trial research agreement (the “Clinical Trial Research Agreement”) with AB. Under the Clinical Research Agreement, AB will design,\nmanage and conduct a head-to-head study of JW-101 compared to EUCRISA (crisaborole ointment 2%) for the treatment of Eczema (the “Study”). The Company will sponsor the\nStudy and under the projected budget laid out in the Clinical Trial Research Agreement will pay AB $1,088,010.00 for its research activities.\n10\nAs previously reported in a Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on December 14, 2021, the Company, entered into a stock purchase agreement (the “Original Purchase\nAgreement”), which was later amended and restated (the “Purchase Agreement”), and reported in a Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on January 13, 2022 (the\n“January 13th Disclosure”), with Next Frontier Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (“Next Frontier Pharmaceuticals”), a Delaware corporation, and certain of its affiliates (the “Next Frontier\nAffiliates”, and together with “Next Frontier Pharmaceuticals”, the “Next Frontier Parties”), pursuant to which the Company planned to acquire Next Frontier Pharmaceuticals (the\n“Acquisition”). The Purchase Agreement contained conditions to close that were not met by the Next Frontier Parties, including delivery of financial statement. As such, on\nFebruary 17, 2022, without consummating the Acquisition, Next Frontier Pharmaceuticals delivered to the Company a letter pursuant to which Next Frontier Pharmaceuticals\nterminated the Purchase Agreement (the “Termination Date”). In light of the aforementioned termination, the Company did not effectuate the Transactions, including the\ndistribution of shares of SRM to the Company’s stockholders, as was contemplated in the Purchase Agreement and previously disclosed in the January 13th Disclosure.\nAs of the Termination Date, an indebtedness balance in an aggregate amount totaling $11.2 million, which was previously advanced by the Company to the Next Frontier Parties\nunder those certain Secured Promissory Note, dated December 8, 2021 (the “December 2021 Note”), and Secured Promissory Note, dated January 7, 2022 (the “January 2022 Note”),\nis owed and outstanding. The December 2021 Note has a maturity date of June 8, 2022, and the January 2022 Note has a maturity date of July 7, 2022, or otherwise when due.\nOn June 4, 2021, the Company filed a registration statement on Form S-1 (File No. 333- 258005) which was declared effective on June 21, 2021, for the sale or other disposition from\ntime to time by the selling shareholders identified in the prospectus of up to 1,050,002 shares of Common Stock consisting of up to 525,001 Common Stock, at a $4.54 share price,\nwhich may be issued upon the conversion of convertible promissory notes issued in May 2021, and up to 525,001 Common Stock, at a $6.00 share price, which may be issued upon\nthe exercise of outstanding warrants.\nPursuant to a registration statement on Form S-1 (File No. 333- 258005) which was declared effective on June 21, 2021 (the “June Registration Statement”) the Company undertook a\nfirm commitment offering (the “Offering”) of shares of our common stock (“Common Stock”), par value $0.001 per share. With a combined public offering price of each share of\nCommon Stock and Company Warrant (as defined below) of $[ ], a total of 11,066,258 shares (the “Company Offering Shares”) and 11,607,142 warrants (the “Company Warrants”)\nto purchase 11,607,142 shares were registered. In addition a total of 540,884 shares were offered by the Company selling stockholder. As part of the compensation, the Company\nalso issued 442,650 warrants to Aegis Capital Corp. to purchase 442,650 shares.\nOn January 20, 2022, the Company received a letter from Nasdaq stating that, because the Company made the Share Grants not pursuant to the 2021 Equity Plan despite them\nconsidered to be S-8 eligible, Nasdaq had determined that the Company did not comply with Listing Rule 5635(c). It was brought to our attention that 180,000 shares of common\nstock, out of the total 1,020,000 shares of common stock to consultants (the “Consulting Share Awards”) that were issued to three consultants, Greentree Financial (100,000\nshares), Inc., L&H Inc. (20,000 shares), and Tee 2 Green Enterprises, Ltd. (60,000 shares), during the relevant period (the “Share Grants”), should have been issued pursuant to the\n2021 Equity Plan because the Share Grants were considered to be S-8 eligible. As a result, the inadvertent issuance of the Share Grants to the mentioned-above three consultants\nwas not made in compliance with Listing Rule 5635(c). The Company subsequently notified Nasdaq that the Board has approved the reallocation of the Share Grants to be\naccounted for as if they were originally issued under the 2021 Equity Plan, and has made the corresponding change to the Company’s books and records. However, since the 2021\nEquity Plan has previously been exercised in full, to allow for the reallocation of the Share Grants under the 2021 Equity Plan, on January 17, 2022, the Board determined that\n100,000 options that have previously been issued under the 2021 Equity Plan to Brian John, and 100,000 options issued to Dr. Glynn Wilson be cancelled, a revocation to which\nMessrs. John and Wilson have agreed. Following the remedial measures, on January 20, 2022 , the Company was informed that the Company has regained compliance with the Rule\nand that this matter is now closed.\nGovernment Regulation\nSince 1937, Cannabis sativa L. has been a federally regulated Schedule I drug under the Controlled Substances Act, 21 U.S.C. § 811 (the “CSA”), regulated by the Drug\nEnforcement Agency (the “DEA”).\n11\nIt was not until 2014 when a distinction between the use of Cannabis sativa L. for medical, recreational, and industrial purposes was made via Section 7606 of the Agricultural Act\nof 2014, which cleared a legal path for industrial hemp to be grown in three limited circumstances, 1) by researchers at an institute of higher education, 2) by state departments of\nagriculture, or 3) by farmers participating in a research program permitted and overseen by a state department of agriculture.\nIn 2016, the DEA, U.S. Department of Agriculture, and the FDA issued a joint statement detailing the guidelines for growth of industrial hemp as part of state-sanctioned research\nprograms. Those guidelines state that hemp can only be sold in states with pilot programs, plants and seeds can only cross state lines as part of permitted state research programs,\nand seeds can only be imported by individuals registered with the DEA.\nWe believe the recent passage of the Farm Bill will allow us to expand our marketplace opportunities. On December 20, 2018, President Donald J. Trump signed into law the\nAgriculture Improvement Act of 2018, otherwise known as the “Farm Bill”. Prior to its passage, hemp, a member of the cannabis family, and hemp-derived CBD were classified as a\nSchedule I controlled substances, and so were deemed to be illegal under the CSA. With the passage of the Farm Bill, hemp cultivation is broadly permitted. The Farm Bill explicitly\nallows the transfer of hemp-derived products across state lines for commercial or other purposes. It also puts no restrictions on the sale, transport, or possession of hemp-derived\nproducts, so long as those items are produced in a manner consistent with the law.\nUnder Section 10113 of the Farm Bill, hemp cannot contain more than 0.3 percent THC. THC refers to the chemical compound found in cannabis that produces the psychoactive\n“high” associated with cannabis. Any cannabis plant that contains more than 0.3 percent THC would be considered non-hemp cannabis—or marijuana—under federal law and\nwould thus face no legal protection under this new legislation and would be an illegal Schedule 1 drug under the CSA.\nAdditionally, there will be significant, shared state-federal regulatory power over hemp cultivation and production. Under Section 10113 of the Farm Bill, state departments of\nagriculture must consult with the state’s governor and chief law enforcement officer to devise a plan that must be submitted to the Secretary of the United States Department of\nAgriculture or USDA. A state’s plan to license and regulate hemp can only commence once the Secretary of USDA approves that state’s plan. In states opting not to devise a\nhemp regulatory program, USDA will construct a regulatory program under which hemp cultivators in those states must apply for licenses and comply with a federally run program.\nThis system of shared regulatory programming is similar to options states had in other policy areas such as health insurance marketplaces under the Affordable Care Act, or\nworkplace safety plans under Occupational Health and Safety Act—both of which had federally-run systems for states opting not to set up their own systems.\nThe Farm Bill outlines actions that are considered violations of federal hemp law (including such activities as cultivating without a license or producing cannabis with more than\n0.3% THC). The Farm Bill details possible punishments for such violations, pathways for violators to become compliant, and even which activities qualify as felonies under the law,\nsuch as repeated offenses.\nOne of the goals of the Agricultural Act of 2014 was to generate and protect research into hemp. The Farm Bill continues this effort. Section 7605 re-extends the protections for\nhemp research and the conditions under which such research can and should be conducted. Further, section 7501 of the Farm Bill extends hemp research by including hemp under\nthe Critical Agricultural Materials Act. This provision recognizes the importance, diversity, and opportunity of the plant and the products that can be derived from it, but also\nrecognizes that there is still a lot to learn about hemp and its products from commercial and market perspectives.\nOverall, we believe that our sunscreen products comply with the FDA Final Rule for sunscreen products under 21 CFR 352 Sunscreen products for Over-the-Counter Human Use.\nTherefore, we believe that our sunscreen products fall within the FDA monograph and that FDA premarket approval and testing is not required. Our products have been tested for\nSPF Evaluation (SPF rating), Critical Wave Length (Broad Spectrum claim) and Water Resistance, each of which is defined within the monograph and labeled accordingly.\nOur products are tested each time they are manufactured. DCR Labs manufactures our products and is compliant with the FDA’s Current Good Manufacturing Practice (“CGMP”)\nregulations in accordance with 21 CFR 210/211 (required for Over-the-Counter drug products). DCR Labs has self-imposed health and safety standards to ensure compliance with\nthe FDA’s CGMPs.\n12\nFDA Regulation of Hemp Extracts\nThe FDA is generally responsible for protecting the public health by ensuring the safety, efficacy, and security of (1) prescription and over the counter drugs; (2) biologics\nincluding vaccines, blood & blood products, and cellular and gene therapies; (3) foodstuffs including dietary supplements, bottled water, and baby formula; and, (4) medical\ndevices including heart pacemakers, surgical implants, prosthetics, and dental devices.\nRegarding its regulation of drugs, the FDA process requires a review that begins with the filing of an investigational new drug (IND) application, with follow-on clinical studies and\nclinical trials that the FDA uses to determine whether a drug is safe and effective, and therefore subject to approval for human use by the FDA.\nAside from the FDA’s mandate to regulate drugs, the FDA also regulates dietary supplement products and dietary ingredients under the Dietary Supplement Health and Education\nAct of 1994. This law prohibits manufacturers and distributors of dietary supplements and dietary ingredients from marketing products that are adulterated or misbranded. This\nmeans that these firms are responsible for evaluating the safety and labeling of their products before marketing to ensure that they meet all the requirements of the law and FDA\nregulations, including, but not limited to the following labeling requirements: (1) identifying the supplement; (2) nutrition labeling; (3) ingredient labeling; (4) claims; and, (5) daily\nuse information.\nThe FDA has not approved cannabis, marijuana, hemp or derivatives as a safe and effective drug for any indication. We intend to file an IND with the FDA for our CaniDermRX\nproducts in the event the pending provisional patent on an Aspartame/CBD combination is approved. As of the date hereof, our products containing CBD derived from industrial\nhemp are not marketed or sold using claims that their use is a safe and effective treatment for any medical condition subject to the FDA’s jurisdiction.\nThe FDA has concluded that products containing cannabis or industrial hemp derived CBD are excluded from the dietary supplement definition under sections 201(ff)(3)(B)(i) and\n(ii) of the U.S. Food, Drug & Cosmetic Act, respectively. The FDA’s position is that products containing cannabis, CBD or derivatives are Schedule 1 drugs under the Controlled\nSubstances Act, and so are illegal. Our products containing CBD derived from industrial hemp are not marketed or sold as dietary supplements. However, at some indeterminate\nfuture time, the FDA may choose to generally change its position concerning products containing hemp derived CBD, and may choose to enact regulations that are applicable to\nsuch products. In this event, our industrial hemp based products containing CBD may be subject to regulation.\nOur products contain controlled substances as defined in the Controlled Substances Act (CSA). Controlled substances that are pharmaceutical products are subject to a high\ndegree of regulation under the CSA, which establishes, among other things, certain registration, manufacturing quotas, security, recordkeeping, reporting, import, export and other\nrequirements administered by the DEA.\nDespite recent approvals by the FDA and DEA for a newly approved medication which contains cannabidiol (CBD), the scheduling of these substances, many of which are\nbeyond our control, could jeopardize our ability to obtain regulatory approval for and successfully market our products. Any such setback in our pursuit of regulatory approval\nwould have a material adverse effect on our business and prospects.\nFDA Regulation of CBD\nOn June 25, 2018, the US Federal Drug Administration (FDA) approved Epidiolex. Epidiolex is the first and only FDA-approved prescription cannabidiol (CBD). It is approved to\ntreat seizures associated with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS), Dravet syndrome, or tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) in patients 1 year of age and older. Accordingly, the FDA\nhas designated CBD as a drug and the need for all marketed products to follow FDA guidelines for safety and efficacy. It is not yet clear how this will affect thousands of CBD\nproducts already on the market given the multitude of state and local regulations that cover this field.\nEmployees\nAs of December 31, 2021, we had twelve full-time employees, including Chief Executive Officer Brian S. John, Chairman and Chief Science Officer, Dr. Glynn Wilson, Chief Financial\nOfficer, Douglas McKinnon, Chief Operating Officer, Ryan Allison and Chief Compliance Officer, Richard Miller. We believe our relations with our employees to be good.\nProperties\nCurrently, we do not own any real property. We rent an office space at 1061 E. Indiantown Rd., Ste. 110, Jupiter, FL 33477 for $15,038 per month. The Company entered into the\noffice lease effective July 1, 2021, which has a primary term of the lease of five years with one renewal option for an additional three years.\n13\nRISK FACTORS\nInvesting in our securities involves a high degree of risk. Before making an investment decision, you should carefully consider any risk factors set forth in the applicable\nprospectus supplement and the documents incorporated by reference in this prospectus, including the factors discussed under the heading “Risk Factors” in our most recent Form\n10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021, as filed with the SEC on March 31, 2022, as updated by our subsequent annual, quarterly and other reports and documents that are\nincorporated by reference into this prospectus. See “Where You Can Find More Information” and “Information We Incorporate By Reference.” Each of the risks described in these\ndocuments could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects, and could result in a partial or complete loss of your\ninvestment. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us, or that we currently deem immaterial, may also adversely affect our business. In addition, past financial\nperformance may not be a reliable indicator of future performance and historical trends should not be used to anticipate results or trends in future periods.\n14\nUSE OF PROCEEDS\nWe will retain broad discretion over the use of the net proceeds from the sale of the securities offered hereby. Unless otherwise specified in any prospectus supplement, we\ncurrently intend to use the net proceeds from the sale of our securities offered under this prospectus for working capital and general corporate purposes including, but not limited\nto, capital expenditures, working capital, repayment of indebtedness, potential acquisitions and other business opportunities. Pending any specific application, we may initially\ninvest funds in short-term marketable securities or apply them to the reduction of indebtedness.\n15\nDESCRIPTION OF CAPITAL STOCK\nAuthorized Capital\nOur authorized capital stock consists of 100,000,000 shares of common stock, par value $0.001 per share, and 100,000 shares of preferred stock, par value $0.001 per share.\nCommon Stock\nCommon stock outstanding\nAs of September 27, 2022, there were 22,095,032 shares of our common stock outstanding.\nVoting rights\nSubject to the rights granted to holders of any preferred stock issued by us, each share of common stock entitles the holder to one vote, either in person or by proxy, at meetings\nof stockholders. The holders are not permitted to vote their shares cumulatively.\nDividend rights\nSubject to the rights granted to holders of any preferred stock issued by us, holders of common stock are entitled to receive ratably such dividends, if any, as may be declared by\nthe Board out of funds legally available.\nRights upon liquidation\nSubject to the rights granted to holders of any preferred stock issued by us, upon our liquidation, dissolution or winding up, the holders of our common stock will be entitled to\nshare ratably in the net assets legally available for distribution to stockholders after the payment of all of our debts and other liabilities.\nOther rights\nHolders of our common stock do not have any pre-emptive rights or other subscription rights, conversion rights, redemption or sinking fund provisions.\nPreferred Stock\nUnder the terms of our second amended and restated certificate of incorporation, our Board is authorized to issue shares of preferred stock in one or more series without\nstockholder approval. Our Board has the discretion to determine the rights, preferences, privileges and restrictions, including voting rights, dividend rights, conversion rights,\nredemption privileges and liquidation preferences, of each series of preferred stock.\nThe purpose of authorizing our Board to issue preferred stock and determination its rights and preferences is to eliminate delays associated with a stockholder vote on specific\nissuances. The issuance of preferred stock, while providing flexibility in connection with possible acquisitions, future financings and other corporate purposes, could have the\neffect of making it more difficult for a third party to acquire, or could discourage a third party from seeking to acquire, a majority of our outstanding voting stock.\nWarrants\nDuring 2018 and 2019, the Company conducted a private placement in which it entered into individual subscription agreements with certain investors for the sale of units at a price\nper unit of $0.25, with each unit consisting of one share of common stock and one two-year warrant to purchase one share of common stock at an exercise price of $0.50 per share.\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2018, we sold 958,000 units. During the year ended December 31, 2019, we sold 200,000 additional units. As of September 30, 2020, the total amount of\nwarrants outstanding was 1,158,000. In November 2020, all of these warrants were exercised.\nDuring 2020, the Company issued a total of 1,123,333 warrants, with each warrant to purchase one share of common stock, consisting of 1,073,333 warrants issued in connection\nwith the Company’s initial public offering at an exercise price of $8.50 per share, expiring in October 2025, and 50,000 warrants issued in connection with the Endorsement\nAgreement with Tee-2-Green at an exercise price of $3.90, expiring in November 2025.\nDuring 2021, the Company issued 525,001 warrants in relation to loans amounting $3,150,000 to the Company issued by the investors. As of the date of this prospectus there are\n1,648,334 warrants outstanding. In addition, the Company issued 11,607,142 warrants to purchase common stock of the under public offering in July 21, 2021.\n16\nOptions\nAt March 31,2022 and December 31, 2021, the Company had 4,686,610 options outstanding. Subsequent to March 31, 2022, the Company issued a 2-year option to purchase\n300,000 shares of common stock at an exercise price of $1.00 per share granted to W&B.\n2021 Private Placement Notes and Warrants\nOn May 11, 2021, we entered into a loan agreement (the “May 11 Loan Agreement”), pursuant to which we sold approximately $2,500,000 of notes (the “May 11 Notes”) and\n416,667 warrants at an exercise price of $6.00.\nOn May 24, 2021, we entered into a loan agreement (the “May 24 Loan Agreement”), pursuant to which we sold approximately $150,000 of notes (the “May 24 Notes”) and 25,000\nwarrants at an exercise price of $6.00 per share.\nOn May 28, 2021, we entered into a loan agreement (the “May 28 Loan Agreement, with the May 11 Loan Agreement and the May 24 Loan Agreement, collectively as “2021 Loan\nAgreements”), pursuant to which we sold approximately $500,000 of notes (the “May 28 Notes,” collectively with May 11 Notes and May 24 Notes as the “2021 Notes”) and 83,334\nwarrants at an exercise price of $6.00 per share.\nThe 2021 Notes have a six months term and are convertible into shares of Common Stock of the Company at $6.00 per share. Interest shall accrue on the notes at 8% annually,\npayable on a quarterly basis. The 2021 Notes held by a particular holder will not be convertible to the extent such conversion would result in such holder owning more than 4.99%\nof the number of Common Stock outstanding after giving effect to the issuance of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of such note calculated in accordance with Section\n13(d) of the Exchange Act. Upon not less than sixty-one (61) days advance written notice, at any time or from time to time, the holder at its sole discretion, may waive the 4.99%\nconversion limit. However, under any circumstance, the holder may not convert the 2021 Note if such conversion would cause holder’s beneficial ownership (as defined by Section\n13(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) of the Company to exceed 9.99% of its total issued and outstanding common or voting shares. Any Common Stocks\nconverted under the 2021 Note need to be delivered to the holder within three (3) business days of the receipt of conversion notice.\nThe warrants are exercisable immediately for a period of five years for cash, at an exercise price of $6.00 per share of Common Stock. The warrants held by a particular holder will\nnot be exercisable to the extent such conversion would result in such holder owning more than 4.99% of the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding after giving effect to\nthe issuance of Common Stock issuable upon exercise of such warrants calculated in accordance with Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act. Upon not less than sixty-one (61) days\nadvance written notice, at any time or from time to time, the warrant holder at its sole discretion, may waive the 4.99% ownership limit. However, under any circumstance, the\nwarrant holder may not exercise the warrant if such exercise would cause such Warrant holder’s beneficial ownership (as defined by Section 13(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of\n1934, as amended) of the Common Stock of the Company to exceed 9.99% of its total issued and outstanding Common Stock or voting shares.\nPursuant to the 2021 Loan Agreements, 2021 Notes and warrants we agreed to file the registration statement of which this prospectus forms a part with the SEC and to cause such\nregistration statement to become effective as promptly as practicable after filing, and are required to cause such registration statement to remain effective until the Common Stock\noffered hereby have been sold or may be freely sold without limitations or restrictions as to volume or manner of sale pursuant to Rule 144 under the Securities Act.\n2022 Private Placement Notes and Warrants\nOn April 20, 2022, we entered into the Greentree Loan, pursuant to which we sold approximately $1,500,000 of Greentree Notes and 1,100,000 Greentree Warrants at an exercise price\nof $2.79.\nOn April 20, 2022, we entered into the L&H Loan, pursuant to which we sold approximately $500,000 of L&H Notes and 360,000 L&H Warrants at an exercise price of $2.79.\nThe Notes have an original issuance discount of five percent (5%), an interest rate of eight percent (8%), and a conversion price of $2.79 per share, subject to an adjustment\ndownward if the Company is in default of the terms of the Notes. Provided, the Notes may be converted at a default price of $1.00 per share in the event of default as stated therein.\nThe Warrants have a five (5) year term, an exercise price of $2.79 per share, have a cashless conversion feature until such time as the shares underlying the Warrants are included\nin an effective registration and certain anti-dilution protection.\n17\nPursuant to the Loan Agreements, Notes and warrants we agreed to file the registration statement of which this prospectus forms a part with the SEC and to cause such\nregistration statement to become effective as promptly as practicable after filing, and are required to cause such registration statement to remain effective until the Common Stock\noffered hereby have been sold or may be freely sold without limitations or restrictions as to volume or manner of sale pursuant to Rule 144 under the Securities Act.\nAnti-Takeover Effects\nOur second amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws will include a number of provisions that may have the effect of delaying, deferring\nor preventing a party from acquiring control of us and encouraging persons considering unsolicited tender offers or other unilateral takeover proposals to negotiate with our Board\nrather than pursue non-negotiated takeover attempts. The provisions include the items described below.\nPotential Effects of Authorized but Unissued Stock\nWe have shares of common stock available for future issuance without stockholder approval. We may utilize these additional shares for a variety of corporate purposes, including\nfuture public offerings to raise additional capital, to facilitate corporate acquisitions or payment as a dividend on the capital stock.\nThe existence of unissued and unreserved common stock and preferred stock may enable our Board to issue shares to persons friendly to current management or to issue preferred\nstock with terms that could render more difficult or discourage a third-party attempt to obtain control of us by means of a merger, tender offer, proxy contest or otherwise, thereby\nprotecting the continuity of our management. In addition, our Board has the discretion to determine designations, rights, preferences, privileges and restrictions, including voting\nrights, dividend rights, conversion rights, redemption privileges and liquidation preferences of each series of preferred stock, all to the fullest extent permissible under the Delaware\nGeneral Corporation Law and subject to any limitations set forth in our second amended and restated certificate of incorporation. The purpose of authorizing the Board to issue\npreferred stock and to determine the rights and preferences applicable to such preferred stock is to eliminate delays associated with a stockholder vote on specific issuances. The\nissuance of preferred stock, while providing desirable flexibility in connection with possible financings, acquisitions and other corporate purposes, could have the effect of making\nit more difficult for a third party to acquire, or could discourage a third party from acquiring, a majority of our outstanding voting stock.\nLimitations of Director Liability and Indemnification of Directors, Officers and Employees\nOur second amended and restated certificate of incorporation limits the liability of directors to the maximum extent permitted by Delaware law. Delaware law provides that directors\nof a corporation will not be personally liable for monetary damages for breach of their fiduciary duties as directors.\nOur amended and restated bylaws provide that we will indemnify our directors and officers to the fullest extent permitted by law, and may indemnify employees and other agents.\nOur amended and restated bylaws also provide that we are obligated to advance expenses incurred by a director or officer in advance of the final disposition of any action or\nproceeding.\nWe currently do not have a policy of directors’ and officers’ liability insurance but intend to obtain such a policy in the near future.\nOur amended and restated bylaws, subject to the provisions of Delaware Law, contain provisions which allow the corporation to indemnify any person against liabilities and other\nexpenses incurred as the result of defending or administering any pending or anticipated legal issue in connection with service to us if it is determined that person acted in good\nfaith and in a manner which he or she reasonably believed was in the best interest of the corporation. Insofar as indemnification for liabilities arising under the Securities Act of\n1933 as amended, or the Securities Act, may be permitted to our directors, officers and controlling persons, we have been advised that in the opinion of the Securities and\nExchange Commission, such indemnification is against public policy as expressed in the Securities Act and is, therefore, unenforceable.\n18\nThe limitation of liability and indemnification provisions in our amended and restated bylaws may discourage stockholders from bringing a lawsuit against directors for breach of\ntheir fiduciary duties. They may also reduce the likelihood of derivative litigation against directors and officers, even though an action, if successful, might provide a benefit to us\nand our stockholders. Our results of operations and financial condition may be harmed to the extent we pay the costs of settlement and damage awards against directors and\nofficers pursuant to these indemnification provisions.\nAt present, there is no pending litigation or proceeding involving any of our directors or officers as to which indemnification is required or permitted, and we are not aware of any\nthreatened litigation or proceeding that may result in a claim for indemnification.\nRequirements for Advance Notification of Stockholder Nominations and Proposals\nOur amended and restated bylaws establish advance notice procedures with respect to stockholder proposals and nomination of candidates for election as directors.\nLimits on Special Meetings\nSpecial meetings may be called for any purpose and at any time by the Chairman of the Board, the President (if there be one) or by any member of the Board. Business transacted at\neach special meeting shall be confined to the purposes stated in the notice of such meeting.\nElection and Removal of Directors\nOur Board is elected annually by our stockholders.

Warrants may be\noffered independently or together with shares of common stock, and/or preferred stock offered by any prospectus supplement and may be attached to or separate from those\nsecurities.\nWhile the terms we have summarized below will generally apply to any future warrants we may offer under this prospectus, we will describe the particular terms of any warrants\nthat we may offer in more detail in the applicable prospectus supplement. The specific terms of any warrants may differ from the description provided below as a result of\nnegotiations with third parties in connection with the issuance of those warrants, as well as for other reasons. Because the terms of any warrants we offer under a prospectus\nsupplement may differ from the terms we describe below, you should rely solely on information in the applicable prospectus supplement if that summary is different from the\nsummary in this prospectus.\nWe will issue the warrants under a warrant agreement, which we will enter into with a warrant agent to be selected by us. We use the term “warrant agreement” to refer to any of\nthese warrant agreements. We use the term “warrant agent” to refer to the warrant agent under any of these warrant agreements. The warrant agent will act solely as an agent of\nours in connection with the warrants and will not act as an agent for the holders or beneficial owners of the warrants.\nWe will incorporate by reference into the registration statement of which this prospectus is a part the form of warrant agreement, including a form of warrant certificate that\ndescribes the terms of the series of warrants we are offering before the issuance of the related series of warrants. The following summaries of material provisions of the warrants\nand the warrant agreements are subject to, and qualified in their entirety by reference to, all the provisions of the warrant agreement applicable to a particular series of warrants. We\nurge you to read any applicable prospectus supplement related to the warrants that we sell under this prospectus, as well as the complete warrant agreement that contain the terms\nof the warrants and defines your rights as a warrant holder.\nWe will describe in the applicable prospectus supplement the terms relating to a series of warrants. If warrants for the purchase of shares of common stock or preferred stock are\noffered, the prospectus supplement will describe the following terms, to the extent applicable:\n● the offering price and the aggregate number of warrants offered;\n● the total number of shares that can be purchased if a holder of the warrants exercises them;\n● the number of warrants being offered with each share of common stock;\n● the date on and after which the holder of the warrants can transfer them separately from the related shares of common stock or preferred stock;\n● the number of shares of common stock or preferred stock that can be purchased if a holder exercises the warrant and the price at which those shares may be purchased\nupon exercise, including, if applicable, any provisions for changes to or adjustments in the exercise price and in the securities or other property receivable upon exercise;\n● the terms of any rights to redeem or call, or accelerate the expiration of, the warrants;\n● the date on which the right to exercise the warrants begins and the date on which that right expires;\n● federal income tax consequences of holding or exercising the warrants; and\n● any other specific terms, preferences, rights or limitations of, or restrictions on, the warrants.\n20\nWarrants for the purchase of shares of common stock or preferred stock will be in registered form only.\nA holder of warrant certificates may exchange them for new certificates of different denominations, present them for registration of transfer and exercise them at the corporate trust\noffice of the warrant agent or any other office indicated in the applicable prospectus supplement. Until any warrants to purchase shares of common stock or preferred stock are\nexercised, holders of the warrants will not have any rights of holders of the underlying shares of common stock or preferred stock, including any rights to receive dividends or to\nexercise any voting rights, except to the extent set forth under “Warrant Adjustments” below.\nExercise of Warrants\nEach holder of a warrant is entitled to purchase the number of shares of common stock or preferred stock, as the case may be, at the exercise price described in the applicable\nprospectus supplement. After the close of business on the day when the right to exercise terminates (or a later date if we extend the time for exercise), unexercised warrants will\nbecome void.\nA holder of warrants may exercise them by following the general procedure outlined below:\n● deliver to the warrant agent the payment required by the applicable prospectus supplement to purchase the underlying security;\n● properly complete and sign the reverse side of the warrant certificate representing the warrants; and\n● deliver the warrant certificate representing the warrants to the warrant agent within five business days of the warrant agent receiving payment of the exercise price.\nIf you comply with the procedures described above, your warrants will be considered to have been exercised when the warrant agent receives payment of the exercise price,\nsubject to the transfer books for the securities issuable upon exercise of the warrant not being closed on such date. After you have completed those procedures and subject to the\nforegoing, we will, as soon as practicable, issue and deliver to you the shares of common stock or preferred stock that you purchased upon exercise. If you exercise fewer than all\nof the warrants represented by a warrant certificate, a new warrant certificate will be issued to you for the unexercised amount of warrants. Holders of warrants will be required to\npay any tax or governmental charge that may be imposed in connection with transferring the underlying securities in connection with the exercise of the warrants.\n21\nAmendments and Supplements to the Warrant Agreements\nWe may amend or supplement a warrant agreement without the consent of the holders of the applicable warrants to cure ambiguities in the warrant agreement, to cure or correct a\ndefective provision in the warrant agreement, or to provide for other matters under the warrant agreement that we and the warrant agent deem necessary or desirable, so long as, in\neach case, such amendments or supplements do not materially adversely affect the interests of the holders of the warrants.\nWarrant Adjustments\nUnless the applicable prospectus supplement states otherwise, the exercise price of, and the number of securities covered by, a warrant for shares of common stock or preferred\nstock will be adjusted proportionately if we subdivide or combine our common stock or preferred stock, as applicable. In addition, unless the prospectus supplement states\notherwise, if we, without payment:\n● issue shares of common stock or preferred stock or other securities convertible into or exchangeable for common stock or preferred stock, or any rights to subscribe for,\npurchase or otherwise acquire any of the foregoing, as a dividend or distribution to all or substantially all holders of our common stock or preferred stock;\n22\n● pay any cash to all or substantially all holders of our common stock or preferred stock, other than a cash dividend paid out of our current or retained earnings;\n● issue any evidence of our indebtedness or rights to subscribe for or purchase our indebtedness to all or substantially all holders of our common stock or preferred stock;\nor\n● issue common stock, preferred stock or additional shares or other securities or property to all or substantially all holders of our common stock or preferred stock by way of\nspinoff, split-up, reclassification, combination of shares or similar corporate rearrangement;\nthen the holders of common stock warrants or preferred stock warrants will be entitled to receive upon exercise of the warrants, in addition to the securities otherwise receivable\nupon exercise of the warrants and without paying any additional consideration, the amount of shares and other securities and property such holders would have been entitled to\nreceive had they held the common stock or preferred stock issuable under the warrants on the dates on which holders of those securities received or became entitled to receive\nsuch additional shares and other securities and property.\nExcept as stated above, the exercise price and number of securities covered by a warrant for shares of common stock or preferred stock, and the amounts of other securities or\nproperty to be received, if any, upon exercise of those warrants, will not be adjusted or provided for if we issue those securities or any securities convertible into or exchangeable\nfor those securities, or securities carrying the right to purchase those securities or securities convertible into or exchangeable for those securities.\nHolders of common stock warrants or preferred stock warrants may have additional rights under the following circumstances:\n● certain reclassifications, capital reorganizations or changes of the common stock or preferred stock;\n● certain share exchanges, mergers, or similar transactions involving us that result in changes of the common stock or preferred stock; or\n● certain sales or dispositions to another entity of all or substantially all of our property and assets.\nIf one of the above transactions occurs and holders of our common stock or preferred stock are entitled to receive shares, securities or other property with respect to or in\nexchange for their securities, the holders of the common stock warrants or preferred stock warrants then-outstanding, as applicable, will be entitled to receive upon exercise of their\nwarrants the kind and amount of shares and other securities or property that they would have received upon the applicable transaction if they had exercised their warrants\nimmediately before the transaction.\n23\nDESCRIPTION OF RIGHTS\nThe following description, together with the additional information we include in any applicable prospectus supplement, summarizes the general features of the rights that we may\noffer under this prospectus. We may issue rights to our stockholders to purchase shares of our common stock and/or any of the other securities offered hereby. Each series of\nrights will be issued under a separate rights agreement to be entered into between us and a bank or trust company, as rights agent. When we issue rights, we will provide the\nspecific terms of the rights and the applicable rights agreement in a prospectus supplement. Because the terms of any rights we offer under a prospectus supplement may differ\nfrom the terms we describe below, you should rely solely on information in the applicable prospectus supplement if that summary is different from the summary in this prospectus.\nWe will incorporate by reference into the registration statement of which this prospectus is a part the form of rights agreement that describes the terms of the series of rights we are\noffering before the issuance of the related series of rights. The applicable prospectus supplement relating to any rights will describe the terms of the offered rights, including,\nwhere applicable, the following:\n● the date for determining the persons entitled to participate in the rights distribution;\n● the exercise price for the rights;\n● the aggregate number or amount of underlying securities purchasable upon exercise of the rights;\n● the number of rights issued to each stockholder and the number of rights outstanding, if any;\n● the extent to which the rights are transferable;\n● the date on which the right to exercise the rights will commence and the date on which the right will expire;\n● the extent to which the rights include an over-subscription privilege with respect to unsubscribed securities;\n● anti-dilution provisions of the rights, if any; and\n● any other terms of the rights, including terms, procedures and limitations relating to the distribution, exchange and exercise of the rights.\nHolders may exercise rights as described in the applicable prospectus supplement. Upon receipt of payment and the rights certificate properly completed and duly executed at the\ncorporate trust office of the rights agent or any other office indicated in the prospectus supplement, we will, as soon as practicable, forward the securities purchasable upon\nexercise of the rights. If less than all of the rights issued in any rights offering are exercised, we may offer any unsubscribed securities directly to persons other than stockholders,\nto or through agents, underwriters or dealers or through a combination of such methods, including pursuant to standby underwriting arrangements, as described in the applicable\nprospectus supplement.\n24\nDESCRIPTION OF UNITS\nWe may issue units comprising two or more securities described in this prospectus in any combination. For example, we might issue units consisting of a combination of common\nstock and warrants to purchase common stock. The following description sets forth certain general terms and provisions of the units that we may offer pursuant to this prospectus.\nThe particular terms of the units and the extent, if any, to which the general terms and provisions may apply to the units so offered will be described in the applicable prospectus\nsupplement.\nEach unit will be issued so that the holder of the unit also is the holder of each security included in the unit. Thus, the unit will have the rights and obligations of a holder of each\nincluded security. Units will be issued pursuant to the terms of a unit agreement, which may provide that the securities included in the unit may not be held or transferred\nseparately at any time or at any time before a specified date. A copy of the forms of the unit agreement and the unit certificate relating to any particular issue of units will be filed\nwith the SEC each time we issue units, and you should read those documents for provisions that may be important to you. For more information on how you can obtain copies of\nthe forms of the unit agreement and the related unit certificate, see “Where You Can Find More Information.”\nThe prospectus supplement relating to any particular issuance of units will describe the terms of those units, including, to the extent applicable, the following:\n● the designation and terms of the units and the securities comprising the units, including whether and under what circumstances those securities may be held or\ntransferred separately;\n● any provision for the issuance, payment, settlement, transfer or exchange of the units or of the securities comprising the units; and\n● whether the units will be issued in fully registered or global form.\n25\nPLAN OF DISTRIBUTION\nWe may sell the securities from time to time, by a variety of methods, including the following:\n● on any national securities exchange or quotation service on which our securities may be listed at the time of sale, including Nasdaq;\n● in the over-the-counter market;\n● in transactions otherwise than on such exchange or in the over-the-counter market, which may include privately negotiated transactions and sales directly to one or more\npurchasers;\n● through ordinary brokerage transactions and transactions in which the broker-dealer solicits purchasers;\n● through purchases by a broker-dealer as principal and resale by the broker-dealer for its account;\n● through underwriters, broker-dealers, agents, in privately negotiated transactions, or any combination of these methods;\n● through short sales;\n● through the writing or settlement of options or other hedging transactions, whether through an options exchange or otherwise;\n● a combination of any of these methods; or\n● by any other method permitted pursuant to applicable law.\nThe securities may be distributed from time to time in one or more transactions:\n● at a fixed price or prices, which may be changed;\n● at market prices prevailing at the time of sale;\n● at prices related to such prevailing market prices; or\n● at negotiated prices.\nOffers to purchase the securities being offered by this prospectus may be solicited directly. Agents may also be designated to solicit offers to purchase the securities from time to\ntime. Any agent involved in the offer or sale of our securities will be identified in a prospectus supplement.\nIf a dealer is utilized in the sale of the securities being offered by this prospectus, the securities will be sold to the dealer as principal. The dealer may then resell the securities to the\npublic at varying prices to be determined by the dealer at the time of resale.\nIf an underwriter is utilized in the sale of the securities being offered by this prospectus, an underwriting agreement will be executed with the underwriter at the time of sale and the\nname of any underwriter will be provided in the prospectus supplement that the underwriter will use to make resales of the securities to the public. In connection with the sale of\nthe securities, we, or the purchasers of securities for whom the underwriter may act as agent, may compensate the underwriter in the form of underwriting discounts or\ncommissions. The underwriter may sell the securities to or through dealers, and those dealers may receive compensation in the form of discounts, concessions or commissions\nfrom the underwriters and/or commissions from the purchasers for which they may act as agent. Unless otherwise indicated in a prospectus supplement, an agent will be acting on\na best efforts basis and a dealer will purchase securities as a principal, and may then resell the securities at varying prices to be determined by the dealer.\n26\nAny compensation paid to underwriters, dealers or agents in connection with the offering of the securities, and any discounts, concessions or commissions allowed by\nunderwriters to participating dealers will be provided in the applicable prospectus supplement. Underwriters, dealers and agents participating in the distribution of the securities\nmay be deemed to be underwriters within the meaning of the Securities Act, and any discounts and commissions received by them and any profit realized by them on resale of the\nsecurities may be deemed to be underwriting discounts and commissions. In compliance with the guidelines of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, Inc., or FINRA, the\nmaximum amount of underwriting compensation, including underwriting discounts and commissions, to be paid in connection with any offering of securities pursuant to this\nprospectus may not exceed 8% of the aggregate principal amount of securities offered. We may enter into agreements to indemnify underwriters, dealers and agents against civil\nliabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act, or to contribute to payments they may be required to make in respect thereof and to reimburse those persons for certain\nexpenses. The securities may or may not be listed on a national securities exchange. To facilitate the offering of securities, certain persons participating in the offering may engage\nin transactions that stabilize, maintain or otherwise affect the price of the securities. This may include over-allotments or short sales of the securities, which involve the sale by\npersons participating in the offering of more securities than were sold to them. In these circumstances, these persons would cover such over-allotments or short positions by\nmaking purchases in the open market or by exercising their over-allotment option, if any. In addition, these persons may stabilize or maintain the price of the securities by bidding\nfor or purchasing securities in the open market or by imposing penalty bids, whereby selling concessions allowed to dealers participating in the offering may be reclaimed if\nsecurities sold by them are repurchased in connection with stabilization transactions. The effect of these transactions may be to stabilize or maintain the market price of the\nsecurities at a level above that which might otherwise prevail in the open market. These transactions may be discontinued at any time.\nIf indicated in the applicable prospectus supplement, underwriters or other persons acting as agents may be authorized to solicit offers by institutions or other suitable purchasers\nto purchase the securities at the public offering price set forth in the prospectus supplement, pursuant to delayed delivery contracts providing for payment and delivery on the\ndate or dates stated in the prospectus supplement. These purchasers may include, among others, commercial and savings banks, insurance companies, pension funds, investment\ncompanies and educational and charitable institutions. Delayed delivery contracts will be subject to the condition that the purchase of the securities covered by the delayed\ndelivery contracts will not at the time of delivery be prohibited under the laws of any jurisdiction in the United States to which the purchaser is subject. The underwriters and\nagents will not have any responsibility with respect to the validity or performance of these contracts.\nWe may engage in at-the-market offerings into an existing trading market in accordance with rule 415(a)(4) under the Securities Act. In addition, we may enter into derivative\ntransactions with third parties, or sell securities not covered by this prospectus to third parties in privately negotiated transactions. If the applicable prospectus supplement so\nindicates, in connection with those derivatives, the third parties may sell securities covered by this prospectus and the applicable prospectus supplement, including in short sale\ntransactions. If so, the third party may use securities pledged by us, or borrowed from us or others to settle those sales or to close out any related open borrowings of common\nstock, and may use securities received from us in settlement of those derivatives to close out any related open borrowings of our common stock. In addition, we may loan or pledge\nsecurities to a financial institution or other third party that in turn may sell the securities using this prospectus and an applicable prospectus supplement. Such financial institution\nor other third party may transfer its economic short position to investors in our securities or in connection with a concurrent offering of other securities.\nThe underwriters, dealers and agents may engage in transactions with us, or perform services for us, in the ordinary course of business for which they receive compensation.\n27\nLEGAL MATTERS\nUnless otherwise indicated in the applicable prospectus supplement, certain legal matters in connection with the offering and the validity of the securities offered by this\nprospectus, and any supplement thereto, will be passed upon by Sichenzia Ross Ference LLP.\nEXPERTS\nThe consolidated financial statements of the Company as of December 31, 2021 and 2020 incorporated in this prospectus by reference from the Company’s Annual Report on Form\n10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021 have been audited by M&K CPAS, PLLC, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report thereon, and have\nbeen incorporated by reference in this prospectus and registration statement in reliance upon such report and upon the authority of such firm as experts in accounting and\nauditing.\n28\n743,716 shares of Common Stock\nPROSPECTUS SUPPLEMENT\nNovember 27, 2024"

(Nasdaq: SHOT) is proud to announce the launch of its newly rebranded and reformulated alcohol-\nreducing beverage, Sure Shot, now available in a convenient 4 oz. bottle at over 300 locations of the grocery chain recently voted “Best Grocery Store in America” by USA Today\nreaders in their annual 10Best Readers’ Choice Awards. This leading Midwestern retailer is renowned for its commitment to customer satisfaction and extensive product selection.\nDesigned to enhance social experiences while promoting responsible drinking, Sure Shot is the first beverage of its kind, specifically formulated to reduce blood alcohol content by\nsupporting the metabolism of alcohol, while enhancing mental clarity. Its unique blend of essential B vitamins, antioxidants, electrolytes, and nootropics supports the body’s\nnatural metabolic processes to efficiently process alcohol, reducing blood alcohol content (BAC) in as little as 30 minutes. This innovative approach, backed by a recently awarded\npatent and positive clinical study results, positions Sure Shot as the ideal choice for health-conscious individuals who enjoy an active social life without compromising their well-\nbeing.\n“Sure Shot reflects our commitment to providing consumers with innovative solutions that promote a balanced and mindful lifestyle,” says Jarrett Boon, CEO of Safety Shot, Inc.\n“We believe that everyone should be able to enjoy social gatherings without sacrificing their well-being. Sure Shot empowers individuals to make healthier choices and feel\nconfident in their social settings.”\nThe new 4 oz. bottle format and updated branding provide a more convenient and recognizable product for consumers. “We’ve listened to our customers and responded with a\nproduct that is not only effective but also convenient and visually appealing,” says Josh Wagner, Chief Revenue Officer of Safety Shot, Inc. “The strategic placement of off-shelf\ndisplays in these high-traffic stores, combined with Sure Shot’s eye-catching branding and convenient 4 oz. size, is designed to capture consumer attention and drive impulse\npurchases. Research shows that consumers are more likely to engage with products that are prominently displayed. We’re confident that Sure Shot’s visual appeal and unique\nbenefits will resonate with the shoppers.”\n“We are excited to expand the availability of Sure Shot and introduce this innovative product to a wider audience of health-conscious consumers,” adds Boon. “We believe Sure\nShot addresses a growing demand for products that promote responsible drinking and social wellness. We are confident that this expansion will contribute to our continued\ngrowth and success.”\nAbout Safety Shot, Inc.\nSafety Shot, Inc., a wellness and dietary supplement company, has developed Safety Shot, the first patented wellness product on Earth that lowers blood alcohol content by\nsupporting its metabolism, while boosting clarity, energy, and overall mood.

Organization and Business Operations\nSafety Shot Inc. (NASDAQ: SHOT) was formerly known as Jupiter Wellness Inc. In August 2023, the Company successfully completed the asset purchase of the functional\nbeverage Safety Shot from GBB Drink Lab, Inc. (\"GBB”), thereby gaining ownership of various assets, including the intellectual property, trade secrets, and trademarks associated\nwith its liquid dietary supplement that can lower blood alcohol content by supporting its metabolism (the \"Sure Shot Dietary Supplement”). Concurrently with the purchase, the\nCompany changed its name to Sure Shot, Inc. and changed its NASDAQ trading symbol to SHOT. The Company launched the Sure Shot Dietary Supplement in December 2023.\nThe Sure Shot Dietary Supplement has a well-established clinical development infrastructure and fits within the Company’s existing over-the-counter and health and wellness\nproducts. The Company will continue its current products line as an operating division and is committed to supporting health and wellness by developing innovative solutions to\na range of conditions. We take pride in our research and development of our products and intellectual property, which aim to address some of the most prevalent health and\nwellness concerns today. We are dedicated to staying up-to-date with the latest scientific research and technology, ensuring that our products are effective, safe, and meet the\nhighest industry standards.\nTo achieve our mission, we rely on a team of highly skilled and experienced professionals who are committed to advancing our vision of health and wellness. Our team includes\nscientists, researchers, product developers, and business experts who collaborate to create new products and enhance existing ones. We also partner with industry leaders and\norganizations to leverage the latest technologies and expand our reach.\nWe generate revenue through various channels through the sales of our consumer products. Our products are available through various retailers and e-commerce platforms,\nmaking them accessible to a broad customer base. Additionally, we collaborate with other companies to license our intellectual property, creating additional revenue streams and\nexpanding our global presence.\nGoing Concern Consideration\nAs of September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, the Company had accumulated deficits of $(101,558,757) and $(65,680,715), respectively, and cash flow used in operations of\n$17,241,736 and $10,515,314 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and year ended December 31, 2023. The Company has incurred and expects to continue to incur\nsignificant costs in pursuit of its expansion and development plans. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company had $1,360,401 and $3,833,349, respectively, in\ncash and working capital of $1,648,876 and $4,103,687, respectively. These conditions have raised substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern as\nnoted by our auditors, M&K CPAS, PLLC.\nNote 2 - Significant Accounting Policies\nBasis of Presentation\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements are presented in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (\"GAAP”) and\npursuant to the rules and regulations of US Securities and Exchange Commission (\"SEC”).The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its\nwholly-owned subsidiaries, Jupiter Wellness Investments, Inc., a Florida corporation. All intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated.\nEmerging Growth Company Status\nThe Company is an \"emerging growth company,” as defined in Section 2(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, (the \"Securities Act”), as modified by the Jumpstart our\nBusiness Startups Act of 2012, (the \"JOBS Act”), and it may take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public\ncompanies that are not emerging growth companies including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the\nSarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in its periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of\nholding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and shareholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved.\nFurther, Section 102(b)(1) of the JOBS Act exempts emerging growth companies from being required to comply with new or revised financial accounting standards until private\ncompanies (that is, those that have not had a Securities Act registration statement declared effective or do not have a class of securities registered under the Exchange Act) are\nrequired to comply with the new or revised financial accounting standards. The JOBS Act provides that a company can elect to opt out of the extended transition period and\ncomply with the requirements that apply to non-emerging growth companies but any such election to opt out is irrevocable. The Company has elected not to opt out of such\nextended transition period which means that when a standard is issued or revised and it has different application dates for public or private companies, the Company, as an\nemerging growth company, can adopt the new or revised standard at the time private companies adopt the new or revised standard. This may make comparison of the Company’s\nfinancial statements with another public company which is neither an emerging growth company nor an emerging growth company which has opted out of using the extended\ntransition period difficult or impossible because of the potential differences in accounting standards used.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with US GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and\nliabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of expenses during the reporting period. Actual results\ncould differ from those estimates.\nF-6\nTable of Contents\nCash and Cash Equivalents\nThe Company considers all short-term investments with a maturity of three months or less when purchased to be cash and equivalents for purposes of the statement of cash flows.\nThere were no cash equivalents as of September 30, 2024 or December 31, 2023.\nInventory\nInventories are stated at the lower of cost or market. The Company periodically reviews the value of items in inventory and provides write-downs or write- offs of inventory based\non its assessment of market conditions. Write-downs and write-offs are charged to cost of goods sold. Inventory is based upon the average cost method of accounting. During the\nnine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company took a write down of certain raw materials and finished goods totaling $1,902,279, due to rebranding issues. During the\ncorresponding period for 2023, the Company had no write-downs or write-offs.\nNet Loss per Common Share\nNet income (loss) per common share is computed pursuant to section 260-10-45 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification. Basic net income (loss) per share is computed by\ndividing net income (loss) by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. If applicable, diluted earnings per share assume the\nconversion, exercise or issuance of all common stock instruments such as options, warrants, convertible securities and preferred stock, unless the effect is to reduce a loss or\nincrease earnings per share. As such, options, warrants, convertible securities, and preferred stock are not considered in the calculations, as the impact of the potential common\nshares would be to decrease the loss per share.\nFor the Three Months Ended September 30, For the Nine Months Ended September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nNumerator:\nNet (loss) (11,929,277) (7,738,301) (35,878,042) (9,406,066)\n- -\nDenominator: - -\nDenominator for basic earnings per share - Weighted-average common\nshares issued and outstanding during the period 55,930,639 29,836,485 51,713,368 27,370,658\nDenominator for diluted earnings per share 55,930,639 29,836,485 51,713,368 27,370,658\nBasic (loss) per share (0.21) (0.26) (0.69) (0.34)\nDiluted (loss) per share (0.21) (0.26) (0.69) (0.34)\nFair Value of Financial Instruments\nThe fair value of the Company’s assets and liabilities, which qualify as financial instruments under ASC Topic 820, \"Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures,” approximates the\ncarrying amounts represented in the accompanying balance sheet, primarily due to their short-term nature.\nRevenue Recognition\nThe Company generates its revenue from the sale of its products directly to the end user or through a distributor (collectively the \"customers”).\nThe Company recognizes revenues by applying the following steps in accordance with FASB Accounting Standards Codification 606 \"Revenue from Contracts with Customers”\n(\"ASC 606”). Under ASC 606, revenues are recognized when control of the promised goods or services are transferred to a customer, in an amount that reflects the consideration\nthat the Company expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services. The Company applies the following five steps in order to determine the appropriate amount of\nrevenue to be recognized as it fulfills its obligations under each of its agreements:\n● identify the contract with a customer;\n● identify the performance obligations in the contract;\n● determine the transaction price;\n● allocate the transaction price to performance obligations in the contract; and\n● recognize revenue as the performance obligation is satisfied.\nF-7\nTable of Contents\nThe Company’s performance obligations are satisfied when goods or products are shipped on a FOB shipping point basis as title passes when shipped. Our products are generally\npaid in advance of shipment or standard net 30 days and we offer no specific right of return, refund or warranty related to our products except for cases of defective products of\nwhich there have been none to date.\nAccounts Receivable and Credit Risk\nAccounts receivable are generated from sales of the Company’s products. The Company provides an allowance for doubtful collections, which is based upon a review of\noutstanding receivables, historical collection information, and existing economic conditions. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and year ended December 31, 2023,\nthe Company recognized no allowance for doubtful collections.\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets\nWe evaluate long-lived assets (including intangible assets) for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of a long-lived asset\nmay not be recoverable. An asset is considered impaired if its carrying amount exceeds the undiscounted future net cash flow the asset is expected to generate.\nIntangible Assets\nIntangible assets consist of patents and trademarks, purchased customer contracts, purchased customer and merchant relationships, purchased trade names, purchased\ntechnology, and non-compete agreements. Intangible assets are amortized over the period of estimated benefit using the straight-line method and estimated useful lives ranging\nfrom one to twenty years. No significant residual value is estimated for intangible assets. We evaluate long-lived assets (including intangible assets) for impairment whenever\nevents or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of a long-lived asset may not be recoverable. An asset is considered impaired if its carrying amount exceeds\nthe undiscounted future net cash flow the asset is expected to generate. The Company’s evaluation of its long-lived assets resulted in no impairment during the nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024, or year ended December 31, 2023.\nResearch and Development\nThe Company accounts for research and development costs in accordance with the Accounting Standards Codification subtopic 730-10, Research and Development (\"ASC 730-\n10”). Under ASC 730-10, all research and development costs must be charged to expense as incurred. Accordingly, internal research and development costs are expensed as\nincurred. Third-party research and developments costs are expensed when the contracted work has been performed or as milestone results have been achieved. Company-\nsponsored research and development costs related to both present and future products are expensed in the period incurred. The Company incurred research and development\nexpenses of $271,719 and $98,091 for the nine-months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023, respectively.\nStock Based Compensation\nThe Company recognizes compensation costs to employees under FASB Accounting Standards Codification 718 \"Compensation - Stock Compensation” (\"ASC 718”). Under ASC\n718, companies are required to measure the compensation costs of share-based compensation arrangements based on the grant-date fair value and recognize the costs in the\nfinancial statements over the period during which employees are required to provide services. Share based compensation arrangements include stock options and warrants. As\nsuch, compensation cost is measured on the date of grant at their fair value. Such compensation amounts, if any, are amortized over the respective vesting periods of the option\ngrant.\nOn October 24, 2018, the inception date, the Company adopted ASU No. 2018-07 \"Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Nonemployee Share-Based\nPayment Accounting.” These amendments expand the scope of Topic 718, Compensation - Stock Compensation (which currently only includes share-based payments to\nemployees) to include share-based payments issued to non-employees for goods or services. Consequently, the accounting for share-based payments to nonemployees and\nemployees will be substantially aligned.\nF-8\nTable of Contents\nIncome Taxes\nThe Company accounts for income taxes under ASC 740 Income Taxes (\"ASC 740”). ASC 740 requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for both the expected\nimpact of differences between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities and for the expected future tax benefit to be derived from tax loss and tax credit carry\nforwards. ASC 740 additionally requires a valuation allowance to be established when it is more likely than not that all or a portion of deferred tax assets will not be realized.\nASC 740 also clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise’s financial statements and prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement\nprocess for financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. For those benefits to be recognized, a tax position must\nbe more-likely-than-not to be sustained upon examination by taxing authorities. ASC 740 also provides guidance on derecognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting\nin interim period, disclosure and transition. Based on the Company’s evaluation, it has been concluded that there are no significant uncertain tax positions requiring recognition in\nthe Company’s financial statements. Since the Company was incorporated on October 24, 2018, the evaluation was performed for 2018 tax year which would be the only period\nsubject to examination. The Company believes that its income tax positions and deductions would be sustained on audit and does not anticipate any adjustments that would result\nin a material changes to its financial position. The Company’s policy for recording interest and penalties associated with audits is to record such items as a component of income\ntax expense.\nThe Company’s deferred tax asset at December 31, 2023 consists of net operating loss carry forwards calculated using federal and state effective tax rates equating to\napproximately $8,658,484 less a valuation allowance in the amount of $8,658,484.\nRelated parties\nThe Company follows subtopic 850-10 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification for the identification of related parties and disclosure of related party transactions.\nPursuant to Section 850-10-20 the related parties include a. affiliates of the Company; b. entities for which investments in their equity securities would be required, absent the\nelection of the fair value option under the Fair Value Option Subsection of Section 825–10–15, to be accounted for by the equity method by the investing entity; c. trusts for the\nbenefit of employees, such as pension and profit-sharing trusts that are managed by or under the trusteeship of management; d. principal owners of the Company; e. management\nof the Company; f. other parties with which the Company may deal if one party controls or can significantly influence the management or operating policies of the other to an\nextent that one of the transacting parties might be prevented from fully pursuing its own separate interests; and g. other parties that can significantly influence the management or\noperating policies of the transacting parties or that have an ownership interest in one of the transacting parties and can significantly influence the other to an extent that one or\nmore of the transacting parties might be prevented from fully pursuing its own separate interests.\nThe consolidated financial statements shall include disclosures of material related party transactions, other than compensation arrangements, expense allowances, and other similar\nitems in the ordinary course of business. However, disclosure of transactions that are eliminated in the preparation of consolidated or combined financial statements is not required\nin those statements. The disclosures shall include: a. the nature of the relationship(s) involved; b. a description of the transactions, including transactions to which no amounts or\nnominal amounts were ascribed, for each of the periods for which income statements are presented, and such other information deemed necessary to an understanding of the\neffects of the transactions on the financial statements; c. the dollar amounts of transactions for each of the periods for which income statements are presented and the effects of\nany change in the method of establishing the terms from that used in the preceding period; and d. amounts due from or to related parties as of the date of each balance sheet\npresented and, if not otherwise apparent, the terms and manner of settlement.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nThe company evaluated issued pronouncements and did not identify any recent pronouncements that apply to the Company.\nNote 3 - Accounts Receivable\nAt September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company had accounts receivable of $5,231 and $5,585, respectively.\nF-9\nTable of Contents\nNote 4 - Prepaid Expenses and Deposits\nAt September 30, 2024, the Company had prepaid expenses and deposits totaling $1,029,351 consisting of $319,216 of prepaid orders, $270,869 of prepaid insurance, and $439,267 of\ndeposits on raw materials.

At December 31, 2023, the Company had\ninventory of $795,824, consisting $746,663 of raw materials and packaging supplies and $49,161 of finished goods.\nNote 6 – Marketable Securities\nAt December 31, 2022, the Company had invested $2,908,300 in Jupiter Wellness Sponsor LLC (\"JWSL”), a limited liability company formed for the sole purpose of sponsorship of\nJupiter Wellness Acquisition Corp. (\"JWAC”), a special purpose acquisition company (\"SPAC”) and an unconsolidated subsidiary. On May 2, 2023, JWAC’s stockholders\napproved JWAC’s business combination with Chijet Inc. and its affiliates including Chijet Motor Company Inc. (collectively \"Chijet”), at its Special Meeting of Stockholders and\nclosed the transaction on June 1, 2023. As a result, on June 27, 2023, the Company received a total of 1,662,434 shares of restricted common stock of Chijet (Nasdaq: CJET) in\nexchange for its Loans. In August 2023, the Company received 96,000 additional shares of ChiJet due to downside protection clauses in the business combination agreements.

During the year ended December 31, 2023 the Company sold 271,679 ChiJet\nshares for a realized gain of $238,834.\nAt the end of September 30, 2024, all of the Company’s CJET Shares have been sold.

The following discussion should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and the related notes that appear elsewhere in this quarterly report. The following\ndiscussion contains forward-looking statements that reflect our plans, estimates and beliefs. Our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in the forward-looking\nstatements. Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to, those discussed below and elsewhere in this quarterly report.\nIn this quarterly report, unless otherwise specified, all dollar amounts are expressed in United States dollars and all references to \"common shares” refer to the common\nshares in our capital stock.\nAs used in this quarterly report and unless otherwise indicated, the terms \"we”, \"us”, \"our”, \"SHOT” and the \"Company” mean Safety Shot, Inc.\nGeneral Overview\nSure Shot Inc. (NASDAQ: SHOT) was formerly known as Jupiter Wellness Inc. In August 2023, the Company successfully completed the asset purchase of the dietary\nsupplement product Sure Shot from GBB Drink Lab, Inc. (\"GBB”), thereby gaining ownership of various assets, including the intellectual property, trade secrets, and trademarks\nassociated with its dietary supplement Sure Shot (the \"Sure Shot Dietary Supplement”). Concurrently with the asset purchase, the Company changed its name to Sure Shot, Inc.\nand changed its NASDAQ trading symbol to SHOT. The Company launched its e-commerce sale of the Sure Shot Dietary Supplement in December 2023.\nThe Sure Shot Dietary Supplement has been formulated to reduce the accumulation of blood alcohol content by supporting its metabolism. Noteworthy is the fact that the\nSure Shot Dietary Supplement comprises 28 active ingredients, all falling under the Generally Regarded As Safe (GRAS) category. Under sections 201(s) and 409 of the Federal\nFood, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the Act),any substance that is intentionally added to food is a dietary supplement, that is subject to premarket review and approval by FDA, unless\nthe substance is generally recognized, among qualified experts, as having been adequately shown to be safe under the conditions of its intended use, or unless the use of the\nsubstance is otherwise excepted from the definition of a dietary supplement.\nIt’s crucial to note that the Sure Dietary Supplement is currently manufactured in a facility adhering to Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP), ensuring the highest standards of\nquality and safety throughout its production process. The Company currently maintains a workforce comprising eight full-time employees of its own.\nProducts Roadmap\nThe Sure Shot Dietary Supplement was launched on our own website and through Amazon in December 2023 and with several Big Box stores. The Company is advancing\nseveral product formats and formulations to continue to offer a wide array of products that can be purchased at various locations that coincide with consumer shopping habits. In\nparticular, the Company plans to continue to develop new flavors for each of its current SKUs (4 oz. and \"Powder Pack”). In addition, the current formula will be offered at various\ndosages and research studies will be carried out addressing dose, ingredient selection and efficacy across multiple indications to help bolster product development and product\nofferings.\n2\nTable of Contents\nResearch and Development\nOur research and development team in continually looking to develop new therapeutic products, while continually improving and enhancing our existing products and\nproduct candidates to address customer demands and emerging trends.\nWe have conducted extensive research and experimentation involving a substantial number of volunteers under the influence of intoxicants. Our findings indicate that the\nSure Shot Dietary Supplement can reduce a person’s Blood Alcohol Content (\"BAC”) by supporting its metabolism, as measured by the premier Breathalyzer in the market. We\nhave recently completed our clinical trials of the Sure Shot Dietary Supplement which have shown a statistically significant reduction in the BAC of the participants. The\nobservable enhancements in cognitive abilities among the test subjects have been carefully documented. See \"Business-Research and Development.”\nSales and Marketing\nThe first 3 quarters since Sure Shot was launched was our opportunity to test, learn, iterate, and evolve our branding and product. This period has helped us to better\nunderstand our target consumers, what they want, and how we can better meet their needs.\nAs we have gathered these learnings, we have gained valuable insights that have allowed us to shape our strategy for sustainable long-term growth and success. One of\nthese learnings was that our 12oz package was not the best fit for our consumer’s needs. The reason for this is the 12oz was too much liquid for consumers to drink while they were\ndrinking. The 12oz was also not portable so consumers weren’t able to take it with them on a night out. We also learned that branding was a more scientific lean and may not have\npopped off the shelf and enticed new shoppers to buy. We also learned that our taste was not good and was causing some resistance with consumers, so we knew this is\nsomething that must be addressed. Lastly, shipping a 12oz can product is very heavy thus our shipping costs are quite high, reducing our overall margins. Because of these\nreasons, we made the decision to do a brand refresh as well as transition into a 4oz product and powder packs. This transitional period occurred during Q3 as we felt this was the\nbest time to make the change as we head into a big 2025 year. Rather than continue selling the old branding and 12oz that was going to be discontinued, we shifted our sales\nefforts to focus on selling the new branding and 4oz and powder pack formats. These factors resulted in us having a Q3 period where sales were down, as we geared up to launch\nthe new branding.\nManufacturing, Logistics and Fulfillment\nWe outsource the manufacturing of our products to contract manufacturers, who produce them according to our formulation specifications. Our products are\nmanufactured by contract manufacturers in India and the US. The majority of our products will then be shipped to third-party warehouses and to our corporate offices, which can\neither transport them to our distributors, retailers, or directly to our customers. Our third-party warehouses are located in the US. We use a limited number of logistics providers to\ndeliver our products to both distributors and retailers, which allows us to lessen order fulfillment time, cut shipping costs, and improve inventory flexibility. Shifting from 12oz cans\nto 4oz shot has moved our current production to a facility located in Northern Louisiana. We chose a central location to help reduce the cost of shipping to our warehouses and\nfacilitate a more seamless approach to logistics. We are now in the process of more frequent production runs of smaller size. This approach will ensure that our production volume\nand timeline of our finished goods match the sell in and sell through (turn rate) of our distribution and retail partners. We have aligned with distribution groups that service both\nlarger retailers as well as the smaller convenience stores for Q4 and beyond. Current individual website sales fulfilment has continued, and we are aligning with more distribution\npartners and specific fulfilment groups as we continue to increase our sales.\nOur Competitive Strengths\nWe are committed to driving continuous improvement through innovation. Since our inception, we have made significant investments in research and development and\nhave acquired a substantial portfolio of intellectual property, which continues to grow each year. Our commitment to innovation has allowed us to create unique products that\naddress unmet needs in the market, all backed by rigorous clinical research. We believe that our focus on research and development is designed to enable us to stay ahead of the\ncurve and provide our customers with products that are not only effective but also innovative. We take pride in our patent portfolio and the continuous growth we have achieved,\nas we believe that it showcases our dedication to creating new and unique solutions for our customers. By staying committed to innovation, we are confident in our ability to meet\nthe ever-changing needs of the health and wellness market. We believe that the Sure Shot Dietary Supplement stands as a unique product in the liquid dietary supplement market.\nNevertheless, our competitive landscape includes many companies involved in the production of health and welfare products.\nRecent Developments\nOn January 19, 2023, the Company entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement (the \"PIPE Agreement”) with certain purchasers, for the issuance of 8,631,574 common\nstock warrants (the \"PIPE Offering”) at a price of $0.125 per warrant, comprised of two common stock warrants (the \"Common Warrants,”), each to purchase up to one share of\nCommon Stock per Common Warrant with an exercise price of $1.00 per share , with (a) 4,315,787 Common Warrants being immediately exercisable for three years following 6\nmonths from the closing of the PIPE Offering, and (b) 4,315,787 Common Warrants being immediately exercisable for five years following 6 months from the closing of the PIPE\nOffering. Concurrently to the PIPE Agreement, the Company entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement (the \"RD Agreement”) with certain purchasers, pursuant to which on\nJanuary 23, 2023, 4,315,787 shares of common stock, par value $0.001 (the \"Common Stock”), at a price of $0.70 per share were issued to the purchasers (the \"RD Offering”). The\nCommon Stock was issued pursuant to a Registration Statement on Form S-3 filed by the Company with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the \"Commission”) on\nSeptember 28, 2022 (File No. 333-267644) and declared effective on November 9,2022. The aggregate gross proceeds to the Company from both the PIPE Offering and the RD\nOffering were approximately $4.1 million, with the purchase price of one share, one 3-year warrant and one 5-year warrant as $0.95. The net proceeds were $3,450,675.\n3\nTable of Contents\nOn July 10, 2023, the Company entered into an asset purchase agreement (the \"Agreement”) with GBB Labs, Inc., a Delaware corporation set up as an acquisition\ncompany (\"Buyer”), GBB Drink Lab Inc., a Florida corporation (\"Seller”), 2V Consulting LLC, a Florida limited liability company, the Jarrett A Boon Revocable Trust Dated October\n22, 2014, Gregory D. Blackman, an individual and Brothers Investment 7777, LLC. Pursuant to the Agreement, the Buyer purchased certain assets relating to the Safety Shot Dietary\nSupplement for a consideration comprising of: (a) the sum of Two Hundred Thousand U.S. Dollars (US $200,000) (the \"Cash Purchase Price”); and (b) 5,000,000 Common Shares\n(the \"Consideration Shares” and together with the Cash Purchase Price, collectively, the \"Purchase Price”). The asset purchase was closed on August 31, 2023.\nIntellectual Property\nIn connection with the asset purchase describe above, the Company owns five patents, including the patent (US 9,186,350 B2)and patent (US 10,028,991 B2) for the\ncomposition of the Sure Shot Dietary Supplement used for minimizing the harmful effects associated with alcohol consumption by supporting the metabolism of alcohol.\nGovernment Regulation\nThe Sure Shot Dietary Supplement:\nThe production, distribution and sale in the United States of the Sure Shot Dietary Supplement is subject to various U.S. federal, state and local regulations, including but\nnot limited to: the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (\"FD&C Act”); the Occupational Safety and Health Act and various state laws and regulations governing workplace\nhealth and safety; various environmental statutes; the Safe Drinking Water and Toxic Enforcement Act of 1986 (\"California Proposition 65”); data privacy and personal data\nprotection laws and regulations, including the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (as modified by the California Privacy Rights Act) and a number of other federal, state and\nlocal statutes and regulations applicable to the production, transportation, sale, safety, advertising, marketing, labeling, packaging, and ingredients of the Sure Shot Dietary\nSupplement.\nWe also may in the future be affected by other existing, proposed and potential future regulations or regulatory actions, including those described below, any of which\ncould adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nFurthermore, legislation and regulation may be introduced in the United States at the federal, state, municipal and supranational level in respect of each of the subject\nareas discussed below. Public health officials and health advocates are increasingly focused on the public health consequences associated with obesity and alcohol consumption,\nespecially as they may affect children, and are seeking legislative change to reduce the consumption of sweetened and alcohol beverages.\nWe are subject to a number of regulations applicable to the formulation, labeling, packaging, and advertising (including promotional campaigns) of our products. In\nCalifornia, we are subject to California Proposition 65, a law which requires that a specified warning be provided before exposing California consumers to any product that contains\nin excess of threshold amounts of a substance listed by California as having been found to cause cancer or reproductive toxicity. California Proposition 65 does not require a\nwarning if the manufacturer of a product can demonstrate that the use of the product in question exposes consumers to an average daily quantity of a listed substance that is\nbelow that threshold amount, which is determined either by scientific criteria set forth inapplicable regulations or via a \"safe harbor” threshold that may be established by the state,\nor the substance is naturally occurring, or is subject to another applicable exception. As of the date of this registration statement, we are not required to put a warning label on our\nproduct and our products are perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances (\"PFAS”) free. We are unable to predict whether a component found in our product might be added to\nthe California list in the future. Furthermore, we are also unable to predict when or whether the increasing sensitivity of detection methodology may become applicable under this\nlaw and related regulations as they currently exist, or as they may be amended. If we are required to add warning labels to any of our products or place warnings in certain locations\nwhere our products are sold, it will be difficult to predict whether, or to what extent, such a warning would have an adverse impact on sales of our products in those locations or\nelsewhere. In addition, there has been increasing regulatory activity globally regarding constituents in packaging materials, including PFAS. Regardless of whether perceived\nhealth consequences of these constituents are justified, such regulatory activity could result in additional government regulations that impact the packaging of our beverages.\nIn addition, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (the \"FDA”) has regulations with respect to serving size information and nutrition labeling on food and beverage\nproducts, including a requirement to disclose the amount of added sugars in such products. Further, the U.S. Department of Agriculture promulgated regulations requiring that, by\nJanuary 1, 2022, the labels of certain bioengineered foods include a disclosure that the food is bioengineered. These regulations may impact, reduce and/or otherwise affect the\npurchase and consumption of our products by consumers.\nAll ingredients in the Sure Shot Dietary Supplement are deemed Generally Recognized as Safe (\"GRAS”) and align with FDA standards, permitting their inclusion in\nsupplements. In the event that the FDA or any governmental agency identifies an ingredient or aspect of our product as unsafe, we commit to promptly withdrawing that\ncomponent in accordance with regulatory directives. From a product and sales perspective, there are no impediments or concerns raised by any governmental agency. It is\nessential to note that the Safety Shot Dietary Supplement is classified as a dietary supplement, exempt from the approval or filing requirements mandated for pharmaceutical drugs\nby the FDA or other regulatory authorities.\n4\nTable of Contents\nBasis of Presentation\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements are presented in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America\n(\"GAAP”) and pursuant to the rules and regulations of US Securities and Exchange Commission (\"SEC”). The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the\nCompany and its wholly-owned subsidiaries Caring Brands, Inc., a Florida corporation, Jupiter Wellness Investments, Inc., a Florida corporation, All intercompany accounts and\ntransactions have been eliminated.\nEquity Method for Investments\nInvestments in unconsolidated affiliates, which the Company exerts significant influence but does not control or otherwise consolidate, are accounted for using the equity\nmethod. Equity method investments are initially recorded at cost. These investments are included in investment in joint ventures in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.\nThe Company’s share of the profits and losses from these investments is reported in loss from equity method joint venture in the accompanying consolidated statements of\noperations. The Company monitors its investments for other-than-temporary impairment by considering factors such as current economic and market conditions and the operating\nperformance of the investees and records reductions in carrying values when necessary.\nAsset Purchases\nThe Company accounts for an acquisitive transaction determined to be an asset purchase based on the cost accumulation and allocation method, under which the costs\nto purchase the asset or set of assets are allocated to the assets acquired. No goodwill is recorded in connection with an asset purchase.\nInvestments in Marketable Securities\nThe Company’s Marketable Securities are considered Held-For-Trading (\"HFT”) or Trading Assets. HTF- Trading securities are valued at their fair value when\npurchased/sold, and any unrealized gains or losses are recorded periodically on financial reporting dates as other income or loss.\nEmerging Growth Company Status\nWe are an \"emerging growth company,” as defined in Section 2(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, (the \"Securities Act”), as modified by the Jumpstart our\nBusiness Startups Act of 2012, (the \"JOBS Act”), and we may take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public\ncompanies that are not emerging growth companies including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the\nSarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in its periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of\nholding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and shareholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved.\nFurther, Section 102(b)(1) of the JOBS Act exempts emerging growth companies from being required to comply with new or revised financial accounting standards until\nprivate companies (that is, those that have not had a Securities Act registration statement declared effective or do not have a class of securities registered under the Exchange Act)\nare required to comply with the new or revised financial accounting standards. The JOBS Act provides that a company can elect to opt out of the extended transition period and\ncomply with the requirements that apply to non-emerging growth companies but any such election to opt out is irrevocable. We have elected not to opt out of such extended\ntransition period which means that when a standard is issued or revised and it has different application dates for public or private companies, we, as an emerging growth company,\ncan adopt the new or revised standard at the time private companies adopt the new or revised standard. This may make comparison of our financial statements with another public\ncompany which is neither an emerging growth company nor an emerging growth company which has opted out of using the extended transition period difficult or impossible\nbecause of the potential differences in accounting standards used.\nSignificant Accounting Policies and Estimates\nOur management’s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our unaudited financial statements for the nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024 and 2023 and audited financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2023, which have been prepared in accordance with United States generally\naccepted accounting principles, or U.S. GAAP, and the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission. The preparation of the financial statements requires us to\nmake estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial\nstatements as well as the reported revenue generated, and expenses incurred during the reporting periods. Our estimates are based on our historical experience and on various\nother factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that\nare not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions and any such differences may be material. We\nbelieve that the accounting policies discussed below are critical to understanding our historical and future performance, as these policies relate to the more significant areas\ninvolving management’s judgments and estimates.\nCash and Cash Equivalents\nThe Company considers all short-term investments with a maturity of three months or less when purchased to be cash and equivalents for purposes of the statement of\ncash flows. There were no cash equivalents as of September 30, 2024 or December 31, 2023.\n5\nTable of Contents\nNet Loss per Common Share\nNet income (loss) per common share is computed pursuant to section 260-10-45 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification. Basic net income (loss) per share is\ncomputed by dividing net income (loss) by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. If applicable, diluted earnings per share\nassume the conversion, exercise or issuance of all common stock instruments such as options, warrants, convertible securities and preferred stock, unless the effect is to reduce a\nloss or increase earnings per share. As such, options, warrants, convertible securities and preferred stock are not considered in the calculations, as the impact of the potential\ncommon shares would be to decrease the loss per share.\nFor the Three Months Ended September 30, For the Nine Months Ended September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nNumerator:\nNet (loss) (11,929,277) (7,738,301) (35,878,043) (9,406,066)\n- -\nDenominator: - -\nDenominator for basic earnings per share - Weighted-average common\nshares issued and outstanding during the period 55,930,639 29,836,485 51,713,368 27,370,658\nDenominator for diluted earnings per share 55,930,639 29,836,485 51,713,368 27,370,658\nBasic (loss) per share (0.21) (0.26) (0.69) (0.34)\nDiluted (loss) per share (0.21) (0.26) (0.69) (0.34)\nRevenue Recognition\nThe Company generates its revenue from the sale of its products directly to the end user or distributor (collectively the \"customer”).\nThe Company recognizes revenues by applying the following steps in accordance with FASB Accounting Standards Codification 606 \"Revenue from Contracts with\nCustomers” (\"ASC 606”). Under ASC 606, revenues are recognized when control of the promised goods or services are transferred to a customer, in an amount that reflects the\nconsideration that the Company expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services. The Company applies the following five steps in order to determine the appropriate\namount of revenue to be recognized as it fulfills its obligations under each of its agreements:\n● identify the contract with a customer;\n● identify the performance obligations in the contract;\n● determine the transaction price;\n● allocate the transaction price to performance obligations in the contract; and\n● recognize revenue as the performance obligation is satisfied.\nThe Company’s performance obligations are satisfied when goods or products are shipped on an FOB shipping point basis as title passes when shipped. Our product is\ngenerally paid in advance of shipment or standard net 30 days and we offer no specific right of return, refund or warranty related to our products except for cases of defective\nproducts of which there have been none to date.\nAccounts Receivable and Credit Risk\nAccounts receivable are generated from sales of the Company’s products. The Company provides an allowance for doubtful collections, which is based upon a review of\noutstanding receivables, historical collection information, and existing economic conditions. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company had not recognized an\nallowance for doubtful collections.\nInventory\nInventories are stated at the lower of cost or market. The Company periodically reviews the value of items in inventory and provides write-downs or write-offs of\ninventory based on its assessment of market conditions. Write-downs and write-offs are charged to cost of goods sold. Inventory is based upon the average cost method of\naccounting.\nFair Value of Financial Instruments\nThe fair value of our assets and liabilities, which qualify as financial instruments under ASC Topic 820, \"Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures,” approximates the\ncarrying amounts represented in the accompanying balance sheet, primarily due to their short-term nature.\n6\nTable of Contents\nIncome Taxes\nWe account for income taxes under ASC 740 Income Taxes (\"ASC 740”). ASC 740 requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for both the expected\nimpact of differences between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities and for the expected future tax benefit to be derived from tax loss and tax credit carry\nforwards. ASC 740 additionally requires a valuation allowance to be established when it is more likely than not that all or a portion of deferred tax assets will not be realized.\nASC 740 also clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise’s financial statements and prescribes a recognition threshold and\nmeasurement process for financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. For those benefits to be recognized, a tax\nposition must be more-likely-than-not to be sustained upon examination by taxing authorities. ASC 740 also provides guidance on derecognition, classification, interest and\npenalties, accounting in interim period, disclosure and transition. Based on our evaluation, it has been concluded that there are no significant uncertain tax positions requiring\nrecognition in our financial statements. Since we were incorporated on October 24, 2018, the evaluation was performed for 2018 tax year, which would be the only period subject to\nexamination. We believe that our income tax positions and deductions would be sustained on audit and does not anticipate any adjustments that would result in a material changes\nto our financial position. Our policy for recording interest and penalties associated with audits is to record such items as a component of income tax expense.\nThe Company’s deferred tax asset at December 31, 2023 consists of net operating loss carry forwards calculated using federal and state effective tax rates equating to\napproximately $8,658,484 less a valuation allowance in the amount of approximately $8,658,484. Due to the Company’s lack of earnings history, the deferred tax asset has been fully\noffset by a valuation allowance in the year ended December 31, 2023.\nResearch and Development\nThe Company accounts for research and development costs in accordance with the Accounting Standards Codification subtopic 730-10, Research and Development\n(\"ASC 730-10”). Under ASC 730-10, all research and development costs must be charged to expense as incurred. Accordingly, internal research and development costs are\nexpensed as incurred. Third-party research and developments costs are expensed when the contracted work has been performed or as milestone results have been achieved.\nCompany-sponsored research and development costs related to both present and future products are expensed in the period incurred. The Company incurred research and\ndevelopment expenses of $271,719 and $98,091.24 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\nStock Based Compensation\nWe recognize compensation costs to employees under FASB Accounting Standards Codification 718 \"Compensation - Stock Compensation” (\"ASC 718”). Under ASC\n718, companies are required to measure the compensation costs of share-based compensation arrangements based on the grant-date fair value and recognize the costs in the\nfinancial statements over the period during which employees are required to provide services. Share based compensation arrangements include stock options and warrants. As\nsuch, compensation cost is measured on the date of grant at their fair value. Such compensation amounts, if any, are amortized over the respective vesting periods of the option\ngrant.\nOn October 24, 2018, the inception date (\"Inception”), we adopted ASU No. 2018-07 \"Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Nonemployee\nShare-Based Payment Accounting.” These amendments expand the scope of Topic 718, Compensation - Stock Compensation (which currently only includes share-based\npayments to employees) to include share-based payments issued to nonemployees for goods or services. Consequently, the accounting for share-based payments to\nnonemployees and employees will be substantially aligned.\nRelated parties\nThe Company follows subtopic 850-10 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification for the identification of related parties and disclosure of related party transactions.\nPursuant to Section 850-10-20 the related parties include a. affiliates of the Company; b.

Other parties that can significantly influence the\nmanagement or operating policies of the transacting parties or that have an ownership interest in one of the transacting parties and can significantly influence the other to an\nextent that one or more of the transacting parties might be prevented from fully pursuing its own separate interests.\nThe consolidated financial statements shall include disclosures of material related party transactions, other than compensation arrangements, expense allowances, and\nother similar items in the ordinary course of business. However, disclosure of transactions that are eliminated in the preparation of consolidated or combined financial statements is\nnot required in those statements. The disclosures shall include: a. the nature of the relationship(s) involved; b. a description of the transactions, including transactions to which no\namounts or nominal amounts were ascribed, for each of the periods for which income statements are presented, and such other information deemed necessary to an understanding\nof the effects of the transactions on the financial statements; c. the dollar amounts of transactions for each of the periods for which income statements are presented and the\neffects of any change in the method of establishing the terms from that used in the preceding period; and d. amounts due from or to related parties as of the date of each balance\nsheet presented and, if not otherwise apparent, the terms and manner of settlement.\n7\nTable of Contents\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nManagement does not believe that any recently issued, but not effective, accounting standards, if currently adopted, would have a material effect on our financial\nstatements.\nResults of Operations\nFor the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023\nThe following table provides selected financial data about us for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\nSeptember 30, 2024 September 30, 2023\nSales $ 110,213 $ 11,877\nCost of Sales 402,399 46,438\nGross Profit (Loss) (292,186) (34,561)\nTotal operating expenses 11,348,320 4,090,608\nOther income (expense) 10,413 (3,152,437)\nNet loss from operations $ (11,630,093) $ (7,277,606)\nLoss from discontinued operations (299,184) (460,695)\nNet loss $ (11,929,277) $ (7,738,301)\nRevenues\nWe generated $110,213 in revenues for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to $11,877 revenues in the three months ended September 30, 2023.\nOperating Expenses and Other Income (Expense)\nWe had total operating expenses of $11,348,320 and other income of $10,413, of other expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to $4,090,608 and\n$3,152,437 of other expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2023.\nOperating expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024 were in connection with our daily operations as follows: (i) marketing expenses of $2,186,808; (ii)\nresearch and development of $10,315; (iii) legal and professional expenses of $2,586,915, consisting of corporate advisory services, annual report preparation fees and general\ncorporate governance fees; (iv) rent and utilities of $93,357; (v) depreciation and amortization of $109,033; (vi) general and administrative expenses of $995,872, consisting of\npayroll and related taxes, travel, meals and entertainment, office supplies and expense, compensation related to management transition agreements and other normal office and\nadministration expenses; and (vii) stock based compensation of $5,366,021.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\nAs a \"smaller reporting company”, we are not required to provide the information required by this Item.\nItem 4. Controls and Procedures\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nThe Company maintains disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the Company’s Exchange Act reports is\nrecorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time communicated to the Company’s management, including its Chief Executive Officer and principal financial officer, as\nappropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure based closely on the definition of \"disclosure controls and procedures” in Rule 13a-15(e). The Company’s\ndisclosure controls and procedures are designed to provide a reasonable level of assurance of reaching the Company’s desired disclosure control objectives. In designing periods\nspecified in the SEC’s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognized that any controls\nand procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and management necessarily was\nrequired to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. The Company’s certifying officers have concluded that the\nCompany’s disclosure controls and procedures are effective in reaching that level of assurance.\nAt the end of the period being reported upon, the Company carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of the Company’s management, including\nthe Company’s Chief Executive Officer and principal financial officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures. Based\non the foregoing, our Chief Executive Officer and principal financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were ineffective to ensure that the material\ninformation required to be included in our Securities and Exchange Commission reports is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive\nand financial officer, recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in Securities and Exchange Commission rules and forms relating to the\nCompany, based on the assessment and control of disclosure decisions currently performed by a small team. The Company plans to expand its management team and build a\nfulsome internal control framework required by a more complex entity.\nChanges in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nDuring the past nine months and previous fiscal year, we implemented significant measures to remediate the previously disclosed ineffectiveness of our internal control over\nfinancial reporting, which included an insufficient degree of segregation of duties amongst our accounting and financial reporting personnel, and the lack of a formalized and\ncomplete set of policy and procedure documentation evidencing our system of internal controls over financial reporting. The remediation measures consisted of the hiring of\nindividuals with appropriate experience in internal controls over financial reporting, and the modification of our accounting processes and enhancement to our financial controls,\nincluding the testing of such controls.\nOther than as described above, there was no change in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) or 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) identified in\nconnection with the evaluation required by Rules 13a-15(d) or 15d-15(d) that occurred during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 that has materially affected, or is\nreasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.\nLimitations on the Effectiveness of Controls\nManagement has confidence in its internal controls and procedures. The Company’s management believes that a control system, no matter how well designed and operated can\nprovide only reasonable assurance and cannot provide absolute assurance that the objectives of the internal control system are met, and no evaluation of internal controls can\nprovide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within a company have been detected. Further, the design of an internal control system must\nreflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitation in all internal control\nsystems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issuers and instances of fraud, if any, within the Company have been detected.\n10\nTable of Contents\nPART II - OTHER INFORMATION\nItem 1. Legal Proceedings\nThe Company may be subject to legal proceedings and claims arising from contracts or other matters from time to time in the ordinary course of business.

Jupiter Wellness, Inc., No.1:23-cv-07874-KPF (the \"Litigation”). Sabby’s initial complaint in the Litigation alleges that\nthe Company’s delayed spin-off and distribution of the common stock of \"SRM” Entertainment. Inc. give rise to claims of breach-of-contact, promissory estoppel, and negligent\nmisrepresentation.\nOn November 10, 2023, Jupiter sought judicial permission to move to dismiss Sabby’s complaint, arguing that Sabby had no legal right to the delayed distribution\noccurring on the original record date, and that regardless, no law requires the Company to compensate Sabby for the costs of covering its short position against the Company. In\nresponse, the Court allowed the parties to bypass that dismissal motion briefing so long as Sabby filed an amended complaint by December 15, 2023.\nSabby seeks compensatory damages estimated to exceed $500,000. The Company has filed a motion to dismiss Sabby’s amended complaint and is awaiting the Court’s\nruling.

The Company filed its answer to the complaint on or about March 7, 2024.

(\"Bigger”), filed a lawsuit against the Company in the Supreme Court for the State of New York, Case No. 650148/2024 (the\n\"Litigation”).

Risk Factors\nRisks Related to Our Business\nIf we are unable to keep up with rapid technological changes, our products may become obsolete.\nThe market for our products is characterized by significant and rapid change. Although we will continue to expand our product line capabilities to remain competitive,\nresearch and discoveries by others may make our processes, products, or brands less attractive or even obsolete.\nCompetition could adversely affect our business.\nOur industry in general is competitive. It is possible that future competitors could enter our market, thereby causing us to lose market share and revenues. In addition,\nsome of our current or future competitors may have significantly greater financial, technical, marketing, and other resources than we do or may have more experience or advantages\nin the markets in which we will compete that will allow them to offer lower prices or higher quality products. If we do not successfully compete with these competitors, we could fail\nto develop market share and our future business prospects could be adversely affected.\nIf we are unable to develop and maintain our brand and reputation for our product offerings, our business and prospects could be materially harmed.\nOur business and prospects depend, in part, on developing and then maintaining and strengthening our brand and reputation in the markets we serve. If problems with\nour products cause our customers to have a negative experience or failure or delay in the delivery of our products to our customers, our brand and reputation could be diminished.\nIf we fail to develop, promote and maintain our brand and reputation successfully, our business and prospects could be materially harmed.\nWe are subject to government regulation, and unfavorable changes could substantially harm our business and results of operations.\nWe are subject to general business regulations and laws as well as regulations and laws specifically governing our industries in the U.S. and other countries in which we\noperate. Uncertainty surrounding existing and future laws and regulations may impede our services and increase the cost of providing such services. These regulations and laws\nmay cover taxation, tariffs, user pricing, distribution, consumer protection and the characteristics and quality of services.\nWe depend heavily on key personnel, and turnover of key senior management could harm our business.\nOur future business and results of operations depend in significant part upon the continued contributions of our senior management personnel. If we lose their services\nor if they fail to perform in their current positions, or if we are not able to attract and retain skilled personnel as needed, our business could suffer. Significant turnover in our senior\nmanagement could significantly deplete our institutional knowledge held by our existing senior management team. We depend on the skills and abilities of these key personnel in\nmanaging the product acquisition, marketing and sales aspects of our business, any part of which could be harmed by turnover in the future. We may not have written employment\nagreements with all of our senior management. We do not have any key person insurance.\nOur products may not meet health and safety standards or could become contaminated.\nWe do not have control over all of the third parties involved in the manufacturing of our products and their compliance with government health and safety standards.\nEven if our products meet these standards, they could otherwise become contaminated. A failure to meet these standards or contamination could occur in our operations or those\nof our manufacturers, distributors or suppliers. This could result in expensive production interruptions, recalls and liability claims. Moreover, negative publicity could be generated\nfrom false, unfounded or nominal liability claims or limited recalls. Any of these failures or occurrences could negatively affect our business and financial performance.\nThe sale of our products involves product liability and related risks that could expose us to significant insurance and loss expenses.\nWe face an inherent risk of exposure to product liability claims if the use of our products results in, or is believed to have resulted in, illness or injury. Our products\ncontain combinations of ingredients, and there is little long-term experience with the effect of these combinations. In addition, interactions of these products with other products,\nprescription medicines and over-the-counter treatments have not been fully explored or understood and may have unintended consequences.\nAny product liability claim may increase our costs and adversely affect our revenue and operating income. Moreover, liability claims arising from a serious adverse event\nmay increase our costs through higher insurance premiums and deductibles and may make it more difficult to secure adequate insurance coverage in the future. In addition, our\nproduct liability insurance may fail to cover future product liability claims, which, if adversely determined, could subject us to substantial monetary damages.\nThe success of our business will depend upon our ability to create and expand our brand awareness.\nThe markets we compete in, including the wellness and dietary supplement market, we intend to compete in, are highly competitive, with many well-known brands leading\nthe industry. Our ability to compete effectively and generate revenue will be based upon our ability to create and expand awareness of our products distinct from those of our\ncompetitors. It is imperative that we are able to convey to consumers the benefits of our products. However, advertising and packaging and labeling of such products will be\nlimited by various regulations. Our success will be dependent upon our ability to convey to consumers that our products are superior to those of our competitors.\n12\nTable of Contents\nWe must develop and introduce new products to succeed.\nOur industry is subject to rapid change. New products are constantly introduced to the market. Our ability to remain competitive depends in part on our ability to enhance\nexisting products, to develop and manufacture new products in a timely and cost-effective manner, to accurately predict market transitions, and to effectively market our products.\nOur future financial results will depend to a great extent on the successful introduction of several new products. We cannot be certain that we will be successful in selecting,\ndeveloping, manufacturing and marketing new products or in enhancing existing products.\n● The success of new product introductions depends on various factors, including, without limitation, the following: Successful sales and marketing efforts;\n● Timely delivery of new products;\n● Availability of raw materials;\n● Pricing of raw materials;\n● Regulatory allowance of the products; and\n● Customer acceptance of new products\nAdverse publicity associated with our products or ingredients, or those of similar companies, could adversely affect our sales and revenue.\nAdverse publicity concerning any actual or purported failure by us to comply with applicable laws and regulations regarding any aspect of our business could have an\nadverse effect on the public perception of us. This, in turn, could negatively affect our ability to obtain financing, endorsers and attract distributors or retailers for our products,\nwhich would have a material adverse effect on our ability to generate sales and revenue.\nOur distributors’ and customers’ perception of the safety and quality of our products or even similar products distributed by others can be significantly influenced by\nnational media attention, publicized scientific research or findings, product liability claims and other publicity concerning our products or similar products distributed by others.\nAdverse publicity, whether or not accurate, that associates consumption of our products or any similar products with illness or other adverse effects, will likely diminish the\npublic’s perception of our products. Claims that any products are ineffective, inappropriately labeled or have inaccurate instructions as to their use, could have a material adverse\neffect on the market demand for our products, including reducing our sales and revenue.\nIf serious adverse or undesirable side effects are identified during the development of our product candidates, we may abandon or limit our development or\ncommercialization of such product candidates.\nIf our product candidates are associated with undesirable side effects or have unexpected characteristics, we may need to abandon their development or limit development\nto certain uses or subpopulations in which the undesirable side effects or other characteristics are less prevalent, less severe or more acceptable from a risk-benefit perspective.\nIf we elect or are forced to suspend or terminate any clinical trial with one of our product candidates, the commercial prospects of such product candidate will be harmed,\nand our ability to generate revenue from such product candidate will be delayed or eliminated. Any of these occurrences may harm our business, financial condition and prospects\nsignificantly.\nIf we experience delays or difficulties in the enrollment of subjects to our clinical trials, our ability to complete such trials will be adversely affected\nIdentifying, screening and enrolling patients to participate in clinical trials of our product candidates is critical to our success, and we may not be able to identify, recruit,\nenroll and dose a sufficient number of patients with the required or desired characteristics to complete our clinical trials in a timely manner. The timing of our clinical trials depends\non our ability to recruit patients to participate as well as to subsequently dose these patients and complete required follow-up periods. In particular, because our planned clinical\ntrials may be focused on indications with relatively small patient populations, our ability to enroll eligible patients may be limited or may result in slower enrollment than we\nanticipate.\nIn addition, we may experience enrollment delays related to increased or unforeseen legal and logistical requirements at certain clinical trial sites. These delays could be\ncaused by reviews by contractual discussions with individual clinical trial sites. Any delays in enrolling and/or dosing patients in our planned clinical trials could result in\nincreased costs, delays in advancing our product candidates, delays in testing the effectiveness of our product candidates or in termination of the clinical trials altogether.\n13\nTable of Contents\nParticipant enrollment may also be affected by other factors, including:\n● coordination with clinical research organizations to enroll and administer the clinical trials;\n● coordination and recruitment of collaborators and investigators at individual sites;\n● size of the participant population and process for identifying participants;\n● design of the clinical trial protocol;\n● eligibility and exclusion criteria;\n● perceived risks and benefits of the product candidates under study;\n● time of year in which the trials are initiated or conducted;\n● ability to obtain and maintain subject consents;\n● ability to enroll participants in a timely manner;\n● risk that enrolled subjects will drop out before completion of the trials;\n● proximity and availability of clinical trial sites for prospective participants;\n● ability to monitor subjects adequately during and after treatment.\nIt is uncertain whether product liability insurance will be adequate to address product liability claims, or that insurance against such claims will be affordable or\navailable on acceptable terms in the future.\nClinical research involves the testing of products on human volunteers pursuant to a clinical trial protocol. Such testing involves a risk of liability for personal injury to or\ndeath of patients due to, among other causes, adverse side effects, improper administration of the new product, or improper volunteer behavior. Claims may arise from patients,\nclinical trial volunteers, consumers, physicians, hospitals, companies, institutions, researchers, or others using, selling, or buying our products, as well as from governmental\nbodies. In addition, product liability and related risks are likely to increase over time, in particular upon the commercialization or marketing of any products by us or parties with\nwhich we enter into development, marketing, or distribution collaborations. Although we are contracting for general liability insurance in connection with our ongoing business,\nthere can be no assurance that the amount and scope of such insurance coverage will be appropriate and sufficient in the event any claims arise, that we will be able to secure\nadditional coverage should we attempt to do so, or that our insurers would not contest or refuse any attempt by us to collect on such insurance policies. Furthermore, there can be\nno assurance that suitable product liability insurance (at the clinical stage and/or commercial stage) will continue to be available on terms acceptable to us or at all, or that, if\nobtained, the insurance coverage will be appropriate and sufficient to cover any potential claims or liabilities.\nIf we are unable to establish relationships with licensees or collaborators to carry out sales, marketing, and distribution functions or to create effective marketing,\nsales, and distribution capabilities, we will be unable to market our products successfully.\nOur business strategy may include out-licensing product candidates to or collaborating with larger firms with experience in marketing and selling pharmaceutical products.\nThere can be no assurance that we will successfully be able to establish marketing, sales, or distribution relationships with any third-party, that such relationships, if established,\nwill be successful, or that we will be successful in gaining market acceptance for any products we might develop. To the extent that we enter into any marketing, sales, or\ndistribution arrangements with third parties, our product revenues per unit sold are expected to be lower than if we marketed, sold, and distributed our products directly, and any\nrevenues we receive will depend upon the efforts of such third parties.\nIf we are unable to establish such third-party marketing and sales relationships, or choose not to do so, we would have to establish in-house marketing and sales\ncapabilities. To market any products directly, we would have to establish a marketing, sales, and distribution force that has technical expertise and could support a distribution\ncapability. Competition in the dietary supplement industry for technically proficient marketing, sales, and distribution personnel is intense and attracting and retaining such\npersonnel may significantly increase our costs.\nThere can be no assurance that we will be able to establish internal marketing, sales, or distribution capabilities or that these capabilities will be sufficient to meet our\nneeds.\nWe face business disruption and related risks resulting from the recent pandemic of COVID-19, which could have, and has had, a material adverse effect on our\nbusiness plan.\nOur supply chain and the development of our product candidates, including that of our subsidiaries, could be, and have been, disrupted and materially adversely affected\nby the recent outbreak of COVID-19. As a result of measures imposed by the governments in affected regions, businesses and schools have been suspended due to quarantines\nintended to contain this outbreak. We are still assessing our business plans and the impact COVID-19 may have on our supply chain and ability to conduct our clinical trials, but\nthere can be no assurance that this analysis will enable us to avoid part or all of any impact from the spread of COVID-19 or its consequences, including downturns in business\nsentiment generally. The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic and global efforts to contain its spread will impact our operations will depend on future developments, which are\nhighly uncertain and cannot be predicted at this time, and include the duration, severity and scope of the pandemic and the actions taken to contain or treat the COVID-19\npandemic.\nNatural disasters and other events beyond our control could materially adversely affect us.\nNatural disasters or other catastrophic events may cause damage or disruption to our operations, international commerce and the global economy, and thus could have a\nstrong negative effect on us. Our business operations are subject to interruption by natural disasters, fire, power shortages, pandemics and other events beyond our control. Such\nevents could make it difficult or impossible for us to deliver our services to our customers and could decrease demand for our services. The World Health Organization declared the\nCOVID-19 outbreak a pandemic. The extent of the impact of COVID-19 on our operational and financial performance will depend on certain developments, including the duration\nand spread of the outbreak, the impact on our customers and employees, all of which are uncertain and cannot be predicted. At this point, the overall extent to which COVID-19\nmay impact our financial condition or results of operations is uncertain.\n14\nTable of Contents\nWe have a limited operating history upon which investors can evaluate our future prospects.\nWe have a limited operating history upon which an evaluation of its business plan or performance and prospects can be made. The business and prospects of the\nCompany must be considered in the light of the potential problems, delays, uncertainties and complications encountered in connection with a newly established business and new\nindustry. The risks include, but are not limited to, the possibility that we will not be able to develop functional and scalable products and services, or that although functional and\nscalable, our products and services will not be economical to market; that our competitors hold proprietary rights that preclude us from marketing such products; that our\ncompetitors market a superior or equivalent product; that we are not able to upgrade and enhance our technologies and products to accommodate new features and expanded\nservice offerings; or the failure to receive necessary regulatory clearances for our products. To successfully introduce and market our products at a profit, we must establish brand\nname recognition and competitive advantages for our products. There are no assurances that we can successfully address these challenges. If it is unsuccessful, we and our\nbusiness, financial condition and operating results could be materially and adversely affected.\nThe current and future expense levels are based largely on estimates of planned operations and future revenues rather than experience. It is difficult to accurately forecast\nfuture revenues because our business is new and our market has not been developed. If our forecasts prove incorrect, the business, operating results and financial condition of the\nCompany may be materially and adversely affected. Moreover, we may be unable to adjust our spending in a timely manner to compensate for any unanticipated reduction in\nrevenues. As a result, any significant reduction in revenues may immediately and adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results.\nOur products and manufacturing activities are subject to extensive government regulation, and failure to comply with these laws and regulations, as they currently\nexist or as modified in the future, may increase our costs, limit or eliminate our ability to sell certain products, subject us or our suppliers to the risk of enforcement action, or\notherwise adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe manufacture, packaging, labeling, advertising, promotion, distribution, import, export and sale of our products are subject to regulation by numerous national and\nlocal governmental agencies in the United States and other countries, including but not limited to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the Federal Trade Commission\n(FTC). Failure to comply with FDA regulatory requirements may result in, among other things, injunctions, product withdrawals, recalls, product seizures, fines, and criminal\nprosecutions. Any action of this type by the FDA could materially adversely affect our ability to market our products successfully.\nThe manufacture of nutritional or dietary supplements and related products in the United States requires compliance with dietary supplement current Good Manufacturing\nPractice (GMP) regulations, which are based on the food-model GMP regulations, with additional requirements that are specific to dietary supplements. We believe the\nmanufacturing processes for the Safety Shot Dietary Supplement substantially complies with the applicable dietary supplement GMP requirements. Nevertheless, any FDA action\ndetermining that such processes do not comply with dietary supplement GMPs could materially adversely affect our ability to manufacture and market the Sure Shot Dietary\nSupplement in the United States. In addition, the Dietary Supplement & Nonprescription Drug Consumer Protection Act requires dietary supplement manufacturers and\ndistributors to notify the FDA when they receive reports of serious adverse events associated with their products that occur within the United States.\nIndividual U.S. states also regulate nutritional supplements. A state may seek to interpret claims or products presumptively valid under federal law as illegal under that\nstate’s regulations, or otherwise seek to create restrictions to access under state law. For example, during the 2024 legislative session, several states are considering bills that\nwould restrict the sale of muscle building and/or weight management supplements to people over the age of 18. Government agencies, as well as legislative bodies, can change\nexisting regulations, or impose new ones, or could take aggressive measures, causing or contributing to a variety of negative consequences, including:\n● requirements for the reformulation of products to meet new standards;\n● the recall or discontinuance of products;\n● additional record-keeping requirements;\n● expanded documentation of the properties of certain or all products;\n● expanded or different labeling or advertising for products;\n● expanded adverse event tracking and reporting requirements; and\n● additional scientific substantiation to support product claims.\nWe cannot predict the nature of any future laws, regulations, interpretations, or applications, nor can we determine what effect additional governmental regulations or\nadministrative orders, when and if promulgated, could have on our business, financial condition, or results of operations.\n15\nTable of Contents\nWe are subject to government regulations of the processing, formulation, packaging, labeling and advertising of our wellness and dietary supplement products.\nUnder the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the FD&C Act), companies that manufacture and distribute functional foods and dietary supplements, such as our\nSafety Shot Dietary Supplement, are limited in the claims that they are permitted to make about nutritional support on the product label without FDA approval. Any failure by us to\nadhere to the labeling requirements could lead to the FDA requiring that our products be repackaged and relabeled, which would have a material adverse effect on our business. In\naddition, companies are responsible for the accuracy and truthfulness of, and must have adequate scientific substantiation for, any nutritional or functional claims. These claims\nmust be truthful and not misleading. Promotional claims about foods and dietary supplements also must not include statements that the product can diagnose, mitigate, treat, cure\nor prevent a specific disease or class of disease.\nWe believe we are able to market our Sure Shot Dietary Supplement product in reliance on the self-affirmed Generally Recognized As Safe (GRAS) status of our\nformulation’s current ingredients. No governmental agency or other third party has made a determination as to whether or not the Sure Shot Dietary Supplement has achieved\nGRAS status. We make this determination based on independent scientific opinions that the individual ingredients and formulation as a whole are not harmful under their intended\nconditions of use. If the FDA, another regulatory authority or other third party denied our self-affirmed GRAS status for the Sure Shot Dietary Supplement, we could face\nsignificant penalties or be required to undergo the regulatory approval process in order to market our product, and our business, financial condition and results of operations will\nbe adversely affected. We cannot guarantee that in such a situation the Sure Shot Dietary Supplement would be approved.\nThe processing, formulation, packaging, labeling and advertising of our products may also be subject to regulation by the FTC, the Environmental Protection Agency\n(EPA), and various agencies of the states and localities in which the products are sold. Any changes in the current regulatory environment could impose requirements that would\nlimit our ability to market our supplement products and make bringing new products to market more expensive. In addition, the adoption of new regulations or changes in the\ninterpretation of existing regulations may result in significant compliance costs or discontinuation of product sales and may adversely affect our business, financial condition and\nresults of operations.\nWhile we have positioned the Sure Shot Dietary Supplement as a dietary supplement, it is possible that the FDA or a state regulatory agency could classify our product\nas a drug. If the Sure Shot Dietary Supplement is determined to be a drug, we would not be able to market it further without making significant changes to the product and labeling\nor going through the drug approval process, which would limit our ability to effectively market the product and would adversely affect our financial condition and results of\noperations. Additional clinical trials may be necessary in order to support any new drug approval for the Sure Shot Dietary Supplement, and clinical trials designed to support drug\napproval may be time consuming, expensive, and uncertain. If required, such additional studies may take years to complete, and we may never generate the necessary data or\nresults required to obtain marketing authorization of Safety Shot Dietary Supplement as an over-the-counter drug product. Accordingly, there can be no assurances that any such\ndrug approval, if required, could be obtained for the Sure Shot Dietary Supplement. If the FDA or a state regulatory agency ultimately determines the Sure Shot Dietary Supplement\nis a drug rather than a dietary supplement, the agency could claim that the product is misbranded and require that we recall, repackage and relabel the product and impose civil\nand/or criminal penalties. Any of these situations could adversely affect our business and operations, and any public actions taken by the FDA or other regulatory agency against\nus could lead to consumer complaints, civil lawsuits, retail customers terminating any supply agreements we may have with them, and significant reputational harms to the\ncompany.\nOur failure to comply with applicable laws or regulations could result in substantial monetary penalties and could adversely affect our operating results.\nIn recent years, the marketing and labeling of functional foods and beverages and dietary supplements has brought increased risk that consumers will bring class action\nlawsuits and that the FTC and/or state attorneys general will bring legal action concerning the truth and accuracy of the marketing and labeling of such products, seek removal of\nsuch products from the marketplace, and/or impose fines and penalties. Our Sure Shot Dietary Supplement product is marketed with express and implied statements relating to the\ningredients or health and wellness related attributes, which may increase the potential risk of regulatory scrutiny over such claims. The lack of specific regulations or guidance on\ncommon supplement terms and statements used in product labeling has contributed to legal challenges against many supplement companies, and plaintiffs have commenced legal\nactions against several nutritional supplement companies, asserting false, misleading and deceptive advertising and labeling claims. In addition, the FTC has instituted numerous\nenforcement actions against dietary supplement companies for failure to have adequate substantiation for claims made in advertising or for the use of false or misleading\nadvertising claims. Our failure to comply with applicable regulations could result insubstantial monetary penalties, which would likely have a material adverse effect on our financial\ncondition or results of operations.\nEven when unmerited, class action lawsuits, action by the FTC or state attorneys general enforcement actions can be expensive to defend against and may adversely\naffect our reputation with existing and potential customers and consumers and our corporate and brand image, which would likely have a material and adverse effect on our\nbusiness, financial condition or results of operations. The number of private consumer class actions relating to false or deceptive advertising against nutritional supplement\ncompanies has increased in recent years.\n16\nTable of Contents\nIn addition, the FDA has aggressively enforced its regulations with respect to different types of product claims that may or may not be made for food or dietary\nsupplement products. These events could interrupt the marketing and sales of our Sure Shot Dietary Supplement product, severely damage our brand reputation and public image,\nincrease our legal expenses, result in product recalls or litigation, and impede our ability to deliver our products in sufficient quantities or quality, which would likely result in a\nmaterial adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nCongress and/or regulatory agencies may impose additional laws or regulations or change current laws or regulations, and state attorneys general may increase\nenforcement of existing or new laws, and compliance with new or changed governmental regulations, or any state attorney proceeding, could increase our costs significantly\nand materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nFrom time to time, Congress, the FDA, the FTC, or other federal, state, local or foreign legislative and regulatory authorities may impose additional laws or regulations that\napply to us, repeal laws or regulations that we consider favorable to us or impose more stringent interpretations of current laws or regulations. We are not able to predict the nature\nof such future laws, regulations, repeals or interpretations or to predict the effect that additional governmental regulation, when and if it occurs, would have on our business in the\nfuture. Those developments could require reformulation of certain products to meet new standards, recalls or discontinuance of certain products not able to be reformulated,\nadditional record-keeping requirements, increased documentation of the properties of certain products, additional or different labeling, additional scientific substantiation, adverse\nevent reporting or other new requirements.\nFor example, in recent years, the FDA has issued warning letters to several dietary supplement companies alleging improper and unapproved drug claims regarding their\nproducts marketed for use as hangover cures or to prevent hangovers. If the FDA determines that we have disseminated inappropriate and unapproved drug claims for our Safety\nShot Dietary Supplement, which we are positioning as a dietary supplement, we could receive a warning or untitled letter, be required to modify our product claims or take other\nactions to satisfy the FDA. Such a public warning or untitled letter from the FDA could harm our reputation and could lead to potential customer or consumer complaints or even\ncivil lawsuits and other financial damages. While we would intend to vigorously defend our company and the Safety Shot product line in such a situation, any developments of\nthis nature could increase our costs significantly and would likely have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur reliance on third parties to manufacture and supply our products, including the Sure Shot Dietary Supplement, may harm our business, financial condition and\noperating results.\nWe contract with third-party suppliers and manufacturers for the production of our products, including the Sure Shot Dietary Supplement. These third-party suppliers and\nmanufacturers produce and, in most cases, pack our products according to formulations and specifications that have been developed by or in conjunction with our in-house\nproduct development team. Products manufactured by third-party suppliers at their facilities must also pass through quality control and assurance procedures to ensure they are\nmanufactured in conformance with our specifications. We cannot assure you that our third-party contract manufacturers will continue to reliably supply products to us at the\nlevels of quality, or the quantities, we require, and in compliance with our specifications or applicable laws, including under the FDA’s dietary supplement GMP regulations and the\nFD&C Act’s food safety provisions. Should our contract manufacturers experience quality issues or supply us with non-conforming products, we may need to terminate\nrelationships or secure alternative suppliers. Identifying and obtaining acceptable replacement manufacturing sources, on a timely basis or at all, for FDA-regulated functional\nbeverages and dietary supplement products is challenging. Additionally, any future need to transfer our third-party manufacturing business to another contract manufacturer\ncould be expensive, time-consuming, result in delays in our production or shipping, reduce our net sales, damage our relationship with customers and damage our reputation in the\nmarketplace.\nWe rely on third parties to conduct clinical trials and most nonclinical studies of our products, including the Sure Shot Dietary Supplement. If these third parties do\nnot perform as contractually required, fail to satisfy regulatory or legal requirements or miss expected deadlines, our product development and commercialization efforts\ncould be delayed with material and adverse effects on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nWhile we recently completed a clinical trial for the Safety Shot Dietary Supplement and may sponsor clinical trials in the future for the Sure Shot Dietary Supplement or\nother products, we do not independently conduct clinical trials or the majority of nonclinical studies involving our products or product candidates. Accordingly, while we perform\ncertain functions internally, we currently rely on third-party contract research organizations (CROs), such as the Center for Applied Health Sciences, as well as laboratories, clinical\ninvestigators, clinical data management organizations, and consultants, to help us design, conduct, supervise and monitor research involving our products and human\nparticipants. As a result, we have less control over the timing, quality and other aspects of our clinical trials than we would have had we conducted them on our own. There is a\nlimited number of third-party service providers that specialize in the wellness space or have the expertise required to achieve our business objectives. If any of our relationships\nwith these third-party CROs terminate, we may not be able to enter into arrangements with alternative CROs or investigators or to do so on commercially reasonable terms. Further,\nthese laboratories, investigators, CROs and consultants are not our employees and we have limited control over the amount of time and resources that they dedicate to our product\ndevelopment programs. These third parties may have contractual relationships with other entities, some of which may be our competitors, which may draw time and resources from\nour programs. The third parties with which we contract might not be diligent, careful or timely in conducting our nonclinical studies or clinical trials. If we cannot contract with\nacceptable third parties on commercially reasonable terms, or at all, or if these third parties do not carry out their contractual duties, satisfy the legal and regulatory requirements for\nthe conduct of nonclinical studies or clinical trials or meet expected deadlines for any reason, our product development efforts could be delayed and otherwise adversely affected.\n17\nTable of Contents\nIn all events, we are responsible for ensuring that each of our nonclinical studies and clinical trials is conducted in accordance with the general investigational plan and\nprotocols for the relevant study or trial. For example, the FDA requires certain nonclinical studies to be conducted in accordance with good laboratory practices and clinical trials\nto be conducted in accordance with good clinical practices, including practices and requirements for designing, conducting, recording and reporting the results of nonclinical\nstudies and clinical trials to assure that data and reported results are credible and accurate and that the rights, integrity and confidentiality of clinical trial participants are protected.\nOur reliance on third parties we do not control do not relieve us of these responsibilities and requirements. Any adverse development or delay in our nonclinical studies or clinical\ntrials could have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nFurther, should the FDA determine that the Sure Shot Dietary Supplement is a drug rather than a dietary supplement and require us to secure new drug approval or\nanother form of marketing authorization for the Sure Shot Dietary Supplement, there can be no assurance that the nonclinical and clinical data we have generated to date would be\nsufficient to meet applicable regulatory standards for demonstrating substantial evidence of effectiveness. \"Substantial evidence” represents the evidentiary threshold in the\nFD&C Act for the efficacy of new drugs, and it requires at least one adequate and well-controlled clinical investigation to establish effectiveness. Because we have positioned the\nSure Shot Dietary Supplement as a dietary supplement, our recently completed clinical trial may not meet FDA’s expectations for a well-controlled clinical investigation adequate to\nsupport a potential drug approval.\nWe may not meet our product development and commercialization milestones.\nWe have established milestones, based upon our expectations regarding our technologies at that time, which we use to assess our progress toward developing our\nproducts. These milestones relate to technology and design improvements as well as dates for achieving development goals. If our products exhibit technical defects or are unable\nto meet cost or performance goals, our commercialization schedule could be delayed, and potential purchasers of our initial commercial products may decline to purchase such\nproducts or may opt to pursue alternative products.\nWe may also experience shortages of equipment due to manufacturing difficulties. Multiple suppliers provide the components used in manufacturing our products. Our\nmanufacturing operations could be disrupted by fire, earthquake or other natural disaster, a labor-related disruption, failure in supply or other logistical channels, electrical outages\nor other reasons. If there were a disruption to manufacturing facilities, we would be unable to manufacture until we have restored and re-qualified our manufacturing capability or\ndeveloped alternative manufacturing facilities.\nOur operations in international markets involve inherent risks that we may not be able to control.\nOur business plan includes the marketing and sale of our proposed products in international markets. Accordingly, our results could be materially and adversely affected\nby a variety of uncontrollable and changing factors relating to international business operations, including:\n● Macroeconomic conditions adversely affecting geographies where we intend to do business;\n● Foreign currency exchange rates;\n● Political or social unrest or economic instability in a specific country or region;\n● Higher costs of doing business in foreign countries;\n● Infringement claims on foreign patents, copyrights or trademark rights;\n● Difficulties in staffing and managing operations across disparate geographic areas;\n● Difficulties associated with enforcing agreements and intellectual property rights through foreign legal systems;\n● Trade protection measures and other regulatory requirements, which affect our ability to import or export our products from or to various countries;\n● Adverse tax consequences;\n● Unexpected changes in legal and regulatory requirements;\n● Military conflict, terrorist activities, natural disasters and medical epidemics; and\n● Our ability to recruit and retain channel partners in foreign jurisdictions.\n18\nTable of Contents\nCompliance with new and existing laws and governmental regulations could increase our costs significantly and adversely affect our results of operations.\nThe processing, formulation, safety, manufacturing, packaging, labeling, advertising and distribution of our products are subject to federal laws and regulation by one or\nmore federal agencies, including the FDA, the FTC, the CPSC, the USDA, and the EPA. These activities are also regulated by various state, local and international laws and\nagencies of the states and localities in which our products are sold. Government regulations may prevent or delay the introduction, or require the reformulation, of our products,\nwhich could result in lost revenues and increased costs to us. For instance, the FDA regulates, among other things, the composition, safety, manufacture, labeling and marketing\nof dietary ingredients and dietary supplements (including vitamins, minerals, herbs, and other dietary ingredients for human use). Dietary supplements and dietary ingredients that\ndo not comply with FDA’s regulations and/or the DSHEA will be deemed adulterated or misbranded. Manufacturers and distributors of dietary supplements and dietary\ningredients are prohibited from marketing products that are adulterated or misbranded, and the FDA may take enforcement action against any adulterated or misbranded dietary\nsupplement on the market. The FDA has broad enforcement powers. If we violate applicable regulatory requirements, the FDA may bring enforcement actions against us, which\ncould have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition, and results of operations. The FDA may not accept the evidence of safety for any new dietary\ningredient that we may wish to market, may determine that a particular dietary supplement or ingredient presents an unacceptable health risk based on the required submission of\nserious adverse events or other information, and may determine that a particular claim(such as reducing Blood Alcohol Content) or statement of nutritional value that we use to\nsupport the marketing of a dietary supplement is an impermissible drug claim or is not substantiated. Any of these actions could prevent us from marketing particular dietary\nsupplement products or making certain claims or statements with respect to those products. The FDA could also require us to remove a particular product from the market. Any\nfuture recall or removal would result in additional costs to us, including lost revenues from any products that we are required to remove from the market, any of which could be\nmaterial. Any product recalls or removals could also lead to an increased risk of litigation and liability, substantial costs, and reduced growth prospects.\nAdditional or more stringent laws and regulations of dietary supplements and other products have been considered from time to time. These developments could require\nreformulation of some products to meet new standards, recalls or discontinuance of some products not able to be reformulated, additional record-keeping requirements, increased\ndocumentation of the properties of some products, additional or different labeling, additional scientific substantiation, or other new requirements. Any of these developments\ncould increase our costs significantly. In addition, regulators’ evolving interpretation of existing laws could have similar effects.\nRisks Related to our Financial Position and Capital Needs\nOur accountant has indicated doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.\nAs of December 31, 2023, and 2022, the Company had $3,833,349 and $1,931,068 in cash, accumulated deficit of $65,480,715 and $50,597,674 and cash flow used in\noperations of $10,515,314 and $6,395,942, respectively. The Company has incurred and expects to continue to incur significant costs in pursuit of its expansion and development\nplans. These conditions raise doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern and accordingly our auditors have included a going concern opinion in our\nannual report.\nIn connection with certain public and private offerings (the \"Financing”), the Company offered warrants as part of the Financing packages. During the year ended\nDecember 31, 2023, the Warrant Holders exercised a total of 10,266,845 warrants for shares of common stock for a total exercise price of $8,887,837. At December 12, 2023, the\nCompany has 15,758,126 warrants outstanding at an average exercise price of $1.45. The Company expects, although there can be no assurance, that a majority of the outstanding\nwarrants will be exercised in the near future.\nIn addition to the unexercised warrants, the Company also holds 1,200,821 shares of Chijet Motor Company, Inc. (Nasdaq: CJET) valued at $0.45 per share (as of March 27, 2024).\nThese shares are considered trading shares and are held as marketable securities on the balance sheet. The Company also holds 3,650,048 shares of SRM Entertainment, Inc.\n(Nasdaq: SRM) valued at $1.41per share (as of March 27, 2024) and are held as investment in affiliate and are accounted for using the Equity Method. These shares are not covered\nby an effective registration statement but may be sold subject to Rule 144.\nAt June 30, 2024, the Company had $3,223,783 in cash and the Company recognizes that it may need to raise additional capital in order to continue to execute its business\nplan in the future. There is no assurance that the Warrant Holders will exercise their warrants or additional financing will be available if needed or that the Company will be able to\nobtain financing on terms acceptable to it or whether the Company will become profitable and generate positive operating cash flow. If the Company is unable to obtain revenue\nproducing contracts or financing or if the revenue or financing it does obtain is insufficient to cover any operating losses it may incur, it may be forced to substantially curtail its\noperations or seek other business opportunities through strategic alliances, acquisitions or other arrangements that may dilute the interests of existing stockholders.\n19\nTable of Contents\nRaising additional capital may cause dilution to our existing stockholders, restrict our operations or require us to relinquish rights to our technologies or other\nassets.\nWe may seek additional capital through a combination of private and public equity offerings, debt financings, strategic partnerships and alliances and licensing\narrangements. To the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, existing ownership interests will be diluted and the terms of\nsuch financings may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect the rights of existing stockholders. Debt financings may be coupled with an equity component,\nsuch as warrants to purchase shares, which could also result in dilution of our existing stockholders’ ownership. The incurrence of indebtedness would result in increased fixed\npayment obligations and could also result in certain restrictive covenants, such as limitations on our ability to incur additional debt, limitations on our ability to acquire or license\nintellectual property rights and other operating restrictions that could adversely impact our ability to conduct our business and may result in liens being placed on our assets and\nintellectual property. If we were to default on such indebtedness, we could lose such assets and intellectual property.\nOur potential for rapid growth and our entry into new markets make it difficult for us to evaluate our current and future business prospects, and we may be unable to\neffectively manage any growth associated with these new markets, which may increase the risk of your investment and could harm our business, financial condition, results of\noperations and cash flow.\nOur proliferation into new markets may place a significant strain on our resources and increase demands on our executive management, personnel and systems, and our\noperational, administrative and financial resources may be inadequate. We may also not be able to effectively manage any expanded operations or achieve planned growth on a\ntimely or profitable basis, particularly if the number of customers using our technology significantly increases or their demands and needs change as our business expands. If we\nare unable to manage expanded operations effectively, we may experience operating inefficiencies, the quality of our products and services could deteriorate, and our business and\nresults of operations could be materially adversely affected.\nChanges in tax laws and unanticipated tax liabilities could adversely affect our effective income tax rate and ability to achieve profitability.\nOur effective income tax rate in the future could be adversely affected by a number of factors including changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory\ntax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities and changes in tax laws. We regularly assess all of these matters to determine the adequacy of our tax\nprovision which is subject to discretion. If our assessments are incorrect, it could have an adverse effect on our business and financial condition. There can be no assurance that\nincome tax laws and administrative policies with respect to the income tax consequences generally applicable to us or to our subsidiaries will not be changed in a manner which\nadversely affects our shareholders.\nRisks Related to our Intellectual Property\nWe may incur substantial costs as a result of litigation or other proceedings relating to patent and other intellectual property rights.\nA third party may sue us or one of our strategic collaborators for infringing its intellectual property rights. Likewise, we may need to resort to litigation to enforce licensed\nrights or to determine the scope and validity of third-party intellectual property rights.\nThe cost to us of any litigation or other proceeding relating to intellectual property rights, even if resolved in our favor, could be substantial, and the litigation would\ndivert our efforts. Some of our competitors may be able to sustain the costs of complex patent litigation more effectively than we can because they have substantially greater\nresources. If we do not prevail in this type of litigation, we or our strategic collaborators may be required to pay monetary damages; stop commercial activities relating to the\naffected products or services; obtain a license in order to continue manufacturing or marketing the affected products or services; or attempt to compete in the market with a\nsubstantially similar product.\nUncertainties resulting from the initiation and continuation of any litigation could limit our ability to continue some of our operations. In addition, a court may require that\nwe pay expenses or damages, and litigation could disrupt our commercial activities.\nAny inability to protect our intellectual property rights could reduce the value of our products and brands, which could adversely affect our financial condition,\nresults of operations and business.\nOur business is partly dependent upon our trademarks, trade secrets, copyrights and other intellectual property rights. Effective intellectual property rights protection,\nhowever, may not be available under the laws of every country in which we and our sub-licensees may operate. There is a risk of certain valuable trade secrets, beyond what is\ndescribed publicly in patents, being exposed to potential infringers. Regardless of our technology being protected by patents or otherwise, there is a risk that other companies may\nemploy the technology without authorization and without recompensing us.\nThe efforts we have taken to protect our proprietary rights may not be sufficient or effective. Any significant impairment of our intellectual property rights could harm our\nbusiness or our ability to compete. In addition, protecting our intellectual property rights is costly and time consuming. There is a risk that we may have insufficient resources to\ncounter adequately such infringements through negotiation or the use of legal remedies. It may not be practicable or cost effective for us to fully protect our intellectual property\nrights in some countries or jurisdictions. If we are unable to successfully identify and stop unauthorized use of our intellectual property, we could lose potential revenue and\nexperience increased operational and enforcement costs, which could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and business.\n20\nTable of Contents\nThe intellectual property behind our products may include unpublished know-how as well as existing and pending intellectual property protection. All intellectual\nproperty protection eventually expires, and unpublished know-how is dependent on key individuals.\nThe commercialization of our licensed products is partially dependent upon know-how and trade secrets held by certain individuals working with and for us. Because the\nexpertise runs deep in these few individuals, if something were to happen to any or all of them, the ability to properly manufacture our products without compromising quality and\nperformance could be diminished greatly.\nKnowledge published in the form of any future intellectual property has finite protection, as all patents and trademarks have a limited life and an expiration date. While\ncontinuous efforts will be made to apply for patents and trademarks if appropriate, there is no guarantee that additional patents or trademarks will be granted. The expiration of\npatents and trademarks relating to our products may hinder our ability to sub-license or sell our products for a long period of time without the development of a more complex\nlicensing strategy.\nIf we are not able to adequately protect our intellectual property, then we may not be able to compete effectively, and we may not be profitable.\nOur existing proprietary rights may not afford remedies and protections necessary to prevent infringement, reformulation, theft, misappropriation and other improper use\nof our products by competitors. We own the formulations contained in our products and we consider these product formulations to be our critical proprietary property, which must\nbe protected from competitors. Although trade secret, trademark, copyright and patent laws generally provide a certain level of protection, and we attempt to protect ourselves\nthrough contracts with manufacturers of our products, we may not be successful in enforcing our rights. In addition, enforcement of our proprietary rights may require lengthy and\nexpensive litigation. We have attempted to protect some of the trade names and trademarks used for our products by registering them with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office,\nbut we must rely on common law trademark rights to protect our unregistered trademarks. Common law trademark rights do not provide the same remedies as are granted to\nfederally registered trademarks, and the rights of a common law trademark are limited to the geographic area in which the trademark is actually used. Our inability to protect our\nintellectual property could have a material adverse impact on our ability to compete and could make it difficult for us to achieve a profit.\nRisks Related to Our Securities and Other Risks\nWe are an \"emerging growth company” and we cannot be certain if the reduced disclosure requirements applicable to emerging growth companies will make our\ncommon stock less attractive to investors.\nWe are an \"emerging growth company” as defined in the JOBS Act, and we intend to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are\napplicable to other public companies that are not \"emerging growth companies” including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements\nof Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements. We cannot predict\nwhether investors will find our common stock less attractive if we rely on these exemptions. If some investors find our common stockless attractive as a result, there may be a less\nactive trading market for our common stock and our stock price may be more volatile.\nThe requirements of being a public company may strain our resources and distract our management, which could make it difficult to manage our business,\nparticularly after we are no longer an \"emerging growth company.”\nWe are required to comply with various regulatory and reporting requirements, including those required by the SEC. Complying with these reporting and other regulatory\nrequirements is time-consuming and results in increased costs to us and could have a negative effect on our results of operations, financial condition or business.\nAs a public company, we are subject to the reporting requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (as amended, the \"Exchange Act”) and the requirements of the Sarbanes-\nOxley Act. These requirements may place a strain on our systems and resources.\nThe Exchange Act requires that we file annual, quarterly and current reports with respect to our business and financial condition. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires that\nwe maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal controls over financial reporting. To maintain and improve the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and\nprocedures, we will need to commit significant resources, hire additional staff and provide additional management oversight. We will be implementing additional procedures and\nprocesses for the purpose of addressing the standards and requirements applicable to public companies. Sustaining our growth also will require us to commit additional\nmanagement, operational and financial resources to identify new professionals to join our firm and to maintain appropriate operational and financial systems to adequately support\nexpansion. These activities may divert management’s attention from other business concerns, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial\ncondition or business.\n21\nTable of Contents\nAs an \"emerging growth company” as defined in the JOBS Act, we intend to take advantage of certain temporary exemptions from various reporting requirements\nincluding, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and reduced disclosure obligations\nregarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements. We may also delay adoption of new or revised accounting pronouncements applicable to public\ncompanies until such pronouncements are made applicable to private companies, as permitted by the JOBS Act.\nWe have broad discretion in the use of the net proceeds from any offerings and may not use them effectively.\nOur management will have broad discretion in the application of the net proceeds from any offerings and may spend or invest these proceeds in a way with which our\nstockholders disagree. The failure by our management to apply these funds effectively could harm our business and financial condition. Pending their use, we may invest the net\nproceeds from any offering in a manner that does not produce income or that loses value.\nOur management has limited experience in managing the day-to-day operations of a public company and, as a result, we may incur additional expenses associated\nwith the management of our Company.\nWe only became a public company in October 2020. The management team is responsible for the operations and reporting of the Company. The requirements of operating\nas a public company are many and sometimes difficult to navigate. This may require us to obtain outside assistance from legal, accounting, investor relations, or other\nprofessionals that could be more costly than planned. If we lack cash resources to cover these costs of being a public company in the future, our failure to comply with reporting\nrequirements and other provisions of securities laws could negatively affect our stock price and adversely affect our potential results of operations, cashflow and financial\ncondition after we commence operations.\nCompliance with changing corporate governance regulations and public disclosures may result in additional risks and exposures.\nChanging laws, regulations and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure, including the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and new regulations from the\nSEC, have created uncertainty for public companies such as ours. These laws, regulations, and standards are subject to varying interpretations in many cases, and as a result, their\napplication in practice may evolve over time as new guidance is provided by regulatory and governing bodies. This could result in continuing uncertainty regarding compliance\nmatters and higher costs necessitated by ongoing revisions to disclosure and governance practices. As a result, our efforts to comply with evolving laws, regulations, and\nstandards have resulted in, and are likely to continue to result in, increased expense and significant management time and attention.\nCertain of our stockholders hold a significant percentage of our outstanding voting securities, which could reduce the ability of minority stockholders to effect\ncertain corporate actions.\nAt December 31, 2023, our officers and directors are the beneficial owners of approximately 20% our issued and outstanding voting securities. As a result, they possess\nsignificant influence over our elections and votes. As a result, their ownership and control may have the effect of facilitating and expediting a future change in control, merger,\nconsolidation, takeover or other business combination, or encouraging a potential acquirer to make a tender offer. Their ownership and control may also have the effect of\ndelaying, impeding, or preventing a future change in control, merger, consolidation, takeover or other business combination, or discouraging a potential acquirer from making a\ntender offer.\nIf securities or industry analysts publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, our stock price could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock will depend in part on the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us or our business. Once our\ncommon stock is quoted, if one or more of the analysts who cover us downgrade our common stock or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, our common\nstock price would likely decline.\nWe do not intend to pay dividends for the foreseeable future.\nWe currently intend to retain any future earnings to finance the operation and expansion of our business, and we do not expect to declare or pay any dividends on our\ncommon stock in the foreseeable future.\n22\nTable of Contents\nOur Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation contains an exclusive forum provision for certain claims, which could limit our stockholders’ ability\nto obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers or employees.\nOur Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation provides that, unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, New York shall be the\nsole and exclusive forum for (a) any derivative action or proceeding brought on behalf of the Company, (b) any action asserting a claim for breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any\ndirector, officer, employee, or agent of the Company to the Company or the Company’s shareholders or (c) any action asserting a claim governed by the internal affairs doctrine, in\neach case subject to said court having personal jurisdiction over the indispensable parties named as defendants therein. This provision may limit a shareholder’s ability to bring a\nclaim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with the company and its directors, officers, or other employees and may discourage lawsuits with respect to such\nclaims. This provision does not apply to actions arising under the Exchange Act or Securities Act.\nOur issuance of additional common stock or preferred stock may cause our common stock price to decline, which may negatively impact your investment.\nIssuances of a substantial number of additional shares of our common or preferred stock, or the perception that such issuances could occur, may cause prevailing market\nprices for our common stock to decline. In addition, our board of directors is authorized to issue additional series of shares of preferred stock without any action on the part of our\nstockholders. Our board of directors also has the power, without stockholder approval, to set the terms of any such series of shares of preferred stock that may be issued,\nincluding voting rights, conversion rights, dividend rights, preferences over our common stock with respect to dividends or if we liquidate, dissolve or wind up our business and\nother terms. If we issue cumulative preferred stock in the future that has preference over our common stock with respect to the payment of dividends or upon our liquidation,\ndissolution or winding up, or if we issue preferred stock with voting rights that dilute the voting power of our common stock, the market price of our common stock could decrease.\nAnti-takeover provisions in the Company’s charter and bylaws may prevent or frustrate attempts by stockholders to change the board of directors or current\nmanagement and could make a third-party acquisition of the Company difficult.\nThe Company’s certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that may discourage, delay or prevent a merger, acquisition or other change in control that\nstockholders may consider favorable, including transactions in which stockholders might otherwise receive a premium for their shares. Furthermore, the Board of Directors has the\nability to increase the size of the Board and fill newly created vacancies without stockholder approval. These provisions could limit the price that investors might be willing to pay\nin the future for shares of the Company’s common stock.\nOur common stock may become subject to the SEC’s penny stock rules and accordingly, broker-dealers may experience difficulty in completing customer\ntransactions and trading activity in our securities may be adversely affected.\nThe SEC has adopted regulations, which generally define \"penny stock” to be an equity security that has a market price of less than $5.00 per share, subject to specific\nexemptions. The market price of our common stock is less than $5.00 per share and therefore would be a \"penny stock” according to SEC rules, unless we are listed on a national\nsecurities exchange. Under these rules, broker-dealers who recommend such securities to persons other than institutional accredited investors must:\n● Make a special written suitability determination for the purchaser;\n● Receive the purchaser’s prior written agreement to the transaction;\n● Provide the purchaser with risk disclosure documents which identify certain risks associated with investing in \"penny stocks” and which describe the market for these\n\"penny stocks” as well as a purchaser’s legal remedies; and\n● Obtain a signed and dated acknowledgment from the purchaser demonstrating that the purchaser has actually received the required risk disclosure document before a\ntransaction in a \"penny stock” can be completed.\nAlthough our common stock is not currently subject to these rules, it were to become subject to such rules, broker-dealers may find it difficult to effectuate customer\ntransactions and trading activity in our securities may be adversely affected. As a result, the market price of our securities may be depressed, and you may find it more difficult to\nsell your securities.\nItem 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds\nDuring the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company issued a total of 0 shares of common stock for services valued at $0.\nDuring the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company issued a total of 0 shares of common stock related to two consulting agreements entered into during 2023 that\nwere recorded as Common Stock Payable at December 31, 2023 and valued at a total of $113,500.\nDuring the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company issued 0 shares of common stock related to the promissory debt modification and extinguishment recorded as\nCommon Stock Payable at December 31, 2023 and valued at a total of $245,044.\nItem 3.

(Nasdaq: SHOT) (The “Company” or “Safety Shot”), a leading innovator in the functional beverage industry, today\nannounced key highlights and accomplishments from the third quarter of 2024, demonstrating significant strides in brand development, strategic partnerships, and market\nexpansion.\nIn the last several months, the Company has achieved significant milestones, including:\n● Rebranding and Product Innovation:\n○ Officially rebranded from Safety Shot to Sure Shot, introducing a bold new visual identity and convenient product formats, including 4oz bottles and on-the-go\nstick packs.\n○ Improved the product’s taste profile based on consumer feedback, further enhancing its appeal and driving customer satisfaction.\n● Strategic Partnerships and Distribution Expansion:\n○ Secured a major distribution partnership with 7-Eleven, launching its 4oz bottles in over 300 stores across the Chicago area.\n○ Formed a strategic alliance with Stellar Partners to expand into the travel retail market, making Sure Shot available in airports across the United States.\n○ Formed strategic alliances with Launchpad’s Network All Roads Travel (ART) to target the college student demographic and Stellar Partners to expand into the\ntravel retail market.\n○ Continued to expand its on-premises presence through agreements with bars and restaurants, making the product readily available in social settings.\n○ Expanded distribution network through a strategic partnership with Atlantic Beverage Distributors, increasing Sure Shot’s presence in Massachusetts and\nRhode Island.\n● Strengthening the Foundation:\n○ Granted a new patent for its innovative BAC-reducing formulation, reinforcing its commitment to scientific validation and intellectual property protection.\n○ President of the Company, Jordan Schur, invested an additional $3.4 million, demonstrating confidence in the company’s future.\n○ Positive clinical study results further validated the product’s efficacy and potential benefits.\n○ A new e-commerce partnership with VENDO was formed to boost online sales and brand visibility.\n● Sharpening Focus:\n○ Announced plans to spin-off its wellness consumer products segment, Caring Brands, into a separate, publicly traded company. This strategic move will allow\nSafety Shot to focus exclusively on its flagship product and its growth potential in the functional beverage market. The spin-off is expected to be completed\nwithin 90 days.\n○ As part of the spin-off, Safety Shot shareholders will receive a dividend of two million shares of Caring Brands stock. This provides shareholders with direct\nownership in a new company poised for growth in the consumer wellness market.\n“Q3 2024 has been a period of tremendous growth and transformation for Safety Shot,” said Jarrett Boon, CEO of Safety Shot. “The rebranding of ‘Sure Shot,’ along with the\nintroduction of our new 4oz bottles and convenient stick packs, has revitalized our product line and strengthened our connection with consumers. These strategic initiatives,\ncombined with our expanded distribution network and key partnerships, are driving strong performance and positioning us to deliver exceptional value to our shareholders.

Sure Shot will be available in all stores of Pete’s Fresh Market, Caputo’s, Tony’s\nFresh Market, Festival Foods, and Sunset Foods, with disruptive placements throughout the stores to maximize visibility and consumer awareness.\nThis strategic move into the Chicagoland market represents a key step in Safety Shot’s nationwide expansion strategy. By partnering with these regional grocery chains renowned\nfor their commitment to quality, freshness, and diverse selections, Safety Shot gains access to a large and discerning consumer base in a major metropolitan area.\nSure Shot is the world’s first beverage designed to reduce blood alcohol content (BAC) and boost mental clarity.

Consumers who prioritize their well-being and seek innovative solutions are often drawn to new and unique products, and Sure Shot’s presence in these\nstores provides an excellent opportunity to reach this receptive audience.\nThe 4 oz. Sure Shot bottles will be prominently displayed in participating stores throughout Q4, coinciding with the holiday season when alcohol sales traditionally peak. With 60%\nof annual alcohol sales occurring in October, November, and December, this strategic timing allows Safety Shot to capitalize on increased consumer demand and introduce its\ninnovative product to a wider audience. Sure Shot will be priced at $5.99 per unit.\nThis expansion builds upon Safety Shot’s recent initiatives to increase brand awareness and market penetration, including a new partnership with 7-Eleven stores in the\nChicagoland area and a successful campaign with Launchpad Network to reach college students.

(NASDAQ: SHOT) was formerly known as Jupiter Wellness Inc. In August 2023, the Company successfully completed the asset purchase of the Safety Shot\nDietary Supplement from GBB Drink Lab, Inc. (“GBB”), thereby gaining ownership of various assets, including the intellectual property, trade secrets, and trademarks associated\nwith its dietary supplement (the “Safety Shot Dietary Supplement”). Concurrently with the asset purchase, the Company changed its name to Safety Shot, Inc. and changed its\nNASDAQ trading symbol to SHOT. The Company launched its e-commerce sale of the Safety Shot Dietary Supplement in December 2023. On October 9, 2024, the Company\nrenamed the Safety Shot Dietary Supplement as the “Sure Shot Dietary Supplement”\nThe Sure Shot Dietary Supplement has been formulated to reduce the accumulation of blood alcohol. Noteworthy is the fact that the Sure Shot Dietary Supplement comprises 28\nactive ingredients, all falling under the Generally Regarded As Safe (GRAS) category. Under sections 201(s) and 409 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the Act), any\nsubstance that is intentionally added to food is a dietary supplement, that is subject to premarket review and approval by the FDA, unless the substance is generally recognized,\namong qualified experts, as having been adequately shown to be safe under the conditions of its intended use, or unless the use of the substance is otherwise excepted from the\ndefinition of a dietary supplement.\nIt’s crucial to note that the Sure Shot Dietary Supplement is currently manufactured in a facility adhering to Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP), ensuring the highest standards\nof quality and safety throughout its production process. The Company currently maintains a workforce comprising eight full-time employees of its own.\nSpecializing in Consumer Packaged Goods, our focus centers on the commercialization of a 12-ounce product positioned as a dietary supplement. Beyond our existing product, we\nare actively pursuing a future product line, including a convenient powdered stick pack version and a 4-ounce version of the Sure Shot Dietary Supplement.\nThe Company has discontinued the historical product lines of Jupiter Wellness which included a diverse range of products, such as hair loss treatments, vitiligo solutions, and\nsexual wellness products, that catered to different health and wellness needs and our commitment to supporting health and wellness by developing innovative solutions to a range\nof conditions. In connection therewith, on September 24, 2024 the Company entered into a Separation and Exchange Agreement with its subsidiary Caring Brands, Inc. whereby\nCaring Brands will seek to commercialize this product line. Caring Brands will be responsible for all costs associated with the operation of that line of business. The Company will\nfocus its efforts on the commercialization of the Sure Shot Dietary Supplement. The Company will retain ownership of 3,000,000 shares of Caring Brands, Inc.\nThe Company entered into a stock exchange agreement (the “Exchange Agreement”) with SRM Entertainment, Inc. (“SRM”) to govern the separation of SRM and the Company.\nOn May 26, 2023, we amended and restated the Exchange Agreement (the “Amended and Restated Exchange Agreement”) to include additional information regarding the\ndistribution and the separation of SRM and the Company. The separation as set forth in the Amended and Restated Exchange Agreement with the Company closed August 14,\n2023. Pursuant to the Amended and Restated Exchange Agreement, on May 31, 2023, SRM issued to the Company 6,500,000 shares of SRM Common Stock (representing 79.3% of\nSRM’s outstanding shares of Common Stock) in exchange for 2 ordinary shares of SRM Ltd owned by the Company (representing all of the issued and outstanding ordinary\nshares of SRM) (the “Share Exchange”). On August 14, 2023, SRM consummated its Initial Public Offering (“IPO”), pursuant to which it sold 1,250,000 shares of its common stock\nat a price of $5.00 per share. In connection with the Share Exchange and SRM’s IPO, the Company distributed 2,000,000 shares of SRM’s common stock to the Company’s\nstockholders and certain warrant holders (out of the 6.5 million shares issued in May 2023) which occurred on the effective date of the Registration Statement but prior to the\nclosing of the IPO. Following such distribution, the Company owns 4.0 million of the 9,450,000 shares of common stock outstanding and SRM is now a minority owned subsidiary\nof the Company.\n3\nTo achieve our mission, we rely on our team of highly skilled and experienced professionals who are committed to advancing our vision of health and wellness. Our team includes\nindividuals with scientific backgrounds, an experienced researcher, product developers, and business experts who collaborate to create new products and enhance existing ones.\nWe also seek to partner with industry leaders and organizations to gain access to the latest technologies and expand our reach.\nThe Sure Shot Dietary Supplement is currently sold through e-commerce and in stores such as BevMo!. In addition, we are seeking to collaborate with other companies to license\nour intellectual property, to create additional revenue streams and expand our global presence. At present, we do not experience concentration risk or dependence on major\ncustomers.\nWe maintain a diverse network of raw material suppliers integral to our production processes. Acquisition strategies encompass both direct procurement and collaborative efforts\nwith our co-packers. The selection of suppliers is contingent upon various factors, including ingredient specificity, availability, and other essential considerations. Notably, these\nsuppliers coincide with those currently providing materials to other facilities engaged in the manufacturing of drinks, powders, tablets, and capsules. Our roster of suppliers\ncomprises reputable entities such as Jiaherb, Compound Solutions, Kyowa-Hakko, Mitsubishi Ingredients, Nura, Sensapure Flavors, Brenntag, E3 Ingredients, Ingredients Online,\namong others. This strategic alliance with established industry players underscores our commitment to sourcing high-quality raw materials essential for the production of our\ninnovative product line. Furthermore, our approach to supplier relationships reflects a dedication to maintaining a seamless and reliable supply chain. We believe that this not only\nensures the consistency of our current offerings but also positions us favorably for future developments. The Management believes that as we continue to expand our product\nportfolio, we believe that these partnerships with trusted suppliers play a pivotal role in upholding the standards that we expect of our brand.\nProducts Roadmap\nThe Sure Shot Dietary Supplement was launched on our own website and through Amazon in December 2023 and with several Big Box stores. The Company is advancing several\nproduct formats and formulations to continue to offer a wide array of products that can be purchased at various locations that coincide with consumer shopping habits. In\nparticular, the Company plans to continue to develop new flavors for each of its current SKUs (12oz., 4 oz. and “Stick Pack”. In addition, the current formula will be offered at\nvarious dosages and the Company plans to conduct additional research studies as follows: assessing varying dosages of the Sure Shot Dietary Supplement against body weight,\ngender and age, examining several current and proposed ingredients with respect to their specific role in reducing BAC and how they affect the enzymatic activity associated with\nthe metabolism of alcohol, and finally, examining additional markers with respect to improving post-alcohol consumption symptoms and feelings.\nThe Company intends to perform the additional research studies in Q2 and Q3 of 2025. The Company will continue to sponsor the studies and intends to work with the Center for\nApplied Health Sciences (“CAHS”) in Canfield, OH. The participants will be selected based upon the parameters of the individual studies and the Company will follow the same\nprotocols employed in the clinical trials at the CAHS described in more detail below in “Research and Development.”\nResearch and Development\nOur research and development team in continually looking to develop new therapeutic products, while continually improving and enhancing our existing products and product\ncandidates to address customer demands and emerging trends.\nWe have conducted extensive informal research and experimentation involving a substantial number of volunteers under the influence of alcohol. Our findings indicate that the\nSure Shot Dietary Supplement can reduce a person’s Blood Alcohol Content, as measured by the premier Breathalyzer on the market. We have recently completed our clinical trials\nof the Sure Shot Dietary Supplement which have shown a statistically significant reduction in the Blood Alcohol Content (“BAC”) of the participants. The observable\nenhancements in cognitive abilities among the test subjects have been carefully documented.\nThe clinical trials took place from January 29, 2024, through June 10, 2024, at the CAHS located at 6570 Seville Drive, Canfield, OH 44406. The clinical trials were sponsored and paid\nfor by the Company and consisted of 36 participants with a mean age of 36.3 years that were selected through advertising of the study. The Company did not inquire about the\nparticipants typical level of alcohol consumption but each participant had to qualify based upon a complete medical history questionnaire, release from physicians and submitting\nto a standard bloodwork panel. Each participant consumed exactly 100 mL of alcohol and the BAC of the participants ranged from 0.047 % to 0.068 %. The participants were not\nemployees of the Company nor affiliated with the Company in any way. The clinical trials were a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study that found that within 30\nminutes of the consumption of the Sure Shot Dietary Supplement, the monitored participants saw a statistically significant drop of p=.002 in BAC and continued to see measurable\ndrops in successive 30-minute increments. The results were measured by using a DOT-approved BACtrack S80 Breathalyzer on the participants to determine their BAC after\ningesting several alcoholic beverages, followed by drinking 12 ounces of the Sure Shot Dietary Supplement and then measuring the participants' BAC 30 minutes later. In addition,\ncognitive responses were measured using the Visual Analogue Scale (“VAS”) and physical function assessed at the same intervals as the blood draws and breathalyzer\nassessments to correlate to function. The VAS consisted of a 10 cm, straight line with end points that measured from low-to-high for a number of physical feelings and sensations.\nThe participants were asked to mark a point on the line that corresponded with their experience. The distance from the end to the point marked by the participant was then\nmeasured in millimeters to quantify their level of sensation. On each visit, participants were asked to perform the VAS tests and the VAS assessed subjective ratings for head\ndiscomfort (headache), nausea, fatigue, energy, tiredness, thirst and ability to concentrate. The Company also conducted further physical assessment by monitoring biometric\nmeasurements such as blood pressure and heart rate at various intervals. The key assumptions in the study were that the participants would demonstrate a marked decrease in\nBAC following the consumption of the Sure Shot Dietary Supplement versus that of the placebo. In addition, the study assumed that the participants would feel better and\ndemonstrate marked improvement in cognitive skills and physical function following the consumption of the Sure Shot Dietary Supplement versus that of the placebo. The\nCompany had previously observed in our numerous, pre-clinical tests that participants who consumed significant amounts of alcohol (more than two drinks) experienced marked\nand rapid reductions in their BAC when measured by BACTrack S80 breathalyzers after consumption of the Sure Shot Dietary Supplement. In addition, the Company observed in\nthe pre-clinical tests that the participants showed significant improvement in motor function and reduction in slurred speech and other markers commonly associated with alcohol\nconsumption. These findings led the Company to continue to develop the Sure Shot Dietary Supplement and commission a clinical study to prove our hypothesis. There were five\nadverse events amongst the participants in the study. Four of the adverse events were associated with the Sure Shot Dietary Supplement (three felt nauseous and one developed a\nrash) and none of the adverse events were serious. The final adverse event was associated with congestion of the placebo.\nSince approximately 2010, the Company has performed 100s of pre-clinical tests in an effort to develop and perfect the Sure Shot Dietary Supplement. These informal, pre-clinical\ntests included friends, family and other volunteers who consumed alcohol at varying levels and then were tested prior to the consumption of the Sure Shot Dietary Supplement.\nThe pre-clinical tests were neither peer reviewed nor were the subjects screened prior to their participation. In addition, the VAS was not used nor were there any placebos or other\ncontrol measures taken in the pre-clinical tests and as such these tests are considered informal and non-clinical. The participants’ BAC was measured by using the BacTrack S80\nafter the consumption of various amounts of alcohol and prior to the consumption of the Sure Shot Dietary Supplement and then at 30 minutes, 45 minutes and one-hour intervals\nafter consumption of the Sure Shot Dietary Supplement so we could assess the efficacy of the Company’s R&D efforts at that point in time. The Company also observed motor\nfunction skills such as walking, balancing and speech at the same intervals following the consumption of 12 ounces of the Sure Shot Dietary Supplement. The Company defined\nand noted the significant improvement in each area by observing participants’ walk and whether a participant’s gait was unsteady, or whether their balance was off while standing\nand whether their speech was clear or slurred. The Company incurred research and development expenses of $100,591 and $1,637,117 for the years ended December 31, 2022, and\n2023, respectively.\n4\nSales and Marketing\nWe primarily sell our products through e-commerce websites including Amazon and through retail stores such as BevMo!. To drive loyalty, word-of-mouth marketing, and\nsustainable growth, we invest in customer experience and customer relationship management. Our marketing investments are directed towards driving profitable growth through\nadvertising, public relations, and brand promotion activities, including digital platforms, sponsorships, collaborations, brand activations, and channel marketing. Additionally, we\ncontinue to invest in our marketing and brand development efforts by investing capital expenditures on product displays to support our channel marketing via our retail partners.\nWe launched the Sure Shot Dietary Supplement in stores such as BevMo! in the second quarter of 2024.\nManufacturing, Logistics and Fulfillment\nWe outsource the manufacturing of our products to contract manufacturers, who produce them according to our formulation specifications. Our products are manufactured by\ncontract manufacturers in India and the US. The majority of our products will then be shipped to third-party warehouses and to our corporate offices, which can either transport\nthem to our distributors, retailers, or directly to our customers. Our third-party warehouses are located in the US. We use a limited number of logistics providers to deliver our\nproducts to both distributors and retailers, which allows us to lessen order fulfillment time, cut shipping costs, and improve inventory flexibility.\nOur Competitive Strengths\nWe are committed to driving continuous improvement through innovation. Since our inception, we have made significant investments in research and development and have\nacquired a substantial portfolio of intellectual property, which continues to grow each year. Our commitment to innovation has allowed us to create unique products that address\nunmet needs in the market, all backed by rigorous clinical research. We believe that our focus on research and development is designed to enable us to stay ahead of the curve and\nprovide our customers with products that are not only effective but also innovative. We take pride in our patent portfolio and the continuous growth we have achieved, as we\nbelieve that it showcases our dedication to creating new and unique solutions for our customers. By staying committed to innovation, we are confident in our ability to meet the\never-changing needs of the health and wellness market. We believe that the Sure Shot Dietary Supplement stands as a unique product in the liquid dietary supplement market.\nNevertheless, our competitive landscape includes many companies involved in the production of health and welfare products, including beverages.\nBackground of Securities Being Registered Herein\nOn September 20, 2024, the Company entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement (the “September SPA”) with one accredited investor for the purchase of 448,029 shares (the\n“PIPE Shares”) for gross proceeds of $500,000 at a price of $1.12 per share, which reflects a 10% discount from the closing price of the common stock on September 20, 2024.

The\n600,000 shares underlying the Greentree Warrants and the 200,000 shares issuable upon exercise of the L & H Warrants are being registered herein.\n5\nIntellectual Property\nAs of the date hereof, the Company owns five patents, including the patent (US 9,186,350 B2) and patent (US 10,028,991 B2) for the composition of the Sure Shot Dietary\nSupplement used for minimizing the harmful effects associated with alcohol consumption by supporting the metabolism of alcohol. US 9,186,350 B2 (the “350 Patent”), relates to an\nearly version of the Sure Shot Dietary Supplement and is owned by the Company. The 350 Patent is a utility patent that covers the United States jurisdiction and expired on\nDecember 25, 2023. US 10,028,991 B2 (the “991 Patent”) is a continuation of the 350 Patent and relates to the Sure Shot Dietary Supplement and is owned by the Company. The 991\nPatent is a utility patent that covers the United States jurisdiction and expires on November 5, 2035. In and around September of 2024, the Company received a Notice of Allowance\nfor a new patent U.S. Patent Application No. 18/395,565 that relates to current version of the Sure Shot Dietary Supplement. This patent will be a utility patent and cover the United\nStates jurisdiction. The Company owns three additional patents that relate to legacy products that the Company neither currently sells nor has any plans to sell in the future.\nGovernment Regulation\nThe Sure Shot Dietary Supplement:\nThe production, distribution and sale in the United States of the Sure Shot Dietary Supplement is subject to various U.S. federal, state and local regulations, including but not\nlimited to: the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (“FD&C Act”); the Occupational Safety and Health Act and various state laws and regulations governing workplace health\nand safety; various environmental statutes; the Safe Drinking Water and Toxic Enforcement Act of 1986 (“California Proposition 65”); data privacy and personal data protection\nlaws and regulations, including the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (as modified by the California Privacy Rights Act) and a number of other federal, state and local\nstatutes and regulations applicable to the production, transportation, sale, safety, advertising, marketing, labeling, packaging, and ingredients of the Sure Shot Dietary Supplement.\nWe also may in the future be affected by other existing, proposed and potential future regulations or regulatory actions, including those described below, any of which could\nadversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nFurthermore, legislation and regulation may be introduced in the United States at the federal, state, municipal and supranational level in respect of each of the subject areas\ndiscussed below. Public health officials and health advocates are increasingly focused on the public health consequences associated with obesity and alcohol consumption,\nespecially as they may affect children, and are seeking legislative change to reduce the consumption of sweetened and alcohol beverages.\nWe are subject to a number of regulations applicable to the formulation, labeling, packaging, and advertising (including promotional campaigns) of our products. In California, we\nare subject to California Proposition 65, a law which requires that a specified warning be provided before exposing California consumers to any product that contains in excess of\nthreshold amounts of a substance listed by California as having been found to cause cancer or reproductive toxicity. California Proposition 65 does not require a warning if the\nmanufacturer of a product can demonstrate that the use of the product in question exposes consumers to an average daily quantity of a listed substance that is below that\nthreshold amount, which is determined either by scientific criteria set forth in applicable regulations or via a “safe harbor” threshold that may be established by the state, or the\nsubstance is naturally occurring, or is subject to another applicable exception. As of the date of this registration statement, we are not required to put a warning label on our\nproduct and our products are perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances (“PFAS”) free. We are unable to predict whether a component found in our product might be added to\nthe California list in the future. Furthermore, we are also unable to predict when or whether the increasing sensitivity of detection methodology may become applicable under this\nlaw and related regulations as they currently exist, or as they may be amended. If we are required to add warning labels to any of our products or place warnings in certain locations\nwhere our products are sold, it will be difficult to predict whether, or to what extent, such a warning would have an adverse impact on sales of our products in those locations or\nelsewhere. In addition, there has been increasing regulatory activity globally regarding constituents in packaging materials, including PFAS. Regardless of whether perceived\nhealth consequences of these constituents are justified, such regulatory activity could result in additional government regulations that impact the packaging of our beverages.\n6\nIn addition, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (the “FDA”) has regulations with respect to serving size information and nutrition labeling on food and beverage products,\nincluding a requirement to disclose the amount of added sugars in such products and regulations about whether a product qualifies as a drug. Further, the U.S. Department of\nAgriculture promulgated regulations requiring that, by January 1, 2022, the labels of certain bioengineered foods include a disclosure that the food is bioengineered. These\nregulations may impact, reduce and/or otherwise affect the purchase and consumption of our products by consumers.\nAll ingredients in the Sure Shot Dietary Supplement are deemed Generally Recognized as Safe (GRAS) and align with FDA standards, permitting their inclusion in supplements. In\nthe event that the FDA or any governmental agency identifies an ingredient or aspect of our product as unsafe, we commit to promptly withdrawing that component in accordance\nwith regulatory directives. From a product and sales perspective, there are no impediments or concerns raised by any governmental agency. It is essential to note that the Sure\nShot Dietary Supplement is classified as a dietary supplement, exempt from the approval or filing requirements mandated for pharmaceutical drugs by the FDA or other regulatory\nauthorities.\nEmployees\nAs of this prospectus, we had eight full-time employees. We believe our relations with our employees to be good.\nProperties\nCurrently, we do not own any real property. We rent office space at 1061 E. Indiantown Rd., Ste. 110, Jupiter, FL 33477 for $15,038 per month. The Company entered into the office\nlease effective July 1, 2021, which has a primary term of the lease of five years with one renewal option for an additional three years. As part of the Separation Agreement, Caring\nBrands, Inc. has agreed to assume to lease obligations upon it reaching certain milestones.\n7\nTHE OFFERING\nCommon stock outstanding 60,396,074 shares.

The provisions include the items described below.\nPotential Effects of Authorized but Unissued Stock\nWe have shares of common stock available for future issuance without stockholder approval. We may utilize these additional shares for a variety of corporate purposes, including\nfuture public offerings to raise additional capital, to facilitate corporate acquisitions or payment as a dividend on the capital stock.\nThe existence of unissued and unreserved common stock and preferred stock may enable our Board to issue shares to persons friendly to current management or to issue preferred\nstock with terms that could render more difficult or discourage a third-party attempt to obtain control of us by means of a merger, tender offer, proxy contest or otherwise, thereby\nprotecting the continuity of our management. In addition, our Board has the discretion to determine designations, rights, preferences, privileges and restrictions, including voting\nrights, dividend rights, conversion rights, redemption privileges and liquidation preferences of each series of preferred stock, all to the fullest extent permissible under the Delaware\nGeneral Corporation Law and subject to any limitations set forth in our second amended and restated certificate of incorporation. The purpose of authorizing the Board to issue\npreferred stock and to determine the rights and preferences applicable to such preferred stock is to eliminate delays associated with a stockholder vote on specific issuances. The\nissuance of preferred stock, while providing desirable flexibility in connection with possible financings, acquisitions and other corporate purposes, could have the effect of making\nit more difficult for a third party to acquire, or could discourage a third party from acquiring, a majority of our outstanding voting stock.\nLimitations of Director Liability and Indemnification of Directors, Officers and Employees\nOur second amended and restated certificate of incorporation limits the liability of directors to the maximum extent permitted by Delaware law. Delaware law provides that directors\nof a corporation will not be personally liable for monetary damages for breach of their fiduciary duties as directors.\nOur amended and restated bylaws provide that we will indemnify our directors and officers to the fullest extent permitted by law, and may indemnify employees and other agents.\nOur amended and restated bylaws also provide that we are obligated to advance expenses incurred by a director or officer in advance of the final disposition of any action or\nproceeding.\nWe currently do not have a policy of directors’ and officers’ liability insurance but intend to obtain such a policy in the near future.\nOur amended and restated bylaws, subject to the provisions of Delaware Law, contain provisions which allow the corporation to indemnify any person against liabilities and other\nexpenses incurred as the result of defending or administering any pending or anticipated legal issue in connection with service to us if it is determined that person acted in good\nfaith and in a manner which he or she reasonably believed was in the best interest of the corporation. Insofar as indemnification for liabilities arising under the Securities Act of\n1933 as amended, or the Securities Act, may be permitted to our directors, officers and controlling persons, we have been advised that in the opinion of the Securities and\nExchange Commission, such indemnification is against public policy as expressed in the Securities Act and is, therefore, unenforceable.\nThe limitation of liability and indemnification provisions in our amended and restated bylaws may discourage stockholders from bringing a lawsuit against directors for breach of\ntheir fiduciary duties. They may also reduce the likelihood of derivative litigation against directors and officers, even though an action, if successful, might provide a benefit to us\nand our stockholders. Our results of operations and financial condition may be harmed to the extent we pay the costs of settlement and damage awards against directors and\nofficers pursuant to these indemnification provisions.\n14\nAt present, there is no pending litigation or proceeding involving any of our directors or officers as to which indemnification is required or permitted, and we are not aware of any\nthreatened litigation or proceeding that may result in a claim for indemnification.\nRequirements for Advance Notification of Stockholder Nominations and Proposals\nOur amended and restated bylaws establish advance notice procedures with respect to stockholder proposals and nomination of candidates for election as directors.\nLimits on Special Meetings\nSpecial meetings may be called for any purpose and at any time by the Chairman of the Board, the President (if there be one) or by any member of the Board. Business transacted at\neach special meeting shall be confined to the purposes stated in the notice of such meeting.\nElection and Removal of Directors\nOur Board is elected annually by our stockholders. The number of directors that shall constitute the whole Board shall not be less than three (3) nor more than seven (7) directors.\nDirectors are elected by a plurality of the votes of shares of our capital stock present in person or represented by proxy at a meeting and entitled to vote in the election of directors.\nEach director shall hold office until a successor is duly elected and qualified or until his or her earlier death, resignation or removal.\nNewly created directorships resulting from any increase in the number of directors or any vacancies in the Board resulting from death, resignation, retirement, disqualification,\nremoval from office or any other cause may be filled, so long as there is at least one remaining director, only by the Board, provided that a quorum is then in office and present, or\nby a majority of the directors then in office, if less than a quorum is then in office, or by the sole remaining director. Directors elected to fill a newly created directorship or other\nvacancies shall hold office until such director’s successor has been duly elected and qualified or until his or her earlier death, resignation or removal as hereinafter provided.\nAny director may be removed from office at any time for cause, at a meeting called for that purpose, but only by the affirmative vote of the holders of at least 66-2/3% of the voting\npower of all outstanding shares of our capital stock entitled to vote generally in the election of directors, voting together as a single class.\nOur second amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws do not provide for cumulative voting in the election of directors.\nAmendments to Our Governing Documents\nThe affirmative vote of the holders of at least 66-2/3% of the voting power of all outstanding shares of our capital stock entitled to vote generally in the election of directors, shall\nbe required to adopt any provision inconsistent with, to amend or repeal any provision of, or to adopt a bylaw inconsistent with, Articles Two, Seven, Eight and Nine of our\nSecond Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation.\nOur amended and restated bylaws may be amended or repealed and new bylaws may be adopted by the stockholders and/or the Board. Any bylaws adopted, amended or repealed\nby the Board may be amended or repealed by the stockholders.\nListing\nOur Common Stock and warrants are listed on Nasdaq under the symbols “SHOT” and “SHOTW”, respectively.\nTransfer Agent, Warrant Agent and Registrar\nThe transfer agent and registrar for our Common Stock offered in this Offering is ClearTrust, LLC.\n15\nPLAN OF DISTRIBUTION\nThe selling stockholder may, from time to time, sell any or all of their securities covered hereby on Nasdaq or any other stock exchange, market or trading facility on which\nthe securities are traded or in private transactions.

The selling stockholder may also sell securities short and\ndeliver these securities to close out their short positions, or loan or pledge the securities to broker-dealers that in turn may sell these securities. The selling stockholder may also\nenter into option or other transactions with broker-dealers or other financial institutions or create one or more derivative securities which require the delivery to such broker-dealer\nor other financial institution of securities offered by this prospectus, which securities such broker-dealer or other financial institution may resell pursuant to this prospectus (as\nsupplemented or amended to reflect such transaction).\nThe selling stockholder and any broker-dealers or agents that are involved in selling the securities may be deemed to be “underwriters” within the meaning of the\nSecurities Act in connection with such sales. In such event, any commissions received by such broker-dealers or agents and any profit on the resale of the securities purchased by\nthem may be deemed to be underwriting commissions or discounts under the Securities Act. The selling stockholder has informed us that it does not have any written or oral\nagreement or understanding, directly or indirectly, with any person to distribute the securities.\nWe are required to pay certain fees and expenses incurred by us incident to the registration of the securities. We have agreed to indemnify the selling stockholder against\ncertain losses, claims, damages and liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act.\nWe agreed to keep this prospectus effective until the earlier of (i) the date on which the securities may be resold by the selling stockholder without registration and\nwithout regard to any volume or manner-of-sale limitations by reason of Rule 144, without the requirement for us to be in compliance with the current public information under Rule\n144 under the Securities Act or any other rule of similar effect or (ii) all of the securities have been sold pursuant to this prospectus or Rule 144 under the Securities Act or any\nother rule of similar effect. The resale securities will be sold only through registered or licensed brokers or dealers if required under applicable state securities laws. In addition, in\ncertain states, the resale securities covered hereby may not be sold unless they have been registered or qualified for sale in the applicable state or an exemption from the\nregistration or qualification requirement is available and is complied with.\nUnder applicable rules and regulations under the Exchange Act, any person engaged in the distribution of the resale securities may not simultaneously engage in market\nmaking activities with respect to the common stock for the applicable restricted period, as defined in Regulation M, prior to the commencement of the distribution. In addition, the\nselling stockholder will be subject to applicable provisions of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder, including Regulation M, which may limit the timing of\npurchases and sales of the common stock by the selling stockholder or any other person. We will make copies of this prospectus available to the selling stockholder and have\ninformed them of the need to deliver a copy of this prospectus to each purchaser at or prior to the time of the sale (including by compliance with Rule 172 under the Securities Act).\nLEGAL MATTERS\nCertain legal matters related to the securities offered by this prospectus will be passed upon on our behalf by The Sichenzia Ross Ference Carmel LLP.

Indemnification of Directors and Officers\nSafety Shot, Inc. is incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware. Reference is made to Section 102(b)(7) of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, as\namended (the “DGCL”), which enables a corporation in its original certificate of incorporation or an amendment thereto to eliminate or limit the personal liability of a director for\nviolations of the director’s fiduciary duty, except (1) for any breach of the director’s duty of loyalty to the corporation or its stockholders, (2) for acts or omissions not in good faith\nor which involve intentional misconduct or a knowing violation of law, (3) pursuant to Section 174 of the DGCL, which provides for liability of directors for unlawful payments of\ndividends or unlawful stock purchase or redemptions or (4) for any transaction from which the director derived an improper personal benefit.\nSection 145(a) of the DGCL provides, in general, that a corporation may indemnify any person who was or is a party or is threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending\nor completed action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative (other than an action by or in the right of the corporation), because he or she is or\nwas a director, officer, employee or agent of the corporation, or is or was serving at the request of the corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation,\npartnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, against expenses (including attorneys’ fees), judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred\nby the person in connection with such action, suit or proceeding, if he or she acted in good faith and in a manner he or she reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best\ninterests of the corporation and, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, had no reasonable cause to believe his or her conduct was unlawful.\nSection 145(b) of the DGCL provides, in general, that a corporation may indemnify any person who was or is a party or is threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending\nor completed action or suit by or in the right of the corporation to procure a judgment in its favor because the person is or was a director, officer, employee or agent of the\ncorporation, or is or was serving at the request of the corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other\nenterprise, against expenses (including attorneys’ fees) actually and reasonably incurred by the person in connection with the defense or settlement of such action or suit if he or\nshe acted in good faith and in a manner he or she reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the corporation, except that no indemnification shall be made\nwith respect to any claim, issue or matter as to which he or she shall have been adjudged to be liable to the corporation unless and only to the extent that the adjudicating court\ndetermines that, despite the adjudication of liability but in view of all of the circumstances of the case, he or she is fairly and reasonably entitled to indemnity for such expenses\nwhich the adjudicating court shall deem proper.\nSection 145(g) of the DGCL provides, in general, that a corporation may purchase and maintain insurance on behalf of any person who is or was a director, officer, employee or\nagent of the corporation, or is or was serving at the request of the corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or\nother enterprise against any liability asserted against such person and incurred by such person in any such capacity, or arising out of his or her status as such, whether or not the\ncorporation would have the power to indemnify the person against such liability under Section 145 of the DGCL.\nOur bylaws, subject to the provisions of the DGCL, contain provisions which allow the corporation to indemnify any person against liabilities and other expenses incurred as the\nresult of defending or administering any pending or anticipated legal issue in connection with service to us if it is determined that person acted in good faith and in a manner which\nhe reasonably believed was in the best interest of the corporation. Insofar as indemnification for liabilities arising under the Securities Act of 1933 may be permitted to our\ndirectors, officers and controlling persons, we have been advised that in the opinion of the Securities and Exchange Commission, such indemnification is against public policy as\nexpressed in the Securities Act of 1933 and is, therefore, unenforceable.\nAs permitted by the DGCL, the registrant has entered into separate indemnification agreements with each of the registrant’s directors and certain of the registrant’s officers which\nrequire the registrant, among other things, to indemnify them against certain liabilities which may arise by reason of their status as directors, officers or certain other employees.\nThe registrant expects to obtain and maintain insurance policies under which its directors and officers are insured, within the limits and subject to the limitations of those policies,\nagainst certain expenses in connection with the defense of, and certain liabilities which might be imposed as a result of, actions, suits or proceedings to which they are parties by\nreason of being or having been directors or officers. The coverage provided by these policies may apply whether or not the registrant would have the power to indemnify such\nperson against such liability under the provisions of the DGCL.\nThese indemnification provisions and the indemnification agreements entered into between the registrant and the registrant’s officers and directors may be sufficiently broad to\npermit indemnification of the registrant’s officers and directors for liabilities (including reimbursement of expenses incurred) arising under the Securities Act of 1933.\n19\nItem 16.
