The study was conducted via an investigator-initiated, investigational research grant provided to the Bateman Horne Center (“BHC”). The study demonstrated that the low dose combination antiviral therapy IMC-2 treated patient cohort (valacyclovir 750 mg + celecoxib dosed 200 mg twice daily) exhibited clinically meaningful reductions in [Long-COVID](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=1swydypyEUTs7yuX0eZDdvVbMu4sxcb0yx0QT9lKU_3hRgVtt4HcCM5htcEhE4ISE5e_WcZzU0Re-n2CH9HAZw==) associated fatigue and sleep disturbance, as compared with the placebo treated cohort. The high dose IMC-2 treated cohort (valacyclovir 1500 mg + celecoxib 200 mg dosed twice daily) did not exhibit clinically meaningful differences versus placebo, believed to be related to higher levels of gastrointestinal (GI) adverse events associated with the higher dose regimen.\n\n“To date, there are no FDA approved medicines to treat Long-COVID symptoms,” said Lucinda Bateman, MD, Founder and Chief Medical Officer of the Bateman Horne Center and the study’s principal investigator. “This trial provides evidence that IMC-2 has the potential to improve fatigue and sleep symptoms associated with Long-COVID illness on a scale not previously observed in Long-COVID research. I believe this finding warrants further investigation of IMC-2 in larger scale, multi-center Long-COVID studies.” \n\n“The primary goals of this trial were to determine the IMC-2 treatment effect size versus placebo and the associated patient sample size to design our planned IMC-2 Phase 2 Long-COVID study in a manner that maximizes probability of success,” said R. Michael Gendreau, MD, Chief Medical Officer of Dogwood Therapeutics, Inc. “IMC-2 demonstrated a robust reduction in fatigue, the primary endpoint agreed with the Food & Drug Administration to advance IMC-2 into Phase 2 development. We look forward to finalizing these plans and providing further information on next steps in the coming months.”\n\n**IMC-2 Long-COVID Development Program Summary:**\n\nBHC Study 201: Investigator-initiated, open-label, matched control study assessing IMC-2 treatment versus patients matched by age, duration of effect, vaccination status and gender. In this study, completed in 2023, the combination of valacyclovir and celecoxib exhibited statistically significant reductions in Long-COVID related fatigue, orthostatic intolerance, pain and anxiety, while improving overall patient health. The dosage used in this study was valacyclovir 1500 mg + celecoxib 200 mg dosed twice daily.\n\nBHC Study 202: This recently completed study was designed as an investigator-initiated, double-blinded, placebo controlled follow-on study to BHC 201. While not statistically significant given the small sample size recruited for this trial (14-15 per group), the study demonstrated that the low dose combination antiviral therapy IMC-2 exhibited clinically meaningful improvements in fatigue and sleep disruption as compared to placebo treated patients. Overall, the IMC-2 adverse event profile was favorable in this study. The high dose IMC-2 treatment (valacyclovir 1500 mg + celecoxib 200 mg dosed twice daily) resulted in more GI related adverse events compared to the low dose and placebo cohorts.\n\n**Additional Assets in Dogwood Therapeutics Proprietary Pipeline:**\n\n  * **Halneuron****®** is in Phase 2b development as a non-opioid, Nav 1.7 inhibitor to treat the neuropathic pain resultant from chemotherapy treatment. [Halneuron](https://dwtx.com/nav-1-7-inhibition/)[®](https://dwtx.com/nav-1-7-inhibition/) has been granted Fast Track Designation from the FDA for the treatment of [Chemotherapy-Induced Neuropathic Pain ](https://dwtx.com/cinp/)(CINP).Next milestone: Interim data from the ongoing Phase 2 CINP study are expected in the second half of 2025.\n\n\n  * **IMC-1 (famciclovir + celecoxib)** is Phase 3 development ready as a combination antiviral treatment for [fibromyalgia](https://dwtx.com/fibromyalgia/) (FM). IMC-1 has been granted fast track designation by the FDA as a treatment for FM. Next milestone: Dogwood is exploring partnerships for IMC-1 to execute the Phase 3 FM program as agreed with the FDA.\n\n\n\n**About Dogwood Therapeutics**\n\nDogwood Therapeutics (Nasdaq: DWTX) is a development-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on developing new medicines to treat pain and fatigue-related disorders. The Dogwood research pipeline includes two separate mechanistic platforms with a non-opioid analgesic program and an antiviral program. The proprietary non-opioid, Nav 1.7 analgesic program is centered on lead development candidate, Halneuron® which is a voltage-gated sodium channel blocker, a mechanism known to be effective for reducing pain. Halneuron® treatment has demonstrated pain reduction of both general cancer related pain and CINP. Interim data from the forthcoming Phase 2 CINP study are expected in 2H 2025. The antiviral program includes IMC-1 and IMC-2, which are novel, proprietary, fixed dose combinations of nucleoside analog, anti-herpes antivirals and the anti-inflammatory agent, celecoxib, for the treatment of illnesses believed to be related to reactivation of previously dormant herpes viruses, including FM and LC. IMC-1 is poised to progress into Phase 3 development as a treatment for FM and is the focus of external partnership activities.

(Nasdaq: DWTX) (the “Company”), a development-stage biotechnology company developing new medicines to treat pain and fatigue-related disorders, today announced financial results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2024 and provided a business update.\n\n“The formation of Dogwood Therapeutics last month represents a transformational expansion of our pipeline with the addition of Halneuron®, a non-opioid, novel NaV 1.7 modulator to treat neuropathic pain associated with chemotherapy, purposefully complementing our promising development assets IMC-1 and IMC-2,” said Greg Duncan, Chief Executive Officer of Dogwood Therapeutics. “The concurrent strategic financing to be provided by an affiliate of CK Life Sciences Int’l., (Holdings) Inc. (“CKLS”), former owner of Pharmagesic (Holdings) Inc., provides us with operating capital through 2025. We see this as a win-win for legacy Virios shareholders and CKLS, with both short-term and medium-term value creation opportunities associated with forthcoming data from the Bateman-Horne Center (“BHC”) managed IMC-2 Phase 2 Long-COVID trial, and the Halneuron® Phase 2b interim data projected for the second half of next year.”\n\n**Key Highlights**\n\n  * Dogwood’s expanded pipeline includes three late-stage assets: Halneuron®, currently in Phase 2b development for chemotherapy-induced neuropathic pain (“CINP”); IMC-1, poised for Phase 3 development as a treatment for fibromyalgia (“FM”); and IMC-2, currently in Phase 2 development to treat Long-COVID (“LC”) sequelae.\n  * In connection with the Combination, the Company announced that it raised $19.5 million in committed debt financing by an affiliate of CKLS in two tranches with $16.5 million funded as of October 7, 2024 and an additional $3.0 million to be funded in 1Q 2025, subject to certain conditions. This financing is expected to fund research and operations through several key milestones, including the release of results from the Halneuron® Phase 2b interim analysis assessment expected in 2H 2025.\n  * Top-line results from the ongoing BHC IMC-2 LC Phase 2a study, assessing two doses of the combination of valacyclovir + celecoxib versus placebo, are expected by mid-November 2024. \n\n\n\n**Dogwood Therapeutics Proprietary Pipeline Includes:**\n\n  * **Halneuron****®** is in Phase 2b development as a non-opioid, NaV 1.7 inhibitor to treat the neuropathic pain associated with chemotherapy treatment. Halneuron® has been granted fast track designation from the Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) for the treatment of CINP. \n\n\n\nNext milestone: Interim data from the ongoing Phase 2b CINP study are expected in 2H 2025.\n\n  * **IMC-2 (valacyclovir + celecoxib)** is in Phase 2a development as a combination antiviral treatment for LC. \n\n\n\nNext milestone: Topline data from an investigator led, double blind controlled proof of concept study, assessing two doses of IMC-2 vs placebo, are expected in mid-November 2024.\n\n  * **IMC-1 (famciclovir + celecoxib)** is ready for Phase 3 development as a combination antiviral treatment for FM. IMC-1 has been granted fast track designation by the FDA for the treatment of FM. Dogwood is exploring partnerships for IMC-1 to execute the Phase 3 FM program agreed upon by the FDA.\n\n\n\n**Third Quarter 2024 Financial Results**\n\nResearch and development expenses increased by $0.2 million for the third quarter of 2024 compared to the third quarter of 2023. The quarter-over-quarter change was primarily due to increases in expenses associated with the grant to BHC for the second proof-of-concept study in LC of $0.3 million offset by a decrease in regulatory expenses of $0.1 million.\n\nGeneral and administrative expenses increased by $0.9 million for the third quarter of 2024 compared to the third quarter of 2023. The quarter-over-quarter change was primarily due to higher legal and professional fees related to the business combination in October 2024 of $1.0 million offset by lower insurance expenses associated with being a public company of $0.1 million.\n\nNet loss for the third quarter of 2024 was $2.3 million, or $2.05 basic and diluted net loss per share, compared to a net loss of $1.2 million, or $1.62 basic and diluted net loss per share for the third quarter of 2023 (as adjusted to reflect the reverse stock split implemented on October 9, 2024).\n\nThe Company estimates that its current cash of $2.0 million at September 30, 2024 along with the $16.5 million in loan proceeds received on October 7, 2024 is not sufficient to fund operating expenses and capital requirements for at least the next 12 months. The Company will need to secure the additional $3.0 million of loan proceeds available to us under the terms of the loan agreement in February 2025 to continue to fund our operations through 2025.\n\n**About Dogwood Therapeutics**\n\nDogwood Therapeutics (Nasdaq: DWTX) is a development-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on developing new medicines to treat pain and fatigue-related disorders.

(Nasdaq: DWTX) (the “Company”), a development-stage biotechnology company developing new medicines to treat pain and fatigue-related disorders, today announced financial results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2024 and provided a business update.\n\n“The formation of Dogwood Therapeutics last month represents a transformational expansion of our pipeline with the addition of Halneuron®, a non-opioid, novel NaV 1.7 modulator to treat neuropathic pain associated with chemotherapy, purposefully complementing our promising development assets IMC-1 and IMC-2,” said Greg Duncan, Chief Executive Officer of Dogwood Therapeutics. “The concurrent strategic financing to be provided by an affiliate of CK Life Sciences Int’l., (Holdings) Inc. (“CKLS”), former owner of Pharmagesic (Holdings) Inc., provides us with operating capital through 2025. We see this as a win-win for legacy Virios shareholders and CKLS, with both short-term and medium-term value creation opportunities associated with forthcoming data from the Bateman-Horne Center (“BHC”) managed IMC-2 Phase 2 Long-COVID trial, and the Halneuron® Phase 2b interim data projected for the second half of next year.”\n\n**Key Highlights**\n\n  * Dogwood’s expanded pipeline includes three late-stage assets: Halneuron®, currently in Phase 2b development for chemotherapy-induced neuropathic pain (“CINP”); IMC-1, poised for Phase 3 development as a treatment for fibromyalgia (“FM”); and IMC-2, currently in Phase 2 development to treat Long-COVID (“LC”) sequelae.\n  * In connection with the Combination, the Company announced that it raised $19.5 million in committed debt financing by an affiliate of CKLS in two tranches with $16.5 million funded as of October 7, 2024 and an additional $3.0 million to be funded in 1Q 2025, subject to certain conditions. This financing is expected to fund research and operations through several key milestones, including the release of results from the Halneuron® Phase 2b interim analysis assessment expected in 2H 2025.\n  * Top-line results from the ongoing BHC IMC-2 LC Phase 2a study, assessing two doses of the combination of valacyclovir + celecoxib versus placebo, are expected by mid-November 2024. \n\n\n\n**Dogwood Therapeutics Proprietary Pipeline Includes:**\n\n  * **Halneuron****®** is in Phase 2b development as a non-opioid, NaV 1.7 inhibitor to treat the neuropathic pain associated with chemotherapy treatment. Halneuron® has been granted fast track designation from the Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) for the treatment of CINP. \n\n\n\nNext milestone: Interim data from the ongoing Phase 2b CINP study are expected in 2H 2025.\n\n  * **IMC-2 (valacyclovir + celecoxib)** is in Phase 2a development as a combination antiviral treatment for LC. \n\n\n\nNext milestone: Topline data from an investigator led, double blind controlled proof of concept study, assessing two doses of IMC-2 vs placebo, are expected in mid-November 2024.\n\n  * **IMC-1 (famciclovir + celecoxib)** is ready for Phase 3 development as a combination antiviral treatment for FM. IMC-1 has been granted fast track designation by the FDA for the treatment of FM. Dogwood is exploring partnerships for IMC-1 to execute the Phase 3 FM program agreed upon by the FDA.\n\n\n\n**Third Quarter 2024 Financial Results**\n\nResearch and development expenses increased by $0.2 million for the third quarter of 2024 compared to the third quarter of 2023. The quarter-over-quarter change was primarily due to increases in expenses associated with the grant to BHC for the second proof-of-concept study in LC of $0.3 million offset by a decrease in regulatory expenses of $0.1 million.\n\nGeneral and administrative expenses increased by $0.9 million for the third quarter of 2024 compared to the third quarter of 2023. The quarter-over-quarter change was primarily due to higher legal and professional fees related to the business combination in October 2024 of $1.0 million offset by lower insurance expenses associated with being a public company of $0.1 million.\n\nNet loss for the third quarter of 2024 was $2.3 million, or $2.05 basic and diluted net loss per share, compared to a net loss of $1.2 million, or $1.62 basic and diluted net loss per share for the third quarter of 2023 (as adjusted to reflect the reverse stock split implemented on October 9, 2024).\n\nThe Company estimates that its current cash of $2.0 million at September 30, 2024 along with the $16.5 million in loan proceeds received on October 7, 2024 is not sufficient to fund operating expenses and capital requirements for at least the next 12 months. The Company will need to secure the additional $3.0 million of loan proceeds available to us under the terms of the loan agreement in February 2025 to continue to fund our operations through 2025.\n\n**About Dogwood Therapeutics**\n\nDogwood Therapeutics (Nasdaq: DWTX) is a development-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on developing new medicines to treat pain and fatigue-related disorders.
