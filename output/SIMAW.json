Although the Group’s reporting currency is the Australian dollar, a significant portion of the\nGroup’s sales and purchases are in currencies other than the Australian dollar. In addition, significant portions of the Group’s net assets\nare denominated in currencies other than the Australian dollar.\nThe Group’s consolidated financial position, results of operations, and cash flows may be materially affected by movements\nin the exchange rate between the Australian dollar and the respective local currencies to which its subsidiaries are exposed.\nSome of the results discussed below are presented on a “constant currency” basis, which means that the current period results are\ntranslated into Australian dollars using applicable exchange rates in the prior corresponding period. This allows\nfor a relative performance comparison between the two periods before the translation impact of currency fluctuations.\nForeign exchange rates compared with the prior corresponding periods for the major currencies that affect the Group’s results are as\nfollows:\nAVERAGE RATE–YEAR ENDED 30 JUNE CLOSING RATE–AS AT 30 JUNE\n2024 2023 CHANGE 2024 2023 CHANGE\nUS dollar 0.6556 0.6732 (2.6%) 0.6667 0.6667 –%\nEuro 0.6061 0.6433 (5.8%) 0.6223 0.6110 1.8%\nPound sterling 0.5205 0.5592 (6.9%) 0.5274 0.5248 0.5%\nAs at 30 June 2024, the cumulative effect of the retranslation of net assets of foreign controlled entities, recognised through the foreign\ncurrency translation reserve, was A$128.5 million compared to A$129.1 million as at 30 June 2023.\nAt reporting date, if the foreign currency exchange rates weakened or strengthened against the functional currency by 10 percent and all\nother variables were held constant, the Group's after tax profit would have increased by A$3.6 million (2023: A$11.6 million) or\ndecreased by A$3.6 million (2023: A$11.6 million) respectively. There would have been no impact to other comprehensive income. The\nsensitivity analysis includes only outstanding foreign currency denominated monetary items at the reporting date and adjusts their\ntranslation for a 10 per cent change in the foreign currency rate.\nAll balances are stated in Australian dollars unless otherwise stated.\nSims Limited Annual Report 2024 2\nDIRECTORS’ REPORT (continued)\nOPERATING AND FINANCIAL REVIEW (continued)\nExternal operating environment\nMetal\nIn FY24 the global scrap market faced challenging conditions due to variable demand from customers, a shortage of supply and\nincreased buy-side competition. Inflation remained above central bank target ranges, keeping interest rates elevated and exerting\nsignificant upward cost pressure on the industry.\nAverage Turkish ferrous scrap prices in FY24 were 2% lower than FY23, at US$387/t[1]. Chinese steel exports reached a multi-year high\nof 90Mt in CY2023. In CY2024, on an annualised basis, this indicator is expected to grow further to 106.8Mt, placing downward\npressure on seaborne steel markets.\nLower global Purchasing Managers' Indices[2] (\"PMI\") observed in many countries demonstrated the global market contraction in\nmanufacturing activity. US manufacturing activity also trended to softer production as the year progressed, albeit to a lesser extent.\nThese unfavourable economic conditions continued to weigh on the metals industry.\nThe Chinese real estate sector (as evidenced by new building activity) contracted by 24% over the period from January to May 2024, in\ncomparison to the prior corresponding period[4]. The consequent export of Chinese steel into global markets remains one of the largest\nand uncertain headwinds for global steel manufacturing. This slowdown in manufacturing activity, combined with an increased average\nvehicle age in the US, contributed to lower scrap supply, as materials are recycled when new replacements are purchased. This\nreduction in metal scrap supply has intensified the shortage of metal scrap, increasing buy-side pressures.\nIn non-ferrous markets, however, prices experienced strong gains, particularly in the second half of the year. LME copper prices\nincreased by 6% to US$8,764/t YoY and the average zorba price increased 7% to US$1,904/t compared to FY23[5]amid positive\nsentiment surrounding the sector's important role in global decarbonisation. LME Aluminium prices decreased by 2% to US$2,308/t in\nFY24 compared to FY23[6].\n[1] Source: Argus; Ferrous Scrap HMS 1/2 80:20 CFR Turkey\n[2] Source: Bloomberg\n[3] Source: World Steel Association; accessed 15 July 2024\n[4] Source: Bloomberg; China total new floor space started\n[5] Source: Argus; Zorba 99/3 min CFR China\n[6] Source: Bloomberg; LME exchange prices\nSims Limited Annual Report 2024 3\nDIRECTORS’ REPORT (continued)\nOPERATING AND FINANCIAL REVIEW (continued)\nExternal operating environment (continued)\nSims Lifecycle Services\nThe demand and supply of IT components is rebalancing, driving price increases across Dynamic Random Access Memory (DRAM)\nand Dual-Inline Memory Modules (DIMM). The growing use of Artificial Intelligence is continuing to drive demand for processing power\nresulting in further investment in large data centres and a refresh of existing data centres.

Australia/New Zealand (\"ANZ\") maintained volumes despite market headwinds, with solid industrial scrap\nsourcing. Intake volumes in North America (NAM\"), excluding the impact of the Baltimore Scrap and Northeast Metal Traders\nacquisitions which added 385 thousand tonnes in the year, were down due to challenging market dynamics and a strategic focus on\nprioritising margin over volume. The UK Metal's (\"UKM\") business was also impacted by challenging markets and increased\ncompetition for scrap from short supply.\nSALES VOLUMES YEAR ENDED 30 JUNE\nTONNES ,000 2024 2023 CHANGE\nContinuing Operations\nNorth America Metal 5,000 5,063 (1.2%)\nAustralia/New Zealand Metal 1,593 1,510 5.5%\nTotal Proprietary Volumes 6,593 6,573 0.3%\nGlobal Trading and other 1,322 1,460 (9.5%)\nTotal Sales Volume from continuing operations 7,915 8,033 (1.5%)\nDiscontinued operations\nUK Metal 1,288 1,399 (7.9%)\nTotal Sales Volume 9,203 9,432 (2.4%)\nProprietary sales volumes were 6.6 million tonnes in FY24 compared to 6.6 million tonnes in FY23, a increase of 0.3%. Sales in the\nANZ market were strong during the period despite a slowdown in domestic demand in the second half. Export facing demand was weak,\nimpacting sales in UKM and to a lesser extent NAM, as greater domestic sales optionality increased local volumes in that region. Recent\nacquisitions added 326 thousand tonnes to the North American market.\n1 Bloomberg Finance\nSims Limited Annual Report 2024 4\nDIRECTORS’ REPORT (continued)\nOPERATING AND FINANCIAL REVIEW (continued)\nFinancial Performance\nThe group experienced a year of two halves, as it refocused its efforts on margin performance in the second half after embedding a\nmajor acquisition and volume growth in the first. Buyside pressure in the beginning of the year against slowing economic conditions and\na number of shredder outages contributed to a disappointing first half performance before a much improved second half. Improvements\nin buying discipline, reduced costs, and increased proportional levels of unprocessed infeed enabled the group to capitalise on an\nimproved non-ferrous market and counter softer US domestic demand as well as the impact of surging Chinese steel exports. On an\nannualised basis, the Group realised 80% of its targeted cost savings in the period, albeit more work is required in this area.\nFY24 sales revenue of $8,562.7 million was up 6.2% compared to FY23 sales revenue of $8,061.1 million. At constant currency, sales\nrevenue was up 3.2%. Revenue growth was assisted by an 8.7% (5.7% at constant currency) increase in Metal average sales prices,\npartially offset by a 2.4% reduction in overall Metal sales volumes. Sims Lifecycle Services revenue was 7.5% higher in FY24 compared\nto FY23.\nMetal trading margin for FY24 was up by 2.4% or down by 0.2% in constant currency, compared to the FY23. The increase was driven\nby an improvement in NAM's performance, including margin contributions from Baltimore Scrap and NEMT , partially offset by\ncompetitive pressures in ANZ.\nThe group generated an underlying EBITDA of $304.8 million, reflecting a decrease of 35.8% compared to the FY23 EBITDA of $474.9\nmillion. Higher absolute fixed costs, including the addition of Baltimore Scrap and NEMT, offset freight reductions, and combined with a\n37.5% decrease in the earnings contribution from the group's 50% interest in SA Recycling (\"SAR\") impacted the result. Sims’ equity\naccounted underlying EBITDA was $102.2 million in FY24 compared to $163.5 million in FY23.\nFY24 Underlying EBIT was $42.9 million compared to $252.2 million in FY23, a decrease of 83.0%. At constant currency, Underlying\nEBIT fell by 81.3%.\nStatutory EBIT was $— million higher than Underlying EBIT, after including a gain on the disposal of Sims’ interest in the LMS business,\noffset by impairment charges following a review of certain asset carrying values. Statutory EBIT for FY24 was $72.6 million, a decrease\nof 75.2% compared to FY23 statutory EBIT of $293.0 million. At constant currency, statutory EBIT decreased by 73.8%.\nFY24 net interest expense was up by 93.6% compared to FY23. This was due to higher borrowing levels and interest rates.\nSims Limited Annual Report 2024 5\nDIRECTORS' REPORT (CONTINUED)\nOPERATING AND FINANCIAL REVIEW (continued)\nOperating Segment Results1 - Continuing Operations\nNorth America Metal\nYEAR ENDED 30 JUNE\nA$M 2024 2023 CHANGE\nSales revenue 4,479.8 3,924.6 14.1%\nTrading margin 784.3 748.9 4.7%\nOperating costs (excluding D&A) (632.5) (569.3) 11.1%\nUnderlying EBITDA 151.8 179.6 (15.5%)\nUnderlying EBIT (12.6) 55.5 (122.7%)\nProprietary Sales tonnes (thousands) 5,000 5,063 (1.2%)\nTrading margin (%) 17.5% 19.1% (1.6%)\nUnderlying EBIT margin (%) (0.3%) 1.4% (1.7%)\nNorth America Metal (“NAM”) FY24 sales revenue was $4,479.8 million, reflecting a 14.1% increase compared to FY23 . At constant\ncurrency, sales revenue was up 11.2% to $4,362.5 million with an improvement in average sales price, partially offset by a (1.2%)\ndecrease in proprietary sales volumes despite the addition of Baltimore Scrap, as infeed supply contracted in line with market\nconditions. Trading margin was 4.7% higher ( 2.0% at constant currency) in FY24 compared to FY23 despite constrained supply\ncontinuing to impact buy prices. The trading margin was 18.0% higher in 2H FY24 compared to 1H FY24, with a higher proportion of\nunprocessed intake tonnes and the optimisation of selling destinations (in line with market conditions) as the business refocused its\nefforts on value over tonnage after a disappointing first half result. This improvement was achieved despite continued challenging\ntrading conditions throughout the year.\nOperating costs increased by 11.1% to $632.5 million or 7.6% at constant currency in FY24 compared to FY23.This was mainly driven\nby the acquisitions of Northeast Metal Traders in May 2023 and Baltimore Scrap in November 2023 which added approximately $80\nmillion to the cost base. Underlying costs excluding acquisitions improved with cost saving measures offsetting inflationary pressures.\nIn FY24, underlying EBIT fell by 122.7% to ($12.6) million or ($9.0) million on constant currency. Approximately 70% of this loss ($8.8\nmillion) was recorded in the first half of the year.\n1 Certain FY23 comparatives in the Operating Segments Results have been restated to ensure consistency with current year presentation\nSims Limited Annual Report 2024 6\nDIRECTORS' REPORT (CONTINUED)\nOPERATING AND FINANCIAL REVIEW (continued)\nOperating Segment Results - Continuing Operations (continued)\nInvestment in SAR\nYEAR ENDED 30 JUNE\nA$M 2024 2023 CHANGE\nSales revenue 4,768.6 4,519.0 5.5%\nTrading margin 1,436.8 1,417.6 1.4%\nOperating costs (excluding D&A) (1,039.7) (930.5) 11.7%\nUnderlying EBITDA 397.1 487.1 (18.5%)\nUnderlying EBIT 218.1 332.7 (34.4%)\nUnderlying PBT 204.4 327.0 (37.5%)\nUnderlying EBIT (50% share) 102.2 163.5 (37.5%)\nProprietary Sales tonnes (thousands) 5,026 4,969 1.1%\nTrading margin (%) 30.1% 31.4% (1.3%)\nUnderlying EBIT margin (%) 4.6% 7.4% (2.8%)\nSAR FY24 sales revenue was up by 5.5% to $4,768.6 million driven by higher sales prices.

The Group has environmental licenses and consents in place at various\noperating sites as prescribed by relevant environmental laws and regulations in respective jurisdictions. Conditions associated with\nthese licenses and consents include those which stipulate environmental monitoring requirements and reporting limits to monitor\nconformance with the requirements of such licenses and consents.\nUnder Australian environmental regulation, an entity is required to provide a summary of its environmental performance as per\ns299(1)(f) of the Corporations Act 2001. Further information on the Company’s environmental performance is set out in the Group’s\nAnnual Sustainability Report. On 10 October 2023, the Group lodged its 2023 Sustainability report on the ASX. A copy of the report can\nbe viewed at https://www.simsltd.com/investors/reports.\nAdditionally, the Group’s Australian operations are subject to the reporting requirements of the National Greenhouse and Energy\nReporting Act 2007 (“NGER”). The NGER Act requires the Group to report its annual greenhouse emissions and energy use of its\nAustralian operations. Similarly, the Group’s UK operations are subject to the reporting requirements of the companies and limited\nliability partnerships in complying with the Companies Act 2006 (Strategic Report and Directors’ Report) Regulations 2013 and the\nCompanies (Directors’ Report) and Limited Liability Partnerships (Energy and Carbon Report) Regulations 2018, which require\nnon‑quoted large companies, such as Sims Limited, to report on its UK energy use and associated greenhouse gas emissions. The\nGroup has implemented systems and processes for the collection and calculation of the data required so as to prepare and submit the\nrelevant report to the Clean Energy Regulator in Australia and include in its Directors’ report as part of its UK filing obligations annually.\nIn the last 12 months, there has been no material exposure to the risk of breaches of environmental permits conditions or legislation.\nMANAGING RISKS\nAn integral part of the way Sims operates is recognising and managing the broad range of risks that it faces. Each must be given careful\nand appropriate consideration in order to support our commitments to our customers and stakeholders in line with our vision to: create a\nworld without waste, while preserving our planet. In accordance with our Risk Management Policy and Framework, Sims manages risk\nwith the aim of:\n• Supporting the achievement of strategic objectives through the identification and management of key areas of risk and\nopportunity on a proactive basis;\n• Providing the basis for informed decision making;\n• Enabling consistent and frequent communication between management and key governance committees;\n• Continuously enhancing the perception of Sims to our key stakeholders, including customers, shareholders and the\ncommunity.\nThrough our Risk Management process (which is detailed in our Risk Management Policy), Sims Limited continuously monitors,\nassesses and manages the response to these risks, which range from operational events to external factors. Some of these key areas of\nrisk and opportunities are discussed in detail in the following sections:\nCLIMATE CHANGE RISKS\nClimate change poses physical risks to our business, our people, and to the infrastructure, communities and environment that we\nengage with. We believe that the transition to a low-carbon economy encompasses a parallel transition to a circular economy and\npresents opportunities for our business as well as risks.\nLearn more about our approach to climate change, including our detailed assessment of the risks and opportunities, in our Climate\nReport. Performance data is included in our Sustainability Databook, both available at https://www.simsltd.com/sustainability/\ndownload-centre/\nOpportunities\nAt Sims, the low-carbon transition is at the heart of our business strategy: Increase our positive impact in the circular economy and take\nactions to decarbonise our operations and value chain in line with our energy and climate targets. Sims provides high-quality recycled\nmetals in place of virgin materials, which enables the avoidance of emissions, including those associated with extraction, refining and\nproduction. Metals such as steel, copper and aluminium are essential to the transition to a low-carbon urban economy; used in\napplications such as Solar PV and wind farms, electric vehicles and urban construction.\nThe strategic and scenario analyses we have outlined in our Climate Report demonstrates that as an enabler of the global circular\neconomy, Sims is well placed to assist customers in lowering their respective carbon footprints as the world transitions to a circular, low-\ncarbon economy and to deliver on our purpose.\nSims Limited Annual Report 2024 18\nDIRECTORS' REPORT (CONTINUED)\nCLIMATE CHANGE RISKS (continued)\nThreats\nClimate change impacts physical, economic and social systems, so climate risks are reflected across the Sims risk profile. Climate\nchange can alter the likelihood and impact of risks, as well as the effectiveness of controls. The potential impacts of climate change on\nour strategy (both physical risk and climate risk) are outlined in the Climate Report. Key physical risks arise as a result of extreme\ntemperatures (including health & safety issues for employees and productivity loss) and extreme wet (including flooding, sea level rise,\nand other acute weather events).\nFailure to manage climate change risk could lead to loss of stakeholder support, increased taxes and regulation, enforcement action,\nlitigation or class actions, and negatively affect our reputation, ability to attract and retain talent, ability to access capital, operational\ncontinuity and financial performance.\nRisk appetite\nSims is committed to living its purpose and views environmental risks as opportunities that allow us to differentiate our offering, even\nwhen it is difficult. We encourage constant innovation and improvement that protect the environment we operate in, exceed the public’s\nexpectations, and set the standard for our industry.\nOur management response includes:\n• Publishing a comprehensive Climate Report, aligned to the TCFD recommendations, and giving our shareholders the opportunity to\nendorse it in an advisory vote every three years. The last vote was at the 2022 AGM where 89.6 percent of issued capital voted in\nfavour\n• Outlining our approach to managing the transition and physical risks of climate change in our Climate Report\n• Establishing clear targets to lower GHG emissions in our direct operations over the short, medium, and longer term to reduce risk\nexposure relating to policy, regulation, and carbon pricing; and including incentives related to these targets in remuneration\nincentives\n• Using climate scenarios, including a Paris-aligned 1.5C scenario, to inform our strategy and business plans\n• Using carbon pricing when making capital expenditure decisions, including merger & acquisition activity\n• Advocating for an orderly transition to a circular, low-carbon economy; including reviewing industry association memberships to\nensure alignment with our climate and energy policy positions\n• Engaging regularly with investors, governments, industry associations, membership-based sustainability organisations, ESG proxy\nadvisers and customers to identify and monitor emerging climate change risks, opportunities and trends\n• Being transparent in our annual disclosure of climate related performance, opportunities and threats, in accordance with\nsustainability reporting standards including GRI, SASB and TCFD.\nHEALTH & SAFETY RISKS\nHealth & Safety are company values taken seriously. Sims leads in safety performance for the simple reason that we do not wait to\nrespond to incidents, but effectively address risks proactively through our global lead indicator programs. Our Health and Safety strategy\nuses data to target specific risks and verifying the effectiveness of controls, and we build a culture of safety excellence.\nLearn more about our approach to safety, including performance data in the Sustainability Report and Databook, available at https://\nwww.simsltd.com/sustainability/download-centre/\nOpportunities\nDemonstrating that we can meet or exceed our commitments in safety supports operational resilience, our ability to attract and retain\ntalent, and helps us achieve our purpose.\nThreats\nWe engage in activities that have the potential to cause harm to our people, including serious injuries and fatalities. A serious safety\nevent could also cause damage or disruptions to our assets and operations, impact our financial performance, result in litigation or\nregulatory action, and cause long-term damage to our social licence to operate and reputation. Safety incidents can alter the lives of the\nindividual, their family and community.\nRisk appetite\nFirst and foremost is safety. We are committed to providing a safe working environment for our people, and will take all reasonable steps\nto protect the public, our customers, contractors and suppliers. Therefore, we have no tolerance for behaviour that compromises the\nsafety of our people and the wider community. Sims takes the mental wellbeing of our workforce just as seriously as their physical\nwellbeing and encourage our workforce to feel comfortable openly discussing their struggles.\nSims Limited Annual Report 2024 19\nDIRECTORS' REPORT (CONTINUED)\nHEALTH & SAFETY RISKS (continued)\nOur management response includes:\n• Defining 18 critical control verifications to address critical risks (those risks with the potential of causing the most serious harms).\nKey focus areas, such as traffic management, have been identified based on risk levels and the highest likelihood of occurrence.\n• Specifying minimum and recommended requirements for hazard controls\n• Reporting, investigating, and sharing learnings from incidents across Sims\n• Developing a proactive safety culture through training, surveying and management example\n• Investigating and deploying technology for incident prevention and detection\n• Providing Employee Assistance Programs for employees to receive support related to mental health, general wellbeing, and other\nconcerns\n• Including targets related to safety performance in remuneration incentives\n• Maintaining evacuation routes, supporting equipment, crisis and emergency response plans and business continuity plans.\n• Being transparent in our annual disclosure of climate related performance, opportunities and threats, in accordance with\nsustainability reporting standards including GRI and SASB.\nSOCIAL LICENCE\nWe recognise the significant shifts in our external operating environment and increased stakeholder expectations regarding the role of\ncompanies in society and the communities in which they operate. In particular, we recognise that without a social licence from our\ncommunities and broader stakeholders, we would simply not able to operate. In this context we have developed a Social Licence\nFramework, not just to manage risks associated with maintaining our Social Licence, but importantly to ensure Sims continues to be a\npartner for change in the communities in which we operate.\nLearn more about our role as partner for change, please refer to our ESG Briefing (October 2022)\nhttps://sltd.s3.amazonaws.com/2022-ESG-Briefing.pdf\nOpportunities\nBuilding, maintaining and deepening our relationships with the communities we operate, and our wider stakeholders supports\noperational resilience and our ability to attract and retain talent (which is mostly sourced from the local community). Our customer base\nis often also local, and we want to be the place where the local community and supplier base recycle their metals. This not only helps our\nbottom-line by giving us access to intake at source, but also develops our brand and credibility as a business and supports our purpose.\nThreats\nThe rapid gentrification or urbanisation of previously industrial or semi-rural suburbs in the vicinity of larger cities means that most of our\nsites, even if relatively removed from urban centres at inception, are now in close proximity to (or in the midst of) urban areas or sensitive\nreceptors. Through our operations, we have the potential to cause disruption and nuisance to the communities and the environment\naround us, whether through fires at our sites, dust, noise, increased heavy-vehicle traffic, and other factors. A serious fire event, for\nexample, could potentially cause damage or disturbances to the environment, our neighbours and the community at large, impact our\nfinancial and operational performance, result in litigation or regulatory action, and ultimately cause long-term damage to our social\nlicence to operate and reputation.\nRisk appetite\nWe encourage fostering trust with the communities in which we operate, by acting authentically in line with our purpose, and by being\ntransparent about our business and our vision to protect our planet. We encourage prioritisation of projects that mitigate negative\nimpacts to the community. We encourage our purpose “create a world without waste” to be lived through our actions across all our sites.\nSims Limited Annual Report 2024 20\nDIRECTORS' REPORT (CONTINUED)\nSOCIAL LICENCE (continued)\nOur management response includes:\n• A vast array of operational measures are in place and substantial investments identified to address and mitigate any undesirable\nimpact of our operations on our communities and the environment. Such measures include (but are not limited to) buffer walls,\nenclosing some of our equipment (where reasonably practicable), and planting trees to screen off noise and improve visuals.\n• Targeted, locally focused, action plans in place for key sites\n• Social Licence Framework and associated governance mechanisms in place\n• Dedicated resources in key locations to understand our communities’ needs and drive our action plans\n• Reporting, investigating, and sharing learnings from incidents impacting our communities and the environment across the Group\n• Developed crisis and emergency response plans and business continuity plans\n• Sims works collaboratively with local fire departments and fire detection firms to ensure our control measures in fire prevention and\nmethods for response continually improve with new technologies. Over the past few years, we have partnered with fire detection\nfirms to trial state-of-the-art, machine-learning, early detection warning systems to control fire risk.\nREGULATIONS AND PUBLIC POLICY\nAs previously articulated, we recognise the significant shift in our external operating environment and increased stakeholder\nexpectations, including those from government and regulatory authorities. In this regard, we view the efforts of government (and the\nprivate sector) to decarbonise and lower emissions as a significant opportunity for Sims.\nParticularly relevant to Sims are cap and trade schemes, emission limits, as well as carbon-pricing mechanisms and taxes on GHG\nemissions. Sims supports the efforts endorsed by the European Council in December 2019 to make the EU climate neutral by 2050 and\nby the U.S. and Australia to achieve net zero greenhouse gas emissions by no later than 2050, in line with the Paris Agreement. Sims\nremains committed to curbing its own emissions.\nOpportunities\nAs described under ‘Climate Change’ for Sims, a low-carbon transition is at the heart of our business strategy. As such, we see a\nsignificant upside in the current and proposed government policies which aim at transitioning to a low-carbon economy. As a leader in\nthe metals recycling industry, we see ourselves as an indispensable part of the transition, and in furthering the circular-economy agenda,\neither through strategic industry associations or directly engaging with government where appropriate.\nThreats\nThe potential threats arising from these changes or measures range between tactical challenges such as an increased cost of\npurchased energy, or capital costs needed for the electrification of equipment, or lower emissions equipment to, on a strategic front,\npotential restrictions to the export of our products which may came through waste management initiatives. Sims has not to date\nexperienced any material negative impact related to these current or potential regulations but we continue to monitor, evaluate and\nengage with government and through industry associations to ensure we remain current and are able to respond to these changes with\nsufficient agility.\nRisk appetite\nSims requires strict compliance with laws and regulations across our organisation including safety, trading, environment, and reporting\nto the public. While we target compliance, we simultaneously pursue clarity in environmental regulations and strive to ensure all players\nin the industry are held to the same environmental standards that we pursue.\nWe encourage regular community and bi-partisan political engagement efforts at a federal, state and local level to support the\nachievement of our purpose and vision. We discourage complacency in our processes and procedures that put us at risk of regulatory\nviolations and potential litigation.\nSims Limited Annual Report 2024 21\nDIRECTORS' REPORT (CONTINUED)\nREGULATIONS AND PUBLIC POLICY (continued)\nOur management response includes:\n• Engaging through industry associations, business chambers, and directly with government where appropriate\n• Annual review of industry association lobbying to monitor activity alignment with Sims’ policy and position (particularly regarding\nclimate change).\n• Monitoring and scanning for changes in the policy and regulatory environment\n• Engagement of specialised third-party advisory firms or individuals as required\n• Government Engagement & Advocacy Policy to guide activities\n• Rotating, regular internal Audit reviews of site compliance with key regulatory obligations\n• Internal Controls Questionnaires to regularly assess and report on the status of key controls pertaining to areas of regulatory\ncompliance across all our sites\n• Annual Compliance training for all staff\n• Whistleblower mechanisms in place to ensure any breaches of laws or regulation can be promptly and anonymously reported and\nrecorded.\nTECHNOLOGY AND CYBER SECURITY\nAs Sims continues to evolve, our processes are becoming increasingly reliant on technology and the systems with which we operate,\nmore sophisticated. We view technology as a tool to assist and enhance the running of our day-to-day operations and also a key\ncomponent of our future strategy. Consequently, Sims has consistently invested in enhancing its technology suite and bolstering its\ncyber security and incident response management.\nOpportunities\nWe see a significant upside in enhancing our core operating systems, as well as in the use of business intelligence, data analytics and,\nwhere appropriate, artificial intelligence.\nOur Sims Lifecycle Services business is exceptionally positioned to take full advantage of the increasing use of data centres across the\nglobe and partners with a range of well-established technology companies, playing a critical role in helping businesses and data centers\nmanage the profound shift in how and where technology is managed. As a worldwide leader in IT asset and cloud infrastructure reuse,\nredeployment, recycling and refining, SLS provides IT asset disposition and e-waste recycling solutions for businesses. Our data centre\ndivision plays a hands-on role in decommissioning IT equipment, bulk hard drive destruction and repurposing data centre parts and\nequipment.\nThreats\nWe view technology and its use as a sizeable opportunity, while also recognising that it presents clear threats which need to be\nmanaged, such as risks associated with the adoption and implementation of new technologies and the failure to take necessary steps to\nprepare for cybersecurity incidents or technical outages which could result in operational incidents, business disruptions or data\nbreaches, and ultimately have adverse effects on our social license to operate, reputation, financial performance, and overall\ncompetitiveness.\nRisk appetite\nWe encourage all Sims employees to believe they have a responsibility to protect Sims’ assets and data and encourage investment in\ntraining that promotes proactive behaviours to prevent, detect, respond and recover from cyber security incidents.\nWe discourage the use of workarounds and an inclination towards old ways of working. We discourage any delays in upgrades to\nsystems which protect Sims’ and Sims’ customer’s data. We also discourage any failure to address, report and escalate instances of\nnon-compliance consistent with Sims policies and procedures.\nSims Limited Annual Report 2024 22\nDIRECTORS' REPORT (CONTINUED)\nTECHNOLOGY AND CYBER SECURITY (continued)\nOur management response includes:\n• Maintaining technologies to improve our overall cybersecurity resilience, including but not limited to global virtual private networks\n(VPNs), multi-factor authentication (MFA), robust anti-virus/anti-spyware/ anti-malware software technologies, data protection via\nencryption and machine authentication.\n• Implementing a robust incident response strategy in partnership with third-party service providers of managed detection and\nincident response and conducted our annual global IT incident response tabletop exercise.\n• Conducting an executive level Crisis Management exercises simulating a wide-spread cyber security event with the participation of\nthe Board (represented through the Board’s Chair and the Chair of the Risk Committee) as well as key executives across all\npotentially impacted business units and functions.\n• Enhancing our information security/cybersecurity awareness training program by leveraging various internal communication\nchannels, including email (frequent publication of cybersecurity articles) and MySims Intranet site (security videos and\nCybersecurity Awareness newsletter).\n• Continuing to include training on relevant security awareness policies (e.g., acceptable use, protection of information assets) as part\nof our new employee onboarding process. • Deployed our mandatory Annual Cybersecurity Training video, which is managed\nthrough the Sims University Learning Center.\n• Conducting bi-monthly internal simulated phishing testing attacks and enhancing our KPI reporting.\n• Maintaining appropriate cyber insurance.\n• Testing our Disaster Recovery Plans across all regions.\n• Subjecting our cybersecurity practices to annual internal and external audit, and vulnerability assessment and penetration testing\nmultiple times during the year.\nGEOPOLITICAL AND MACROECONOMIC RISKS\nSims financial and operational performance is exposed to fluctuations in the market price for ferrous and non‑ferrous metals and\nprecious metals, which at times are volatile. The underlying causes for these fluctuations are typically geopolitical and macroeconomic\nfactors which, albeit being beyond Sims’ direct control, need to be closely monitored and, to the extent possible, their impact anticipated\nand mitigated.\nOpportunities\nWe are confident in the medium and long-term fundamentals of the business. The demand for ferrous scrap in the USA spurred on by\ninfrastructure spending and EAF steelmaking production is expected to remain robust. India remains a key area of growth and we\nexpect to be able to leverage its foreshadowed infrastructure expansion in the coming years.\nOn more general terms, we continue to build our understanding of geopolitical and macroeconomic threats and opportunities as we\nbelieve this can not just assist us in implementing appropriate risk mitigation measures but also enhance the development of our\nstrategy, our operations planning and response, and ultimately provide a potential future competitive advantage.\nThreats\nIn the short term, adverse movements in commodity prices may negatively impact our financial performance. Current ferrous scrap\nprices, driven, at least partially, from an oversupply of Chinese Steel, may result in a continuation of soft scrap inflows. We expect the\nZorba price to remain stable largely due to the subdued supply of shredder infeed.\nThe cost of capital driven by persistently high inflation, and a strong US dollar, may also adversely affect the results of our operations,\nfinancial performance and returns to investors in the short term.\nOur management response includes:\n• Monitoring geopolitical and macroeconomic developments and trends, including through signal monitoring and our enterprise-level\nwatch list of emerging themes, to provide an early indication of events that could impact our strategy.\n• Regular briefings and updates from external Subject Matter Experts to management and the Board\n• Maintaining response plans for various scenarios (including major international conflict/s) to mitigate disruptions to sales and\nlogistics.\n• Inventory management and turning inventories quickly.\n• Use of forward commodity contracts matched to purchases or sales of non‑ferrous metals (primarily copper, nickel and aluminium)\nand certain precious metals (primarily gold, silver and palladium).\n• Strategic planning and stress testing of assumptions using a range of diverse pricing forecasts for key commodities.\n• Cost containment measures and other initiatives deployed to offset the impact of a commodity pricing downturn and improve\nmargins.\nSims Limited Annual Report 2024 23\nDIRECTORS' REPORT (CONTINUED)\nINSURANCE AND INDEMNIFICATION OF OFFICERS\nDuring the financial year, the Company had contracts in place insuring all Directors and Executives of the Company (and/or any\nsubsidiary companies in which it holds greater than 50% of the voting shares), including Directors in office at the date of this report and\nthose who served on the Board during the year, against liabilities that may arise from their positions within the Company and its\ncontrolled entities, except where the liabilities arise out of conduct involving a lack of good faith.

Due to\nthe favourable feedback received from Sims’ shareholders and various stakeholder groups on the changes to the FY23 remuneration\nstructure we disclosed in last year’s Report, no further changes were made to either the STI or LTI plan designs in FY24.\nOverview of FY24\nIn FY24, the global scrap market encountered significant challenges due to a tight supply of ferrous scrap, primarily stemming from a\ndownturn in post-consumer availability. This was compounded by declining demand for metal scrap in the seaborne and ferrous scrap\ndomestic markets. These adverse conditions negatively impacted our margins and EBIT, resulting in an overall disappointing financial\nperformance in FY24 relative to expectations.\nHowever, despite these challenges, we achieved significant strategic milestones in the execution of our strategy, with material progress\nmade in the second half of the year. We undertook a comprehensive strategic review of our UK Metal business, evaluating various\noptions, including a sale, joint venture, or restructuring. Ultimately, the decision to sell proved to be the most beneficial outcome for our\nshareholders. Additionally, we have signed a letter of intent to sell our remaining interest in Circular Services as part of our recycling\ncapital strategy.\nIn North America, our largest metal market, we made cultural, operational, and commercial adjustments to improve competitiveness\nand cyclical resilience in response to changing market conditions. Notably, we achieved significant improvement in the last quarter of\nthe year as our performance improvement initiatives began to take effect.\nPleasingly, Sims Lifecycle Services is on a strong revenue and profit growth trajectory.\nThrough our cost-out program, in the last six months we realised significant savings and reduced a number of staff roles. We continue to\nevaluate our structure and identify additional opportunities to fully deliver against our cost savings target.\nOn the sustainability front, we continued to excel in safety performance, achieving a new low in our Total Recordable Injury Frequency\nRate of 1.0. We were also proud to be recognised by Corporate Knights as the world’s most sustainable company illustrating that our\npurpose, to \"create a world without waste to preserve our planet\", is integrated throughout our business.\nSims Limited Annual Report 2024 26\nDIRECTORS' REPORT (CONTINUED)\nREMUNERATION REPORT (continued)\nFY24 remuneration framework and outcomes\nGiven the restructuring and cost reduction initiatives undertaken throughout the year, no increases to fixed remuneration were made to\nExecutives during FY24 (this was the third consecutive year for the CEO and CFO). However, the Board did approve a promotional\nincrease to Mr. Mikkelsen when he was appointed to the role of Chief Executive Officer and Managing Director effective 1 October 2023.\nThe fixed remuneration and maximum LTI opportunity for Mr. Mikkelsen are 17% and 38% less, respectively, than that of the former\nGroup CEO.\nIn line with our remuneration principles of aligning executive incentive outcomes with business performance and shareholder returns,\nthe actual results of both the short term and long term incentives realised by the KMP in FY24 were significantly below the target and\nmaximum opportunities.\nThe FY24 financial component of the Short-term Incentive (STI) was assessed on an EBIT target set for the entire year. Based on the\nFY24 EBIT result, the Company did not achieve the minimum threshold for payment of the financial component (representing 80% of\nthe total opportunity) of the annual bonus plan and therefore no monies will be paid to the KMP for that portion of the STI.\nThe second component of the STI (representing 20% of the total opportunity) is based on an assessment of executives’ individual\nperformance goals. In FY24, KMP achieved 100% - 105% for that portion of the STI bonus. In total, the CEO and KMP executives\nachieved STI outcomes of 11% of the maximum STI bonus.\nOur Long-term Incentive (LTI) award is focused on alignment to shareholder experiences and delivering sustainable growth and value\nover the long term. The performance over the three-year measurement period resulted in an achievement of total shareholder returns\nbelow the 50th percentile against the comparator group, resulting in no vesting of the Total Shareholder Return (TSR) performance\nrights. After careful consideration of a range of factors, including a shift in certain strategic initiatives (as referenced in section 2.6), the\nBoard determined that Strategic Performance Rights (SPR) vesting would be 60%. This resulted in an overall achievement of 32% of\nthe LTI performance rights eligible to vest in the performance period ending in FY24.\nKMP and Non Executive Director changes\nA number of changes to the KMP and directors occurred throughout the course of FY24, including retirements of long-standing\nexecutives and directors and the welcoming of several new directors and our CFO.\nAlistair Field retired from Sims as Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer on 30 September 2023. After joining Sims in 2015 and\nserving as the CEO since 2017, Mr Field formed and led the executive team in defining the company’s long-term purpose and values,\nand developing the growth strategy that remains the focus going forward.\nAfter a rigorous recruitment and selection process, the Board was delighted to appoint Stephen Mikkelsen, who served as Sims’ Group\nCFO since 2018, as Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer. Mr Mikkelsen’s depth of understanding of Sims’ business, industry,\nand markets, accompanied by his successful operations experience in managing and creating shareholder value in large complex\nbusinesses made him an excellent choice to lead Sims on its drive for continued profitable growth.\nWarrick Ranson was appointed as Group Chief Financial Officer effective 4 December 2023. Mr Ranson brings over two decades of\nextensive executive-level experience, having held senior positions within blue-chip corporations operating across global markets in the\nmining and resources industries. He was most recently CFO of OZ Minerals Limited.\nSteve Skurnac, most recently serving Sims as Chief Development Officer and also as Interim Chief Financial Officer, retired as planned\nand announced on 31 December 2023.\nGeoff Brunsdon announced his retirement from the Sims Board effective 25 March 2024 after 12 years serving as the the Sims Board\nChair. Philip Bainbridge was appointed as the new Board Chair, effective on the same date.\nKathy Hirschfeld was appointed to the Board as an independent non-executive director effective 1 September 2023. Ms Hirschfeld has\nextensive experience on ASX, NYSE, private company and government boards. She is currently the Chair of Powerlink Queensland,\nand is an independent non-executive director of Central Petroleum.\nGeorgia Nelson announced her retirement from the Sims Board effective 1 November 2023 after nine years of dedicated service to the\nBoard, including her roles as the Chair of the Risk Committee and a member of the Audit and People and Culture Committees.\nGrant Dempsey was appointed to the Board as an independent non-executive director effective 22 April 2024. Mr Dempsey has more\nthan 35 years of executive experience, having served in numerous roles as a senior executive, strategic advisor and investment banker.\nMost recently, Mr Dempsey served as the Chief Financial Officer of TPG Telecom.\nThe Board wishes to thank Messrs Field, Brunsdon, Skurnac and Ms Nelson for their many years of leadership and dedicated service to\nSims.\nSims Limited Annual Report 2024 27\nDIRECTORS' REPORT (CONTINUED)\nREMUNERATION REPORT (continued)\nLooking ahead to FY25\nSims relies on a high-performing geographically diverse management team to execute our growth strategy and deliver sustainable long-\nterm value for shareholders, in a manner that is consistent with our purpose, values and culture. We believe Sims' remuneration\nstructure provides the right balance and meets the multiple objectives of our remuneration framework.

The framework is\naligned with the business’ performance objectives, the remuneration guiding principles, and is informed by market practice. The mix of\ntotal target remuneration for Executives consists of fixed remuneration for the performance of job duties, short‑term incentives for\ndelivery of one‑year financial goals and execution of important strategic and operational objectives, and long‑term incentives for\nachievement of multi‑year financial goals and execution of strategic initiatives that position the company for future success.\nOur Remuneration Principles\nWe align Executive We drive Short‑Term We Attract, Motivate We align We align Risk &\n& Shareholder & Long-Term & Retain Talent remuneration with Strategy Execution\nInterest by Achievements with through competitive Sims’ Purpose & through an\nemphasising the balanced objectives remuneration Market Dynamics by appropriate balanced\nachievement of linked to Group, programs reflective of designing mix of incentives and\nlong‑term results using business unit and the market, scope of fit‑for‑purpose metrics aligned to\nat‑risk incentives and individual role, geographic programs accounting both short‑term\nshare ownership performance. location and for our global execution and long-\nthrough deferred performance. operations, cyclical term strategy.\nequity and holding industry and market\nrequirements. dynamics, and the\nCompany's purpose.\nSims Limited Annual Report 2024 30\nDIRECTORS' REPORT (CONTINUED)\nREMUNERATION REPORT (continued)\nExecutive Remuneration Framework\nAT-RISK INCENTIVE\nFIXED REMUNERATION SHORT-TERM INCENTIVE LONG-TERM INCENTIVE\nPurpose Attract and retain top global Rewards for meeting or Drives a focus on creating\ntalent exceeding challenging annual sustainable long-term\nfinancial, strategic and shareholder value and\nindividual performance goals reinforcing an ownership\nmindset\nInstrument Base salary, superannuation, Cash and Deferred Ordinary • TSR Performance Rights\npension, and/or retirement Shares (22%)\ncontributions where applicable,\n• Strategic Performance\nand other non-monetary\nRights (45%)\nbenefits\n• Return on Productive\nAssets Rights (ROPA)\n(33%)\nMeasurement / Reviewed periodically Financial performance TSR Performance Rights\nConsiderations considering various factors (80%) Relative TSR against\nincluding (but not limited to) Underlying EBIT companies in the ASX 200\nrole size and complexity, skills materials and energy sectors,\nand experience, talent scarcity Non-financial performance over a three-year performance\nand relevant external (20%) period.\nremuneration benchmarks Individual performance goals\nunder several key focus areas: Strategic Performance\nRights\n• Environment, Health &\nSafety Achievement of strategic goals\nover a three-year performance\n• Organisational\nperiod.\nSimplification\n• Margin Optimisation ROPA Rights\n• Culture, Leadership, Achievement of the\nDiversity and People Company’s performance\nrelative to a Return on\nProductive Assets metric over\na three-year performance\nperiod.\nQuantum Group CEO, Group CFO\nGroup CEO\n100% of base salary at-target\nLTI grant value of 150% of\n(184% of base maximum)\nbase salary\nCCO, Metal and COO, Metal\nGroup CFO, CCO, Metal and\n75% of base salary at-target COO, Metal\n(138% of base maximum)\nLTI grant value of 100% of\nbase salary\nSims Limited Annual Report 2024 31\nDIRECTORS' REPORT (CONTINUED)\nREMUNERATION REPORT (continued)\nDelivery of FY24 remuneration components\n1.2 EXECUTIVE REMUNERATION MIX\nThe charts below show the mix of the aggregate remuneration components at target and maximum for each of our Executives for FY24.\nReferences to actual remuneration outcomes received by the Sims’ Executives for FY24 are provided in section 3.\nFY24 Remuneration structure and mix at target and at maximum achievement for Sims’ Executives1,2\n1 Fixed Remuneration excludes accrued benefits.\n2 Totals may not add to 100% due to rounding of individual components\nSims Limited Annual Report 2024 32\nDIRECTORS' REPORT (CONTINUED)\nREMUNERATION REPORT (continued)\n1.3 EXECUTIVE REMUNERATION BENCHMARKING\nThe Committee believes it is important to understand the relevant market for executive talent in order to ensure Sims’ remuneration\nstrategy and programs support the guiding principle to attract, retain and develop a pipeline of highly qualified leaders. Sims has adopted\na market positioning strategy where the remuneration program design and total remuneration for Executives are benchmarked against a\ngroup of peer companies that are listed on the Australian Securities Exchange (ASX), New York Stock Exchange and the NASDAQ\nStock Market. The Company competes against the peer companies for executive talent across its different business operations and\njurisdictions, globally.\nFixed remuneration acts as a base level of pay for ongoing performance of job responsibilities. A competitive level of fixed remuneration\nis critical to attract and retain executives.\nTotal fixed remuneration includes base salary and benefits, such as superannuation or other retirement programs, health insurance, life\nand disability insurance, and automobile allowances where applicable. At-risk remuneration elements are based on annual bonus and\nperformance-based equity incentives.\nFixed and at-risk remuneration at Sims references an appropriate range around the market median (50th percentile) as one input to the\nCompany’s remuneration decisions. In addition, other inputs include:\n• The geographic reach of the role;\n• The complexity of the role;\n• Skills and experience required for the role;\n• Market pay levels and competitiveness against the benchmark peer group;\n• The criticality of the role to successful execution of the business strategy; and\n• Market dynamics and cyclicality affecting the industry in which the Company operates.\nSims Limited Annual Report 2024 33\nDIRECTORS' REPORT (CONTINUED)\nREMUNERATION REPORT (continued)\nExecutive Benchmarking Peer Group\nThe People & Culture Committee, with assistance from its independent remuneration consultants, monitors composition of the peer\ngroup to ensure it continues to serve as an appropriate reference for establishing total remuneration for Sims’ Executives. The\nCommittee considers companies with similarities to Sims on one or more of the following characteristics:\n• within our industry or comparable lines of business\n• complexity of global operations\n• similar revenue size\n• country listing\n• similar industry dynamics\n• similar number of employees\n• similar market capitalisation.\nThis peer group is used exclusively for benchmarking of executive remuneration and is not linked to any incentive program.\nBy considering benchmarking peers across a number of parameters, this ensures that Sims is able to attract and retain key talent that\nreflects the geographical and operational complexity of our business. The Committee believes that overemphasising peer companies by\nmarket capitalisation can lead to significant volatility in remuneration quantum due to temporary peaks or troughs in Sims’ and peers’\nmarket value. It should be noted that the U.S. listed peers companies not only represent our key source of competition for executive\ntalent, but also companies that Sims competes with for business acquisitions.\nThe executive remuneration peer group was determined by selecting public companies traded in the USA and Australia with executives\nprimarily located in either of those two countries. Revenue, assets, market capitalisation, capital expenditures, profit, number of\nemployees, industry, cyclicality, complexity of operations, and geographic footprint were among the factors considered in selecting the\npeer companies.\nThe Committee, along with its independent compensation consultant recently reviewed Sims' peer group which currently reflect the 38\ncompanies listed below:\nAUSTRALIAN LISTED COMPANIES\nAnsell Cleanaway Waste Management Incitec Pivot Orora\nAurizon Coronado Global Resources James Hardie Industries Qube\nBlueScope Steel CSR Metcash Viva Energy Group\nBoral Downer EDI Nufarm Worley\nBrickworks Graincorp Orica\nU.S. LISTED COMPANIES\nAlgoma Steel Group Clean Harbors Greif Ryerson Holding Corp\nAlpha Metallurgical Resources Commercial Metals Co Hyster-Yale Materials Schneider National\nATI Constellium SE O-I Glass Silgan\nBoise Cascade Co Eagle Materials Pactiv Evergreen Worthington Steel\nCarpenter Technology Corp Enviri Corp Radius Recycling\nSims Limited Annual Report 2024 34\nDIRECTORS' REPORT (CONTINUED)\nREMUNERATION REPORT (continued)\n1.4 SHORT-TERM INCENTIVE PLAN OVERVIEW FOR FY24\nWho participates in the The Group CEO and other KMP Executives\nSTI Plan?\nWhat is the objective To recognise KMP Executives for the achievement of financial, strategic and individual performance goals over\nof the STI Plan? one year.\nHow is it paid?

Sims’ Board may reassess the effectiveness of the performance measures\nunder the STI annually and may determine to make adjustments to ensure continued alignment to strategy and\ndelivery of appropriate returns to shareholders.\nThe Board believes the utilisation of underlying EBIT as a reporting metric provides a consistent and\ncomparable year-over-year measure. This improves transparency, line of sight, communication and simplicity.\nEBIT associated with the disposal of businesses, impact of impairments, restructuring charges, timing of non-\nqualified hedges and other non-recurring items that are subject to significant variability from one period to the\nnext are excluded from the calculation.

Individual Performance Goals (IPGs) are set in a number of key areas which focus on\nsafety and business initiatives critical to the overall success of the Company and execution of its strategic\ninitiatives and operating objectives. The Board assesses the IPG achievement of the CEO and reviews and\napproves the CEO's assessment of achievement by other Executives. Executives can earn a maximum of\n120% achievement for the IPG component of the STI, being approximately 13% of the total maximum STI\nopportunity.\nThe People & Culture Committee established specific criteria for FY24 individual performance goals pertaining\nto the Group CEO and other Executives of Sims. IPGs for Executives included objectives in the areas of safety;\nculture and leadership; organisational simplification; margin optimisation; sustainability; and community\nengagement. Additional details regarding achievement against goals are provided for each Executive in section\n2.6.\nNo minimum financial achievement is required for Executives to earn a payout for the achievement of the non-\nfinancial component of the STI. The Board retains discretion regarding the funding of the non-financial\ncomponent payouts.\nThe Group CEO’s performance is assessed by the Committee and any earned incentive payment\nrecommendation must be approved by the Board of Directors.

The\nCompany aims to provide a level of fees for NEDs taking into account, among other things, fees paid for similar roles in comparable\ncompanies, the time commitment, risk and responsibility accepted by NEDs, and recognition of their commercial expertise and\nexperience. Given the geographical spread of the NEDs, with several NEDs located in either the U.S. or Japan, the Company also\nconsiders global market competitiveness in setting fee levels.\nThe maximum aggregate amount available for NED fees (including superannuation) is the greater of A$3 million and US$3 million per\nannum as approved by shareholders at the Company’s 2015 Annual General Meeting. Total aggregate NED fees for FY24 were\nA$2,222,197/ US$1,457,960 (FY23: A$2,296,558 / US$1,538,767).\nDuring FY19, the Company established a policy of paying all NED fees based on the Australian dollar, regardless of where the director is\nresident. U.S. resident NEDs who joined the Board prior to FY19 will continue to receive their fees based on the U.S. dollar.\nThere have been no changes to NED base fees since July 2011.

NEDs do not participate in any incentive (cash or equity‑based) arrangements.\nFor Australian resident NEDs, superannuation is deducted from the above fees disclosed in Column A. The Company paid\nsuperannuation at 10.5% up to the maximum contribution (A$27,500) for each Australian resident NED in FY24. Superannuation is not\npaid in respect of overseas NEDs.

The Group sells\na significant portion of its ferrous secondary material on cost and freight or cost, insurance and freight Incoterms. Under these\narrangements, revenue from the sale of goods is recognised prior to the vessel arriving at the destination port as control has passed and\nperformance obligations have been met (dependent on the Incoterm per contract). A material portion of the Group’s ferrous bulk cargo\nsales arrangements specify that title passes once material has been loaded onto a vessel (i.e. passed the ship’s rail). These sales are\nprimarily sold on a letter of credit basis.\nNon-ferrous secondary recycling\nNon‑ferrous secondary recycling comprises the collection, processing and trading of other metal alloys and residues, principally\naluminium, lead, copper, zinc and nickel bearing materials. Revenue for non‑ferrous secondary recycling is recognised when control\npasses and performance obligations are satisfied. According to the specific contract terms, control of the goods will pass to the\ncustomer at the point in time when the goods are loaded in a container, delivered to the customer or cash is received as that is the point\nin time the original bills of lading are passed to the buyer and title is transferred. Contract terms are determined based upon customer,\nproduct and/or destination and are typically sold on a cash in advance, deposit, letter of credit or open credit basis.\nRecycling services\nRecycling services comprises the provision of environmental and data security responsible services for the refurbishment, resale or\ncommodity reclamation of IT assets recycled for commercial and post‑consumer suppliers. For recycling services, service revenue is\nrecognised based upon completion of the agreed performance obligations, including services such as hard disk cleansing and data\ncapture and reporting. These performance obligations are based upon amount collected, processed and/or on a time basis amongst\nother contractual terms. For precious metals reclaimed, revenue is recognised upon completion and agreement of an assay, and when\nprice and quantity can be determined, and acceptance is finalised. Contractual terms can involve a deposit received in advance for\nwhich revenue is deferred until performance obligations are satisfied.\nSecondary processing and other services\nSecondary processing and other services comprise stevedoring and other sources of service based revenue. Other service revenue is\nrecognised based upon completion of the performance obligations in the contract.\nInterest income\nInterest income is recognised as it is earned, using the effective interest method.\nRental income\nRental income consists of rentals from sub‑lease rentals. Rentals received under operating leases and initial direct costs are recognised\non a straight‑line basis over the term of the lease.\nDividend income\nDividends are recognised when the Group’s right to receive the payment is established.\nOther income\n2024 2023\nA$M A$M\nRestated\nNet gain on commodity derivatives – 9.4\nNet gain on currency derivatives 6.1 0.6\nNet gain on disposal of property, plant and equipment 2.1 36.4\nNet gain on revaluation of financial assets at fair value through profit or loss – (1.0)\nGain on sale of assets held for sale 182.6 51.5\nOther 13.8 13.7\nTotal other income from continuing operations 204.6 110.6\nSims Limited Annual Report 2024 70\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\n4 – SIGNIFICANT ITEMS\nSignificant items are those which by their size and nature, incidence or variability from one period to the next are relevant in explaining\nthe financial performance of the Group and as such are disclosed separately.\n2024 2023\nA$M A$M\nGain/(loss) on fair valuation of investment (48.1) 49.2\nGain on sale of assets classified as held for sale 181.7 –\nNon-recurring gains on asset disposals – 36.5\nNon-qualifying hedges¹ 2.1 (18.7)\nTransaction costs (14.7) –\nRestructuring and redundancies (6.1) (13.4)\nClosure costs and other provisions (21.0) (2.2)\nAsset impairments (64.2) (9.9)\nSA Recycling amortisation reversal – 16.8\nAlumisource contingent consideration – (14.5)\nOther non-recurring items – (3.0)\n29.7 40.8\n1 Non‑qualifying hedges include the impact of financial hedges that do not qualify for hedge accounting.\nSignificant item amounts in FY24 include the following:\n• Loss on fair valuation of investment included a revaluation of the residual 12.4% interest held in Circular Services to market value\nfollowing a sales process.\n• Gain on sale of assets classified as held for sale primarily relates to the gain on disposal of Sims' interest in LMS.\n• Non‑qualifying hedges reflect the mark‑to‑market adjustment on commodity hedges held at balance date.\n• Transaction costs were incurred in relation to the Baltimore Scrap Corporation acquisition and the disposal of LMS.\n• The group continued its restructuring and redundancy program to simplify the organisational structure and reduce headcount.\n• Closure costs include restructuring of certain site and lease arrangements.

The\nestimated dividends to be paid, but not recognised as a liability at the end of the reporting period, is approximately $19.3 million.\nDividend franking account\nThe franked components of all dividends paid or declared were franked based on an Australian corporate tax rate of 30%.\nAt 30 June 2024, there was a $2.9 million surplus (2023: $8.3 million surplus) of estimated franking credits. The company expects to\nhave sufficient franking credits available within the FY25 financial year to enable the final dividend for FY24 to be fully franked.\n7 – EARNINGS/(LOSS) PER SHARE\nBasic earnings per share is calculated by dividing net profit/(loss) by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding\nduring the financial year.\nDiluted earnings per share is calculated by dividing net profit by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding after\nadjustments for the effects of all dilutive potential ordinary shares.\nThe weighted average number of shares used for the purposes of calculating basic earnings per share is calculated after deduction of\nthe shares held by the Group's trusts.\n2024 2023\nRestated\nFrom continuing operations:\nBasic earnings/(loss) per share (in A¢) 0.9 101.7\nDiluted earnings/(loss) per share (in A¢) 0.9 99.5\nFrom continuing and discontinued operations:\nBasic earnings/(loss) per share (in A¢) (29.9) 93.7\nDiluted earnings/(loss) per share (in A¢) (29.9) 91.7\nWeighted average number of shares used in the denominator ('000)\nBasic shares 193,199 193,318\nDilutive effect of share-based awards 3,003 4,275\nDiluted shares 196,202 197,593\nSims Limited Annual Report 2024 73\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\nASSETS AND LIABILITIES\n8 – TRADE AND OTHER RECEIVABLES\n2024 2023\nA$M A$M\nTrade receivables 455.9 480.8\nLoss allowance (3.4) (2.0)\nNet trade receivables 452.5 478.8\nOther receivables 113.9 135.0\nTax receivable 50.9 60.0\nPrepayments 34.3 42.4\nTotal current receivables 651.6 716.2\nMovement in loss allowance\nBalance at 1 July 2.0 2.6\nProvision recognised/(written back) during the year 1.4 (0.7)\nForeign exchange differences – 0.1\nBalance at 30 June 3.4 2.0\nDebtors overdue\nDays overdue\n1–30 days 31.6 31.3\n31–60 days 7.3 8.9\nOver 60 days 4.2 14.8\n43.1 55.0\nRecognition and measurement\nTrade and other receivables are initially recognised at fair value, and subsequently measured at amortised cost, net of loss allowance.\nTrade receivables are generally due for settlement within 30 to 60 days following shipment, except in the case of certain ferrous\nshipments made to export destinations, which are generally secured by letters of credit that are collected on negotiated terms but\ngenerally within 10 days of shipment.\nCollectability of trade receivables is reviewed on an ongoing basis. Individual debts that are known to be uncollectible are written‑off by\nreducing the carrying amount directly. A loss allowance account is used based upon the lifetime expected credit loss model as required\nby AASB 9 Financial Instruments. The amount of expected credit losses is updated at each reporting date to reflect changes in credit\nrisk since initial recognition of the respective financial instrument or asset. Refer to the processes described in the credit risk section of\nnote 23 for further information regarding the Group’s approach to ongoing credit monitoring. Expected credit losses on other receivables\nis not considered material.\nWhen a trade receivable for which a loss allowance provision had been recognised becomes uncollectible in a subsequent period, it is\nwritten‑off against the provision for impairment account. Subsequent recoveries of amounts previously written‑off are credited against\nother expenses in profit or loss.\nSims Limited Annual Report 2024 74\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\n9 – INVENTORIES\n2024 2023\nA$M A$M\nRaw materials 84.8 103.3\nFinished goods 469.9 561.9\nStores and spare parts 49.0 42.4\n603.7 707.6\nAs at 30 June 2024, the value of ferrous inventory held by the Group was $216.2 million (2023: $299.9 million).\nThe cost of inventories recognised as an expense during FY24 amounted to $5,298.2 million (2023 (restated): $4,736.1 million).\nLower of cost and market adjustments during the year ended 30 June 2024 and 30 June 2023 were not material.\nRecognition and measurement\nInventories (ferrous and non ferrous metals) are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost is based on first‑in, first‑out or\nweighted average and comprises direct materials, direct labour and an appropriate proportion of variable and fixed overhead\nexpenditures, the latter being allocated on the basis of normal operating capacity. Precious metals are stated at net market value.\nStores and spare parts consist of consumable and maintenance stores and spare parts when they do not meet the definition of property,\nplant and equipment.\nCritical accounting estimates and judgement\nExistence of inventories\nQuantities of inventories are determined using various estimation techniques, including observation, weighing and other industry\nmethods and are subject to periodic physical verification and includes procedures such as zero pile out and peer review stock takes.\nValuation of inventories\nThe Group reviews its inventory at the end of each reporting period to determine if it is properly stated at the lower of cost and net\nrealisable value. Net realisable value is based on estimated future selling prices. Impairment losses may be recognised on inventory if\nmanagement needs to revise its estimates of net realisable value in response to changing market conditions.\nSims Limited Annual Report 2024 75\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\n10 – PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT\nCAPITAL\nLEASEHOLD PLANT & WORK IN\nLAND BUILDINGS IMPROVEMENTS EQUIPMENT PROGRESS TOTAL\nA$M A$M A$M A$M A$M A$M\nAt 30 June 2024\nCost 490.9 485.7 114.5 1,305.5 145.1 2,541.7\nAccumulated depreciation and\nimpairment – (234.2) (65.5) (842.5) – (1,142.2)\nNet book amount 490.9 251.5 49.0 463.0 145.1 1,399.5\nMovement\nBalance at 1 July 476.1 239.4 45.8 439.4 232.7 1,433.4\nAdditions - continuing operations 4.3 8.4 – 3.6 144.5 160.8\nAdditions - discontinued operations – 3.4 2.8 30.1 – 36.3\nDisposals (5.3) – – (1.2) – (6.5)\nAcquisitions (note 24) 29.8 19.4 – 80.1 0.4 129.7\nTransfer 11.5 24.0 34.6 130.5 (200.6) –\nReclassification to intangible assets\n(note 12) – – – – (23.6) (23.6)\nImpairment charges – (0.1) (0.2) (10.2) – (10.5)\nDepreciation expense - continuing\noperations – (26.6) (6.5) (109.1) – (142.2)\nDepreciation expense -\ndiscontinued operations – (1.7) (3.9) (16.1) – (21.7)\nReclass to asset held for sale (23.3) (13.0) (23.8) (79.0) (7.1) (146.2)\nForeign exchange differences (2.2) (1.7) 0.2 (5.1) (1.2) (10.0)\nBalance at 30 June 490.9 251.5 49.0 463.0 145.1 1,399.5\nCAPITAL\nLEASEHOLD PLANT & WORK IN\nLAND BUILDINGS IMPROVEMENTS EQUIPMENT PROGRESS TOTAL\nA$M A$M A$M A$M A$M A$M\nAt 30 June 2023\nCost 476.1 484.8 128.3 1,421.7 232.7 2,743.6\nAccumulated depreciation and – (245.4) (82.5) (982.3) – (1,310.2)\nimpairment\nNet book amount 476.1 239.4 45.8 439.4 232.7 1,433.4\nMovement\nBalance at 1 July 449.8 225.8 36.5 399.9 205.3 1,317.3\nAdditions 29.2 2.0 4.9 21.5 169.3 226.9\nDisposals (8.7) (0.1) – (1.5) – (10.3)\nAcquisitions – 0.5 – 8.3 – 8.8\nReclass to Asset held for Sale (3.2) (0.5) – (2.7) – (6.4)\nTransfers (2.8) 31.8 9.5 99.3 (137.8) –\nImpairment charges – – – (0.9) (9.9) (10.8)\nDepreciation expense - continuing\noperations – (25.2) (4.1) (84.2) – (113.5)\nDepreciation expense -\ndiscontinued operations – (1.1) (3.0) (13.9) – (18.0)\nForeign exchange differences 11.8 6.2 2.0 13.6 5.8 39.4\nBalance at 30 June 476.1 239.4 45.8 439.4 232.7 1,433.4\nSims Limited Annual Report 2024 76\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\n10 – PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT (continued)\nRecognition and measurement\nCarrying value\nProperty, plant and equipment is recorded at historical cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses. Historical cost\nincludes expenditures that are directly attributable to the acquisition and installation of the items.\nDepreciation\nAssets are depreciated on a straight‑line basis over their estimated useful lives. Useful lives are reassessed at the end of each reporting\nperiod and are subject to management judgement. The Group's decarbonisation strategy has been considered and included within the\nassessment of useful lives of assets.\nThe expected useful lives are as follows:\n• Buildings – 25 to 40 years\n• Plant and equipment – 1 to 20 years\n• Leasehold improvements – lesser of life of asset or term of the lease\nProceeds from sale of assets\nThe gross proceeds from sale of assets are recognised at the date that an unconditional contract of sale is exchanged with the\npurchaser and control of the asset is transferred. Gains and losses on disposals are determined by comparing proceeds with the asset’s\ncarrying amounts and recognised in profit or loss.\nCritical accounting estimates and judgement\nImpairment\nThe carrying amounts of the Group’s property, plant and equipment are reviewed for impairment when there is an indication that the\nasset may be impaired. If the asset’s carrying amount is greater than its estimated recoverable amount, then an impairment loss is\nrecognised.

Software\nand other intangible assets include acquired software assets. The Company accounts for SaaS arrangements in which the Company\ncontrols the asset as an identified intangible asset within software and other intangible asset.\nResearch & development (R&D) costs relate to the capitalised costs of the Sims Resource Renewal Pilot Plant which have been\ncapitalised upon the proven feasibility of the design of the Plasma Gasification technology.\nAmortisation\nIntangible assets with finite useful lives are amortised on a straight‑line basis.\nThe expected amoritsation period are as follows:\n• Supplier relationships - one to ten years,\n• Contracts - one to three years, and\n• R&D costs - five years.\nThe estimated useful life and amortisation method are reviewed at the end of each annual reporting period.\nImpairment\nGoodwill and intangible assets that have an indefinite useful life are tested annually for impairment, or more frequently if events or\nchanges in circumstances indicate that they may be impaired. Other definite lived intangible assets are tested for impairment whenever\nevents or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.\nAn impairment loss is recognised for the amount by which the asset’s carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount. The\nrecoverable amount is the higher of an asset’s fair value less costs to sell and value in use. For the purposes of assessing impairment,\nassets are grouped at the cash generating unit (“CGU”) level. CGUs represent the lowest levels for which there are separately\nidentifiable cash inflows, which are largely independent of the cash inflows from other assets or groups of assets. Non‑financial assets,\nother than goodwill, that have previously been impaired are reviewed for possible reversal of the impairment at each reporting period.\nGoodwill has been allocated subsequent to impairments and disposals, for impairment testing purposes, to the CGUs as follows.\n2024 2023\nA$M A$M\nCGU Segment\nAustralia and New Zealand Metal ANZ Metal 61.7 61.9\nNorth America Metal North America Metal¹ 134.4 47.8\nAll other CGUs 1.7 1.6\nTotal 197.8 111.3\n1 During FY24, the Group acquired recycling businesses within the NAM segment which resulted in goodwill of $ 91.4 million and other intangible assets of $58.2\nmillion at the date of acquisition. Refer to note 24 for further information.\nImpairment charges\nThere were no impairment charges recognised in relation to intangible assets in FY24 nor in FY23.\nSims Limited Annual Report 2024 81\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\nCritical accounting estimates and judgement\nDetermination of potential impairment requires an estimation of the recoverable amount of the CGUs to which the goodwill and\nintangible assets with indefinite useful lives are allocated. The recoverable amount of each CGU is determined based on the higher of its\nvalue in use or fair value less costs to sell. These calculations require the use of assumptions such as discount rates, growth rates based\non historical market data, and other assumptions.\nKey assumptions used for goodwill and intangible asset impairment tests\nThe value in use calculations use a five‑year cash flow projection, which is based initially on the budget for the year ended 30 June 2025\n(as approved by the Board) and a four‑year forecast prepared by management. The four‑year forecast is developed using the budget for\nthe year ended 30 June 2025 and applying key assumptions such as long term trading margin, inflation rates, price and volume growth\nassumptions, and costs escalations.\nThese five‑year projections also incorporate management estimates related to the inherent impact of future volatility in volumes,\ncommodity prices and margins drawn from past experience and factor in current and expected future economic conditions. A terminal\nvalue is determined from the final year of cash flow based on application of the Gordon Growth model.\nThe cash flows are discounted using rates that reflect management’s estimate of the time value of money and the risks specific to each\nCGU that are not already reflected in the cash flows. In determining appropriate discount rates for each CGU, consideration has been\ngiven to a weighted average cost of capital of the entity as a whole and adjusted for country and business risk specific to the CGU.\nThe cash flow projections are based on management’s best estimates, with reference to historical results, to determine income,\nexpenses, capital expenditures and cash flows for each CGU. Projected expenditures for the Group's decarbonisation and sustainability\ntargets are also estimated in the cashflow forecasts. Expected future cash flows used to determine the value in use of goodwill are\ninherently uncertain and could materially change over time.\nFor CGUs utilising the value in use calculation to determine the recoverable amount, the key assumptions used for the value in use\ncalculations were as follows:\nDISCOUNT RATE (PRE-TAX) GROWTH RATE\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nCGU % % % %\nNorth America Metal 13.5% 13.0% 2.6% 2.5%\nANZ Metal 14.3% 15.0% 3.2% 2.4%\nOther than as disclosed above, the Group believes that for all other CGUs, any reasonably possible change in the key assumptions\nwould not cause the carrying value of the CGUs to exceed their recoverable amount.\nThe North America Metal CGU has $134.4 million of goodwill and $76.1 million of other intangible assets at 30 June 2024. An\nassessment of the impact of possible changes in key assumptions was performed to assess the recoverability of this CGU at 30 June\n2024. An increase in the discount rate and/or if the CGU fails to achieve an EBIT consistent with forecast assumptions in the coming 12\nmonths, it is likely to result in impairment.\nThe UK Metals Business has been classified as discontinued operations (note 33) and has been assessed on a fair value less cost to\nsell basis.\nSims Limited Annual Report 2024 82\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\n13 – INCOME TAXES\n2024 2023\nA$M A$M\nRestated\nIncome tax expense from continuing operations\nCurrent income tax charge 101.9 48.5\nAdjustment for prior years 2.7 2.7\nDeferred income tax (28.6) 32.6\nIncome tax expense recognised in profit or loss 76.0 83.8\nReconciliation of income tax expense to prima facie income tax expense\nProfit/(loss) before income tax from continuing operations 77.8 280.4\nTax at the standard Australian rate of 30% 23.3 84.1\nEffect of tax rates in other jurisdictions 7.0 (24.7)\nDeferred tax assets not recognised 2.2 12.3\nNon-deductible expenses 10.0 9.3\nTax rate change – (2.7)\nUtilisation of unrecognised deferred tax assets (1.0) (2.7)\nShare of results of joint ventures (1.0) (4.2)\nNon-assessable income (7.5) (0.2)\nShare-based payments 1.8 (1.2)\nState and local taxes 3.7 11.1\nAdjustments for prior years 2.7 2.7\nTax on sale of investment 30.9 –\nOther 3.9 –\nIncome tax expense recognised in profit or loss 76.0 83.8\nIncome tax (benefit)/charge directly to equity\nShare-based payments 1.0 (2.0)\nExchange gain on foreign denominated intercompany loans – 6.4\nTotal income tax (benefit)/charge directly to equity 1.0 4.4\nTax expense relating to items of other comprehensive income\nCash flow hedges 0.5 –\nDefined benefit plans 0.1 (0.1)\nTotal tax expense relating to items of other comprehensive income 0.6 (0.1)\nSims Limited Annual Report 2024 83\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\n13 – INCOME TAXES (continued)\n2024 2023\nA$M A$M\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities\nDeferred tax assets\nThe balance comprises temporary difference attributable to:\n(amounts recognised in profit or loss)\nProvisions and other accruals 37.8 16.4\nEmployee benefits 20.3 19.6\nProperty, plant and equipment 4.1 3.7\nIntangible assets 9.0 8.4\nJoint ventures 12.7 4.5\nTax loss carryforwards and tax credits 44.8 30.9\nLeases 71.4 92.6\nShare-based payments 3.5 6.0\nERP software-other 26.0 28.8\nTotal recognised in profit or loss 229.6 210.9\n(amounts recognised directly in equity)\nDefined benefit plans 0.2 0.3\nShare-based payments 0.3 3.0\nTotal recognised directly in equity 0.5 3.3\nTotal deferred tax assets 230.1 214.2\nMovements\nBalance at 1 July 166.2 243.2\nCharged to income statement 39.7 (15.3)\nCharged directly to equity and other comprehensive income 1.0 1.9\nTransfers to/from deferred tax liabilities 29.7 (69.0)\nForeign exchange differences (6.5) 5.4\nBalance at 30 June 230.1 166.2\nSims Limited Annual Report 2024 84\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\n13 – INCOME TAXES (continued)\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities (continued)\n2024 2023\nA$M A$M\nDeferred tax liabilities\nThe balance comprises temporary differences attributable to:\n(amounts recognised in profit or loss)\nIntangible assets 2.0 1.9\nLeases 66.9 89.3\nProperty, plant and equipment 106.7 88.4\nInventory and consumables 4.8 3.5\nJoint ventures – 6.3\nShare-based payments – –\nEmployee benefits 0.1 0.8\nOther 2.2 2.4\nTotal recognised in profit or loss 182.7 192.6\n(amounts recognised directly in equity)\nDefined benefit plans 0.1 (0.1)\nExchange gain on foreign denominated intercompany loans 32.6 32.0\nTotal recognised directly in equity 32.7 31.9\nTotal deferred tax liabilities 215.4 224.5\nMovements\nBalance at 1 July 176.5 225.6\nCharged to income statement 14.5 2.2\nCharged directly to equity and other comprehensive income 0.6 6.3\nTransfers to/from deferred tax assets 29.7 (73.9)\nForeign exchange differences (5.9) 16.3\nBalance at 30 June 215.4 176.5\nDeferred tax balances recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position\nDeferred tax asset 181.9 145.7\nDeferred tax liability 167.2 156.0\n14.7 (10.3)\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets and liabilities and when\nthe deferred tax balances relate to the same taxation authority. Current tax assets and tax liabilities are offset where the entity has a\nlegally enforceable right to offset and intends either to settle on a net basis, or to realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously\nSims Limited Annual Report 2024 85\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\nRecognition and measurement\nCurrent tax\nThe income tax expense or benefit for the period is the tax payable on the current period taxable income using tax rates enacted or\nsubstantively enacted at the reporting date and any adjustment to tax payable in respect to prior years.\nDeferred tax\nDeferred income tax is provided in full, using the liability method, on temporary differences arising between the carrying amounts of\nassets and liabilities and the corresponding tax base. Deferred income tax is determined using tax rates (and laws) that have been\nenacted or substantially enacted by the end of the reporting period and are expected to apply when the related deferred income tax\nasset is realised or the deferred income tax liability is settled.\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are not recognised for temporary differences between the carrying amount and tax bases of\ninvestments in controlled entities where the Company is able to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences and it is\nprobable that the differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets and liabilities and when\nthe deferred tax balances relate to the same taxation authority. Current tax assets and tax liabilities are offset where the entity has a\nlegally enforceable right to offset and intends either to settle on a net basis, or to realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.\nCurrent and deferred tax is recognised in profit or loss, except to the extent that it relates to items recognised in other comprehensive\nincome or directly in equity. In this case, the tax is also recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity, respectively.\nAs of each reporting date, management considers new evidence, both positive and negative, that could affect its view of the future\nrealisation of deferred tax assets. The net deferred tax assets are all reviewed for realisability each reporting period. In preparing the\nanalysis to determine if there is certainty in future profitability to utilise the deferred assets, in order to be consistent and conservative,\nthe future profitability projected in the goodwill impairment models has been used to determine the recognition of the net deferred tax\nassets. At 30 June 2024 , certain entities utilised deferred tax assets that were not recognised during the year resulting in a tax benefit\nfor the period of $1.0 million. There were also deferred tax balances not recognised during the year due to uncertainty of future\nrealisability resulting in tax expense of $2.2 million.\nAt 30 June 2024, the Group has not recognised deferred tax assets totalling $106.6 million (2023: $88.5 million) as it is not probable that\nthey will be realised. Of the $106.6 million of unrecognised deferred tax assets, $62.6 million (including $49.4 million of losses) relate to\nassets held for sale in the UK. A portion of the unrecognised deferred tax asset relates to unused tax losses of $93.0 million (2023: $69.1\nmillion) due to either a history of tax losses or it is not considered probable that there will be sufficient future taxable profits to realise the\nbenefit of deferred tax assets within certain subsidiary entities. Unrecognised tax losses include $6.2 million (2023: $6.7 million) of tax\nlosses that will expire in five to 20 years. Other unused tax losses (2024: $86.8 million) may be carried forward indefinitely.\nThe Company is within the scope of the OECD Pillar Two model rules. Pillar two legislation has been drafted in Australia (effective 1\nJanuary 2024) and the UK enacted legislation effective for accounting periods after 31 December 2023. Under the legislation, the\nCompany is liable to pay a top-up tax for the difference between its GloBE effective tax rate per jurisdiction and the 15% minimum rate.\nThe Company has performed modelling with the FY2023 information, and all of the entities are expected to meet the safe harbour\nthresholds. The Company is currently engaged with specialists to assist with the FY2024 data and proper implementation of future\nreporting.\nInternational parented groups with at least one company based in the UK with a consolidated group revenue of EUR 750 million or more\nare required to submit a Country-by-Country Report (CbCR) beginning with FY2024. The deadline is 30 June 2025 for the FY2024\nreporting year. For the first year, the Company has engaged tax specialists to assist in filing these reports in the UK for FY2024.\nTax consolidation legislation\nThe Company and its wholly owned Australian controlled entities implemented tax consolidation legislation as of 31 October 2005. The\nCompany is the head entity of the tax consolidated group. Members of the tax consolidated group have entered into a tax sharing and\nfunding agreement that provides for the allocation of income tax liabilities between entities should the head entity default on its tax\npayment obligations. No amounts have been recognised in the consolidated financial statements in respect of this agreement on the\nbasis that the probability of default is remote.\nCritical accounting estimate and judgement\nDeferred tax\nDeferred tax assets are recognised for deductible temporary differences and unused tax losses only if it is probable that future taxable\namounts will be available to utilise those temporary differences and losses. Judgement is required to determine the amount of deferred\ntax assets that can be recognised, based upon the likely timing and the level of probable future taxable profits.\nSims Limited Annual Report 2024 86\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\n14 – TRADE AND OTHER PAYABLES\n2024 2023\nA$M A$M\nCurrent:\nTrade payables 363.9 471.2\nOther payables 265.3 305.3\nDeferred income 111.1 61.6\n740.3 838.1\nNon-current:\nOther payables 7.9 21.4\nRecognition and measurement\nTrade and other payable amounts represent liabilities for goods and services provided to the Group prior to the end of a financial year,\nwhich are unpaid.\nMovements in deferred income during the fiscal year relate to revenue recognised upon the satisfaction of performance obligations.\nDeferred income of $61.6 million at 30 June 2023 was earned during FY24 and $111.1 million at 30 June 2024 relates to performance\nobligations outstanding at the end of the year.\n15 – PROVISIONS\n2024 2023\nA$M A$M\nCurrent Non-current Total Current Non-current Total\nEmployee benefits 68.0 22.9 90.9 50.8 19.8 70.6\nSelf-insured risks 27.5 – 27.5 10.5 17.8 28.3\nOnerous provisions – – – 0.7 1.1 1.8\nLegal provisions 0.6 – 0.6 0.8 – 0.8\nProperty make-good 13.1 2.6 15.7 20.3 14.7 35.0\nOther provisions 13.7 – 13.7 56.9 – 56.9\n122.9 25.5 148.4 140.0 53.4 193.4\nMovements in each class of provision during the year ended 30 June 2024, other than employee benefits, are set out below:\nSELF ONEROUS LEGAL PROPERTY OTHER\nINSURANCE PROVISIONS A$M MAKE-GOOD PROVISIONS¹\nRISKS A$M A$M A$M\nA$M\nBalance at 1 July 2023 28.3 1.8 0.8 35.0 56.9\nProvisions recognised/(derecognised) (0.8) 3.0 – 10.5 13.4\nPayments – – (0.2) (2.9) (57.6)\nReclassified as liabilities directly associated with\nassets held for sale – (4.8) – (27.1) –\nForeign exchange differences – – – 0.2 1.0\nBalance at 30 June 2024 27.5 – 0.6 15.7 13.7\n1 Other provisions includes contingent consideration attributed to the Alumisource acquisition which was paid in FY24.\nSims Limited Annual Report 2024 87\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\nRecognition and measurement\nProvisions are recognised when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of past events, it is probable that an\noutflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation and the amount can be reliably estimated. Probability requires a degree of\nmanagement judgement. Other than for loss contracts, provisions are not recognised for future operating losses.\nEmployee benefits\nProvisions are made for benefits accruing to employees in respect of wages and salaries, annual leave, long service leave and other\nemployee obligations. Provisions made in respect of employee benefits expected to be settled within 12 months are measured at their\nnominal values using the remuneration rate expected to apply at the time of settlement.\nSelf-insurance\nCertain of the Group’s subsidiaries are self‑insured for property, health, workers’ compensation and general liability claims. Provisions\nare recognised based on claims reported, and an estimate of claims incurred but not reported.

As a\nconsequence, the Group has incurred, and will continue to incur, environmental costs and liabilities associated with site and facility\noperation, closure, remediation, monitoring and licensing.\nProvisions have been made in respect of estimated environmental liabilities where obligations are known to exist and can be reasonably\nmeasured. However, additional liabilities may emerge due to a number of factors, including changes in environmental laws and\nregulations in each of the jurisdictions in which the Group operates or has operated. The Group cannot predict the extent to which it may\nbe impacted in the future by any such changes in legislation or regulation.\nLegal claims\nVarious Group companies are parties to legal actions and claims that arise in the ordinary course of their business. While the outcome of\nsuch legal proceedings cannot be readily foreseen, the Group believes that they will be resolved without material effect on its financial\nstatements. Provision has been made for known obligations where the existence of the liability is probable and can be reasonably\nestimated and there are no contingent obligations the Group are aware of.\nOther provisions\nOther provisions include contingent obligations resulting from acquisition‑related contractual arrangements. A provision is made when a\nGroup company has a subsequent legal or constructive obligation, and it is probable that an outflow of resources will be required to\nsettle the obligation based on the contractual terms. Subsequent to a fair value purchase accounting assessment, any remeasurement\nof the contingent consideration will be recognised in profit or loss.\nSims Limited Annual Report 2024 88\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\n16 – RETIREMENT BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS\nThe Group operates a number of pension plans for the benefit of its employees throughout the world. The Group’s pension plans are\nprovided through either defined contribution or defined benefit plans.\nDefined contribution plans\nDefined contribution plans offer employees individual funds that are converted into benefits at the time of retirement. The defined\ncontribution plans receive fixed contributions from Group companies with the Group’s legal obligation limited to these contributions.

The amount of credit available is\nsubject to limits from loan covenants as specified in the loan facilities.\nIn November 2023, the Group renewed its loans facilities on substantially the same terms and conditions as had previously existed. This\nrenewal extended the maturity dates of the Group’s borrowing facilities by an additional two years to 31 October 2026.\nThe group incurred $60.2 million of finance costs, excluding lease interest, during the year ended 30 June 2024, mainly comprised of\ninterest on external borrowings and commitment fees on the Group’s loan facilities (2023: $25.2 million).\nThere have been no breaches of the Group’s bank covenants during the period.\nSims Limited Annual Report 2024 94\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\nRecognition and measurement\nBorrowings are initially recognised at fair value, net of transaction costs incurred. Borrowings are subsequently measured at amortised\ncost. Any difference between the proceeds, net of transaction costs, and the redemption amount is recognised in profit or loss over the\nperiod of the borrowings, using the effective interest method.\nBorrowings are removed from the statement of financial position when the obligation specified in the contract is discharged, cancelled or\nexpired. The difference between the carrying amount of a financial liability that has been extinguished or transferred to another party and\nthe consideration paid, including any non‑cash assets transferred or liabilities assumed, is recognised in profit or loss as other income or\nfinance costs.\nBorrowings are classified as current liabilities unless the Group has the unconditional right to defer settlement of the liability for at least\n12 months after the reporting period.\n21 – CONTRIBUTED EQUITY\n2024 2023\nNUMBER NUMBER\nOF SHARES A$M OF SHARES A$M\nOn issue per share register at the beginning of the period 193,181,520 2,597.1 194,114,369 2,611.7\nShare buy-back – – (977,546) (14.6)\nIssued under long-term incentive plans 28,147 – 44,697 –\nOn issue per share register at the end of the period 193,209,667 2,597.1 193,181,520 2,597.1\nLess: Treasury shares held at the end of the period (251,100) (3.8) (1,395,087) (21.5)\nTotal contributed equity 192,958,567 2,593.3 191,786,433 2,575.6\nHolders of ordinary shares are entitled to receive dividends as declared and are entitled to one vote per share at shareholders’ meetings.\nWith effect from 1 January 2020, the Company has allowed participants of its long‑term incentive plan (“LTIP”) to withhold shares to\nsatisfy applicable tax withholding and exercise costs under the LTIP.\nShare buy-back\nThe number and timing of shares purchased will depend on the Company’s share price and market conditions. All ordinary shares\npurchased pursuant to the share buy‑ back program will be cancelled. During FY24, the Company did not purchase ordinary shares for\nunder its current buy‑back program.\nEmployee share ownership programme trusts (\"treasury shares\")\nDuring August 2019, the Company established two separate employee share ownership programme trusts for the benefit of all\nlong‑term incentive plan eligible employees of the Company.

The trusts held 251,100 shares\nat 30 June 2024 (2023: 1,395,087 shares).\nOrdinary shares are classified as equity. Incremental costs directly attributable to the issuance of new shares are shown in equity as a\ndeduction, net of tax, from the proceeds. When the Company purchases any of its own equity instruments, for example, as a result of a\nshare buy‑back, the consideration paid, including any directly attributable incremental costs (net of income taxes), is deducted from\ncontributed equity.\nSims Limited Annual Report 2024 95\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\n22 – RESERVES AND ACCUMULATED DEFICIT\nReserves\nFOREIGN\nSHARE BASED CURRENCY\nPAYMENTS TRANSLATION TOTAL\nA$M A$M A$M\nBalance at 1 July 2022 282.0 43.7 325.7\nEquity-settled share-based payment expense 17.0 – 17.0\nGain reclassified to profit or loss on disposal of foreign operations – (1.2) (1.2)\nForeign currency translation differences – 93.0 93.0\nDeferred tax 2.0 (6.4) (4.4)\nBalance at 1 July 2023 301.0 129.1 430.1\nEquity-settled share-based payment expense 19.5 – 19.5\nGain reclassified to profit or loss on disposal of foreign operations – (2.6) (2.6)\nForeign currency translation differences – 2.5 2.5\nDeferred tax (1.0) (0.5) (1.5)\nBalance at 1 July 2024 319.5 128.5 448.0\nNature and purpose of reserves\nShare-based payments reserve\nThe share‑based payments reserve is used to recognise the fair value of share‑based awards issued to employees.\nForeign currency translation reserve\nExchange differences arising on translation of foreign operations are recognised in other comprehensive income and accumulated in a\nseparate reserve within equity.

The Group’s overall financial risk management strategy seeks to\nmitigate these risks to minimise potential adverse effects on the financial performance of the Group.\nRisk management is carried out by a limited number of employees as authorised by the Board. The Board provides written principles for\noverall risk management, as well as written policies covering specific areas, such as foreign exchange risk, interest rate risk, credit risk,\nuse of derivative financial instruments and non‑derivative financial instruments and the investment of excess liquidity.\nThe Risk Committee (“RC”) of the Board oversees the monitoring of compliance by management with the Group’s risk management\nframework. The RC is assisted in its oversight role by Internal Audit which undertakes reviews of key management controls and\nprocedures.\nThe Group uses derivative financial instruments in certain circumstances in accordance with Board approved policies to hedge\nexposure to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates and commodity prices. Derivative financial instruments are used for hedging\npurposes and not as trading or other speculative instruments.\nCapital risk management\nThe primary objective of managing the Group’s capital is to ensure that there is sufficient capital available to support the funding\nrequirements of the Group, including capital expenditure, in a way that optimises the cost of capital, maximises shareholders’ returns\nand ensures that the Group remains in a sound financial position. In order to manage the capital structure, the Group may periodically\nadjust dividend policy, return capital to shareholders, issue new shares or sell assets to reduce debt.\nThe Group monitors its capital structure primarily using the gearing ratio. This ratio is calculated as net debt divided by total capital. Net\ndebt is calculated as total borrowings less cash and cash equivalents. Total capital is calculated as total equity as shown in the\nstatement of financial position plus net debt. As at 30 June 2024, the Group had a net cash position of $(411.9) million (2023: $(135.5)\nmillion).\nMarket risk\nMarket risk is the risk that changes in market prices, such as commodity prices, foreign exchange rates and interest rates, will affect the\nGroup’s net profit or the value of its holdings of financial instruments.\n(i) Foreign exchange risk\nThe Group operates internationally and is exposed to foreign exchange risk, primarily with respect to transactions settled in US dollars\nand Euro. The exposure of an entity to transaction risk is minimised by matching local currency income with local currency costs.\nThe Group enters into forward foreign exchange contracts to hedge sales or purchase commitments denominated in currencies that are\nnot the functional currency of the relevant entity. These contracts are typically entered for a period of three to six months based on when\nthe transaction is expected to settle.\nThe Group’s net financial assets/(liabilities) exposure to foreign exchange risk at the end of the reporting period, expressed in Australian\ndollars, was as follows:\n2024 2023\nA$M A$M\nCurrency\nUS dollar (116.2) 86.3\nEuro 127.9 143.7\nBritish pounds sterling (2.6) 23.5\nSims Limited Annual Report 2024 97\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\nThe table below shows the net impact of a 10% appreciation of the relevant currency against the Australian dollar for the balances above\nwith all other variables held constant and the corresponding effect on the Group’s forward foreign exchange contracts with all other\nvariables held constant.\nImpact on post-tax profit – (lower)\n2024 2023\nA$M A$M\nCurrency\nUS dollar (30.6) (17.5)\nEuro 10.2 7.0\nBritish pounds sterling 12.0 (1.1)\nImpact on equity – higher\n2024 2023\nA$M A$M\nCurrency\nUS dollar 43.3 43.3\nThe impact on equity includes the effect from intragroup long‑term borrowings which, in substance, form part of the Group’s investment\nin an entity. Exchange gains and losses on these balances are recorded in the foreign currency translation reserve.\nA 10% depreciation of the relevant currency against the Australian dollar would have an equal and opposite effect.\n(ii) Commodity price risk\nThe Group is exposed to risks associated with fluctuations in the market price for ferrous and non‑ferrous metals and precious metals,\nwhich are at times volatile. The Group seeks to mitigate commodity price risk by seeking to turn over its inventories quickly, instead of\nholding inventories in anticipation of higher commodity prices.\nThe Group uses forward commodity contracts matched to purchases or sales of non‑ferrous metals (primarily copper, nickel and\naluminium) and certain precious metals (primarily gold, silver and palladium) where viable forward commodity contracts are available to\nminimise price risk exposure. The hedges undertaken aim to protect margins and provide downside protection of the underlying value of\non‑site finished goods inventories and unpriced in‑transit sales.\nAt the end of the reporting period, none of the Group’s forward commodity contracts qualified for hedge accounting, despite being valid\neconomic hedges of the relevant risk. Accordingly, any movement in commodity rates that impact the fair value of these forward\ncommodity contracts are recorded in profit or loss. Note 17 shows the carrying amount of the Group’s forward commodity contracts at\nthe end of the reporting period.\nA 10% appreciation in commodity prices on outstanding forward commodity contracts, with all other variables held constant, would\nresult in lower net profit of $24.3 million during FY24 (2023: $13.1 million). A 10% depreciation of the stated commodity prices would\nhave an equal and opposite effect.\n(iii) Interest rate risk\nThe Group is exposed to interest rate risk as entities borrow funds at variable interest rates. The Group does not use any derivative\nfinancial instruments to manage its exposure to interest rate risk. Cash deposits, loans to third parties and borrowings issued at fixed\nrates expose the Group to fair value interest rate risk. The interest rate risk for interest‑bearing liabilities is immaterial in terms of possible\nimpact on profit or loss.\nSims Limited Annual Report 2024 98\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\nCredit risk\nCredit risk is the risk of financial loss if a counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet its contractual obligations, and arises\nprincipally from the Group’s receivables from customers. The carrying amount of financial assets represents the maximum credit\nexposure.\nThe Group establishes credit limits for its customers. Trade and other receivables consist of a large number of customers, spread across\nvarious metal producing sectors in international markets. Ongoing credit evaluation is performed on the financial condition of the\nGroup’s customers and, where appropriate, a loss allowance is raised. For certain customers, the Group purchases credit insurance to\nprotect itself against collection risks.\nThe Group is also exposed to credit risk arising from the Group’s transactions in derivative contracts. For credit purposes, there is only a\ncredit risk where the counterparty is liable to pay the Group in the event of a closeout.\nThe Group has policies that limit the amount of credit exposure to any financial institution. Derivative counterparties and cash\ntransactions are limited to financial institutions that typically have a minimum credit rating of “A” by either Standard & Poor’s or Moody’s,\nunless otherwise approved by the Board. Management also monitors the current credit exposure with each counterparty. Any changes\nto counterparties or their credit limits must be approved by the Group Chief Financial Officer.\nLiquidity risk\nLiquidity risk is associated with ensuring that there is sufficient cash and cash equivalents on hand and the availability of funding through\nan adequate amount of committed credit facilities to meet the Group’s obligations as they mature and the ability to close out market\npositions.\nThe Group manages liquidity risk by monitoring forecast and actual cash flows and matching the maturity profiles of financial assets and\nliabilities. Due to the dynamic and volatile nature of the underlying businesses, the Group aims at maintaining flexibility in funding by\nkeeping committed credit lines available with a variety of counterparties. Included in note 19 is a summary of undrawn facilities that the\nGroup can draw upon if required.\nThe contractual cash flows of the Group’s financial liabilities are shown in the table below. The contractual amounts represent the future\nundiscounted cash flows. The amounts for interest bearing liabilities also include interest cash flows and therefore, do not equate to the\ncarrying amount. The expected timing of cash outflows are set out below:\nLESS THAN BETWEEN OVER\n1 YEAR 1 AND 5 YEARS 5 YEARS TOTAL\nA$M A$M A$M A$M\n2024\nNon-derivatives:\nTrade and other payables 740.1 7.2 0.7 748.0\nBorrowings – 505.0 – 505.0\nDerivatives:\nOther financial liabilities 166.6 – – 166.6\nNet settled (forward commodity contracts) 2.5 – – 2.5\nGross settled (forward foreign exchange contracts):\n– (inflows) 334.0 – – 334.0\n– outflows (335.7) – – (335.7)\n907.5 512.2 0.7 1,420.4\nInterest on financial commitments 37.0 37.0 12.5 86.5\nFinancial guarantees¹ 38.9 – – 38.9\n983.4 549.2 13.2 1,545.8\nSims Limited Annual Report 2024 99\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\nLESS THAN BETWEEN OVER\n1 YEAR 1 AND 5 YEARS 5 YEARS TOTAL\nA$M A$M A$M A$M\n2023\nNon-derivatives:\nTrade and other payables 838.1 16.7 4.7 859.5\nBorrowings – 444.2 – 444.2\nDerivatives:\nNet settled (forward commodity contracts) – – – –\nGross settled (forward foreign exchange contracts): –\n– (inflows) (157.8) – – (157.8)\n– outflows 159.3 – – 159.3\n839.6 460.9 4.7 1,305.2\nInterest on financial commitments 26.4 8.9 – 35.3\nFinancial guarantees 44.3 – – 44.3\n910.3 469.8 4.7 1,384.8\n1 Refer to note 30 for details on financial guarantees. The amounts disclosed above are the maximum amounts allocated to the earliest period in which the\nguarantee could be called. However, the Group considers that it is more likely than not that such an amount will not be payable under the arrangement.\nPut option\nA subsidiary of the Group holds a 50% share in the SA Recycling, LLC Joint Venture (“SAR”). The remaining 50% of SAR is owned by\nthe Adams family through Adams Steel LLC (“Adams Steel”). Under the terms of the SAR Operating Agreement dated 1 September\n2007, as subsequently amended, Adams Steel holds an option which gives Adams Steel the right to compel the Group’s subsidiary to\npurchase some or all of its interest on a cash free/debt free basis, using a 4.5 multiple of the average annual EBITDA for the prior three\nfiscal years. Sims’ assessment is that this formula would result in an exercise price that would be considered equal to the fair value of\n50% of SAR. As such, the derivative does not have a material value to be accounted for. The purchase of some or all of the interest\nunder the option is to be settled in cash within twelve months of the option being exercised. The option has no expiry date and has no\nimpact on the current control of SAR. The Group considers that sufficient financing options are available should the put option be\nexercised.\nFair value\nThe carrying amounts and estimated fair values of the Group’s financial assets and liabilities are materially the same.\nThe fair value of financial instruments traded on active markets (such as publicly traded derivatives and investments in marketable\nsecurities) is based on quoted market prices at the reporting date. These instruments are included in level 1.\nThe fair value of financial instruments that are not traded in an active market (such as forward foreign exchange contracts) is determined\nusing readily observable broker quotes. These instruments are included in level 2.\nThere were no transfers between levels during the year.\nValuation of financial assets and liabilities\nFinancial instruments carried at fair value are classified by valuation method using the following hierarchy:\n• Level 1 – quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities;\n• Level 2 – inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (as prices)\nor indirectly (derived from prices); and\n• Level 3 – inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs).\nSims Limited Annual Report 2024 100\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\nRecognition and measurement\nDerivatives are initially recognised at fair value on the date a derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently remeasured to their\nfair value at each reporting date. The resulting gain or loss is recognised in profit or loss immediately unless the derivative is designated\nand effective as a hedging instrument, in which event the timing of the recognition in profit or loss depends on the nature of the hedge\nrelationship.\nCertain derivative instruments do not qualify for hedge accounting, despite being valid economic hedges of the relevant risks. Changes\nin the fair value of any derivative instrument that does not qualify for hedge accounting are recognised immediately in profit or loss and\nare included in other income or other expenses. Refer to note 4 for the impact of hedge gains or losses for non‑qualified hedges.\nSims Limited Annual Report 2024 101\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\nGROUP STRUCTURE\n24 – BUSINESS ACQUISITIONS AND DISPOSALS\nAcquisitions\n(a) Baltimore Scrap Corporation\nOn 15 August 2023, the Group announced that it had agreed to acquire the operations of US based metal recycler, Baltimore Scrap\nCorporation (\"BSC\"), within the NAM segment, for total consideration of $347.3million (US$220.0 million).

The impact of the revision to\noriginal estimates, if any, is recognised in profit or loss with a corresponding adjustment to equity.\nFor cash‑settled share‑based arrangements, the fair value of the amount payable is recognised as an employee benefit expense with a\ncorresponding increase to a liability. The liability is re‑measured each reporting date and at settlement date. Any changes in the fair\nvalue of the liability are recognised as an employee benefit expense in profit or loss.\nThe fair value of options and performance rights at grant date is independently determined using either a binomial model or a\nMonte‑Carlo simulation model which takes into account any market related performance conditions. Non‑market vesting conditions are\nnot considered when determining fair value, but rather are included in the assumptions about the number of rights that are expected to\nvest. The fair value of restricted share units is determined based on the market price of the Company’s shares on the date of grant and\nthe Company’s dividend yield.\n29 – KEY MANAGEMENT PERSONNEL\nTotal remuneration paid or payable to Directors and key management personnel (“KMP”) is set out below:\n2024 2023\nA$ A$\nShort-term benefits 8,644,218 10,472,987\nLong-term benefits 97,290 85,708\nPost-employment benefits 561,921 470,419\nShare-based payments 6,236,426 5,235,586\n15,539,855 16,264,700\nOther than the disclosures in note 17, 25, 26 and 29, there were no other transactions with related parties for the year ended 30 June\n2024 and 2023.\nSims Limited Annual Report 2024 114\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\n30 – COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES\n2024 2023\nCOMMTMENTS A$M A$M\nLease Commitments\nNot later than one year 2.3 1.7\nLater than one year, but not later than five years – 2.3\nLater than five years – –\nTotal lease commitments not recognised as liabilities 2.3 4.0\n2024 2023\nA$M A$M\nCapital expenditures\nPayable within one year 12.3 28.0\nLater than one year, but not later than five years – 0.1\nLater than five years – –\nTotal capital expenditure commitments not recognised as liabilities 12.3 28.1\nThe commitments included above also include the Group’s share relating to joint ventures.\nGuarantees\nThe Group has given guarantees in respect of the performance of contracts entered into in the ordinary course of business.

The determination of tax residency involves judgement as the\ndetermination of tax residency is highly fact dependent and there are currently several different interpretations that could be adopted, and which could give rise to a different conclusion on residency.\nIn determining tax residency, the consolidated entity has applied the following interpretations:\n• Australian Tax residency: the consolidated entity has applied current legislation and judicial precedent, inducing having regard to the Commissioners of Taxation's public guidance in Tax\nRuling TR 2018/5.\n• Foreign tax residency: The consolidated entity has applied current legislation and where available judicial precedent in the determination of the foreign tax residency. where necessary, the\nconsolidated entity has used independent tax advisers in foreign jurisdictions to assist in its determination of tax residency to ensure applicable foreign tax;legislation has been complied with.\nPartnerships and Trusts\nAustralian tax law does not contain specific residency tests for partnerships and trusts. Generally, these entities are taxed on a flow through basis so there is no need for a general residency test. there are\nsome provisions which treat trusts as residents for certain purposes, but this does not mean the trust itself is an entity that is subject to tax.\nSims Limited Annual Report 2024 123\nDIRECTORS' DECLARATION\nIn the Directors’ opinion:\n(i) The financial statements and notes set out on pages 59 to 118 are in accordance with the Corporations Act 2001, including:\n◦ complying with Accounting Standards, the Corporations Regulations 2001 and other mandatory professional\nreporting requirements, and\n◦ giving a true and fair view of the consolidated entity’s financial position as at 30 June 2024 and of its performance for\nthe financial year ended on that date, and\n(ii) there are reasonable grounds to believe that Sims Limited will be able to pay its debts as and when they become due and payable,\n(iii)at the date of this declaration, there are reasonable grounds to believe that the members of the Extended Closed Group identified in\nnote 25 will be able to meet any obligations or liabilities to which they are, or may become, subject by virtue of the Deed of Cross\nGuarantee described in note 25, and\n(iv)the Consolidated entity disclosure statement set on our pages 119 and 123 required by subsection (3A) is true and correct.\nNote 1 confirms that the financial statements also comply with International Financial Reporting Standards as issued by the\nInternational Accounting Standards Board.\nThe Directors have been given the declarations by the Group Chief Executive Officer and the Group Chief Financial Officer required by\nsection 295A of the Corporations Act 2001.\nThe declaration is made in accordance with a resolution of the directors.\nP Bainbridge S Mikkelsen\nChairperson Managing Director and Group CEO\nNew South Wales New South Wales\n20 August 2024 20 August 2024\nSims Limited Annual Report 2024 124\nDeloitte Touche Tohmatsu\nABN 74 490 121 060\nQuay Quarter Tower\n50 Bridge Street\nSydney NSW 2000\nAustralia\nTel: +61 2 9322 7000\nwww.deloitte.com.au\nIndependent Auditor’s Report to the Members of Sims Limited\nReport on the Audit of the Financial Report\nOpinion\nWe have audited the financial report of Sims Limited (the “Company”) and its subsidiaries (the “Group”) which\ncomprises the consolidated statement of financial position as at 30 June 2024, the consolidated statement of\nprofit or loss, the consolidated statement of comprehensive income, the consolidated statement of changes in\nequity and the consolidated statement of cash flows for the year then ended, and notes to the financial\nstatements, including material accounting policy information and other explanatory information, the directors’\ndeclaration and the Consolidated Entity Disclosure Statement.\nIn our opinion, the accompanying financial report of the Group is in accordance with the Corporations Act 2001,\nincluding:\n• Giving a true and fair view of the Group’s financial position as at 30 June 2024 and of its financial performance\nfor the year then ended; and\n• Complying with Australian Accounting Standards and the Corporations Regulations 2001.\nBasis for Opinion\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with Australian Auditing Standards. Our responsibilities under those\nstandards are further described in the Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Report section of\nour report. We are independent of the Group in accordance with the auditor independence requirements of the\nCorporations Act 2001 and the ethical requirements of the Accounting Professional & Ethical Standards Board’s\nAPES 110 Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants (including Independence Standards) (the Code) that are\nrelevant to our audit of the financial report in Australia. We have also fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in\naccordance with the Code.\nWe confirm that the independence declaration required by the Corporations Act 2001, which has been given to\nthe directors of the Company, would be in the same terms if given to the directors as at the time of this auditor’s\nreport.\nWe believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our\nopinion.\nKey Audit Matters\nKey audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgement, were of most significance in our audit of\nthe financial report for the current period.

The other information comprises the Directors’ Report,\nwhich we obtained prior to the date of this auditor’s report, and also includes the following information which will\nbe included in the Group’s annual report (but does not include the financial report and our auditor’s report\nthereon): Chairman’s Review, CEO’s Review, Operational and Financial Review, Other Information and Shareholder\nInformation, which is expected to be made available to us after that date.\nOur opinion on the financial report does not cover the other information and we do not and will not express any\nform of assurance conclusion thereon.\nIn connection with our audit of the financial report, our responsibility is to read the other information identified\nabove and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial report\nor our knowledge obtained in the audit, or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If, based on the work we\nhave performed on the other information that we obtained prior to the date of this auditor’s report, we conclude\nthat there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact. We have\nnothing to report in this regard.\n126\nWhen we read the Chairman’s Review, CEO’s Review, Operational and Financial Review, Other Information and\nShareholder Information, if we conclude that there is a material misstatement therein, we are required to\ncommunicate the matter to the directors and use our professional judgement to determine the appropriate\naction.\nResponsibilities of the Directors for the Financial Report\nThe directors of the Company are responsible for the preparation of the financial report that gives a true and fair\nview in accordance with Australian Accounting Standards and the Corporations Act 2001 and for such internal\ncontrol as the directors determine is necessary to enable the preparation of the financial report that gives a true\nand fair view and is free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\nIn preparing the financial report, the directors are responsible for assessing the ability of the Group to continue as\na going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of\naccounting unless the directors either intend to liquidate the Group or to cease operations, or has no realistic\nalternative but to do so.\nAuditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Report\nOur objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial report as a whole is free from\nmaterial misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion.\nReasonable assurance is a high level of assurance but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance\nwith the Australian Auditing Standards will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements\ncan arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably\nbe expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of this financial report.\nAs part of an audit in accordance with the Australian Auditing Standards, we exercise professional judgement and\nmaintain professional scepticism throughout the audit. We also:\n• Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial report, whether due to fraud or error,\ndesign and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient\nand appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting\nfrom fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional\nomissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.\n• Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are\nappropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of\nthe Group’s internal control.\n• Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and\nrelated disclosures made by the directors.\n• Conclude on the appropriateness of the directors’ use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on\nthe audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may\ncast significant doubt on the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material\nuncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the\nfinancial report or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on\nthe audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor’s report. However, future events or conditions may\ncause the Group to cease to continue as a going concern.\n• Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial report, including the disclosures, and\nwhether the financial report represents the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair\npresentation.\n• Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business\nactivities within the Group to express an opinion on the financial report. We are responsible for the direction,\nsupervision and performance of the Group’s audit. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion.\n127\nWe communicate with the directors regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit\nand significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our\naudit.\nWe also provide the directors with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements\nregarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably\nbe thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, actions taken to eliminate threats or safeguards\napplied.\nFrom the matters communicated with the directors, we determine those matters that were of most significance\nin the audit of the financial report of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe\nthese matters in our auditor’s report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or\nwhen, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should not be communicated in our report\nbecause the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest\nbenefits of such communication.\nReport on the Remuneration Report\nOpinion on the Remuneration Report\nWe have audited the Remuneration Report included in pages 26 to 57 of the Directors’ Report for the year ended\n30 June 2024.\nIn our opinion, the Remuneration Report of Sims Limited, for the year ended 30 June 2024, complies with section\n300A of the Corporations Act 2001.\nResponsibilities\nThe directors of the Company are responsible for the preparation and presentation of the Remuneration Report\nin accordance with section 300A of the Corporations Act 2001. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the\nRemuneration Report, based on our audit conducted in accordance with Australian Auditing Standards.\nDELOITTE TOUCHE TOHMATSU\nSamuel Vorwerg\nPartner\nChartered Accountants\nSydney, 20 August 2024\n128"

likely to continue, requiring further cost reduction strategies to mitigate impact\nMacro trends\n• Increased demand for metal intensive infrastructure spending and the production of post consumption scrap\nis positive for metal recycling (both ferrous and non-ferrous)\n• Global decarbonisation of steel making, growth of EAFs and the energy transition will drive demand for\nrecycled metal\n• The fundamental drivers of cloud infrastructure recycling remain positive over the medium term\n• There are risks to the materialisation of these positive drivers, particularly as it relates to global
