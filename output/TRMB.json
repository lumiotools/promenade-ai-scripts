(NASDAQ: TRMB) received a staff delisting determination from the Listing Qualifications Department of The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC, informing the Company that Nasdaq has initiated a process which could result in the delisting of the Company's common stock from Nasdaq as a result of the Company not being in compliance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5250(c)(1), which requires listed companies to timely file all required periodic financial reports with the Securities and Exchange Commission.\n\n[ ![\\(PRNewsfoto/Trimble\\)](https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/1893180/Trimble_Blue_Logo.jpg) ](https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/1893180/Trimble_Blue_Logo.html)\n\nIn addition, Nasdaq also informed the Company that it is delinquent in filing its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the period ended September 27, 2024. The staff determination and the deficiency notice have no immediate effect and will not immediately result in the suspension of trading or delisting of the Company's securities.\n\nThe staff determination was issued because the Company had not filed the Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the periods ended March 29, 2024, June 28, 2024 and September 27, 2024 by the November 11, 2024 deadline previously granted by Nasdaq.\n\nThe Company intends to appeal the staff determination before a Nasdaq Hearing Panel and seek a further stay of any suspension or delisting action pending the hearing process in accordance with the procedures set forth in the staff determination. Hearings are typically scheduled to occur 30 to 45 days after the date of the request. Following the hearing, the Hearing Panel will issue a decision, which the Company may further appeal to the Nasdaq Listing Council for review. The Company believes it is well positioned, although not guaranteed, to be granted an extension. This would provide the Company and Ernst & Young LLP, the Company's independent registered public accounting firm, additional time to complete their work and for the Company to file its financials, thereby regaining compliance with the Nasdaq Listing Rule.\n\nThe Company is working diligently with EY to complete the previously disclosed assessment of the impacts related to the Company's internal controls over financial reporting as soon as practicable. EY has been performing and continues to perform incremental audit procedures responsive to the identified material weaknesses.\n\nBased on the work to date, management has not identified any errors that would result in a restatement to the consolidated financial statements for the periods presented in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K, originally filed with the SEC on February 26, 2024, or for any previously released financial results. Furthermore, EY has not withdrawn its audit report on the financial statements included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n\n**Safe Harbor Statement**\n\nCertain statements made in this press release are forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and are made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements include statements regarding the Company's intention to appeal the staff determination and seek an extended stay; the Nasdaq delisting process; and the timing and expectations in connection with the Company's and EY's assessment process and the filing of the delayed periodic reports; as well as all statements that are not historical facts. While management has not identified any errors based on the work completed to date that would result in a restatement to the consolidated financial statements for the periods presented in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K, originally filed with the SEC on February 26, 2024, or for any previously released financial results, it is possible that errors could be discovered in the ongoing audit that could lead to such a restatement. These forward-looking statements are subject to change, and actual results may materially differ from those set forth in this press release due to certain risks and uncertainties. Factors that could cause or contribute to changes in such forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, the expected results of EY's completion of its additional audit procedures; the risk that the completion and filing of the delayed periodic reports will take longer than expected; the outcome of the Company's appeal of the staff determination and request for an extended stay; the duration of any extension that may be granted by Nasdaq; and the risk that the Company will be unable to meet Nasdaq's continued listing requirements. The foregoing review of important factors should not be construed as exhaustive and should be read in conjunction with the other cautionary statements set forth in reports filed with the SEC, including the Company's current reports on Form 8-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and its annual report on Form 10-K. Undue reliance should not be placed on any forward-looking statement contained herein. These statements reflect the Company's position as of the date of this press release. The Company expressly disclaims any undertaking to release publicly any updates or revisions to any statements to reflect any change in the Company's expectations or any change of events, conditions, or circumstances on which any such statement is based.\n\n**About Trimble**\n\nTrimble is transforming the ways people move, build and live.

measures, which are not meant\nto be considered in isolation or as a substitute for comparable GAAP. We believe these non-GAAP \u0000nancial\nmeasures provide useful information to investors and others in understanding our \"core operating performance\",\nwhich excludes (i) the e\u0000ect of non-cash items and certain variable charges not expected to recur; and (ii)\ntransactions that are not meaningful in comparison to our past operating performance or not re\u0000ective of ongoing\n\u0000nancial results. Lastly, we believe that our core operating performance o\u0000ers a supplemental measure for period-\nto-period comparisons and can be used to evaluate our historical and prospective \u0000nancial performance, as well as\nour performance relative to competitors.\nThe non-GAAP de\u0000nitions, and explanations to the adjustments to comparable GAAP measures are included below:\nNon-GAAP De\u0000nitions\nNon-GAAP gross margin\nWe de\u0000ne Non-GAAP gross margin as GAAP gross margin, excluding the e\u0000ects of amortization of purchased\nintangible assets, acquisition/divestiture items, stock-based compensation, deferred compensation, and\nrestructuring and other costs. We believe our investors bene\u0000t by understanding our non-GAAP gross margin as a\nway of understanding how product mix, pricing decisions, and manufacturing costs in\u0000uence our business.\n7\nNon-GAAP operating expenses\nWe de\u0000ne Non-GAAP operating expenses as GAAP operating expenses, excluding the e\u0000ects of amortization of\npurchased intangible assets, acquisition/divestiture items, stock-based compensation, deferred compensation, and\nrestructuring and other costs. We believe this measure is important to investors evaluating our non-GAAP\nspending in relation to revenue.\nNon-GAAP operating income\nWe de\u0000ne Non-GAAP operating income as GAAP operating income, excluding the e\u0000ects of amortization of\npurchased intangible assets, acquisition/divestiture items, stock-based compensation, deferred compensation, and\nrestructuring and other costs. We believe our investors bene\u0000t by understanding our non-GAAP operating income\ntrends, which are driven by revenue, gross margin, and spending.\nNon-GAAP non-operating expense, net\nWe de\u0000ne Non-GAAP non-operating expense, net as GAAP non-operating income (expense), net, excluding\nacquisition/divestiture items, deferred compensation, and restructuring and other costs. We believe this measure\nhelps investors evaluate our non-operating expense trends.\nNon-GAAP income tax provision\nWe de\u0000ne Non-GAAP income tax provision as GAAP income tax provision, excluding charges and bene\u0000ts such as\nnet deferred tax impacts resulting from the non-U.S. intercompany transfer of intellectual property, tax law\nchanges, and signi\u0000cant one-time reserve releases upon the statute of limitations expirations. We believe this\nmeasure helps investors because it provides for consistent treatment of excluded items in our non-GAAP\npresentation and a di\u0000erence in the GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates.\nNon-GAAP net income\nWe de\u0000ne Non-GAAP net income as GAAP net income, excluding the e\u0000ects of amortization of purchased intangible\nassets, acquisition/divestiture items, stock-based compensation, restructuring and other costs, and non-GAAP tax\nadjustments. This measure provides a supplemental view of net income trends, which are driven by non-GAAP\nincome before taxes and our non-GAAP tax rate.\nNon-GAAP diluted net income per share\nWe de\u0000ne Non-GAAP diluted net income per share as GAAP diluted net income per share, excluding the e\u0000ects of\namortization of purchased intangible assets, acquisition/divestiture items, stock-based compensation, restructuring\nand other costs, and non-GAAP tax adjustments. We believe our investors bene\u0000t by understanding our non-GAAP\n8\noperating performance as re\u0000ected in a per share calculation as a way of measuring non-GAAP operating\nperformance by ownership in the Company.\nAdjusted EBITDA\nWe de\u0000ne Adjusted EBITDA as non-GAAP operating income plus depreciation expense, cloud computing\namortization, and income from equity method investments, net, excluding our proportionate share of items such\nas amortization of purchased intangibles, stock-based compensation, and restructuring costs. Other companies\nmay de\u0000ne Adjusted EBITDA di\u0000erently. Adjusted EBITDA is a performance measure that we believe o\u0000ers a useful\nview of the overall operations of our business because it facilitates operating performance comparisons by\nremoving potential di\u0000erences caused by variations unrelated to operating performance, such as capital structures\n(interest expense), income taxes, depreciation, and amortization of purchased intangibles and cloud computing\ncosts.\nExplanations of Non-GAAP adjustments\n(A) Amortization of purchased intangible assets. Non-GAAP gross margin and operating expenses exclude the amortization of\npurchased intangible assets, which primarily represents technology and/or customer relationships already developed.\n(B) Acquisition / divestiture items. Non-GAAP gross margin and operating expenses exclude costs consisting of external and incremental\ncosts resulting directly from acquisitions, divestitures, and strategic investment activities such as legal, due diligence, integration, and other\nclosing costs, including the acceleration of acquisition stock awards and adjustments to the fair value of earn-out liabilities. Non-GAAP non-\noperating expense, net, excludes one-time acquisition/divestiture charges, including foreign currency exchange rate gains/losses related to an\nacquisition, divestiture gains/losses, and strategic investment gains/losses. These are one-time costs that vary significantly in amount and\ntiming and are not indicative of our core operating performance.\n(C) Stock-based compensation / deferred compensation. Non-GAAP gross margin and operating expenses exclude stock-based\ncompensation and income or expense associated with movement in our non-qualified deferred compensation plan liabilities. Changes in non-\nqualified deferred compensation plan assets, included in non-operating expense, net, offset the income or expense in the plan liabilities.\n(D) Restructuring and other costs. Non-GAAP gross margin and operating expenses exclude restructuring and other costs comprised of\ntermination benefits related to reductions in employee headcount and closure or exit of facilities, executive severance agreements, business\nexit costs, as well as a $20 million commitment to donate to the Trimble Foundation that was paid over four quarters ending in the first quarter\nof 2023. Non-GAAP non-operating expense net, excludes our proportionate share of items recorded in income from equity method investment\nitems, such as amortization of purchased intangibles, stock-based compensation, and restructuring costs.\n(E) Non-GAAP items tax effected. This amount adjusts the provision for income taxes to reflect the effect of the non-GAAP items (A)\nthrough (D) on non-GAAP net income.\n(F) Difference in GAAP and non-GAAP tax rate. This amount represents the difference between the GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates\napplied to the non-GAAP operating income plus the non-GAAP non-operating expense, net. The non-GAAP tax rate excludes charges and\nbenefits such as (i) deferred tax impacts from tax amortization relating to a non-U.S. intercompany transfer of intellectual property and R&D\ncost capitalization impact to global intangible low-taxed income, and (ii) significant one-time reserve releases upon statute of limitations\nexpirations.\n(G) GAAP and non-GAAP tax rate percentages. These percentages are defined as GAAP income tax provision as a percentage of\nGAAP income before taxes and non-GAAP income tax provision as a percentage of non-GAAP income before taxes.\nOTHER KEY METRICS\nAnnualized Recurring Revenue\nIn addition to providing non-GAAP \u0000nancial measures, Trimble provides an ARR performance measure in order to\nprovide investors with a supplementary indicator of the value of the Company's current recurring revenue\ncontracts. ARR represents the estimated annualized value of recurring revenue. ARR is calculated by taking our\nsubscription and maintenance and support for the current quarter and adding the portion of the contract value of\n9\nall our term licenses attributable to the current quarter, then dividing that sum by the number of days in the\nquarter and then multiplying that quotient by 365. ARR should be viewed independently of revenue and deferred\nrevenue as it is a performance measure and is not intended to be combined with or to replace either of those\nitems.\nOrganic Annualized Recurring Revenue\nOrganic annualized recurring revenue refers to annualized recurring revenue excluding the impacts of (i) foreign\ncurrency translation, and (ii) acquisitions and divestitures that closed in the prior 12 months.\nOrganic Revenue\nOrganic revenue refers to revenue excluding the impacts of (i) foreign currency translation, and (ii) acquisitions and\ndivestitures that closed in the prior 12 months.\nView original content to download multimedia:https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/trimble-announces-\nthird-quarter-2024-results-302297119.html\nSOURCE Trimble\n10"

These\nstatements include expectations about our future financial and operational results. These forward-looking statements are subject to change, and actual\nresults may materially differ due to certain risks and uncertainties. The Company's results may be adversely affected if the Company is unable to market,\nmanufacture and ship new products, obtain new customers, effectively integrate new acquisitions or consummate divestitures in a timely manner, or get the\nbenefits it is expecting from its joint ventures and partnerships, including with AGCO and Platform Science. The Company's results would also be negatively\nimpacted due to weakness and deterioration in the US and global macroeconomic outlook, including slowing growth, inflationary pressures and increases in\ninterest rates, which may affect demand for our products and services and increase our costs, adversely affecting our revenues and profitability, supply chain\nshortages and disruptions, the pace at which our dealers work through their inventory, changes in our distribution channels, adverse geopolitical\ndevelopments and the potential impact of volatility and conflict in the political and economic environment, including conflicts in the Middle East and between\nRussia and Ukraine and its direct and indirect impact on our business, foreign exchange fluctuations, the pace we transition our business model towards a\nsubscription model, the imposition of barriers to international trade, the impact of acquisitions or divestitures, and our ability to maintain effective internal\ncontrols over financial reporting, including our ability to remediate our material weaknesses in our internal controls over financial reporting. Any failure to\nachieve predicted results could negatively impact the Company's revenue, cash flow from operations, and other financial results. The Company's financial\nresults will also depend on a number of other factors and risks detailed from time to time in reports filed with the SEC, including its quarterly reports on Form\n10-Q and its annual report on Form 10-K.

basis. Adjusted EBITDA refers to non-GAAP operating income plus depreciation and cloud computing amortization\nplus income from equity method investments.\nTo help our readers understand our past financial performance and our future results, we supplement the financial results that we provide in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP, with non-GAAP financial measures. The non-GAAP\nfinancial measure included in the table above is leverage ratio, as it includes adjusted EBITDA in its calculation. The method we use to produce non-GAAP results is not computed according to GAAP and may differ from the methods used by other companies. We\nhave provided this ratio as many investors find it to be a valuable metric to measure a company’s ability to service indebtedness. Our non-GAAP measures are not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for comparable GAAP measures and should be\nread only in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP. Our management regularly uses our supplemental non-GAAP financial measures internally to understand, manage, and evaluate our business and make\noperating decisions. These non-GAAP measures are among the primary factors management uses in planning for and forecasting future periods.

The non-GAAP financial measures included in the table above are non-GAAP gross margin, non-GAAP operating expenses, non-\nGAAP operating income, non-GAAP non-operating income (expense), net, non-GAAP income tax provision, non-GAAP net income, and non-GAAP diluted net income per share. The method we use to produce non-GAAP results is not computed according to GAAP and may differ from the methods used by other companies. Our non-GAAP results are not meant to be\nconsidered in isolation or as a substitute for comparable GAAP measures and should be read only in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP. Our management regularly uses our supplemental non-GAAP financial measures internally to understand, manage and evaluate our business and make operating decisions. These\nnon-GAAP measures are among the primary factors management uses in planning for and forecasting future periods. We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures reflect an additional way of viewing aspects of our operations that, when viewed with our GAAP results, provide a more complete understanding of factors and trends affecting our business. For detailed\nexplanations of the adjustments made to comparable GAAP measures please refer to the individually reported press releases and related Form 8-K.\nPage 7\nStock-based Compensation and Deferred Compensation\n(Dollars in millions)\n(Unaudited)\nThree Months Ended Three Months Ended Three Months Ended\nQ1 Q2 Q3 Q4 Year Q1 Q2 Q3 Q4 Year Q1 Q2 Q3\n2022 2022 2022 2022 2022 2023 2023 2023 2023 2023 2024 2024 2024\nStock-based compensation\nCost of sales $ 2.4 $ 3.5 $ 3.5 $ 3.2 $ 12.6 $ 3.4 $ 4.0 $ 3.7 $ 3.5 $ 14.6 $ 4.1 $ 4.1 $ 4.1\nResearch and development 6.1 7.2 7.4 7.3 28.0 8.7 11.4 11.3 9.3 40.7 10.0 10.8 10.8\nSales and marketing 5.5 6.4 6.7 6.0 24.6 5.8 8.0 7.3 6.0 27.1 8.3 5.6 6.8\nGeneral and administrative 14.3 15.9 14.3 10.7 55.2 15.6 17.0 16.3 14.1 63.0 14.0 17.0 14.7\nTotal stock-based compensation $ 28.3 $ 33.0 $ 31.9 $ 27.2 $ 120.4 $ 33.5 $ 40.4 $ 38.6 $ 32.9 $ 145.4 $ 36.4 $ 37.5 $ 36.4\nDeferred compensation\nCost of sales $ (0.2) $ (0.4) $ (0.1) $ 0.2 $ (0.5) $ 0.1 $ 0.1 $ 0.1 $ 0.1 $ 0.4 $ 0.2 $ 0.1 $ 0.1\nResearch and development (1.3) (2.7) (0.1) 0.8 (3.3) 0.8 0.6 (0.3) 1.1 2.2 0.9 0.2 0.7\nSales and marketing (0.5) (0.8) - 0.1 (1.2) 0.3 0.2 (0.1) 0.3 0.7 0.3 - 0.2\nGeneral and administrative (1.3) (2.9) - 0.8 (3.4) 0.7 0.8 (0.4) 1.3 2.4 1.0 0.3 0.7\nTotal deferred compensation $ (3.3) $ (6.8) $ (0.2) $ 1.9 $ (8.4) $ 1.9 $ 1.7 $ (0.7) $ 2.8 $ 5.7 $ 2.4 $ 0.6 $ 1.7\nTotal Stock-based compensation and Deferred\ncompensation\nCost of sales $ 2.2 $ 3.1 $ 3.4 $ 3.4 $ 12.1 $ 3.5 $ 4.1 $ 3.8 $ 3.6 $ 15.0 $ 4.3 $ 4.2 $ 4.2\nResearch and development 4.8 4.5 7.3 8.1 24.7 9.5 12.0 11.0 10.4 42.9 10.9 11.0 11.5\nSales and marketing 5.0 5.6 6.7 6.1 23.4 6.1 8.2 7.2 6.3 27.8 8.6 5.6 7.0\nGeneral and administrative 13.0 13.0 14.3 11.5 51.8 16.3 17.8 15.9 15.4 65.4 15.0 17.3 15.4\nTotal stock-based compensation and deferred\ncompensation $ 25.0 $ 26.2 $ 31.7 $ 29.1 $ 112.0 $ 35.4 $ 42.1 $ 37.9 $ 35.7 $ 151.1 $ 38.8 $ 38.1 $ 38.1\nPage 8"
