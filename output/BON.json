This development is set to drive considerable growth in BON's apple polyphenol products in the upcoming fiscal year.\n\nApple polyphenol is a mixed natural compound that is widely used in dietary supplements and personal care products. However, due to the nature of its chemical instability, apple polyphenol’s application and production always encounters technical difficulties and high production costs, which are deemed as one of the main impediments to the commercialization of apple polyphenols. After ten years of efforts in its R&D, with this pioneered technology, the Company is able to solve the quality stability problem and remove extra residues of the pesticide in the products, while significantly reducing costs.\n\nMr. Yongwei Hu, Chairman and CEO of BON, commented: “We are proud to overcome the main commercialization barriers of apple polyphenol through technological innovation. Currently, our annual production capacity of apple polyphenol is approximately 300 to 500 tons. With the new technology breakthrough, we expect this product to make significant progress in dietary supplements and personal care products, where sales are expected to significantly increase with a trajectory of continued rapid growth. With its strong functionality and broad application range, we believe that the apple polyphenol segment will become be a key driver for our sustainable growth and a transformative force in the industry, significantly enhancing shareholder value for the company.”\n\n**About Bon Natural Life Limited**\n\nThe Company focuses on the manufacturing of personal care ingredients, such as plant extracted fragrance compounds for perfume and fragrance manufacturers, natural health supplements such as powder drinks and bioactive food ingredient products mostly used as food additives and nutritional supplements by their customers.

This technological advancement not only boosts the transformation rate and bioavailability of broccoli extract, but also reduces costs significantly, allowing for rapid market expansion. Additionally, it extends the shelf life of extract products, providing convenience to customers.\n\nBased on this new design, BON plans to launch a series of new health supplement products under the registered trademark: Broclife® in areas of sleep improvement, digestive health, and immune health, seeking to meet the market demand for natural health products.\n\nRecognized for its numerous health benefits such as antioxidant, anti-aging, anti-inflammatory effects, immune enhancement, inhibition of cancer cell replication, support for digestive health, and promotion of the central nervous system, broccoli extract is a highly valuable ingredient. However, its application has been limited due to challenges related to formulation effectiveness and the high costs involved in production.\n\nYongwei Hu, CEO & Chairman of BON, stated, \"We believe that our new Broclife® products will address the challenges related to both effectiveness and costs in broccoli extract products, and play a crucial role in the global health market. With this innovation, BON hopes to unleash substantial growth with the hope to reach a projected of market of tens of millions of dollars over the next three years. This achievement will not only drive the Company's expansion but also deliver exceptional performance and value to our shareholders.”\n\n**About Bon Natural Life Limited (\"BON\")**\n\nBON is a Cayman Islands company engaged in the business of natural, health, and personal care industries.

I will begin today's call by providing an overview of\nour business performance during the fiscal year 2022. Saini will then provide a detailed\noverview of our financial year 2022 financials highlighting the financial performance of each\nproduct category.\nRichard Hu\n[Speaking Chinese]\nBon Natural Life Limited\nFebruary 10, 2023 at 9:00 a.m. Eastern\n2\nYiru Xu\nNow turn to slide 6, I'd like to briefly introduce our company for those who are new to our story.\nBon Natural Life is a bio-ingredient solution provider in the natural health and personal care\nindustry. We source raw materials from farms, then process and break down the natural plants\ninto natural chemicals that can be used commercially for their abovementioned applications.\nWe have three product categories: fragrance compounds, health supplements and bioactive\nfood ingredients. Fragrance compounds are used in fragrances that go into consumer\nfragrance, oral care, detergents and etcetera. Health supplements are powder drinks,\nprebiotics, probiotics and etcetera. Bio-additive food ingredients are used in food preservatives\nand health supplements as well.\nOur customers include well-known names in Asia including Tong Ren Tang, Liangmianzhen,\nJin Brand and Angel Yeast. Our clients also include some of the biggest names in U.S. and\nEurope, such as International Flavors & Fragrances, Mars, Symrise, Fridal and ACS\nInternational.\nRichard Hu\n[Speaking Chinese]\nYiru Xu\nNow turning to slide 7, I would like to briefly discuss our manufacturing facilities and the\nupcoming plant. We currently have two facilities in Xi'an, China, both are located within 90\nminutes’ drive from the company headquarter.\nRegarding our third production facility, Yumen Plant, the building structure of the first phase\nfacility has been completed as scheduled. The first phase construction work is estimated to be\ncompleted in May this year. For the first phase the Yumen Plant will increase the production\ncapability of the fragrance compounds and bio-active food ingredients to meet the existing\nmarket and customer demand.\nFor the second phase of expansion, the production will be used for the company’s new\nproprietary products including natural pre audit and functional personal care products. The new\nconstruction is expected to increase our production capability of fragrance compound and bio-\nadditive food ingredients by 200%, representing a 150% annualized growth potential in\nrevenue.\nRichard Hu\n[Speaking Chinese]\nYiru Xu\nIn this light, I would like to introduce the development progress of our proprietary products.\nThanks to the tremendous and decade-long efforts of our R&D team, we are excited and proud\nto be able to add new and innovative health products to our nutraceutical line for our legacy\ncompound business.\nBon Natural Life Limited\nFebruary 10, 2023 at 9:00 a.m. Eastern\n3\nWe have received the initial purchase order for our first female personal care product,\nFeatherPure. It is an all-natural product with no antibiotics, fragrance or harmful chemical\nadditives without harmful side effects. The product can regulate microbial balance of female\nreproductive system and will provide anti-bacterial and anti-inflammatory function. We expect\nFeatherPure to bring approximately $3 million in revenue in the next two years.\nSecondly, we would like to introduce our new broccoli based probiotic powder drink as our first\nproprietary products of the cruciferous vegetable based health supplement series. It will\nprovide an additional growth driver for us.\nAccording to research, about 56% of the Chinese population are infected by H. pylori, a\nbacteria that can cause digestive disease. Our new probiotic powdery drink could potentially\ninhibit the proliferation of H. pylori bacteria and regulate the microbial balance of digestive\nsystem.\nIn addition to the powder drink, we are also expecting to develop other consumer products in\nour cruciferous vegetable based series. We plan to introduce immune system booster in soft\ngel capsules, digestive health booster in soft gel capsules, weight loss management products\nand sleep aid products for the middle-aged and elderly. We look forward to bringing our\nproducts to the market and we are optimistic about the opportunity and revenue potential of\nour proprietary consumer products.\nRichard Hu\n[Speaking Chinese]\nYiru Xu\nIn slide 9, I will provide an overview of our growth strategies for the next six months to one\nyear. First, we are expecting to put more effort in product line expansion. In the following year,\nthe company will introduce two to three new raw material categories to expand our sales in-\nhouse market and gain more competitive advantages. In addition to that, the company will\ncontinue to focus on the regulation technology of human microorganisms and develop new\nproducts which are beneficial for digestive and immune health. At present, we have tested and\nwill launch some products, including products helping gastroenteritis, sleeping and memory\nissue, liver health and immune health.\nNext, in terms of capital markets and global operation, the company is expected to carry out\ntwo to three mergers and acquisitions in the following year. These acquisitions will improve our\ncapabilities in bio manufacturing technology and sales networking expansion. And the\ncompany will continue to look for opportunity to expand our business operations and local raw\nmaterial market on a global level, especially in United States, Japan, Europe and Southeast\nAsia with a new COVID situation.\nThe company's strategy is to establish localized business to rapidly expand the raw material\nbusiness market. Meanwhile, the company will also actively engage in Global Health Solutions,\nespecially in the U.S. and China.\nBon Natural Life Limited\nFebruary 10, 2023 at 9:00 a.m. Eastern\n4\nRichard Hu\n[Speaking Chinese]\nYiru Xu\nWith that, I will now turn the call over to Saini and she will walk you through our financials.\nSaini Liu\nThank you, Mr. Hu. I’m Saini Liu and will review the 2022 earnings financials review and our\nCFO Mr. Li, will be available for the Q&A session if you have any questions regarding the\nfinancials.\nBefore I reveal the numbers, let me remind you that all figures discussed are for this reporting\nperiod, the year ended September 30, 2022 unless I state otherwise. Additionally, any year-\nover-year comparison is to the September 30, 2021. So let's go over our 2022 yearended\nfinancials.\nI'll begin with an overview of our consolidated results on slide 11. In the fiscal year of 2022,\nBon generated approximately $29.9 million in revenue at a 17.3% increase over last year.\nThese increases were primarily driven by the increase in average selling price of all three\nproduct categories, as well as increase in sales volume of bioactive food ingredients.\nThe selling price of fragrance compounds, powder drinks and bioactive food ingredients\nincreased by 27.5%, 7% and 17.4% as we raised our selling price in response to the rising raw\nmaterial costs and market change as affected by the COVID-19 and the shortage of the\nprincipal raw material due to abnormal weather.\nAlthough the selling price was raised, the sales volume of bioactive food ingredients and health\nsupplemental powder drinks increased by 27.3% and 1% for the fiscal year of 2022. The sales\nvolume of bioactive food ingredients increased from 121,000 kilograms to about 154,000\nkilograms due to strong customer demand and our sales efforts to promote sales of milk thistle\nextract, with benefit to protect liver and lower blood sugar.\nIn addition, the sales volume of fragrance compounds decreased by 15.1% mainly due to the\nshortage of raw material, which suffered abnormal wet weather in the second half of 2021,\nalong with disruption of logistics caused by COVID-19.\nAt the same time, gross profit for the fiscal year of 2022 was approximately $9.4 million,\nincreased by 32.5% which is mainly driven by strong category growth from house\nsupplemental powder drink and bioactive food ingredients. Both sales volume and average\nselling price are moving in the right direction, partially offset by the supply chain impact of the\ncontribution from fragrance compound.\nGovernment subsidies received in the form of a grant and recognized as other operating\nincome totaled about $1.3 million and $450,000 in the fiscal year of 2022 and 2021,\nrespectively. This is an example of continuing support from government to high tech\ncompanies like Bon Natural Life.\nBon Natural Life Limited\nFebruary 10, 2023 at 9:00 a.m. Eastern\n5\nNet income in fiscal year of 2022 increased from $4.6 million to about $6.2 million, increased\nby 35.4%. Diluted earnings per share was $0.74 compared to the $0.68 for the same period in\n2021.\nIn this slide, I will dive deeper into the financial performance of each product category.\nBeginning with fragrance compounds, revenue generated from fragrance compounds\nincreased by 7.6% from $12.7 million to about $13.7 million. As I mentioned previously, the\nrevenue growth of fragrance compounds was primarily driven by the average order size and\nthe average selling price of our product. Although there's a rise in the raw material costs due to\nsupply chain and pandemic challenges, with our advanced technology and our ability to secure\nsuch supply, we are able to increase our average selling price and maintain our profitability in\nfragrance compounds.\nNext, our health supplements, specifically powder drink segment increased by 7.4% and $6.7\nmillion to about $7.1 million. The increase from health supplements was mainly due to volume\ngrowth and higher average selling price.\nRevenues from bioactive ingredients increased 48.5% compared to the same period of 2021\nfrom $6.1 million to about $9.1 million. As I mentioned before, the increase in revenues from\nbioactive ingredients was primarily due to volume growth and higher average selling price.\nOverall, the increase in total sales revenue from unit price increases in all three segments as\nwell as volume increase in bioactive ingredients and health supplemental product drinks offset\nthe negative impact of supply chain shortage in fragrance compound. Thus, we are pleased\nwith the overall financial performance of our product categories.\nNow turning to the slide 13, I would like to discuss the regional breakdown of our sales and the\ndynamics that influenced our results. Despite the global supply chain challenges in 2022,\nrevenue generated from domestic China was $28.8 million, achieving a 21.3% increase in\nsales, which represents approximately 96.1% of our total revenue for the fiscal year of 2022.\nOverseas sales was approximately $1.2 million representing about 3.9% of the total revenue.\nDue to COVID-19, global logistics have been disrupted. So we shifted our sales strategy by\ndirecting more marketing efforts to promote our products to large domestic enterprise\ncustomers rather than export sales to overseas customers. We believe that with the\ncommissioning of Yumen Plant, we will be able to accelerate the revenue growth in both\ndomestic and international sectors to meet the increasing demand from our customers.\nNext, in slide 14, I will go over to the key subsequent events after fiscal year of 2022. On\nSeptember 2022, the company had announced the delay of the commencement of Yumen\nPlant to May 2023. On January 2023, the company closed the previous offering with gross\nproceeds of $2.2 million, mainly to fund its new Yumen plant and working capital for the new\nproduction facility.\nAnd now I'll turn the call over to Mr. Hu for closing remarks. And then we'll start the Q&A\nsession.\nBon Natural Life Limited\nFebruary 10, 2023 at 9:00 a.m. Eastern\n6\nRichard Hu\n[Speaking Chinese]\nSaini Liu\nThanks, everyone, for joining us today. Before I wrap up today's presentation, I would like to\nfirst recognize our employees for their efforts and thank our loyal customers for their trust in us.\nWe are confident that our R&D capability business model and strategy would enable us to gain\nmore market share and maintain our growth momentum.\nWith that, before we open to the call to your questions, I would like to note that for any\nquestions directed to management in China, we’ll translate both their questions and their\nanswers. If you want to ask your questions in Chinese, please also ask in English for the\nbenefit of listeners. Please also note that we'll only be able to respond to questions about our\nfinancial and operating results.\nWith that will now open the call to questions. Operator?\nQUESTIONS AND ANSWERS\nOperator\nWe will now begin the question and answer session. To ask a question, you may press star\nthen one on your touchtone phone. If you are using a speakerphone, please pick up your\nhandset before pressing the keys. To withdraw your question, please press star then two.\nFor those on the webcast, you may submit questions by typing in the Submit a Question box\non your screen. At this time, we will pause momentarily to assemble our roster.\nAnd our first question comes from Emma Lee, a private investor. Please go ahead.\nEmma Lee\nHi, thanks for taking my questions. I think my first question is for the CFO, Richard. I saw your\npress release that the company has postponed the completion of the Yumen Plant. I just want\nto know do you expect it to complete in May this year or there might be another delay? And\nalso how much production capability will the plant provide? Is there any existing demand for\nsuch increase or do you have [audio disruption] to meet the increased production? Thanks.\nTaylor Zhang\nLet me translate your question to the management. [Speaking Chinese]\nRichard Hu\n[Speaking Chinese]\nTaylor Zhang\nYour answer comes from the Chairman, CEO Mr. Richard Hu. So, the management does not\nforesee any further delay, especially after China is reopening after from the COVID-19\nBon Natural Life Limited\nFebruary 10, 2023 at 9:00 a.m. Eastern\n7\npandemic. So, they feel pretty confident that the company will be able to complete construction\nand also ramping up production around May this year.\nIn terms of production capacity, phase one is basically for fragrance compounds. Phase two is\nfor sale in bioactive ingredient food products. So, phase one, as we mentioned, will come alive\naround May, which will bring additional capacity, approximately 50 metric tons of fragrance\ncompounds products, which translates into about 200% in terms of production capacity\nincrease. In terms of revenue, the company expects that will be increased by about 150%.\nIn terms of bioactive for the ingredients products, which will come online around May this year,\nthe second phase, so that will bring additional 300 metric tons production capacity to the\ncompany.\nEmma Lee\nAll right, okay, thanks. I think my second question is also for Richard CEO. I noticed that your\ncompany has overseas expansion plans, but can you explain why does the earnings and sales\nratio of the overseas decline in 2022 compared to the 2021? Will you adjust the plan the future\nor you're going to keep this plan?\nTaylor Zhang\n[Speaking Chinese]\nRichard Hu\n[Speaking Chinese]\nTaylor Zhang\nSo the answer comes from Richard Hu, company Chairman and CEO. In terms of the\noverseas sales decline significantly in fiscal year 2022, there's two reasons. One is in March,\nApril and May of 2022, there was a significant congestion at the Port of Shanghai, which\ncaused the company unable to deliver to the customer. So that's factor one.\nThe second factor is due to the supply chain disruption globally, there's a huge shortage of raw\nmaterials the company needed for fragrance compounds and also certain bioactive food\ningredients materials. So those were primary reasons that the company’s overseas sales\ndeclined dramatically in fiscal year 2022.\nLooking forward, the company does not foresee any of these factors will play a role. So the\ncompany believes the company will resume its export business and the company does expect\nits overseas sales will pick up in fiscal year 2023.\nEmma Lee\nOkay, thanks. So one more question. My last question is for the CFO. I saw that the company's\naccounts receivable are over $6 million and increased by $1.3 million in 2022. Can you explain\nwhy the company has such a high level of accounts receivables? And do we have any better\nprovisions on that?\nBon Natural Life Limited\nFebruary 10, 2023 at 9:00 a.m. Eastern\n8\nTaylor Zhang\nLet me translate. [Speaking Chinese]\nZhenchao Li\n[Speaking Chinese]\nTaylor Zhang\nOkay. So, here's the answer from Mr. Li, the company's CFO. So, the payment terms the\ncompany gives the customer is universal, three months or 90 days. So throughout last year,\nthe company has not experienced any during delinquent payments, so all the payments are\naccording to the payment schedule.\nAs of now, in January this year, the company has pretty much collected all the balance that\nwas reflected in the balance sheet as of September 30, 2022. So the company does not have\nany bad debt provision.\nEmma Lee\nOkay, okay. All right. Thanks. I think I don't have any further questions on that. Thank you.\nTaylor Zhang\nSure. Thank you Emily.\nOperator\nOnce again, if you would like to ask a question, please press star then one.\nCONCLUSION\nOperator\nThis concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over\nto Saini Liu for any closing remarks.\nSaini Liu\nThank you, operator. On behalf of Bon, we want to thank you for your interest and participation\nin this call. If you'd like to speak with us further, please contact either Sophie or Maggie. Some\ncontact information is listed at the end of the press release. Thank you. Operator, back to you.\nOperator\nThe conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today’s presentation.

Mr. Hu, please go ahead.\nRichard Hu\n[Speaking Chinese]\nYiru Xu\nThank you, everyone, for joining us today. I will begin today's call by providing an overview of\nour business performance during the fiscal year 2022. Saini will then provide a detailed\noverview of our financial year 2022 financials highlighting the financial performance of each\nproduct category.\nRichard Hu\n[Speaking Chinese]\nBon Natural Life Limited\nFebruary 10, 2023 at 9:00 a.m. Eastern\n2\nYiru Xu\nNow turn to slide 6, I'd like to briefly introduce our company for those who are new to our story.\nBon Natural Life is a bio-ingredient solution provider in the natural health and personal care\nindustry. We source raw materials from farms, then process and break down the natural plants\ninto natural chemicals that can be used commercially for their abovementioned applications.\nWe have three product categories: fragrance compounds, health supplements and bioactive\nfood ingredients. Fragrance compounds are used in fragrances that go into consumer\nfragrance, oral care, detergents and etcetera. Health supplements are powder drinks,\nprebiotics, probiotics and etcetera. Bio-additive food ingredients are used in food preservatives\nand health supplements as well.\nOur customers include well-known names in Asia including Tong Ren Tang, Liangmianzhen,\nJin Brand and Angel Yeast. Our clients also include some of the biggest names in U.S. and\nEurope, such as International Flavors & Fragrances, Mars, Symrise, Fridal and ACS\nInternational.\nRichard Hu\n[Speaking Chinese]\nYiru Xu\nNow turning to slide 7, I would like to briefly discuss our manufacturing facilities and the\nupcoming plant. We currently have two facilities in Xi'an, China, both are located within 90\nminutes’ drive from the company headquarter.\nRegarding our third production facility, Yumen Plant, the building structure of the first phase\nfacility has been completed as scheduled. The first phase construction work is estimated to be\ncompleted in May this year. For the first phase the Yumen Plant will increase the production\ncapability of the fragrance compounds and bio-active food ingredients to meet the existing\nmarket and customer demand.\nFor the second phase of expansion, the production will be used for the company’s new\nproprietary products including natural pre audit and functional personal care products. The new\nconstruction is expected to increase our production capability of fragrance compound and bio-\nadditive food ingredients by 200%, representing a 150% annualized growth potential in\nrevenue.\nRichard Hu\n[Speaking Chinese]\nYiru Xu\nIn this light, I would like to introduce the development progress of our proprietary products.\nThanks to the tremendous and decade-long efforts of our R&D team, we are excited and proud\nto be able to add new and innovative health products to our nutraceutical line for our legacy\ncompound business.\nBon Natural Life Limited\nFebruary 10, 2023 at 9:00 a.m. Eastern\n3\nWe have received the initial purchase order for our first female personal care product,\nFeatherPure. It is an all-natural product with no antibiotics, fragrance or harmful chemical\nadditives without harmful side effects. The product can regulate microbial balance of female\nreproductive system and will provide anti-bacterial and anti-inflammatory function. We expect\nFeatherPure to bring approximately $3 million in revenue in the next two years.\nSecondly, we would like to introduce our new broccoli based probiotic powder drink as our first\nproprietary products of the cruciferous vegetable based health supplement series. It will\nprovide an additional growth driver for us.\nAccording to research, about 56% of the Chinese population are infected by H. pylori, a\nbacteria that can cause digestive disease. Our new probiotic powdery drink could potentially\ninhibit the proliferation of H. pylori bacteria and regulate the microbial balance of digestive\nsystem.\nIn addition to the powder drink, we are also expecting to develop other consumer products in\nour cruciferous vegetable based series. We plan to introduce immune system booster in soft\ngel capsules, digestive health booster in soft gel capsules, weight loss management products\nand sleep aid products for the middle-aged and elderly. We look forward to bringing our\nproducts to the market and we are optimistic about the opportunity and revenue potential of\nour proprietary consumer products.\nRichard Hu\n[Speaking Chinese]\nYiru Xu\nIn slide 9, I will provide an overview of our growth strategies for the next six months to one\nyear. First, we are expecting to put more effort in product line expansion. In the following year,\nthe company will introduce two to three new raw material categories to expand our sales in-\nhouse market and gain more competitive advantages. In addition to that, the company will\ncontinue to focus on the regulation technology of human microorganisms and develop new\nproducts which are beneficial for digestive and immune health. At present, we have tested and\nwill launch some products, including products helping gastroenteritis, sleeping and memory\nissue, liver health and immune health.\nNext, in terms of capital markets and global operation, the company is expected to carry out\ntwo to three mergers and acquisitions in the following year. These acquisitions will improve our\ncapabilities in bio manufacturing technology and sales networking expansion. And the\ncompany will continue to look for opportunity to expand our business operations and local raw\nmaterial market on a global level, especially in United States, Japan, Europe and Southeast\nAsia with a new COVID situation.\nThe company's strategy is to establish localized business to rapidly expand the raw material\nbusiness market. Meanwhile, the company will also actively engage in Global Health Solutions,\nespecially in the U.S. and China.\nBon Natural Life Limited\nFebruary 10, 2023 at 9:00 a.m. Eastern\n4\nRichard Hu\n[Speaking Chinese]\nYiru Xu\nWith that, I will now turn the call over to Saini and she will walk you through our financials.\nSaini Liu\nThank you, Mr. Hu. I’m Saini Liu and will review the 2022 earnings financials review and our\nCFO Mr. Li, will be available for the Q&A session if you have any questions regarding the\nfinancials.\nBefore I reveal the numbers, let me remind you that all figures discussed are for this reporting\nperiod, the year ended September 30, 2022 unless I state otherwise. Additionally, any year-\nover-year comparison is to the September 30, 2021. So let's go over our 2022 yearended\nfinancials.\nI'll begin with an overview of our consolidated results on slide 11. In the fiscal year of 2022,\nBon generated approximately $29.9 million in revenue at a 17.3% increase over last year.\nThese increases were primarily driven by the increase in average selling price of all three\nproduct categories, as well as increase in sales volume of bioactive food ingredients.\nThe selling price of fragrance compounds, powder drinks and bioactive food ingredients\nincreased by 27.5%, 7% and 17.4% as we raised our selling price in response to the rising raw\nmaterial costs and market change as affected by the COVID-19 and the shortage of the\nprincipal raw material due to abnormal weather.\nAlthough the selling price was raised, the sales volume of bioactive food ingredients and health\nsupplemental powder drinks increased by 27.3% and 1% for the fiscal year of 2022. The sales\nvolume of bioactive food ingredients increased from 121,000 kilograms to about 154,000\nkilograms due to strong customer demand and our sales efforts to promote sales of milk thistle\nextract, with benefit to protect liver and lower blood sugar.\nIn addition, the sales volume of fragrance compounds decreased by 15.1% mainly due to the\nshortage of raw material, which suffered abnormal wet weather in the second half of 2021,\nalong with disruption of logistics caused by COVID-19.\nAt the same time, gross profit for the fiscal year of 2022 was approximately $9.4 million,\nincreased by 32.5% which is mainly driven by strong category growth from house\nsupplemental powder drink and bioactive food ingredients. Both sales volume and average\nselling price are moving in the right direction, partially offset by the supply chain impact of the\ncontribution from fragrance compound.\nGovernment subsidies received in the form of a grant and recognized as other operating\nincome totaled about $1.3 million and $450,000 in the fiscal year of 2022 and 2021,\nrespectively. This is an example of continuing support from government to high tech\ncompanies like Bon Natural Life.\nBon Natural Life Limited\nFebruary 10, 2023 at 9:00 a.m. Eastern\n5\nNet income in fiscal year of 2022 increased from $4.6 million to about $6.2 million, increased\nby 35.4%. Diluted earnings per share was $0.74 compared to the $0.68 for the same period in\n2021.\nIn this slide, I will dive deeper into the financial performance of each product category.\nBeginning with fragrance compounds, revenue generated from fragrance compounds\nincreased by 7.6% from $12.7 million to about $13.7 million. As I mentioned previously, the\nrevenue growth of fragrance compounds was primarily driven by the average order size and\nthe average selling price of our product. Although there's a rise in the raw material costs due to\nsupply chain and pandemic challenges, with our advanced technology and our ability to secure\nsuch supply, we are able to increase our average selling price and maintain our profitability in\nfragrance compounds.\nNext, our health supplements, specifically powder drink segment increased by 7.4% and $6.7\nmillion to about $7.1 million. The increase from health supplements was mainly due to volume\ngrowth and higher average selling price.\nRevenues from bioactive ingredients increased 48.5% compared to the same period of 2021\nfrom $6.1 million to about $9.1 million. As I mentioned before, the increase in revenues from\nbioactive ingredients was primarily due to volume growth and higher average selling price.\nOverall, the increase in total sales revenue from unit price increases in all three segments as\nwell as volume increase in bioactive ingredients and health supplemental product drinks offset\nthe negative impact of supply chain shortage in fragrance compound. Thus, we are pleased\nwith the overall financial performance of our product categories.\nNow turning to the slide 13, I would like to discuss the regional breakdown of our sales and the\ndynamics that influenced our results. Despite the global supply chain challenges in 2022,\nrevenue generated from domestic China was $28.8 million, achieving a 21.3% increase in\nsales, which represents approximately 96.1% of our total revenue for the fiscal year of 2022.\nOverseas sales was approximately $1.2 million representing about 3.9% of the total revenue.\nDue to COVID-19, global logistics have been disrupted. So we shifted our sales strategy by\ndirecting more marketing efforts to promote our products to large domestic enterprise\ncustomers rather than export sales to overseas customers. We believe that with the\ncommissioning of Yumen Plant, we will be able to accelerate the revenue growth in both\ndomestic and international sectors to meet the increasing demand from our customers.\nNext, in slide 14, I will go over to the key subsequent events after fiscal year of 2022. On\nSeptember 2022, the company had announced the delay of the commencement of Yumen\nPlant to May 2023. On January 2023, the company closed the previous offering with gross\nproceeds of $2.2 million, mainly to fund its new Yumen plant and working capital for the new\nproduction facility.\nAnd now I'll turn the call over to Mr. Hu for closing remarks. And then we'll start the Q&A\nsession.\nBon Natural Life Limited\nFebruary 10, 2023 at 9:00 a.m. Eastern\n6\nRichard Hu\n[Speaking Chinese]\nSaini Liu\nThanks, everyone, for joining us today. Before I wrap up today's presentation, I would like to\nfirst recognize our employees for their efforts and thank our loyal customers for their trust in us.\nWe are confident that our R&D capability business model and strategy would enable us to gain\nmore market share and maintain our growth momentum.\nWith that, before we open to the call to your questions, I would like to note that for any\nquestions directed to management in China, we’ll translate both their questions and their\nanswers. If you want to ask your questions in Chinese, please also ask in English for the\nbenefit of listeners. Please also note that we'll only be able to respond to questions about our\nfinancial and operating results.\nWith that will now open the call to questions. Operator?\nQUESTIONS AND ANSWERS\nOperator\nWe will now begin the question and answer session. To ask a question, you may press star\nthen one on your touchtone phone. If you are using a speakerphone, please pick up your\nhandset before pressing the keys. To withdraw your question, please press star then two.\nFor those on the webcast, you may submit questions by typing in the Submit a Question box\non your screen. At this time, we will pause momentarily to assemble our roster.\nAnd our first question comes from Emma Lee, a private investor. Please go ahead.\nEmma Lee\nHi, thanks for taking my questions. I think my first question is for the CFO, Richard. I saw your\npress release that the company has postponed the completion of the Yumen Plant. I just want\nto know do you expect it to complete in May this year or there might be another delay? And\nalso how much production capability will the plant provide? Is there any existing demand for\nsuch increase or do you have [audio disruption] to meet the increased production? Thanks.\nTaylor Zhang\nLet me translate your question to the management. [Speaking Chinese]\nRichard Hu\n[Speaking Chinese]\nTaylor Zhang\nYour answer comes from the Chairman, CEO Mr. Richard Hu. So, the management does not\nforesee any further delay, especially after China is reopening after from the COVID-19\nBon Natural Life Limited\nFebruary 10, 2023 at 9:00 a.m. Eastern\n7\npandemic. So, they feel pretty confident that the company will be able to complete construction\nand also ramping up production around May this year.\nIn terms of production capacity, phase one is basically for fragrance compounds. Phase two is\nfor sale in bioactive ingredient food products. So, phase one, as we mentioned, will come alive\naround May, which will bring additional capacity, approximately 50 metric tons of fragrance\ncompounds products, which translates into about 200% in terms of production capacity\nincrease. In terms of revenue, the company expects that will be increased by about 150%.\nIn terms of bioactive for the ingredients products, which will come online around May this year,\nthe second phase, so that will bring additional 300 metric tons production capacity to the\ncompany.\nEmma Lee\nAll right, okay, thanks. I think my second question is also for Richard CEO. I noticed that your\ncompany has overseas expansion plans, but can you explain why does the earnings and sales\nratio of the overseas decline in 2022 compared to the 2021? Will you adjust the plan the future\nor you're going to keep this plan?\nTaylor Zhang\n[Speaking Chinese]\nRichard Hu\n[Speaking Chinese]\nTaylor Zhang\nSo the answer comes from Richard Hu, company Chairman and CEO. In terms of the\noverseas sales decline significantly in fiscal year 2022, there's two reasons. One is in March,\nApril and May of 2022, there was a significant congestion at the Port of Shanghai, which\ncaused the company unable to deliver to the customer. So that's factor one.\nThe second factor is due to the supply chain disruption globally, there's a huge shortage of raw\nmaterials the company needed for fragrance compounds and also certain bioactive food\ningredients materials. So those were primary reasons that the company’s overseas sales\ndeclined dramatically in fiscal year 2022.\nLooking forward, the company does not foresee any of these factors will play a role. So the\ncompany believes the company will resume its export business and the company does expect\nits overseas sales will pick up in fiscal year 2023.\nEmma Lee\nOkay, thanks. So one more question. My last question is for the CFO. I saw that the company's\naccounts receivable are over $6 million and increased by $1.3 million in 2022. Can you explain\nwhy the company has such a high level of accounts receivables? And do we have any better\nprovisions on that?\nBon Natural Life Limited\nFebruary 10, 2023 at 9:00 a.m. Eastern\n8\nTaylor Zhang\nLet me translate. [Speaking Chinese]\nZhenchao Li\n[Speaking Chinese]\nTaylor Zhang\nOkay. So, here's the answer from Mr. Li, the company's CFO. So, the payment terms the\ncompany gives the customer is universal, three months or 90 days. So throughout last year,\nthe company has not experienced any during delinquent payments, so all the payments are\naccording to the payment schedule.\nAs of now, in January this year, the company has pretty much collected all the balance that\nwas reflected in the balance sheet as of September 30, 2022. So the company does not have\nany bad debt provision.\nEmma Lee\nOkay, okay. All right. Thanks. I think I don't have any further questions on that. Thank you.\nTaylor Zhang\nSure. Thank you Emily.\nOperator\nOnce again, if you would like to ask a question, please press star then one.\nCONCLUSION\nOperator\nThis concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over\nto Saini Liu for any closing remarks.\nSaini Liu\nThank you, operator. On behalf of Bon, we want to thank you for your interest and participation\nin this call. If you'd like to speak with us further, please contact either Sophie or Maggie. Some\ncontact information is listed at the end of the press release. Thank you. Operator, back to you.\nOperator\nThe conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today’s presentation.

You should carefully consider the risks described\nbelow, together with all of the other information included in this annual report, before making an investment decision.\nIf any of the following risks actually occurs, our business, financial condition or results of operations could suffer. In\nthat case, the trading price of our common stock could decline, and you may lose all or part of your investment.\nRisks Related To Our Financial Condition and Business Model\nOur failure to appropriately respond to changing consumer preferences and demand for new products or\nproduct enhancements could significantly harm our customer relationships and product sales and harm our\nfinancial condition and operating results.\nOur business is subject to changing consumer trends and preferences, especially with respect to weight management;\ntargeted nutrition; energy, sports, and fitness; and other nutrition products. Our continued success depends in part on\nour ability to anticipate and respond to these changes, and we may not respond in a timely or commercially appropriate\nmanner to such changes. Furthermore, the nutritional supplement industry is characterized by rapid and frequent\nchanges in demand for products and new product introductions and enhancements. Our failure to accurately predict\nthese trends could negatively impact consumer opinion of our products and cause the loss of sales. Our short term new\nproduct development primarily focuses on health supplements, such as various powder drink products seeking to i)\nboost immunity; ii) prevent indigestion; iii) prevent respiratory infection; iv) prevent allergic skin reaction; v) improve\nsleep quality; vi) prevent memory loss and vii) alleviate anxiety. Our products have not been approved as effective in\ntreating or preventing any health conditions and/or diseases by a regulatory agency in the PRC. In terms of product\nenhancements, we are also working on increasing the purity of our bioactive food ingredients, such as our ultra-pure\nstachyose as a dietary supplement for infants, flavanols to seek intestine health improvement, procyanidin b2 to seek\nto promote hair growth, and high soluble and low residue sclareolide to seek weight management. The success of our\nnew product offerings and enhancements depends upon a number of factors, including our ability to:\n● accurately anticipate customer needs;\n3\n● innovate and develop new products or product enhancements that meet these needs;\n● successfully commercialize new products or product enhancements in a timely manner;\n● price our products competitively;\n● manufacture and deliver our products in sufficient volumes and in a timely manner; and\n● differentiate our product offerings from those of our competitors.\nIf we do not introduce new products or make enhancements to meet the changing needs of our customers in a timely\nmanner, some of our product offerings could be rendered obsolete, which could negatively impact our revenues,\nfinancial condition and operating results.\nIf we are unable to build sufficient distribution network to meet increasing demand of our products, our ability\nto execute on our business plan as outlined in this report will be impaired.\nWe sell our products through our direct sales force and distribution channel. Although our sales and distribution satisfy\nour existing business needs, they might be insufficient to meet demand for our products as we continue to grow our\nbusiness, which could result in harm to our sales and business operations, financial condition and results of operations.\nTo mitigate such risk, we intent to invest our internally generated cash from operations and capital to be raised to add\nadditional teams to our direct sales force, expand our geographic reach with new distribution channels into other\nprovinces within China and overseas, and establish more sales online. If our planned efforts to expand our sales and\ndistribution channels are not effective, our ability to execute on our business plan and to realize continued growth with\nbe impaired.\nProduction difficulties, quality control problems, inaccurate forecasting and reliance on third-party suppliers\ncould harm our business.\nProduction difficulties, quality control problems, inaccurate forecasting and our reliance on third party suppliers to\nmanufacture and deliver products that meet our specifications in a timely manner could harm our business. We could\nexperience production difficulties with respect to our products, including the availability of raw materials,\ncomponents, packaging and products that do not meet our specifications and quality control standards. These\nproduction difficulties and quality problems could result in stock outages or shortages in our markets with respect to\nsuch products, harm our sales, or create inventory write-downs for unusable products.\nThe inability to obtain adequate supplies of raw materials for products at favorable prices, or at all, could have\na material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations.\nWe acquire our raw materials for the manufacture of our products from third-party suppliers. Materials used in\nmanufacturing our products are purchased through purchase order, often invoking pre-negotiated supply agreements.\nWe have very few long-term agreements for the supply of these materials. There is a risk that any of our suppliers\ncould discontinue selling raw materials to us. Although we believe that we could establish alternate sources for most\nof our products, any delay in locating and establishing relationships with other sources could result in product\nshortages or back orders for products, with a resulting loss of net sales. In certain situations, we may be required to\nalter our products or to substitute different products from another source. There can be no assurance that suppliers will\nprovide the raw materials that are needed by us in the quantities that we request or at the prices that we are willing to\npay. Because we do not control the actual production of certain raw materials, we are also subject to delays caused by\nany interruption in the production of these materials, based on conditions not within our control, including weather,\ncrop conditions, transportation interruptions, strikes by supplier employees, and natural disasters or other catastrophic\nevents.\n4\nOur products have not been clinically proven to be safe or effective, and our quality control efforts are limited\nto ensuring ingredient and product purity and certain safety measures. If our products, or similar products\ndistributed by other companies, were prove or asserted to be unsafe or ineffective, our business would be\nharmed.\nOur products include nutritional supplements that are made from vitamins, minerals, herbs, and other substances for\nwhich there is a long history of human consumption. Some of our products contain innovative ingredients or\ncombinations of ingredients. Although we believe that all of our products are safe when taken as directed, there is\nlittle long-term experience with human consumption of certain of these product ingredients or combinations of\ningredients in concentrated form. We have not conducted clinical trials on the safety or efficacy of our products, and\nno government agency with authority has made any determination regarding their safety or efficacy. Our inspection\nand quality control efforts are limited to ensuring ingredient and product purity and quality. We follow industry best\npractices by inspecting sourced raw materials and finished products and formulating our products and in accordance\nto “ISO22000 Food Safety Management System-Procurement Control Procedure”, “People’s Republic of China\nNational Standard-Powder Drink”, and “People’s Republic of China Domestic Trade Industry Standard-Tablet\nCandy”. In addition to our self-inspections, we use authorized national food quality control and safety inspection\nagencies to inspect our raw materials and finished products. These inspections and practices, however, do not\nconstitute proof or assurance that our products are safe or effective. We could be adversely affected in the event that\nour products, or similar products distributed by other companies, were proven or are asserted to be ineffective or\nharmful to consumers or in the event of adverse publicity associated with any illness or other adverse effects resulting\nfrom consumers’ use or misuse of our products or similar products of our competitors.\nDisruptions resulting from the Covid-19 pandemic have had a material negative impact on our results of\noperations, and pose continuing additional risks to our operations.\nIn December 2019, a novel strain of COVID-19 was reported in Wuhan, China. On March 11, 2020, the World Health\nOrganization categorized it as a pandemic. To reduce the spread of the COVID-19, the Chinese government has\nemployed measures including city lockdowns, quarantines, travel restrictions, suspension of business activities and\nschool closures. Due to difficulties resulting from the COVID-19 outbreak, including, but not limited to, the temporary\nclosure of the Company’s factory and operations beginning in early February, limited support from the Company’s\nemployees, delayed access to raw material supplies and inability to deliver products to customers on a timely basis,\nthe Company’s business was negatively impacted and generated lower revenue and net income during the period from\nFebruary to April 2020. The Company resumed operations on March 2, 2020 and received and fulfilled an increasing\nnumber of customer orders in the second half of fiscal year 2020, especially for bioactive food ingredients, including\nStachyose due to local government recommendation and increasing consumer demand. Our revenues were\n$25,494,564 in fiscal year 2021, an increase of $7,274,605, or approximately 39.9% as compared to $18,219,959 in\nfiscal year 2020. Our net income increased by 48.8%, from $3,098,317 in fiscal year 2020 to $4,609,453 in fiscal year\n2021 because we fulfilled increased sales orders in fiscal year 2021 when COVID-19 was relatively under control in\nChina. Our revenues were $29,908,561 in fiscal year 2022, an increase of $4,413,997, or approximately 17.3% as\ncompared to $25,494,564 in fiscal year 2021 due to strong customer demand. Our net income increased from\n$4,609,453 in fiscal year 2021 to $6,242,424 in fiscal year 2022. As of the date of this annual report, although the\nnegative impact of the COVID-19 coronavirus outbreak on our business seems to be temporary in China, there is still\nuncertainty both in China and globally and potential disruption to business and the economy. A resurgence could\nnegatively affect the execution of customer contracts, the collection of customer payments, or disruption of the\nCompany’s supply chain. The continued uncertainties associated with COVID 19 may cause the Company’s revenue\nand cash flows to underperform in the next 12 months from the date of issuance of our 2022 consolidated financial\nstatements. The extent of the future impact of COVID-19 is still highly uncertain and cannot be predicted as of the\ndate of this report.\nWe may face increased competition from new and existing firms with greater capital resources, which could\ncause our market share and profitability to decline if we do not successfully meet competitive challenges.\nBecause of the strong prospects and recent growth of our existing business, we may face new direct competition from\nsome counterparts engaged in other categories of the natural products and ingredients business, such as Chenguang\nBiotech from China, which is engaged in natural colors, Layn, which engaged in natural sweeteners, and European\ncounterparts like Koninklijke DSM N.V., Symrise AG, and Givaudan SA. These firms may seek to compete directly\nwith Xi’an App-Chem in its existing businesses to some extent. The size, financial strength, technology foundation\nand development capabilities of the above-mentioned companies are strong, and potential competition from these\nfirms will be a key competitive challenge in the near future. In addition, large and well-developed food and food\ningredient companies may seek to enter the nutritional health space. These companies may challenge us by seeking to\nsecure key raw material sources for their products and to acquire stability, reliability and cost advantages for their\nsupply chains. Because of the strong capital and brand strength of such companies, they might pose challenges to us\nin the future. If we are unable to continue to expand, innovate, and collaborate to improve our market position in the\nface of new competition, our market share, revenues, and profitability will be adversely affected.\n5\nIf we do not obtain substantial additional financing, our ability to execute on our business plan as outlined in\nthis report will be impaired.\nOur plans for business expansion and development are dependent upon our raising significant additional capital. Our\nplans call for significant new investments in research and development, marketing, expanded productions capacity,\nand working capital for raw materials and other items. Management estimates that our capital needs for expansion\nwill be approximately $40 million. We will be required to seek additional investments, loans or debt financing to fully\npursue our business plans. Such additional investment may not be available to us on terms which are favorable or\nacceptable. Should we be unable to meet our full capital needs, our ability to fully implement our business plan will\nbe impaired.\nIf we are unable to retain key personnel and hire new key personnel, we may not be able to implement our\nbusiness plan.\nOur ability to succeed depends upon the experience and contributions of our key personnel, and in particular, our\nfounder and CEO, Mr. Hu. The loss of the services of these individuals, if they are not adequately replaced, could\nhave a substantial adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, and prospects. Our future success\nwill also depend on our ability to identify, attract, and retain additional qualified personnel as we expand our\noperations. There is no guarantee that we will be successful in identifying, attracting, and retaining such personnel.\nConsequently, the loss of any of those individuals may have a substantial effect on our future success or failure. We\nmay have to recruit qualified personnel with competitive compensation packages, equity participation, and other\nbenefits that may affect the working capital available for our operations. Management may have to seek to obtain\noutside independent professionals to assist them in assessing the merits and risks of any business proposals as well as\nassisting in the development and operation of many company projects. No assurance can be given that we will be able\nto obtain such needed assistance on terms acceptable to us. Our failure to attract additional qualified employees or to\nretain the services of key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial\ncondition.\nNegative publicity may harm our brand and reputation and have a material adverse effect on our business.\nNegative publicity about us, including our services, management, business model and practices, compliance with\napplicable rules, regulations and policies, or our network partners may materially and adversely harm our brand and\nreputation and have a material adverse effect on our business. We cannot assure you that we will be able to defuse any\nsuch negative publicity within a reasonable period of time, or at all. Additionally, allegations, directly or indirectly\nagainst us, may be posted on the internet by anyone on a named or anonymous basis, and can be quickly and widely\ndisseminated. Information posted may be inaccurate, misleading and adverse to us, and it may harm our reputation,\nbusiness or prospects. The harm may be immediate without affording us an opportunity for redress or correction. Our\nreputation may be negatively affected as a result of the public dissemination of negative and potentially inaccurate or\nmisleading information about our business and operations, which in turn may materially adversely affect our\nrelationships with our customers, employees or business partners, and adversely affect the price of our Shares.\nBecause we are an “emerging growth company,” we may take advantage of certain exemptions from various\nreporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not “emerging growth\ncompanies.”\nWe are an “emerging growth company” as defined under the Jumpstart our Business Startups Act (“JOBS Act”). We\nwill remain an “emerging growth company” for up to five years, or until the earliest of:\n(i) the last day of the first fiscal year in which our total annual gross revenues exceed $1.07 billion,\n(ii) the date that we become a “large accelerated filer” as defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Securities Exchange\nAct of 1934, which would occur if the market value of our ordinary shares that is held by non-affiliates\nexceeds $700 million as of the last business day of our most recently completed second fiscal quarter, or\n(iii) the date on which we have issued more than $1 billion in non-convertible debt during the preceding three-\nyear period.\n6\nAs an “emerging growth company”, we may take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting\nrequirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not “emerging growth companies” including, but\nnot limited to:\n● not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-\nOxley Act (“Sarbanes Oxley”) (we also will not be subject to the auditor attestation requirements of section\n404(b) as long as we are a “smaller reporting company”, which includes issuers that had a public float of less\nthan $75 million as of the last business day of their most recently completed second fiscal quarter);\n● reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy\nstatements; and\n● exemptions from the requirements of holding a non-binding advisory vote on executive compensation and\nshareholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved.\nIn addition, section 107 of the JOBS Act provides that an “emerging growth company” can take advantage of the\nextended transition period provided in section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act of 1933 (the “Securities Act”) for\ncomplying with new or revised accounting standards. Under this provision, an “emerging growth company” can delay\nthe adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies.\nHowever, we are choosing to “opt out” of such extended transition period and, as a result, we will comply with new\nor revised accounting standards on the relevant dates on which adoption of such standards is required for non-emerging\ngrowth companies. Section 107 of the JOBS Act provides that our decision to opt out of the extended transition period\nfor complying with new or revised accounting standards is irrevocable.\nRisks Related to Our Corporate Structure\nWe previously carried out our online sales through the ICP license held by Xi’an App-Chem by means of\nContractual Arrangements. If the PRC government determines that these contractual arrangements did not\ncomply with PRC regulations relating to the relevant industries, or if these regulations or the interpretation of\nexisting regulations change in the future, we could be subject to severe penalties or be forced to relinquish our\ninterests in those operations.\nDue to PRC legal restrictions on foreign ownership in companies that engage in online sales China, we originally\ncarried out our business through Xi’an App-Chem, a domestic PRC company holding a value-added\ntelecommunications license, through a variable interest entity structure.\nHowever, our online sales have historically generated minimal revenues. On September 28, 2021, our Board of\nDirectors approved a restructuring of our corporate structure to terminate the original VIE contractual agreements, to\nconvert Xi’an App-Chem from a PRC domestic company into a Sino-foreign joint venture, and to transfer 100% of\nthe ownership interests in Xi’an App-Chem from its original shareholders to Xi’an CMIT and Xi’an Youpincui. On\nOctober 21, 2021, Xi’an Ap-Chem’s original shareholders signed the share transfer agreement to transfer their 100%\nownership interest in Xi-an App-Chem to Xi’an CMIT and Xi’an Youpincui. On October 22, 2021, Xi-an App-Chem\ncompleted its business license registration with PRC government and became a foreign investment enterprise\nHowever, even though we terminated the original VIE contractual agreements, there are still substantial uncertainties\nregarding the interpretation and application of current and future PRC laws, regulations and rules in respect of our\nprevious use of the variable interest entity structure; accordingly, the PRC regulatory authorities may impose severe\npenalties retroactively.\nIf we were subject to severe penalties retroactively, the relevant PRC regulatory authorities would have broad\ndiscretion to take action in dealing with such violations and failures, including:\n● revoking the business and operating licenses of such entities;\n● discontinuing or placing restrictions or onerous conditions on our operations;\n● imposing fines, confiscating the income from our PRC subsidiaries, or imposing other requirements with\nwhich we or our PRC entities may not be able to comply;\n● restricting or prohibiting our use of the proceeds from a U.S. public offering to finance our business and\noperations in China.\n7\nAny of these actions could cause significant disruption to our business operations and severely damage our reputation,\nwhich would in turn materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur current corporate structure and business operations may be affected by the newly enacted Foreign\nInvestment Law.\nOn March 15, 2019, the National People’s Congress approved the Foreign Investment Law, which came into effect\non January 1, 2020. Along with the Foreign Investment Law, the Implementing Rules of Foreign Investment Law\npromulgated by the State Council and the Interpretation of the Supreme People’s Court on Several Issues Concerning\nthe Application of the Foreign Investment Law promulgated by the Supreme People’s Court became effective on\nJanuary 1, 2020. Since the Foreign Investment Law and its current implementation and interpretation rules are\nrelatively new, uncertainties still exist in relation to their further application and improvement.\nThe Foreign Investment Law grants national treatment to foreign-invested entities, except for those foreign-invested\nentities that operate in industries specified as either “restricted” or “prohibited” from foreign investment in a “negative\nlist”. It is unclear whether the “negative list” to be published pursuant to the Foreign Investment Law will differ from\nthe current Special Administrative Measures for Market Access of Foreign Investment (Negative List) (2021 Version).\nThe Foreign Investment Law provides that foreign-invested entities operating in “restricted” industries will require\nmarket entry clearance and other approvals from relevant PRC government authorities. As of the date hereto, the\ncurrent business activities of our PRC subsidiaries are not within the “negative list”, and foreign investors are allowed\nto hold 100% equity interests of our PRC subsidiaries under the Foreign Investment Law. We have no plans at the\npresent to substantially change our PRC subsidiaries’ business activities in the future. However, it’s uncertain whether\nwe will engage in business activities that are in the “negative list”, as the “negative list” may be amended from time\nto time.\nRisks Related to Legal Uncertainty and Doing Business in China\nBecause all of our operations are in China, our business is subject to the complex and rapidly evolving laws\nand regulations there. The Chinese government may exercise significant oversight and discretion over the\nconduct of our business and may intervene in or influence our operations at any time, which could result in a\nmaterial change in our operations and/or the value of our ordinary shares.\nAs all of our business operations are conducted in China, we are subject to the laws and regulations of the PRC, which\ncan be complex and evolve rapidly. The PRC legal system is based on written statutes. Unlike common law systems,\nit is a system in which legal cases have limited value as precedents. In the late 1970s, the PRC government began to\npromulgate a comprehensive system of laws and regulations governing economic matters in general. The overall effect\nof legislation over the past four decades has significantly increased the protections afforded to various forms of foreign\nor private-sector investment in China.\nAs relevant laws and regulations are relatively new and the PRC legal system continues to rapidly evolve with little\nadvance notice, the interpretations of many laws, regulations and rules are not always uniform and enforcement of\nthese laws, regulations and rules involve uncertainties. The PRC government has the power to exercise significant\noversight and discretion over the conduct of our business, and the regulations to which we are subject may change\nrapidly and with little notice to us or our shareholders. As a result, the application, interpretation, and enforcement of\nnew and existing laws and regulations in the PRC are often uncertain. In addition, these laws and regulations may be\ninterpreted and applied inconsistently by different agencies or authorities, and inconsistently with our current policies\nand practices. New laws, regulations, and other government directives in the PRC may also be costly to comply with,\nand such compliance or any associated inquiries or investigations or any other government actions may:\n● Delay or impede our development,\n● Result in negative publicity or increase our operating costs,\n● Require significant management time and attention, and\n● Subject us to remedies, administrative penalties and even criminal liabilities that may harm our business,\nincluding fines assessed for our current or historical operations, or demands or orders that we modify or even\ncease our business practices.\n8\nThe promulgation of new laws or regulations, or the new interpretation of existing laws and regulations, in each case\nthat restrict or otherwise unfavorably impact the ability or manner in which we conduct our business and could require\nus to change certain aspects of our business to ensure compliance, which could decrease demand for our products,\nreduce revenues, increase costs, require us to obtain more licenses, permits, approvals or certificates, or subject us to\nadditional liabilities. To the extent any new or more stringent measures are required to be implemented, our business,\nfinancial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected as well as materially decrease the value of\nour ordinary shares.\nIf the Chinese government chooses to exert more oversight and control over offerings that are conducted\noverseas and/or foreign investment in China-based issuers, such action could significantly limit or completely\nhinder our ability to offer or continue to offer securities to investors and cause the value of such securities to\nsignificantly decline or be worthless.\nRecent statements by the Chinese government have indicated an intent to exert more oversight and control over\nofferings that are conducted overseas and/or foreign investments in China based issuers. PRC has recently proposed\nnew rules that would require companies collecting or holding large amounts of data to undergo a cybersecurity review\nprior to listing in foreign countries, a move that would significantly tighten oversight over China-based internet giants.\nOn July 10, 2021, the CAC issued a revised draft of the Measures for Cybersecurity Review for public comments,\nwhich required that, among others, in addition to “operator of critical information infrastructure”, any “data processor”\ncontrolling personal information of no less than one million users which seeks to list in a foreign stock exchange\nshould also be subject to cybersecurity review, and further elaborated the factors to be considered when assessing the\nnational security risks of the relevant activities. Later on December 28, 2021, the Measures for Cybersecurity Review\n(2021 version) was promulgated and became effective on February 15, 2022, which iterates that any “online platform\noperators” controlling personal information of more than one million users which seeks to list in a foreign stock\nexchange should also be subject to cybersecurity review. On November 14, 2021, the CAC published the Network\nInternet Data Protection Draft Regulations (draft for comments), which reiterates that data handlers that process the\npersonal information of more than one million users listing in a foreign country should apply for a cybersecurity\nreview.\nOur business does not involve the collection of user data, implicate cybersecurity, or involve any other type of\nrestricted industry and we do not believe we are among the “operator of critical information infrastructure”, “data\nprocessor”, “online platform operators” or “data handler” as mentioned above. However, since the Measures for\nCybersecurity Review (2021 version) was newly adopted and the Network Internet Data Protection Draft Regulations\n(draft for comments) is in the process of being formulated, it is unclear on how it will be interpreted, amended and\nimplemented by the relevant PRC governmental authorities. Thus we could not assure you that we will not be deemed\nas the “operator of critical information infrastructure”, “data processor”, “online platform operators” or “data handler”\nas mentioned above. We believe that, as of the date of this prospectus, the Company and its subsidiaries, (1) are not\nrequired to obtain permissions or approvals from any PRC authorities to operate or issue our Ordinary Shares to\nforeign investors; and (2) are not subject to permission requirements from the China Securities Regulatory\nCommission (the “CSRC”), the Cyberspace Administration of China (the “CAC”) or any other entity that is required\nto approve of our operations. As of the date of this prospectus, we and our PRC subsidiaries have not been involved\nin any investigations on cybersecurity review initiated by the CAC or related governmental regulatory authorities, and\nhave not received any requirements to obtain permissions from any PRC authorities to issue our ordinary shares to\nforeign investors or were denied such permissions by any PRC authorities. Uncertainties still exist due to the\npossibility that laws, regulations, or policies in the PRC could change rapidly in the future. Any future action by the\nPRC government expanding the categories of industries and companies whose foreign securities offerings are subject\nto review by the CRSC or the CAC could significantly limit or completely hinder our ability to offer or continue to\noffer securities to investors and could cause the value of such securities to significantly decline or be worthless.\nIf the Chinese government were to impose new requirements for approval from the PRC Authorities to issue\nour ordinary shares to foreign investors or list on a foreign exchange, such action could significantly limit or\ncompletely hinder our ability to offer or continue to offer securities to investors and cause the value of such\nsecurities to significantly decline or be worthless.\nRecently, the General Office of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the General Office of\nthe State Council jointly issued the “Opinions on Severely Cracking Down on Illegal Securities Activities According\nto Law,” or the Opinions, which was made available to the public on July 6, 2021. The Opinions emphasized the need\nto strengthen the administration over illegal securities activities, and the need to strengthen the supervision over\noverseas listings by Chinese companies. Effective measures, such as promoting the construction of relevant regulatory\nsystems will be taken to deal with the risks and incidents of China-concept overseas listed companies, and\ncybersecurity and data privacy protection requirements and similar matters.\n9\nOn December 24, 2021, the CSRC released the Administrative Provisions of the State Council Regarding the Overseas\nIssuance and Listing of Securities by Domestic Enterprises (Draft for Comments) and the Measures for the Overseas\nIssuance of Securities and Listing Record-Filings by Domestic Enterprises (Draft for Comments), which were\npublished for public comments only with the comment period expired on January 23, 2022. The Draft Rules Regarding\nOverseas Listing lay out the filing regulation arrangement for both direct and indirect overseas listing, and clarify the\ndetermination criteria for indirect overseas listing in overseas market.\nThe Draft Rules Regarding Overseas Listing stipulate that the Chinese-based companies, or the issuer, shall fulfill the\nfiling procedures within three working days after the issuer makes an application for initial public offering and listing\nin an overseas market. The required filing materials for an initial public offering and listing should include at least the\nfollowing: record-filing report and related undertakings; regulatory opinions, record-filing, approval and other\ndocuments issued by competent regulatory authorities of relevant industries (if applicable); and security assessment\nopinion issued by relevant regulatory authorities (if applicable); PRC legal opinion; and prospectus.\nIn addition, an overseas offering and listing is prohibited under any of the following circumstances: (1) if the intended\nsecurities offering and listing is specifically prohibited by national laws and regulations and relevant provisions; (2)\nif the intended securities offering and listing may constitute a threat to or endangers national security as reviewed and\ndetermined by competent authorities under the State Council in accordance with law; (3) if there are material\nownership disputes over the equity, major assets, and core technology, etc. of the issuer; (4) if, in the past three years,\nthe domestic enterprise or its controlling shareholders or actual controllers have committed corruption, bribery,\nembezzlement, misappropriation of property, or other criminal offenses disruptive to the order of the socialist market\neconomy, or are currently under judicial investigation for suspicion of criminal offenses, or are under investigation\nfor suspicion of major violations; (5) if, in past three years, directors, supervisors, or senior executives have been\nsubject to administrative punishments for severe violations, or are currently under judicial investigation for suspicion\nof criminal offenses, or are under investigation for suspicion of major violations; (6) other circumstances as prescribed\nby the State Council. The Administration Provisions defines the legal liabilities of breaches such as failure in fulfilling\nfiling obligations or fraudulent filing conducts, imposing a fine between RMB 1 million and RMB 10 million, and in\ncases of severe violations, a parallel order to suspend relevant business or halt operation for rectification, revoke\nrelevant business permits or operational license.\nHowever, as of the date of this prospectus, the Draft Rules Regarding Overseas Listing have not yet gone into effect,\nit is still uncertain how PRC governmental authorities will regulate overseas listing in general and whether we are\nrequired to obtain any specific regulatory approvals or to fulfill any record-filing requirements. The Draft Rules\nRegarding Overseas Listing, if enacted, may subject us to additional compliance requirement in the future, and we\ncannot assure you that we will be able to get the clearance of filing procedures under the Draft Rules Regarding\nOverseas List on a timely basis, or at all. If we do not receive any required approvals or record-filing or if we\nincorrectly conclude that approvals or record-filing are not required or if the CSRC or other regulatory agencies\npromulgate new rules, explanations or interpretations requiring that we obtain their prior approvals or ex-post record-\nfiling for this offering and any follow-on offering, we may be unable to obtain such approvals and record-filing which\ncould significantly limit or completely hinder our ability to offer or continue to offer securities to our investors.\nFurthermore, the PRC government authorities may strengthen oversight and control over offerings that are conducted\noverseas and/or foreign investment in China-based issuers like us. Such actions taken by the PRC government\nauthorities may intervene or influence our operations at any time, which are beyond our control. Therefore, any such\naction may adversely affect our operations and significantly limit or hinder our ability to offer or continue to offer\nsecurities and reduce the value of such securities.\nAs of the date of this prospectus, we and our PRC subsidiaries have not been involved in any investigations on\ncybersecurity review initiated by the Cyber Administration of China or related governmental regulatory authorities,\nand have not received any requirements to obtain permissions from any PRC authorities to issue our Ordinary Shares\nto foreign investors or were denied such permissions by any PRC authorities. However, given the current PRC\nregulatory environment, it is uncertain when and whether we or our PRC subsidiaries, will be required to obtain\npermission from the PRC government to list on U.S. exchanges in the future, and even when such permission is\nobtained, whether it will be denied or rescinded.\n10\nWe have been closely monitoring regulatory developments in China regarding any necessary approvals from the\nCSRC or other PRC governmental authorities required for overseas listings, including this offering As of the date of\nthis prospectus, except for the potential uncertainties disclosed above, we have not received any inquiry, notice,\nwarning, sanctions or regulatory objection to this offering from the CSRC or other PRC governmental authorities.\nHowever, there remains significant uncertainty as to the enactment, interpretation and implementation of regulatory\nrequirements related to overseas securities offerings and other capital markets activities. If it is determined in the\nfuture that the approval of the CSRC, the CAC or any other regulatory authority is required for this offering, the\noffering will be delayed until we have obtained the relevant approvals. There is also the possibility that we may not\nbe able to obtain or maintain such approval or that we inadvertently concluded that such approval was not required. If\nthe approval was required while we inadvertently concluded that such approval was not required or if applicable laws\nand regulations or the interpretation of such were modified to require us to obtain the CSRC approval in the future,\nwe may face sanctions by the CSRC, the CAC or other PRC regulatory agencies. These regulatory agencies may\nimpose fines and penalties on our operations in China, limit our ability to pay dividends outside of China, limit our\noperations in China, delay or restrict the repatriation of the proceeds from this offering into China or take other actions\nthat could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects, as\nwell as the trading price of our securities. The CSRC, the CAC, or other PRC regulatory agencies also may take actions\nrequiring us, or making it advisable for us, to halt this offering before settlement and delivery of our ordinary shares.\nConsequently, if you engage in market trading or other activities in anticipation of and prior to settlement and delivery,\nyou do so at the risk that settlement and delivery may not occur. In addition, if the CSRC, the CAC or other regulatory\nPRC agencies later promulgate new rules requiring that we obtain their approvals for this offering, we may be unable\nto obtain a waiver of such approval requirements, if and when procedures are established to obtain such a waiver. Any\nuncertainties and/or negative publicity regarding such an approval requirement could have a material adverse effect\non the trading price of our securities.\nChanges in China’s economic, political or social conditions or government policies could have a material\nadverse effect on our business and operations.\nAll of our assets and operations are located in China. Accordingly, our business, financial condition, results of\noperations and prospects may be influenced to a significant degree by political, economic and social conditions in\nChina generally. The Chinese economy differs from the economies of most developed countries in many respects,\nincluding the level of government involvement, level of development, growth rate, control of foreign exchange and\nallocation of resources. Although the Chinese government has implemented measures emphasizing the utilization of\nmarket forces for economic reform, the reduction of state ownership of productive assets, and the establishment of\nimproved corporate governance in business enterprises, a substantial portion of productive assets in China is still\nowned by the government. In addition, the Chinese government continues to play a significant role in regulating\nindustry development by imposing industrial policies. The Chinese government also exercises significant control over\nChina’s economic growth through allocating resources, controlling payment of foreign currency-denominated\nobligations, setting monetary policy, and providing preferential treatment to particular industries or companies.\nWhile the Chinese economy has experienced significant growth over the past decades, growth has been uneven, both\ngeographically and among various sectors of the economy, and the rate of growth has been slowing since 2012. Any\nadverse changes in economic conditions in China, in the policies of the Chinese government or in the laws and\nregulations in China could have a material adverse effect on the overall economic growth of China. Such developments\ncould adversely affect our business and operating results, lead to reduction in demand for our services and adversely\naffect our competitive position. The Chinese government has implemented various measures to encourage economic\ngrowth and guide the allocation of resources. Some of these measures may benefit the overall Chinese economy but\nmay have a negative effect on us. For example, our financial condition and results of operations may be adversely\naffected by government control over capital investments or changes in tax regulations. In addition, in the past the\nChinese government has implemented certain measures, including interest rate adjustment, to control the pace of\neconomic growth. These measures may cause decreased economic activity in China, which may adversely affect our\nbusiness and operating results.\n11\nWe may incur material product liability claims, which could increase our costs and harm our financial\ncondition and operating results.\nOur ingestible products include milk thistle extracts, apple polyphenol and other ingredients and are classified as foods\nor raw materials of dietary supplements and, unlike prescription medication, our product formulas are not subject to\npre-market regulatory approval with respect to medical efforts in China in which our products are distributed. Our\nproducts could contain contaminated substances, and some of our products contain some ingredients that do not have\nlong histories of human consumption. We rely upon published and unpublished safety information including clinical\nstudies on ingredients used in our products. These studies include “Safety and toxicity of silymarin, the major\nconstituent of milk thistle extract: An updated review” [available at\nhttps://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ptr.6361], “The toxicology and safety of apple polyphenol extract”\n[available at https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0278691504000493?via%3Dihub], “Public\nAnnouncement Regarding Haematococcus Pluvialis and Other New Resource Food” [Evaluation Division of Food\nSafety Standard and Inspection,” No. 17 issued on October 29, 2010] [available at\nhttp://www.nhc.gov.cn/sps/s7891/201011/7957c2f1326c4990b5e67ce2d3ceb783.shtml?from=singlemessage&isappi\nnstalled=0] (indicating that Stachyose is a safe ordinary food) and other reports by independent research institutions.\nIn addition, stachyose is permitted for ordinary food production by the Ministry of Health of China. We do not,\nhowever, conduct or sponsor clinical studies of our products. Previously unknown adverse reactions resulting from\nhuman consumption of these ingredients could occur. As a marketer of dietary and nutritional supplements and other\nproducts that are ingested by consumers or applied to their bodies, we may be subjected to various product liability\nclaims, including that (i) the products contain contaminants, (ii) the products include inadequate instructions as to\ntheir uses, or (iii) the products include inadequate warnings concerning side effects and interactions with other\nsubstances. It is possible that widespread product liability claims could increase our costs, and adversely affect our\nrevenues and operating income.\nFood safety regulations regarding the raw ingredients for our products may restrict, inhibit or delay our ability\nto sell our products.\nBefore 2018, the China Food and Drug Administration, or the CFDA, had the regulatory authority to oversee,\nadminister and enforce all laws, regulations and rules concerning the food industry business operations in China. After\nthe institutions reformed, the CFDA has been abolished, and relevant regulatory authority has been taken over by the\nState Administration for Market Regulation, or the SAMR, under the State Council.\nThe food industry is subject to extensive regulations in China. The PRC laws and regulations governing the food\nindustry primarily consist of the PRC Food Safety Law (2009), as last amended in 2018; the Implementation\nRegulation for the Food Safety Law of PRRC (2009), or the Food Safety Regulation, as amended in 2019; the\nAdministrative Measures for Food Production Licensing (2010), or the Food Production Licensing Rule, as amended\nin 2020; and the Administrative Measures for Food Business Licensing (2015), or the Food Business Licensing Rule,\nas amended in 2017. Under the PRC Food Safety Law and the Food Safety Regulation, food product manufacturers\nand business operators shall obtain the required food production permits; food producers and business operators are\nsubject to regular quality inspection and supervision by the local governmental agencies and their product permits\nmay be revoked if they no longer meet the standards and requirements for food production and operation; food-\nproducing enterprises shall establish and implement food safety management systems, such as ingredient inspection\nand acceptance, production process safety management, storage management, equipment management, and\nsubstandard product management systems; and packaging of pre-packed food shall bear a label which states\nmanufacturing permit serial number; among other things. The State Council implements a licensing system for food\nproduct manufacture and distribution. According to the Food Production Licensing Rule, a food production license\nmust be obtained prior to engaging in food production activities in the PRC. The Food Business Licensing Rule\nrequires food business operators to obtain a food business license for each business entity engaging in food business\noperations. We have obtained the required Food Production Licenses and Food Business Licenses for related products.\nIn order for our business to continue, we must continue to comply with all government inspection and licensing\nrequirements. If we were to have an unsatisfactory inspection, or otherwise fail to comply with government safety\nregulations in all respects, our ability to continue operations and to continue to sell our products may be inhibited or\ndelayed. Additionally, the term of Food Production Licenses and Food Business Licenses is 5 years. We have been\nclosely monitoring the status of all the permits and have applied for renewal before the relevant licenses expired. The\nfailure to renew the relevant licenses and/or registrations may subject us to fines or sanctions which will have negative\nimpact on our production.\n12\nAny disruption of our factories or our suppliers’ factories could materially and adversely affect our business\nand results of operations.\nCurrently, our products are primarily produced at our factories located in China. We also rely on our suppliers to\nproduce raw materials and components of our products. Nevertheless, natural disasters or other unanticipated\ncatastrophic events, including storms, fires, explosions, earthquakes, terrorist attacks and wars, as well as changes in\ngovernmental planning for the land where our factories or our suppliers’ factories are located could significantly\nimpair our ability to manufacture our products and operate our business. Catastrophic events could also destroy the\ninventories stored in and those suppliers’ factories. The occurrence of any catastrophic event could result in the\ntemporary or long-term closure of manufacturing facilities, and severely disrupt our business operations.\nIn addition, the factories are subject to fire control and environmental inspections and regulations. As of the date of\nthis report, we cannot assure you that all the factories were in strict compliance with such fire control and\nenvironmental inspections and regulations based on our knowledge. If such facilities fail to rectify and pass the fire\ncontrol and environmental inspections or comply with relevant fire control and environmental requirements relating\nto production activities in a timely manner, they may be subject to fines, cohesive rectification, suspension and closure,\nwhich may materially and adversely affect the production of our factories and in turn may impact our business. In the\nevent of any changes in the PRC laws and/or regulations and/or government policies on environmental protection and\nmore stringent requirements are imposed on Company, we may have to incur extra costs and expenses to comply with\nsuch requirements and our business and results of operations may be adversely affected. In addition, such facilities\nare also subject to health and safety laws and regulations imposed by the PRC governmental authorities to ensure a\nhealthy and safe production environment. Failure to comply with the existing and future health and safety laws and\nregulations could subject the factories to monetary damages and fines, disruption to production plans, suspension of\ntheir operations, which may in turn materially and adversely affect our business operations. Furthermore, if any on-\nsite personnel at such facilities is suspected of having any communicable diseases, such as COVID-19, such facilities\nmay be subject to temporary closure and quarantine requirements, which may in turn materially and adversely affect\nour business operations.\nFurthermore, various special equipment, such as boilers, pressure vessels, pressure pipes, and elevators, was in use\non-site in these factories, which involve a high degree of safety risks. Proprietors using special equipment shall, before\nor within 30 days after such special equipment is put into use, handle registration with the department in charge of the\nsupervision and administration of special equipment safety and obtain the registration license. The operators and\nrelevant managerial staff may not engage in corresponding operations or management until they pass certain\nexamination and acquire the certificates of special operators. As of the date of this report, we cannot assure you that\nall such special equipment has been registered with the local governmental authorities as legally required or all\noperators and relevant managerial staff have obtained relevant qualifications. Failure to comply with such regulations\nmay subject the factories to orders to take corrective action within a stipulated time, fines and suspension of their\noperations, which may in turn materially and adversely affect our business operations.\nBesides, some of our factories are located on leased properties. Though such leases are renewable upon expiration,\nour ability to renew existing leases upon their expiration is crucial to our production activities, operations and\nprofitability. If we are unable to negotiate for a renewal of the relevant leases, we may be forced to relocate our\nproduction bases and it may be difficult and costly to replace or relocate our factories and equipment on a timely basis.\nWe have not registered the lease agreement relating to our factories and offices with the PRC governmental authorities\nas required by PRC law and thus we may be ordered by the PRC government authorities to rectify such noncompliance\nor we may be subject to fines imposed by PRC government authorities. See also “We are subject to risks relating to\nour leased properties.”\nIf we experience any unanticipated disruptions to us or our suppliers or if we are unable to renew our current leases,\nour production will be severely disrupted, which may in turn materially and adversely affect our business, financial\ncondition and results of operations.\nWe are subject to risks relating to our leased properties\nWe lease certain real properties from third parties primarily for our production facilities and offices in China, and such\nlease agreements for these properties have not been registered with the PRC governmental authorities as required by\nPRC law. Although the failure to do so does not in itself invalidate the leases, we may be ordered by the PRC\ngovernment authorities to rectify such noncompliance and, if such noncompliance is not rectified within a given period\nof time, we may be subject to fines imposed by PRC government authorities ranging from RMB1,000 and RMB10,000\nfor each lease agreement that has not been registered with the relevant PRC governmental authorities.\n13\nThe ownership certificates or other similar proof of our leased properties have not been provided to us by the relevant\nlessors. Therefore, we cannot assure you that such lessors are entitled to lease the relevant real properties to us. If the\nlessors are not entitled to lease the real properties to us and the owners of such real properties decline to ratify the\nlease agreements between us and the respective lessors, we may not be able to enforce our rights to lease such\nproperties under the respective lease agreements against the owners. As of the date of this report, we are not aware of\nany claim or challenge brought by any third parties concerning the use of our leased properties without obtaining\nproper ownership proof. If our lease agreements are claimed as null and void by third parties who are the real owners\nof such leased real properties, we could be required to vacate the properties, in the event of which we could only\ninitiate the claim against the lessors under relevant lease agreements for indemnities for their breach of the relevant\nleasing agreements. We cannot assure you that suitable alternative locations are readily available on commercially\nreasonable terms, or at all, and if we are unable to relocate our officers in a timely manner, our operations may be\ninterrupted.\nWe may not be able to protect our intellectual property rights.\nWe rely on a combination of trademark, fair trade practice, patent, copyright and trade secret protection laws in China.\nIntellectual property protection may not be sufficient in China. Accordingly, we may not be able to effectively protect\nour intellectual property rights or to enforce our patent rights in China. In addition, policing any unauthorized use of\nour intellectual property is difficult, time-consuming and costly and the steps we have taken may be inadequate to\nprevent the misappropriation of our intellectual property. In the event that we resort to litigation to enforce our\nintellectual property rights, such litigation could result in substantial costs and a diversion of our managerial and\nfinancial resources. We can provide no assurance that we will prevail in such litigation. In addition, our trade secrets\nmay be leaked or otherwise become available to, or be independently discovered by, our competitors. Any failure in\nprotecting or enforcing our intellectual property rights could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial\ncondition and results of operations.\nUncertainties with respect to the PRC legal system could adversely affect us.\nThe PRC legal system is a civil law system based on written statutes. Unlike the common law system, prior court\ndecisions under the civil law system may be cited for reference but have limited precedential value.\nIn 1979, the PRC government began to promulgate a comprehensive system of laws and regulations governing\neconomic matters in general. The overall effect of legislation over the past three decades has significantly enhanced\nthe protections afforded to various forms of foreign investments in China. However, China has not developed a fully\nintegrated legal system, and recently enacted laws and regulations may not sufficiently cover all aspects of economic\nactivities in China. In particular, the interpretation and enforcement of these laws and regulations involve uncertainties.\nSince PRC administrative and court authorities have significant discretion in interpreting and implementing statutory\nprovisions and contractual terms, it may be difficult to evaluate the outcome of administrative and court proceedings\nand the level of legal protection we enjoy. These uncertainties may affect our judgment on the relevance of legal\nrequirements and our ability to enforce our contractual rights or tort claims. In addition, the regulatory uncertainties\nmay be exploited through unmerited or frivolous legal actions or threats in attempts to extract payments or benefits\nfrom us.\nFurthermore, the PRC legal system is based in part on government policies and internal rules, some of which are not\npublished on a timely basis or at all and may have retroactive effect. As a result, we may not be aware of our violation\nof any of these policies and rules until sometime after the violation. In addition, any administrative and court\nproceedings in China may be protracted, resulting in substantial costs and diversion of resources and management\nattention.\nYou may experience difficulties in effecting service of legal process, enforcing foreign judgments or bringing\nactions in China against us or our management named in the report based on foreign laws.\nWe are a company incorporated under the laws of the Cayman Islands, we conduct substantially all of our operations\nin China, and substantially all of our assets are located in China. In addition, all our senior executive officers reside\nwithin China for a significant portion of the time and most are PRC nationals. As a result, it may be difficult for our\nshareholders to effect service of process upon us or those persons inside China. In addition, China does not have\ntreaties providing for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments of courts with the Cayman Islands and\nmany other countries and regions. Therefore, recognition and enforcement in China of judgments of a court in any of\nthese non-PRC jurisdictions in relation to any matter not subject to a binding arbitration provision may be difficult or\nimpossible.\n14\nShareholder claims that are common in the United States, including securities law class actions and fraud claims,\ngenerally are difficult to pursue as a matter of law or practicality in China. For example, in China, there are significant\nlegal and other obstacles to obtaining information needed for shareholder investigations or litigation outside China or\notherwise with respect to foreign entities. According to Article 177 of the PRC Securities Law which was amended in\nDecember 2019, no overseas securities regulator is allowed to directly conduct investigation or evidence collection\nactivities within the territory of the PRC. Accordingly, without the consent of the competent PRC securities regulators\nand relevant authorities, no organization or individual may provide the documents and materials relating to securities\nbusiness activities to overseas parties, leaving no mechanism to obtain information or conduct an investigation, if\nnecessary\nWe may rely on dividends and other distributions on equity paid by our PRC subsidiary to fund any cash and\nfinancing requirements we may have, and any limitation on the ability of our PRC subsidiary to make payments\nto us could have a material and adverse effect on our ability to conduct our business.\nWe are a Cayman Islands holding company and we rely principally on dividends and other distributions on equity\nfrom our PRC subsidiary for our cash requirements, including for services of any debt we may incur. Our subsidiary’s\nability to distribute dividends is based upon its distributable earnings. Current PRC regulations permit our PRC\nsubsidiary to pay dividends to their respective shareholders only out of their accumulated profits, if any, determined\nin accordance with PRC accounting standards and regulations. In addition, our PRC subsidiary and its subsidiaries are\nrequired to set aside at least 10% of their after-tax profits each year, if any, to fund a statutory reserve until such\nreserve reaches 50% of their registered capital. These reserves are not distributable as cash dividends. A company\nmay discontinue the contribution when the aggregate sum of the statutory surplus reserve is more than 50% of its\nregistered capital. The statutory common reserve fund of a company shall be used to cover the losses of the company,\nexpand the business and production of the company or be converted into additional capital. Subject to above-\nreferenced limitations and at the discretion of board of directors, the accumulated profits after appropriation of\nstatutory surplus reserve available for dividends were $14,695,422 and $9,192,676 as of September 30, 2022 and\n2021, respectively. If our PRC subsidiary incurs debt on its own behalf in the future, the instruments governing the\ndebt may restrict its ability to pay dividends or make other payments to us. Any limitation on the ability of our PRC\nsubsidiary to distribute dividends or other payments to its shareholders could materially and adversely limit our ability\nto grow, make investments or acquisitions that could be beneficial to our businesses, pay dividends or otherwise fund\nand conduct our business. As of September 30, 2022, the statutory surplus reserves of our PRC subsidiary and its\nsubsidiaries, as percentage of their respective registered capitals, ranged from 2% to 41% and averaged 25% in the\naggregate.\nTo address the persistent capital outflow and the RMB’s depreciation against the U.S. dollar in the fourth quarter of\n2016, the People’s Bank of China and the State Administration of Foreign Exchange, or SAFE, have implemented a\nseries of capital control measures in the subsequent months, including stricter vetting procedures for China-based\ncompanies to remit foreign currency for overseas acquisitions, dividend payments and shareholder loan repayments.\nFor instance, the Circular on Further Improving Reform of Foreign Exchange Administration and Optimizing\nGenuineness and Compliance Verification, or the SAFE Circular 3, issued on January 26, 2017, provides that the\nbanks shall, when dealing with dividend remittance transactions from domestic enterprise to its offshore shareholders\nof more than US$50,000, review the relevant board resolutions, original tax filing form and audited financial\nstatements of such domestic enterprise based on the principal of genuine transaction. The PRC government may\ncontinue to strengthen its capital controls and our PRC subsidiary’s dividends and other distributions may be subject\nto tightened scrutiny in the future. Any limitation on the ability of our PRC subsidiary to pay dividends or make other\ndistributions to us could materially and adversely limit our ability to grow, make investments or acquisitions that could\nbe beneficial to our business, pay dividends, or otherwise fund and conduct our business.\n15\nIn addition, the PRC Enterprise Income Tax Law and its implementation rules provide that a withholding tax at a rate\nof 10% will be applicable to dividends payable by Chinese companies to non-PRC-resident enterprises unless reduced\nunder treaties or arrangements between the PRC central government and governments of other countries or regions\nwhere the non-PRC resident enterprises are tax resident. Pursuant to the Arrangement between Mainland China and\nthe Hong Kong Special Administrative Region for the Avoidance of Double Taxation and Tax Evasion on Income, the\nwithholding tax rate in respect to the payment of dividends by a PRC enterprise to a Hong Kong enterprise may be\nreduced to 5% from a standard rate of 10% if, among other requirements, the Hong Kong enterprise directly holds at\nleast 25% of the PRC enterprise. Under the Circular of the State Administration of Taxation on the Issues concerning\nthe Application of the Dividend Clauses of Tax Agreements, or SAT Circular 81, promulgated by the State\nAdministration of Taxation, or the SAT, on February 20, 2009, a Hong Kong resident enterprise must meet the\nfollowing conditions, among others, in order to apply the reduced withholding tax rate: (i) it must be a company; (ii)\nit must directly own the required percentage of equity interests and voting rights in the PRC resident enterprise; and\n(iii) it must have directly owned such required percentage in the PRC resident enterprise throughout the 12 months\nprior to receiving the dividends. Nonresident enterprises are not required to obtain pre-approval from the relevant tax\nauthority in order to enjoy the reduced withholding tax. Instead, nonresident enterprises and their withholding agents\nmay, by self-assessment and on confirmation that the prescribed criteria to enjoy the tax treaty benefits are met,\ndirectly apply the reduced withholding tax rate, and file necessary forms and supporting documents when performing\ntax filings, which will be subject to post-tax filing examinations by the relevant tax authorities. Accordingly, our Hong\nKong subsidiary may be able to benefit from the 5% withholding tax rate for the dividends it receives from our PRC\nsubsidiary, if it satisfies the conditions prescribed under the SAT Circular 81, and other relevant tax rules and\nregulations. However, if the relevant tax authorities consider the transactions or arrangements we have are for the\nprimary purpose of enjoying a favorable tax treatment, the relevant tax authorities may adjust the favorable\nwithholding tax in the future. Accordingly, there is no assurance that the reduced 5% will apply to dividends received\nby our Hong Kong subsidiary from our PRC subsidiary. This withholding tax will reduce the amount of dividends we\nmay receive from our PRC subsidiary.\nThe custodians or authorized users of our controlling non-tangible assets, including chops and seals, may fail\nto fulfill their responsibilities, or misappropriate or misuse these assets.\nUnder the PRC laws, legal documents for corporate transactions, including agreements and contracts, are executed\nusing the chop or seal of the signing entity or with the signature of a legal representative whose designation is\nregistered and filed with relevant PRC market regulation authorities.\nIn order to secure the use of our chops and seals, we have established internal control procedures and rules for using\nthese chops and seals. In any event that the chops and seals are intended to be used, the responsible person will submit\nthe application which will then be verified and approved by authorized employees in accordance with our internal\ncontrol procedures and rules. In addition, in order to maintain the physical security of our chops, we generally have\nthem stored in secured locations accessible only to authorized employees. Although we monitor such authorized\nemployees, the procedures may not be sufficient to prevent all instances of abuse or negligence. There is a risk that\nour employees could abuse their authority, for example, by entering into a contract not approved by us or seeking to\ngain control of one of our subsidiaries. If any employee obtains, misuses or misappropriates our chops and seals or\nother controlling non-tangible assets for whatever reason, we could experience disruption to our normal business\noperations. We may have to take corporate or legal action, which could involve significant time and resources to\nresolve and divert management from our operations.\nPRC regulation of loans to and direct investment in PRC entities by offshore holding companies and\ngovernmental control of currency conversion may delay or prevent us from using the proceeds of any securities\nofferings to make loans to or make additional capital contributions to our PRC subsidiary, which could\nmaterially and adversely affect our liquidity and our ability to fund and expand our business.\nWe are an offshore holding company conducting our operations in China through our PRC subsidiary. We may make\nloans to our PRC subsidiary subject to the approval from governmental authorities and limitation of amount, or we\nmay make additional capital contributions to our PRC subsidiary in China.\nAny loans to our PRC subsidiary in China, which is treated as foreign-invested enterprises under PRC laws, are subject\nto PRC regulations and foreign exchange loan registrations. For example, loans by us to our PRC subsidiary in China\nto finance their activities cannot exceed statutory limits and must be registered with the local counterpart of the SAFE.\nIn addition, a foreign-invested enterprise shall use its capital pursuant to the principle of authenticity and self-use\nwithin its business scope. The capital of a foreign-invested enterprise shall not be used for the following purposes: (i)\ndirectly or indirectly used for payment beyond the business scope of the enterprises or the payment prohibited by\nrelevant laws and regulations; (ii) directly or indirectly used for investment in securities investments other than banks’\nprincipal-secured products unless otherwise provided by relevant laws and regulations; (iii) the granting of loans to\nnon-affiliated enterprises, except where it is expressly permitted in the business license; and (iv) paying the expenses\nrelated to the purchase of real estate that is not for self-use (except for the foreign-invested real estate enterprises).\n16\nSAFE promulgated the Circular of the State Administration of Foreign Exchange on Reforming the Management\nApproach regarding the Settlement of Capital of Foreign-invested Enterprises, or SAFE Circular 19, effective June\n2015, in replacement of the Circular on the Relevant Operating Issues Concerning the Improvement of the\nAdministration of the Payment and Settlement of Foreign Currency Capital of Foreign-Invested Enterprises, the\nCircular of the State Administration of Foreign Exchange on Relevant Issues Concerning Strengthening the\nAdministration of Foreign Exchange Businesses, and the Circular on Further Clarification and Regulation of the\nIssues Concerning the Administration of Certain Capital Account Foreign Exchange Businesses. Although SAFE\nCircular 19 allows RMB capital converted from foreign currency-denominated registered capital of a foreign-invested\nenterprise to be used for equity investments within China, it also reiterates the principle that RMB converted from the\nforeign currency-denominated capital of a foreign-invested company may not be directly or indirectly used for\npurposes beyond its business scope. Thus, it is unclear whether SAFE will permit such capital to be used for equity\ninvestments in China in actual practice. SAFE promulgated the Circular of the State Administration of Foreign\nExchange on Reforming and Standardizing the Foreign Exchange Settlement Management Policy of Capital Account,\nor SAFE Circular 16, effective on June 9, 2016, which reiterates some of the rules set forth in SAFE Circular 19, but\nchanges the prohibition against using RMB capital converted from foreign currency-denominated registered capital\nof a foreign-invested company to issue RMB entrusted loans to a prohibition against using such capital to issue loans\nto non-associated enterprises. Violations of SAFE Circular 19 and SAFE Circular 16 could result in administrative\npenalties. SAFE Circular 19 and SAFE Circular 16 may significantly limit our ability to transfer any foreign currency\nwe hold, including the net proceeds from an offering of our securities, to our PRC subsidiary, which may adversely\naffect our liquidity and our ability to fund and expand our business in China.\nOn October 23, 2019, SAFE issued the Circular of the State Administration of Foreign Exchange on Further\nPromoting the Facilitation of Cross-border Trade and Investment, or SAFE Circular 28, which took effect on the\nsame day. SAFE Circular 28, subject to certain conditions, allows foreign-invested enterprises whose business scope\ndoes not include investment, or the non-investment foreign-invested enterprises, to use their capital funds to make\nequity investments in China. Since SAFE Circular 28 was issued only recently, its interpretation and implementation\nin practice are still subject to substantial uncertainties.\nIn light of the various requirements imposed by PRC regulations on loans to and direct investment in PRC entities by\noffshore holding companies, we cannot assure you that we will be able to complete the necessary government\nregistrations or obtain the necessary government approvals on a timely basis, if at all, with respect to future loans to\nour PRC subsidiary or future capital contributions by us to our PRC subsidiary in China. As a result, uncertainties\nexist as to our ability to provide prompt financial support to our PRC subsidiary when needed. If we fail to complete\nsuch registrations or obtain such approvals, our ability to use the proceeds we may receive from any securities offerings\nand to capitalize or otherwise fund our PRC operations may be negatively affected, which could materially and\nadversely affect our liquidity and our ability to fund and expand our business.\nAlthough the audit reports included in this report was issued by U.S. auditors who are currently inspected by the\nPCAOB, if it is later determined that the PCAOB is unable to inspect or investigate our auditor completely, investors\nwould be deprived of the benefits of such inspection and our ordinary shares may be delisted or prohibited from\ntrading.\nThe audit report included in this annual report for the year ended September 30, 2022 was issued by YCM CPA, Inc.\n(‘YCM”), which is a U.S.-based accounting firm that is registered with the PCAOB and can be inspected by the\nPCAOB. We have no intention of dismissing YCM in the future or of engaging any auditor not based in the U.S. and\nnot subject to regular inspection by the PCAOB. As an auditor of companies that are registered with the SEC and\npublicly traded in the United States and a firm registered with the PCAOB, our auditor is required under the laws of\nthe United States to undergo regular inspections by the PCAOB to assess its compliance with the laws of the United\nStates and professional standards. If we were to engage a different auditor in the future, we would engage an auditor\nthat is U.S.-based and subject to full PCAOB inspection with all materials related to the audit of our financial\nstatements accessible to the PCAOB. There is no guarantee, however, that any future auditor engaged by the Company\nwould remain subject to full PCAOB inspection during the entire term of our engagement. In such case, we will engage\na new qualified and fully inspected auditor, which may result in us delaying or restating our financial statements.\nPursuant to the Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act (the “HFCAA”), enacted in December 2020, if the SEC\ndetermines that an issuer has filed audit reports issued by a registered public accounting firm that has not been subject\nto inspection for the PCAOB for three consecutive years beginning in 2021, the SEC shall prohibit its securities from\nbeing traded on a national securities exchange or in the over-the-counter trading market in the United States.\n17\nOn December 16, 2021, the PCAOB issued the Determination Report which found that the PCAOB is unable to\ninspect or investigate completely registered public accounting firms headquartered in: (1) China of the China or Hong\nKong, because of a position taken by one or more authorities in China; and (2) Hong Kong, a Special Administrative\nRegion and dependency of the PRC, because of a position taken by one or more authorities in Hong Kong. On\nDecember 15, 2022, the PCAOB issued a new Determination Report which: (1) vacated the December 16, 2021\nDetermination Report; and (2) concluded that the PCAOB has been able to conduct inspections and investigations\ncompletely in the PRC in 2022. The December 15, 2022 Determination Report cautions, however, that authorities in\nthe PRC might take positions at any time that would prevent the PCAOB from continuing to inspect or investigate\ncompletely. As required by the HFCAA, if in the future the PCAOB determines it no longer can inspect or investigate\ncompletely because of a position taken by an authority in the PRC, the PCAOB will act expeditiously to consider\nwhether it should issue a new determination.\nShould the PCAOB be unable to fully conduct inspection of our auditor’s work papers in China, it will make it difficult\nto evaluate the effectiveness of our auditor’s audit procedures or equity control procedures. Investors may\nconsequently lose confidence in our reported financial information and procedures or quality of the financial\nstatements, which would adversely affect us and out securities.\nFluctuations in exchange rates could have a material and adverse effect on our results of operations and the\nvalue of your investment.\nThe value of the Renminbi against the U.S. dollar and other currencies may fluctuate and is affected by, among other\nthings, changes in political and economic conditions in China and by China’s foreign exchange policies. On July 21,\n2005, the PRC government changed its decade-old policy of pegging the value of the Renminbi to the U.S. dollar, and\nthe Renminbi appreciated more than 20% against the U.S. dollar over the following three years. Between July 2008\nand June 2010, this appreciation halted and the exchange rate between the Renminbi and the U.S. dollar remained\nwithin a narrow band. Since June 2010, the Renminbi has fluctuated against the U.S. dollar, at times significantly and\nunpredictably. It is difficult to predict how market forces or PRC or U.S. government policy may impact the exchange\nrate between the Renminbi and the U.S. dollar in the future.\nSignificant revaluation of the Renminbi may have a material and adverse effect on your investment. For example, to\nthe extent that we need to convert U.S. dollars we receive from any securities offerings into Renminbi for our\noperations, appreciation of the Renminbi against the U.S. dollar would have an adverse effect on the Renminbi amount\nwe would receive from the conversion. Conversely, if we decide to convert our Renminbi into U.S. dollars for the\npurpose of making payments for dividends on our ordinary shares or for other business purposes, appreciation of the\nU.S. dollar against the Renminbi would have a negative effect on the U.S. dollar amount available to us.\nVery limited hedging options are available in China to reduce our exposure to exchange rate fluctuations. To date, we\nhave not entered into any hedging transactions in an effort to reduce our exposure to foreign currency exchange risk.\nWhile we may decide to enter into hedging transactions in the future, the availability and effectiveness of these hedges\nmay be limited and we may not be able to adequately hedge our exposure or at all. In addition, our currency exchange\nlosses may be magnified by PRC exchange control regulations that restrict our ability to convert Renminbi into foreign\ncurrency.\nGovernmental control of currency conversion may limit our ability to utilize our revenues effectively and affect\nthe value of your investment.\nThe PRC government imposes controls on the convertibility of the Renminbi into foreign currencies and, in certain\ncases, the remittance of currency out of China. We receive substantially all of our revenues in Renminbi. Under our\ncurrent corporate structure, our Cayman Islands holding company primarily relies on dividend payments from our\nPRC subsidiary to fund any cash and financing requirements we may have. Under existing PRC foreign exchange\nregulations, payments of current account items, including profit distributions, interest payments and trade and service-\nrelated foreign exchange transactions, can be made in foreign currencies without prior approval of the SAFE by\ncomplying with certain procedural requirements. Specifically, under the existing exchange restrictions, without prior\napproval of SAFE, cash generated from the operations of our PRC subsidiary in China may be used to pay dividends\nto our company. However, approval from or registration with appropriate governmental authorities is required where\nRenminbi is to be converted into foreign currency and remitted out of China to pay capital expenses such as the\nrepayment of loans denominated in foreign currencies. As a result, we need to obtain SAFE approval to use cash\ngenerated from the operations of our PRC subsidiary to pay off their respective debt in a currency other than Renminbi\nowed to entities outside China, or to make other capital expenditure payments outside China in a currency other than\nRenminbi. The PRC government may at its discretion restrict access to foreign currencies for current account\ntransactions in the future. If the foreign exchange control system prevents us from obtaining sufficient foreign\ncurrencies to satisfy our foreign currency demands, we may not be able to pay dividends in foreign currencies to our\nshareholders, including holders of our Shares.\n18\nCertain PRC regulations may make it more difficult for us to pursue growth through acquisitions.\nAmong other things, the Rules on Mergers and Acquisitions of Domestic Enterprises by Foreign Investors, or the\nM&A Rules, promulgated by six PRC regulatory agencies in 2006 and amended in 2009, established additional\nprocedures and requirements that could make merger and acquisition activities by foreign investors more time-\nconsuming and complex. The M&A Rules require, among other things, that the MOFCOM be notified in advance of\nany change-of-control transaction in which a foreign investor acquires control of a PRC domestic enterprise, if (i) any\nimportant industry is concerned, (ii) such transaction involves factors that have or may have an impact on the national\neconomic security, or (iii) such transaction will lead to a change in control of a domestic enterprise which holds a\nfamous trademark or PRC time-honored brand. Moreover, the Anti-Monopoly Law promulgated by the Standing\nCommittee of the NPC which became effective in 2008 requires that transactions that are deemed concentrations and\ninvolve parties with specified turnover thresholds must be cleared by the MOFCOM before they can be completed. In\naddition, PRC national security review rules which became effective in September 2011 require acquisitions by\nforeign investors of PRC companies engaged in military-related or certain other industries that are crucial to national\nsecurity be subject to security review before consummation of any such acquisition. We may pursue potential strategic\nacquisitions that are complementary to our business and operations. Complying with the requirements of these\nregulations to complete such transactions could be time-consuming, and any required approval processes, including\nobtaining approval or clearance from the MOFCOM, may delay or inhibit our ability to complete such transactions,\nwhich could affect our ability to expand our business or maintain our market share.\nPRC regulations relating to the establishment of offshore special purpose companies by PRC residents may\nsubject our PRC resident beneficial owners or our PRC subsidiary to liability or penalties, limit our ability to\ninject capital into our PRC subsidiary, limit our PRC subsidiary’s ability to increase its registered capital or\ndistribute profits to us, or may otherwise adversely affect us.\nIn July 2014, SAFE promulgated the Circular on Relevant Issues Concerning Foreign Exchange Control on Domestic\nResidents’ Offshore Investment and Financing and Roundtrip Investment through Special Purpose Vehicles, or SAFE\nCircular 37, to replace the Circular on Relevant Issues Concerning Foreign Exchange Administration for Domestic\nResidents’ Financing and Roundtrip Investment through Offshore Special Purpose Vehicles, or SAFE Circular 75,\nwhich ceased to be effective upon the promulgation of SAFE Circular 37. SAFE Circular 37 requires PRC residents\n(including PRC individuals and PRC corporate entities) to register with local branches of SAFE in connection with\ntheir direct or indirect offshore investment activities. SAFE Circular 37 is applicable to our shareholders who are PRC\nresidents and may be applicable to any offshore acquisitions that we make in the future.\nUnder SAFE Circular 37, PRC residents who control, or have prior to the implementation of SAFE Circular 37\ncontrolled, directly or indirectly of offshore special purpose vehicles, or SPVs, will be required to register such\ninvestments with the SAFE or its local branches. The term “control” under SAFE Circular 37 is broadly defined as\nthe operation rights, beneficiary rights or decision-making rights acquired by PRC residents in the SPVs, by means of\nacquisition, trust, proxy, voting rights, repurchase, convertible bonds or other arrangements. In addition, any PRC\nresident who is a direct or indirect shareholder of an SPV, is required to update its filed registration with the local\nbranch of SAFE with respect to that SPV, to reflect any material change. Moreover, any subsidiary of such SPV in\nChina is required to urge the PRC resident shareholders to update their registration with the local branch of SAFE. If\nany PRC shareholder of such SPV fails to make the required registration or to update the previously filed registration,\nthe subsidiary of such SPV in China may be prohibited from distributing its profits or the proceeds from any capital\nreduction, share transfer or liquidation to the SPV, and the SPV may also be prohibited from making additional capital\ncontribution into its subsidiary in China. On February 13, 2015, the SAFE promulgated a Circular on Further\nSimplifying and Improving Foreign Exchange Administration Policy on Direct Investment, or SAFE Circular 13,\nwhich became effective on June 1, 2015. Under SAFE Circular 13, applications for foreign exchange registration of\ninbound foreign direct investment and outbound overseas direct investment, including those required under the SAFE\nCircular 37, will be filed with qualified banks instead of the SAFE. The qualified banks will directly examine the\napplications and accept registrations under the supervision of the SAFE.\n19\nThese regulations may have a significant impact on our present and future structuring and investment. We have\nrequested or intend to take all necessary measures to require our shareholders who to our knowledge are PRC residents\nto make the necessary applications, filings and amendments as required under these regulations. However, we may\nnot at all times be fully aware or informed of the identities of all our shareholders or beneficial owners that are required\nto make such registrations, and we may not always be able to compel them to comply with all relevant foreign\nexchange regulations. We further intend to structure and execute our future offshore acquisitions in a manner\nconsistent with these regulations and any other relevant legislation. However, because it is presently uncertain how\nthe SAFE regulations and any future legislation concerning offshore or cross-border transactions will be interpreted\nand implemented by the relevant government authorities in connection with our future offshore financings or\nacquisitions, we cannot provide any assurances that we will be able to comply with, qualify under, or obtain any\napprovals required by the regulations or other legislation. Furthermore, we cannot assure you that any PRC\nshareholders of our company or any PRC company into which we invest will be able to comply with those\nrequirements. Any failure or inability by such individuals or entities to comply with SAFE regulations may subject us\nto fines or legal sanctions, such as restrictions on our cross-border investment activities or our PRC subsidiary’s ability\nto distribute dividends to, or obtain foreign exchange-denominated loans from, our company or prevent us from\nmaking distributions or paying dividends. As a result, our business operations and our ability to make distributions to\nyou could be materially and adversely affected.\nFurthermore, as these foreign exchange regulations are still relatively new and their interpretation and implementation\nhave been constantly evolving, it is unclear how these regulations, and any future regulation concerning offshore or\ncross-border transactions, will be interpreted, amended and implemented by the relevant governmental authorities.\nFor example, we may be subject to a more stringent review and approval process with respect to our foreign exchange\nactivities, such as remittance of dividends and foreign-currency-denominated borrowings, which may adversely affect\nour financial condition and results of operations. In addition, if we decide to acquire a PRC domestic company, we\ncannot assure you that we or the owners of such company, as the case may be, will be able to obtain the necessary\napprovals or complete the necessary filings and registrations required by the foreign exchange regulations. This may\nrestrict our ability to implement our acquisition strategy and could adversely affect our business and prospects.\nAny failure to comply with PRC regulations regarding the registration requirements for employee stock\nincentive plans of overseas, publicly listed company may subject the PRC plan participants or us to fines and\nother legal or administrative sanctions.\nPursuant to SAFE Circular 37, PRC residents who participate in share incentive plans in overseas non-publicly-listed\ncompanies may submit applications to SAFE or its local branches for the foreign exchange registration with respect\nto offshore special purpose companies before they obtain the incentive shares or exercise the share options. In the\nmeantime, our directors, executive officers and other employees who are PRC citizens or who are non-PRC citizens\nresiding in the PRC for a continuous period of not less than one year, subject to limited exceptions, and who have\nbeen granted incentive share awards by us, may follow the Circular of the State Administration of Foreign Exchange\non Issues Relating to the Foreign Exchange Administration for Domestic Individuals Participating in Stock Incentive\nPlan of Overseas Listed Company, or the SAFE Circular 7, promulgated by the SAFE in 2012. Pursuant to the SAFE\nCircular 7, PRC citizens and non-PRC citizens who reside in China for a continuous period of not less than one year\nwho participate in any stock incentive plan of an overseas publicly listed company, subject to a few exceptions, are\nrequired to register with SAFE through a domestic qualified agent, which could be the PRC subsidiaries of such\noverseas listed company, and complete certain other procedures. In addition, an overseas entrusted institution must be\nretained to handle matters in connection with the exercise or sale of stock options and the purchase or sale of shares\nand interests. Since We are an overseas listed company pursuant to the SAFE Circular 7, our executive officers and\nother employees who are PRC citizens or non-PRC citizen residing in the PRC for a continuous period of not less than\none year and who have been granted options will be subject to these regulations. Failure to complete the SAFE\nregistrations may subject them to fines of up to RMB300,000 for entities and up to RMB50,000 for individuals, and\nlegal sanctions and may also limit our ability to contribute additional capital into our PRC subsidiary and limit our\nPRC subsidiary’s ability to distribute dividends to us.\n20\nThe SAT has issued certain circulars concerning employee share options and restricted shares. Under these circulars,\nour employees working in China who exercise share options or are granted restricted shares will be subject to PRC\nindividual income tax. Our PRC subsidiary has obligations to file documents related to employee share options or\nrestricted shares with relevant tax authorities and to withhold individual income taxes of those employees who exercise\ntheir share options. If our employees fail to pay or we fail to withhold their income taxes according to relevant laws\nand regulations, we may face sanctions imposed by the tax authorities or other PRC governmental authorities.\nIf we are classified as a PRC resident enterprise for PRC income tax purposes, such classification could result\nin unfavorable tax consequences to us and our non-PRC shareholders.\nUnder the PRC Enterprise Income Tax Law and its implementation rules, an enterprise established outside of the PRC\nwith “de facto management body” within the PRC is considered a “resident enterprise” and will be subject to the\nenterprise income tax on its global income at the rate of 25%. The implementation rules define the term “de facto\nmanagement body” as the body that exercises full and substantial control and overall management over the business,\nproductions, personnel, accounts and properties of an enterprise. In 2009, the SAT issued the Circular of the State\nAdministration of Taxation on Issues Concerning the Identification of Chinese-controlled Overseas Registered\nEnterprises as Resident Enterprises in accordance with the Actual Standards of Organizational Management, or the\nSAT Circular 82, which provides certain specific criteria for determining whether the “de facto management body” of\na PRC-controlled enterprise that is incorporated offshore is located in China. Although this circular only applies to\noffshore enterprises controlled by PRC enterprises or PRC enterprise groups, not those controlled by PRC individuals\nor foreigners, the criteria set forth in the circular may reflect the SAT’s general position on how the “de facto\nmanagement body” text should be applied in determining the tax resident status of all offshore enterprises. According\nto SAT Circular 82, an offshore incorporated enterprise controlled by a PRC enterprise or a PRC enterprise group will\nbe regarded as a PRC tax resident by virtue of having its “de facto management body” in China and will be subject to\nPRC enterprise income tax on its global income only if all of the following conditions are met: (i) the places where\nthe senior management and senior management departments responsible for the daily production, operation and\nmanagement of the enterprise perform their duties are mainly located within the territory of the PRC; (ii) decisions\nrelating to the enterprise’s financial matters (such as money borrowing, lending, financing and financial risk\nmanagement) and human resource matters (such as appointment, dismissal and salary and wages) are made or are\nsubject to approval by organizations or personnel in the PRC; (iii) the enterprise’s primary assets, accounting books\nand records, company seals, and board and shareholder resolutions, are located or maintained in the PRC; and (iv) at\nleast 50% of voting board members or senior executives habitually reside in the PRC. In addition, the SAT issued the\nBulletin of the State Administration of Taxation on Printing and Distributing the Administrative Measures for Income\nTax on Chinese-controlled Resident Enterprises Incorporated Overseas (Trial Implementation) in 2011, providing\nmore guidance on the implementation of SAT Circular 82. This bulletin clarifies matters including resident status\ndetermination, post determination administration, and competent tax authorities. In January 2014, the SAT issued the\nBulletin of the State Administration of Taxation on Issues concerning the Determination of Resident Enterprises Based\non the Standards of Actual Management Institutions, or SAT Bulletin 9. According to SAT Bulletin 9, a Chinese-\ncontrolled offshore incorporated enterprise that satisfies the conditions prescribed under the SAT Circular 82 for being\nrecognized as a PRC tax resident must apply for being recognized as a PRC tax resident to the competent tax authority\nat the place of registration of its main investor within the territory of China.\nWe believe that Bon Natural Life Limited is not a PRC resident enterprise for PRC tax purposes. See “Regulation—\nRegulations Relating to Tax—Enterprise Income Tax.” However, the tax resident status of an enterprise is subject to\ndetermination by the PRC tax authorities and uncertainties remain with respect to the interpretation of the term “de\nfacto management body.” If the PRC tax authorities determine that Bon Natural Life Limited or any of our offshore\nsubsidiaries is a PRC resident enterprise for enterprise income tax purposes, we and our offshore subsidiary will be\nsubject to PRC enterprise income on their worldwide income at the rate of 25%, which would materially reduce our\nnet income. Furthermore, if we are treated as a PRC tax resident enterprise, we may be required to withhold a 10%\nwithholding tax from dividends we pay to our shareholders that are non-resident enterprises. In addition, non-resident\nenterprise shareholders may be subject to PRC tax on gains realized on the sale or other disposition of ordinary shares,\nif such income is treated as sourced from within the PRC. Furthermore, if we are deemed a PRC resident enterprise,\ndividends payable to our non-PRC individual shareholders and any gain realized on the transfer of ordinary shares by\nsuch shareholders may be subject to PRC tax at a rate of 20% unless a reduced rate is available under an applicable\ntax treaty. It is unclear whether non-PRC shareholders of Bon Natural Life Limited would be able to claim the benefits\nof any tax treaties between their country of tax residence and the PRC in the event that Bon Natural Life Limited is\ntreated as a PRC resident enterprise.\n21\nWe may incur liability for unpaid taxes, including interest and penalties.\nIn the normal course of business, our Company may be subject to challenges from various PRC taxing authorities\nregarding the amounts of taxes due. PRC taxing authorities may take the position that the Company owes more taxes\nthan it has paid. The Company recorded tax liabilities of $1.2 million as of September 30, 2022, primarily including\n$576,098 income tax payable and $572,306 in unpaid value added taxes (“VAT” tax). It is possible that the tax liability\nof the Company for past taxes may be higher than those amounts, if the PRC authorities determine that we are subject\nto interest and penalties or that we have not paid the correct amount. To the extent our Company is unable to settle its\ntax liabilities as scheduled, or interest and penalties on unpaid tax liabilities assessed by tax authorities greatly exceed\nmanagement’s estimates, our financial condition and operating results may be negatively impacted.\nWe face uncertainty with respect to indirect transfers of equity interests in PRC resident enterprises by their\nnon-PRC holding companies.\nOn February 3, 2015, the SAT issued a Bulletin of State Administration of Taxation on Several Issues concerning the\nEnterprise Income Tax on the Indirect Transfer of Properties by Non-resident Enterprises, or SAT Bulletin 7, which\ncame into effect on February 3, 2015, but will also apply to cases where their PRC tax treatments are not yet concluded.\nPursuant to SAT Bulletin 7, an ‘‘Indirect Transfer’’ of PRC assets, including a transfer of equity interests in an unlisted\nnon-PRC holding company of a PRC resident enterprise, by non-PRC resident enterprises may be re-characterized\nand treated as a direct transfer of the underlying PRC assets, if such arrangement does not have a reasonable\ncommercial purpose and was established for the purpose of avoiding payment of PRC enterprise income tax. As a\nresult, gains derived from such indirect transfer may be subject to PRC enterprise income tax, and the transferee or\nother person who is obligated to pay for the transfer is obligated to withhold the applicable taxes, currently at a rate\nof 10% for the transfer of equity interests in a PRC resident enterprise.\nOn October 17, 2017, the SAT issued the Bulletin of the State Administration of Taxation on Issues Concerning the\nWithholding of Non-resident Enterprise Income Tax at Source, or SAT Bulletin 37, which came into effect on\nDecember 1, 2017. The SAT Bulletin 37 further clarifies the practice and procedure of the withholding of non-resident\nenterprise income tax.\nWhere a non-resident enterprise transfers taxable assets in China indirectly by disposing of the equity interests of an\noverseas holding company, the non-resident enterprise as either transferor or transferee, or the PRC entity whose\nequity is transferred, may report such Indirect Transfer to the relevant tax authority. Under the “substance over form”\nprinciple, the PRC tax authority may disregard the existence of the overseas holding company if it lacks a reasonable\ncommercial purpose and was established for the purpose of reducing, avoiding or deferring PRC tax. As a result, gains\nderived from such Indirect Transfer may be subject to PRC enterprise income tax, and the transferee or other person\nwho is obligated to pay for the transfer is obligated to withhold the applicable taxes, currently at a rate of 10% for the\ntransfer of equity interests in a PRC resident enterprise. Both the transferor and the transferee may be subject to\npenalties under PRC tax laws if the transferee fails to withhold the taxes and the transferor fails to pay the taxes.\nWe face uncertainties as to the reporting and other implications of certain past and future transactions where PRC\ntaxable assets are involved. Our company may be subject to filing obligations or taxed if our company is transferor in\nsuch transactions, and we may be subject to withholding obligations if our company is a transferee in such transactions,\nunder SAT Bulletin 7 and SAT Bulletin 37. For transfer of shares in our company by investors that are non-PRC resident\nenterprises, our PRC subsidiary may be requested to assist in the filing under SAT Bulletin 7 and SAT Bulletin 37. As\na result, we may be required to expend valuable resources to comply with SAT Bulletin 7 and SAT Bulletin 37 or to\nrequest the relevant transferors from whom we purchase taxable assets to comply with these circulars, or to establish\nthat our company should not be taxed under these circulars, which may have a material adverse effect on our financial\ncondition and results of operations.\n22\nIf our preferential tax treatments and government subsidies are revoked or become unavailable or if the\ncalculation of our tax liability is successfully challenged by the PRC tax authorities, we may be required to pay\ntax, interest and penalties in excess of our tax provisions.\nThe Chinese government has provided tax incentives to our operating subsidiary in China, including reduced\nenterprise income tax rates. For example, under the PRC Enterprise Income Tax Law and its implementation rules,\nthe statutory enterprise income tax rate is 25%. However, the income tax of an enterprise that has been determined to\nbe a high and new technology enterprise can be reduced to a preferential rate of 15%. According to the Administrative\nMeasures for the Accreditation of High-tech Enterprises promulgated by three PRC regulatory agencies, including\nSAT, the qualification of high and new enterprise is effective for a renewable three-year permitted. If our operating\nsubsidiary fails to renew the qualification of high and new enterprise, it will be subject to the statutory enterprise\nincome tax rate of 25%. In addition, our operating subsidiary enjoys local government subsidies. Any increase in the\nenterprise income tax rate applicable to our PRC subsidiary or our operating subsidiary in China, or any\ndiscontinuation, retroactive or future reduction or refund of any of the preferential tax treatments and local government\nsubsidies currently enjoyed by our operating subsidiary in China, could adversely affect our business, financial\ncondition, and results of operations.\nFurther, in the ordinary course of our business, we are subject to complex income tax and other tax regulations, and\nsignificant judgment is required in the determination of a provision for income taxes. Although we believe our tax\nprovisions are reasonable, if the PRC tax authorities successfully challenge our position and we are required to pay\ntax, interest, and penalties in excess of our tax provisions, our financial condition and results of operations would be\nmaterially and adversely affected.\nOur failure to fully comply with PRC labor-related laws may expose us to potential penalties.\nCompanies operating in China are required to participate in mandatory employee social security schemes that are\norganized by municipal and provincial governments, including pension insurance, unemployment insurance,\nchildbirth insurance, work-related injury insurance, medical insurance and housing provident funds. Such schemes\nhave not been implemented consistently by the local governments in China given the different levels of economic\ndevelopment in different locations, but generally require us to make contributions to employee social security plans\nat specified percentages of the salaries, bonuses and certain allowances of our eligible full-time employees, up to a\nmaximum amount specified by the local government from time to time. We have accrued in financial statements but\nnot made full contributions to the social insurance and housing provident funds in accordance for our eligible full-\ntime employees as required by the relevant PRC laws and regulations. As the date of this report, none of our\nsubsidiaries had received any notice from local authorities or any claim or request from the employees in this regard.\nOur failure to make full contributions to social insurance and to comply with applicable PRC labor-related laws\nregarding housing funds may subject us to late payment penalties and other fines or labor disputes, and we could be\nrequired to make up the contributions for these plans, which may adversely affect our financial condition and results\nof operations.\nAccording to applicable PRC laws and regulations, employers must open social insurance registration accounts and\nhousing provident fund accounts and pay social insurance and housing provident funds for employees. Our PRC\nsubsidiary or some its subsidiaries have not opened social insurance registration accounts or housing provident fund\naccounts. We may be subject to penalties imposed by the local social insurance authorities and the local housing\nprovident fund management centers for failing to discharge our obligations in relation to payment of social insurance\nand housing provident funds as an employer.\nOur failure to fully comply with PRC construction-related laws may expose us to potential penalties.\nOur PRC subsidiary has rented a factory in Weinan, Shaanxi for use as our Weinan Raw Materials and Ingredients\nProduction Site (See “History and Organizational Structure—Property, Plants, and Equipment — Weinan Raw\nMaterials and Ingredients Production Site”). The landlord constructed some buildings of this production site without\nobtaining the planning permits, construction permits, or going through the completion filing, fire safety filing, or\nenvironmental protection procedures in accordance with the PRC laws and regulations. Such failure to comply with\nthe relevant laws and regulations may subject us to administrative penalties, including but not limited to paying fines,\nbeing required to stop using or demolishing such buildings. As the date of this report, our PRC subsidiary and its\nsubsidiaries have not received any notice or any claim from the local authorities with respect to such buildings. We\nwill urge the landlord to apply for relevant permits and handle relevant procedures or filings with the local authorities.\nSuch buildings are mostly used as the warehouses. If the local authorities require us to stop using such buildings, we\nwill need to rent new warehouses, which may affect our normal operations and cause operating losses. But we believe\nthat the amount of the loss will not exceed 3% of the Company’s sale revenues. In addition, the lease term of this\nproduction site will expire on December 31, 2024. At that time, we may not renew the lease of this production site\nand may transfer the production to a new production base.\n23\nRisks Related to our Securities\nThe trading price for our Shares may fluctuate significantly.\nOur Shares are listed on the Nasdaq Capital Market under the symbol “BON.” We can provide no assurance that the\ntrading price of our Shares will not decline. As a result, investors in our securities may experience a significant\ndecrease in the value of their Shares.\nThe trading price of our Shares can be volatile, which could result in substantial losses to investors.\nThe trading price of our Shares can be volatile and could fluctuate widely due to factors beyond our control. This may\nhappen because of broad market and industry factors, including the performance and fluctuation of the market prices\nof other companies with business operations located mainly in China that have listed their securities in the United\nStates. In addition to market and industry factors, the price and trading volume for our Shares may be highly volatile\nfor factors specific to our own operations, including the following:\n● variations in our revenues, earnings and cash flow;\n● announcements of new investments, acquisitions, strategic partnerships or joint ventures by us or our\ncompetitors;\n● announcements of new offerings, solutions and expansions by us or our competitors;\n● changes in financial estimates by securities analysts;\n● detrimental adverse publicity about us, our services or our industry;\n● additions or departures of key personnel;\n● release of lock-up or other transfer restrictions on our outstanding equity securities or sales of additional\nequity securities; and\n● potential litigation or regulatory investigations.\nAny of these factors may result in large and sudden changes in the volume and price at which our Shares will trade.\nIn the past, shareholders of public companies have often brought securities class action suits against those companies\nfollowing periods of instability in the market price of their securities. If we were involved in a class action suit, it\ncould divert a significant amount of our management’s attention and other resources from our business and operations\nand require us to incur significant expenses to defend the suit, which could harm our results of operations. Any such\nclass action suit, whether or not successful, could harm our reputation and restrict our ability to raise capital in the\nfuture. In addition, if a claim is successfully made against us, we may be required to pay significant damages, which\ncould have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nCertain existing shareholders have substantial influence over our company and their interests may not be\naligned with the interests of our other shareholders.\nOur directors and officers collectively own an aggregate of 16.82% of the total voting power of our outstanding\nordinary shares. As a result, they have substantial influence over our business, including significant corporate actions\nsuch as mergers, consolidations, sales of all or substantially all of our assets, election of directors and other significant\ncorporate actions.\n24\nThey may take actions that are not in the best interest of us or our other shareholders. This concentration of ownership\nmay discourage, delay or prevent a change in control of our company, which could deprive our shareholders of an\nopportunity to receive a premium for their shares as part of a sale of our company and may reduce the price of the\nShares. These actions may be taken even if they are opposed by our other shareholders. In addition, the significant\nconcentration of share ownership may adversely affect the trading price of the Shares due to investors’ perception that\nconflicts of interest may exist or arise. For more information regarding our principal shareholders and their affiliated\nentities, see “Principal Shareholders.”\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish research or reports about our business, or if they adversely\nchange their recommendations regarding our Shares, the market price for our Shares and trading volume\ncould decline.\nThe trading market for our Shares will be influenced by research or reports that industry or securities analysts publish\nabout our business. If one or more analysts who cover us downgrade our Shares, the market price for our Shares would\nlikely decline. If one or more of these analysts cease to cover us or fail to regularly publish reports on us, we could\nlose visibility in the financial markets, which in turn could cause the market price or trading volume for our Shares to\ndecline.\nThe sale or availability for sale of substantial amounts of our Shares could adversely affect their market price.\nSales of substantial amounts of our Shares in the public market, or the perception that these sales could occur, could\nadversely affect the market price of our Shares and could materially impair our ability to raise capital through equity\nofferings in the future. Shares held by our existing shareholders may be sold in the public market in the future subject\nto the restrictions in Rule 144 and Rule 701 under the Securities Act. We cannot predict what effect, if any, market\nsales of securities held by our significant shareholders or any other shareholder or the availability of these securities\nfor future sale will have on the market price of our Shares.\nBecause we do not expect to pay dividends in the foreseeable future, you must rely on price appreciation of our\nShares for return on your investment.\nWe currently intend to retain most, if not all, of our available funds and any future earnings to fund the development\nand growth of our business. As a result, we do not expect to pay any cash dividends in the foreseeable future.\nTherefore, you should not rely on an investment in our Shares as a source for any future dividend income.\nOur board of directors has complete discretion as to whether to distribute dividends. Even if our board of directors\ndecides to declare and pay dividends, the timing, amount and form of future dividends, if any, will depend on our\nfuture results of operations and cash flow, our capital requirements and surplus, the amount of distributions, if any,\nreceived by us from our subsidiaries, our financial condition, contractual restrictions and other factors deemed relevant\nby our board of directors. Accordingly, the return on your investment in our Shares will likely depend entirely upon\nany future price appreciation of our Shares. There is no guarantee that our Shares will appreciate in value or even\nmaintain the price at which you purchased the Shares. You may not realize a return on your investment in our Shares\nand you may even lose your entire investment in our Shares.\nYou may face difficulties in protecting your interests, and your ability to protect your rights through U.S. courts\nmay be limited, because we are incorporated under Cayman Islands law.\nWe are an exempted company incorporated under the laws of the Cayman Islands. Our corporate affairs are governed\nby our memorandum and articles of association, the Companies Law (2020 Revision) of the Cayman Islands and the\ncommon law of the Cayman Islands. The rights of shareholders to take action against the directors, actions by minority\nshareholders and the fiduciary duties of our directors to us under Cayman Islands law are to a large extent governed\nby the common law of the Cayman Islands. The common law of the Cayman Islands is derived in part from\ncomparatively limited judicial precedent in the Cayman Islands as well as from the common law of England, the\ndecisions of whose courts are of persuasive authority, but are not binding, on a court in the Cayman Islands. The rights\nof our shareholders and the fiduciary duties of our directors under Cayman Islands law are not as clearly established\nas they would be under statutes or judicial precedent in some jurisdictions in the United States. In particular, the\nCayman Islands has a less developed body of securities laws than the United States. Some U.S. states, such as\nDelaware, have more fully developed and judicially interpreted bodies of corporate law than the Cayman Islands. In\naddition, Cayman Islands companies may not have standing to initiate a shareholder derivative action in a federal\ncourt of the United States.\n25\nShareholders of Cayman Islands exempted companies like us have no general rights under Cayman Islands law to\ninspect corporate records or to obtain copies of lists of shareholders of these companies. Our directors have discretion\nunder our articles of association to determine whether or not, and under what conditions, our corporate records may\nbe inspected by our shareholders, but are not obliged to make them available to our shareholders. This may make it\nmore difficult for you to obtain the information needed to establish any facts necessary for a shareholder motion or to\nsolicit proxies from other shareholders in connection with a proxy contest.\nCertain corporate governance practices in the Cayman Islands, which is our home country, differ significantly from\nrequirements for companies incorporated in other jurisdictions such as the United States. To the extent we choose to\nfollow home country practice with respect to corporate governance matters, our shareholders may be afforded less\nprotection than they otherwise would under rules and regulations applicable to U.S. domestic issuers.\nAs a result of all of the above, our public shareholders may have more difficulty in protecting their interests in the\nface of actions taken by management, members of the board of directors or controlling shareholders than they would\nas public shareholders of a company incorporated in the United States. For a discussion of significant differences\nbetween the provisions of the Companies Law of the Cayman Islands and the laws applicable to companies\nincorporated in the United States and their shareholders, see “Description of Share Capital—Differences in Corporate\nLaw.”\nCertain judgments obtained against us by our shareholders may not be enforceable.\nWe are a Cayman Islands company and substantially all of our assets are located outside of the United States.\nSubstantially all of our current operations are conducted in China. In addition, all of our current directors and officers\nare nationals and residents of countries other than the United States. Substantially all of the assets of these persons are\nlocated outside the United States. As a result, it may be difficult or impossible for you to bring an action against us or\nagainst these individuals in the United States in the event that you believe that your rights have been infringed under\nthe U.S. federal securities laws or otherwise. Even if you are successful in bringing an action of this kind, the laws of\nthe Cayman Islands and of China may render you unable to enforce a judgment against our assets or the assets of our\ndirectors and officers. For more information regarding the relevant laws of the Cayman Islands and China, see\n“Enforceability of Civil Liabilities.”\nWe are a foreign private issuer within the meaning of the rules under the Exchange Act, and as such we are\nexempt from certain provisions applicable to United States domestic public companies.\nBecause we are a foreign private issuer under the Exchange Act, we are exempt from certain provisions of the\nsecurities rules and regulations in the United States that are applicable to U.S. domestic issuers, including: (i) the rules\nunder the Exchange Act requiring the filing of quarterly reports on Form 10-Q or current reports on Form 8-K with\nthe SEC; (ii) the sections of the Exchange Act regulating the solicitation of proxies, consents, or authorizations in\nrespect of a security registered under the Exchange Act; (iii) the sections of the Exchange Act requiring insiders to\nfile public reports of their stock ownership and trading activities and liability for insiders who profit from trades made\nin a short period of time; and (iv) the selective disclosure rules by issuers of material nonpublic information under\nRegulation FD.\nWe are required to file an annual report on Form 20-F within four months of the end of each fiscal year. In addition,\nwe will continue to publish our results on a quarterly basis through press releases, distributed pursuant to the rules and\nregulations of the Nasdaq Stock Exchange. Press releases relating to financial results and material events will also be\nfurnished to the SEC on Form 6-K. However, the information we are required to file with or furnish to the SEC will\nbe less extensive and less timely compared to that required to be filed with the SEC by U.S. domestic issuers. As a\nresult, you may not be afforded the same protections or information, which would be made available to you, were you\ninvesting in a U.S. domestic issuer.\n26\nAs a foreign private issuer, we are permitted to, and we will, rely on exemptions from certain Nasdaq Stock\nExchange corporate governance standards applicable to domestic U.S. issuers. This may afford less protection\nto holders of our shares.\nWe are exempted from certain corporate governance requirements of the Nasdaq Stock Exchange by virtue of being\na foreign private issuer. We are required to provide a brief description of the significant differences between our\ncorporate governance practices and the corporate governance practices required to be followed by domestic U.S.\ncompanies listed on the Nasdaq Stock Exchange. The standards applicable to us are considerably different than the\nstandards applied to domestic U.S. issuers. For instance, we are not required to:\n● have a majority of the board be independent (although all of the members of the audit committee must be\nindependent under the U.S. Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act);\n● have a compensation committee or a nominating or corporate governance committee consisting entirely of\nindependent directors;\n● have regularly scheduled executive sessions with only independent directors; or\n● have executive sessions of solely independent directors each year.\nWe have relied on and intend to continue to rely on some of these exemptions. As a result, you may not be provided\nwith the benefits of certain corporate governance requirements of the Nasdaq Stock Exchange.\nIf we fail to establish and maintain proper internal financial reporting controls, our ability to produce accurate\nfinancial statements or comply with applicable regulations could be impaired.\nOur management has not completed an assessment of the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting,\nand our independent registered public accounting firm has not conducted an audit of our internal control over financial\nreporting. In the course of auditing our consolidated financial statements for the years ended September 30, 2022 and\n2021, we identified several material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting and other control\ndeficiencies as of September 30, 2022. A “material weakness” is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in\ninternal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the\ncompany’s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.\nThe material weaknesses identified to date relate to a lack of accounting staff and resources with appropriate\nknowledge of generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (“U.S. GAAP”) and SEC reporting and\ncompliance requirements.\nFollowing the identification of the material weaknesses and control deficiencies, we have taken remedial measures\nincluding (i) hiring more qualified accounting personnel with relevant U.S. GAAP and SEC reporting experience and\nqualifications to strengthen the financial reporting function and to set up a financial and system control framework;\n(ii) implementing regular and continuous U.S. GAAP accounting and financial reporting training programs for our\naccounting and financial reporting personnel; and (iii) setting up an internal audit function as well as engaging an\nexternal consulting firm to assist us with assessment of Sarbanes-Oxley compliance requirements and improvement\nof overall internal control.\nAs of the date of this report, we have not fully addressed the above-referenced weaknesses. However, we have made\nprogress in implementing remedial measures, specifically:\n● We have hired two additional mid-level financial staff in late 2020, one of whom has been staffed in financial\nreporting unit and the other in internal control department. In addition, we have identified three potential\ncandidates with U.S. Certified Public Accountant qualifications and related experience and skills for senior\nfinancial roles. We expect to hire at least one candidate prior to March 31, 2022. In the interim, we will\ncontinue using an external consultant to assist us in financial reporting.\n● Since September 30, 2020, the management team, including our chief executive officer, Mr. Yongwei Hu,\nour chief financial officer, Mr. Zhenchao Li, and other management team members of our PRC subsidiary\nand its subsidiaries in the PRC have held internal meetings, discussions, trainings, and seminars on a monthly\nbasis to review our financial statements and operational performance and to identify areas to improve our\ninternal control procedures.\n● We have appointed directors and established an audit committee;\n● In April 2021, we engaged Grant Thornton (Special General Partnership), Xiamen Branch to assist us in\nsetting-up our financial and system control framework. Grant Thornton has completed the evaluation of the\neffectiveness of our existing financial and system control and formulated an implementation plan with\nexpanded and enhanced control and procedures. We expect to fully complete the setup of our financial and\nsystem control framework by June 30, 2023.\n27\nWe plan to fully implement the above-referenced measures prior to December 31, 2023.\nThe implementation of these measures may not fully address the material weaknesses in our internal control over\nfinancial reporting, and we cannot conclude that they have been fully remedied. Our failure to correct theses material\nweaknesses or our failure to discover and address any other material weaknesses could result in inaccuracies in our\nfinancial statements and could also impair our ability to comply with applicable financial reporting requirements and\nrelated regulatory filings on a timely basis. As a result, our business, financial condition, results of operations and\nprospects, as well as the trading price of our Ordinary Shares, may be materially and adversely affected. Moreover,\nineffective internal control over financial reporting significantly hinders our ability to prevent fraud. In addition, once\nwe cease to be an “emerging growth company” as such term is defined in the JOBS Act, our independent registered\npublic accounting firm must attest to and report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting.\nOur management may conclude that our internal control over financial reporting is not effective. Moreover, even if\nour management concludes that our internal control over financial reporting is effective, our independent registered\npublic accounting firm, after conducting its own independent testing, may issue a report that is qualified if it is not\nsatisfied with our internal controls or the level at which our controls are documented, designed, operated or reviewed,\nor if it interprets the relevant requirements differently from us. In addition, after we become a public company, our\nreporting obligations may place a significant strain on our management, operational and financial resources and\nsystems for the foreseeable future. We may be unable to timely complete our evaluation testing and any required\nremediation.\nThere can be no assurance that we will not be a passive foreign investment company, or PFIC, for U.S. federal\nincome tax purposes for any taxable year, which could result in adverse U.S. federal income tax consequences\nto U.S. holders of our ordinary shares.\nA non-U.S. corporation will be a passive foreign investment company, or PFIC, for any taxable year if either (1) at\nleast 75% of its gross income for such year consists of certain types of “passive” income; or (2) at least 50% of the\nvalue of its assets (based on an average of the quarterly values of the assets) during such year is attributable to assets\nthat produce passive income or are held for the production of passive income (the “asset test”). Based on our current\nand expected income and assets, we do not presently expect to be a PFIC for the current taxable year or the foreseeable\nfuture. However, no assurance can be given in this regard because the determination of whether we are or will become\na PFIC is a fact-intensive inquiry made on an annual basis that depends, in part, upon the composition of our income\nand assets. Fluctuations in the market price of our Shares may cause us to become a PFIC for the current or subsequent\ntaxable years because the value of our assets for the purpose of the asset test may be determined by reference to the\nmarket price of our Shares. The composition of our income and assets may also be affected by how, and how quickly,\nwe use our liquid assets.\nIf we were to be or become a PFIC for any taxable year during which a U.S. Holder (as defined in “Taxation—United\nStates Federal Income Tax Considerations”) holds our ordinary shares, certain adverse U.S. federal income tax\nconsequences could apply to such U.S. Holder. See “Taxation—United States Federal Income Tax Considerations—\nPassive Foreign Investment Company Rules.”\nITEM 4. INFORMATION ON THE COMPANY\nA. History and Development of the Company\nWe commenced our natural products and ingredients business through Xi’an App-Chem Bio(Tech) Co., Ltd. (“Xi’an\nApp-Chem”), a corporation formed in the People’s Republic of China in April of 2006. On April 23, 2006, Xi’an App-\nChem received its Business License (Registration No.: 6101012116403) from the Xi’an Administration for Industry\nand Commerce.\nOn December 11, 2019, Bon Natural Life Limited was incorporated under the laws of the Cayman Islands as our\noffshore holding company to facilitate financing and offshore listing. Bon Natural Life Limited subsequently\nestablished a Wholly Foreign-Owned Enterprise (“WOFE”) in PRC China, Xi’an CMIT Information and Technology\nCo., Ltd. (“Xi’an CMIT”). Xi’an CMIT is wholly owned by our direct subsidiary in Hong Kong, Tea Essence.\n28\nInitial Public Offering\nOn June 28, 2021, the Company closed its initial public offering (“IPO”) of 2,200,000 ordinary shares, par value\nUS$0.0001 per share at a public offering price of $5.00 per share, and the Company’s ordinary shares started to trade\non the Nasdaq Capital Market under the ticker symbol “BON” since June 24, 2021. On July 2, 2021, the underwriters\nexercised its over-allotment option to purchase an additional 330,000 shares, par value US$0.0001 per share at the\nprice of $5.00 per share. Gross proceeds of the Company’s IPO, including the proceeds from the sale of the over-\nallotment shares, totaled $12.65 million, before deducting underwriting discounts and other related expenses, resulting\nin net proceeds of approximately $11.3 million.\nNote regarding financial statements in this annual report\nThe financial statements in this annual report and the accompanying footnotes, with regard to the prior fiscal year\nended September 30, 2021, were prepared for a period in which we were operating under a variable interest entity\nstructure and contain various references the former VIE agreements and related matters. We do not believe that the\ntermination of the VIE agreements, which occurred effective November 1, 2021, will have material impact on our\noperations going forward in terms of any impairment of our total assets, or any adverse effect on our business, financial\nconditions or results of operations, as no changes in control occurred as a result of the termination of our VIE\nagreements. Therefore, the Company’s consolidated financial statements include the operation results of the same\nentities under common control before and after the restructuring.\nThe following diagram illustrates our corporate structure as of the date of this report:\n29\nThe structure of cash flows within our organization, and the applicable regulations, are as follows:\n1. Our equity structure is a direct holding structure, that is, the overseas entity listed in the U.S., Bon Natural\nLife, directly controls Xi’an CMIT and Xi’an Youpincui (the “WFOEs”) and other domestic operating\nentities through the Hong Kong company, Tea Essence. See “Corporate History and Structure” above for\nadditional details.\n2. Within our direct holding structure, the cross-border transfer of funds within our corporate group is legal and\ncompliant with the laws and regulations of the PRC. After foreign investors’ funds enter Bon Natural Life\nfollowing an offering of securities, the funds can be directly transferred to Tea Essence, and then transferred\nto subordinate operating entities through the WFOEs.\nIf we distribute dividends, we will transfer the dividends to Tea Essence in accordance with the laws and\nregulations of the PRC, and then Tea Essence will transfer the dividends to Bon Natural Life, and the\ndividends will be distributed from Bon Natural Life to all shareholders respectively in proportion to the shares\nthey hold, regardless of whether the shareholders are U.S. investors or investors in other countries or regions.\n3. As of the date of this prospectus, net proceeds of approximately $9 million from our initial public offering\n(“IPO”) and net proceeds of approximately $1 million from the exercise of the over-allotment option were\ntransferred from our company to the PRC subsidiaries in June and July 2021, respectively, as intercompany\nloans. Please see “Parent Company Statements of Cash Flows” in Note 21 (Condensed Financial Information\nof the Parent Company) to the audited financial statements included in our Annual Report on Form 20-F filed\nwith the SEC on January 31, 2022. The inter-company transfers are reflected on the line labelled “Cash lent\nto subsidiaries and VIE,” In the reporting periods presented in this prospectus, no dividends or distributions\nof a subsidiary have been made to us. For the foreseeable future, we intend to use earnings for research and\ndevelopment, to develop new products and to expand its production capacity. As a result, we do not expect\nto pay any cash dividends.\n4. Our PRC subsidiaries’ ability to distribute dividends is based upon their distributable earnings. Current PRC\nregulations permit our PRC subsidiaries to pay dividends to their respective shareholders only out of their\naccumulated profits, if any, determined in accordance with PRC accounting standards and regulations. In\naddition, each of our PRC subsidiaries is required to set aside at least 10% of its after-tax profits each year,\nif any, to fund a statutory reserve until such reserve reaches 50% of each of their registered capitals. These\nreserves are not distributable as cash dividends. See “Regulations Relating to Dividend Distributions” for\nmore information.\nTo address persistent capital outflows and the RMB’s depreciation against the U.S. dollar in the fourth quarter of\n2016, the People’s Bank of China and the State Administration of Foreign Exchange, or SAFE, have implemented a\nseries of capital control measures in the subsequent months, including stricter vetting procedures for China-based\ncompanies to remit foreign currency for overseas acquisitions, dividend payments and shareholder loan repayments.\nThe PRC government may continue to strengthen its capital controls and our PRC subsidiaries’ dividends and other\ndistributions may be subject to tightened scrutiny in the future. The PRC government also imposes controls on the\nconversion of RMB into foreign currencies and the remittance of currencies out of the PRC. Therefore, we may\nexperience difficulties in completing the administrative procedures necessary to obtain and remit foreign currency for\nthe payment of dividends from our profits, if any. Furthermore, if our subsidiaries in the PRC incur debt on their own\nin the future, the instruments governing the debt may restrict their ability to pay dividends or make other payments.\nIn addition, the Enterprise Income Tax Law and its implementation rules provide that a withholding tax at a rate of\n10% will be applicable to dividends payable by Chinese companies to non-PRC-resident enterprises unless reduced\nunder treaties or arrangements between the PRC central government and the governments of other countries or regions\nwhere the non-PRC resident enterprises are tax resident. Pursuant to the tax agreement between Mainland China and\nthe Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, the withholding tax rate in respect to the payment of dividends by a\nPRC enterprise to a Hong Kong enterprise may be reduced to 5% from a standard rate of 10%. However, if the relevant\ntax authorities determine that our transactions or arrangements are for the primary purpose of enjoying a favorable tax\ntreatment, the relevant tax authorities may adjust the favorable withholding tax in the future. Accordingly, there is no\nassurance that the reduced 5% withholding rate will apply to dividends received by our Hong Kong subsidiary from\nour PRC subsidiaries. This withholding tax will reduce the amount of dividends we may receive from our PRC\nsubsidiaries.\n30\nXi’an App-Chem’s Operating Subsidiaries\nThe table below provides a summary of Xi’an App-Chem’s operating subsidiaries (“Bon Operating Companies”) and\ntheir primary business functions as of the date of this annual report:\nDate of Place of % of\nName of Entity Incorporation Incorporation Ownership Principal Activities\nBon Natural Life December 11, Cayman Islands Parent, 100% Investment holding\n2019\nTea Essence January 9, 2020 Hong Kong 100% Investment holding\nXi’an CMIT April 9, 2020 Xi.an City, PRC 100% WFOE, Investment holding\nXi’an Youpincui September 8, Xi.an City, PRC 100% WFOE, Investment holding\n2021\nPRC Subsidiaries:\nXi’an App- Chem Bio April 23, 2006 Xi’an City, PRC 100% owned by General administration and\n(Tech) WFOEs sales of the Company’s\nproducts to customers\nBon Operating Companies (owned by\nXi’an App-Chem)\nApp-Chem Health April 17, 2006 Tongchuan City, 100% owned by Registered owner of land with\nPRC Xi’an App-Chem an area of 12,904.5 square\nmeters, no other business\nactivities\nApp-Chem Ag-tech April 19, 2013 Dali County, 100% owned by Product manufacturing\nPRC Xi’an App-Chem\nXi’an YH September 15, Xi.an City, PRC 100% owned by Research and development of\n2009 Xi’an App-Chem product\nApp-Chem Guangzhou April 27, 2018 Guangzhou City, 100% owned by Raw material purchase\nPRC Xi’an App-Chem\nTongchuan DT May 22, 2017 Tongchuan City, 100% owned by Product manufacturing\nPRC Xi’an App-Chem\nXi’an DT April 24, 2015 Xi’an City, PRC 75% owned by Research and development of\nXi’an App-Chem product\nTianjin YHX September 16, Tianjin City, 51% owned by Raw material purchase\n2019 PRC Xi’an App-Chem\nGansu BMK March 11, 2020 Jiuquan City, 100% owned by Product manufacturing\nPRC Xi’an App-Chem\nAll of our actual business operations are conducted through Xi’an App-Chem and its subsidiaries. Bon Natural Life\nLimited (the Cayman Islands holding company offering securities through this Prospectus), its immediate Hong Kong\nsubsidiary Tea Essence, and Tea Essence’s subsidiaries Xi’an CMIT and Xi’an Youpincui, function solely as holding\ncompanies.\nRecent Developments\nClose of Private Offering\nOn January 17, 2023, we closed a private offering of ordinary shares and warrants to purchase ordinary shares. A total\nof 2,750,000 ordinary shares (the “Shares”) were issued to a total of five (5) investors (the “Investors”) at a\nsubscription price of $0.80 per share, for total subscription proceeds of $2,200,000. In addition, for each share\nsubscribed for by the Investors, we issued one (1) warrant to purchase one (1) ordinary share at an exercise price of\n$0.88 per share, exercisable for a period of twenty-four (24) months (the “Warrants”). We have agreed to register the\nInvestors’ re-sale of the Shares by way of a prospectus supplement to our currently effective unallocated shelf\nregistration statement on Form F-3, (SEC File No. 333-267116). The offer and sale of the Shares and the Warrants\nwas exempt under Rule 506 of Regulation D under the Securities Act of 1933 (the “Securities Act”). We engaged in\nno general solicitation or advertising with regard to the offering and the offering was made solely to “Accredited\nInvestors” as defined in Rule 501 of Regulation D under the Securities Act.\n31\nCompletion of the Initial Public Offering (“IPO”)\nOn June 28, 2021, the Company closed its initial public offering (“IPO”) of 2,200,000 ordinary shares, par value\nUS$0.0001 per share at a public offering price of $5.00 per share, and the Company’s ordinary shares started to trade\non the Nasdaq Capital Market under the ticker symbol “BON” since June 24, 2021. On July 2, 2021, the underwriters\nexercised its over-allotment option to purchase an additional 330,000 shares, par value US$0.0001 per share at the\nprice of $5.00 per share. Gross proceeds of the Company’s IPO, including the proceeds from the sale of the over-\nallotment shares, totaled $12.65 million, before deducting underwriting discounts and other related expenses, resulting\nin net proceeds of approximately $11.3 million.\nAcquisition of Land Use Right for Construction of a New Manufacturing Facility\nOn May 10, 2021, we acquired a land use right of 8.2 acres at cost of $267,000, through a government organized\nauction bidding in Yumen City, Gansu Province of China. We have the right to use this land for 50 years until to May\n9, 2071. We plan to construct a new manufacturing facility on this land. Total budget for construction of this new\nmanufacturing plant (“Yumen Plant”) is around $5.6 million. The construction of Yumen Project was initially\nexpected to be completed by October 2022. Due to resurgence of the COVID-19 pandemic, which resulted in the\nimplementation of significant governmental measures, including lockdowns, closures, quarantines and travel bans,\nthe construction work is estimated to be completed in May 2023.\nNewly formed subsidiary\nOn September 8, 2021, Xi’an Youpincui Biotechnology Co., Ltd (“Xi’an Youpincui”) was formed as a Wholly\nForeign-Owned Enterprise (“WFOE”) in the People’s Republic of China (“PRC”). Tea Essence Limited, our direct\nwholly owned subsidiary incorporated in Hong Kong, owns 100% equity interest in Xi’an Youpincui.\nTerminating the VIE agreements for corporate restructuring\nDue to PRC legal restrictions on foreign ownership in companies that engage in online sales China, we originally\ncarried out our business through Xi’an App-Chem, a domestic PRC company holding a value-added\ntelecommunications license, through a variable interest entity structure, because foreign investment in the value-added\ntelecommunication services industry in China is extensively regulated and subject to numerous restrictions. However,\nour online sales have historically generated minimal revenues. On September 28, 2021, our Board of Directors\napproved a restructuring of our corporate structure to terminate the original VIE contractual agreements, to convert\nXi’an App-Chem from a PRC domestic company into a Sino-foreign joint venture, and to transfer 100% of the\nownership interests in Xi’an App-Chem from its original shareholders to Xi’an CMIT and Xi’an Youpincui. On\nOctober 21, 2021, Xi’an Ap-Chem’s original shareholders signed the share transfer agreement to transfer their 100%\nownership interest in Xi-an App-Chem to Xi’an CMIT and Xi’an Youpincui. On October 22, 2021, Xi-an App-Chem\ncompleted its business license registration with PRC government and became a Sino-foreign joint venture.\nEffective November 1, 2021, we completed the reorganization of our corporate structure in the PRC and are the\nindirect sole shareholder of Xi’an App-Chem. Xi’an App-Chem is wholly-owned by two WOFEs Xi’an CMIT and\nXi’an Youpincui. Each of the WOFEs are in turn wholly-owned by Tea Essence, our direct wholly-owned subsidiary\nin Hong Kong. Xi’an App-Chem’s financial results are consolidated into our consolidated financial statements in\naccordance with U.S. GAAP because we have control over that entity by way of 100% share ownership through Tea\nEssence, and in turn, Xi’an CMIT and Xi’an Youpincui. The termination of the VIE agreements as described above\ndoes not adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations because we, together with our\nwholly owned subsidiaries, are effectively controlled by the same shareholders before and after the restructuring. The\nrestructuring is therefore considered to be a recapitalization of entities under common control. Following the corporate\nrestructuring, the value-added telecommunication license held by Xi’an App-Chem has been revoked and we’re\ninvestigating other feasible ways to explore online sales business.\n32\nCOVID-19 Impact\nOur business operations have been affected and may continue to be affected by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.\nAlthough we resumed our operations since early March 2020 and the impact of COVID-19 on our operating results\nand financial performance for fiscal year 2020, 2021 and 2022 were temporary, a resurgence could negatively affect\nthe execution of customer contracts, the collection of customer payments, or disrupt our supply chain, and the\ncontinued uncertainties associated with COVID 19 may cause our revenue and cash flows to underperform in the next\n12 months from the date of issuance of our 2022 consolidated financial statements. The extent of the future impact of\nthe COVID-19 pandemic on our business and results of operations is still uncertain.\nKey Financial Performance Indicators\nIn assessing our financial performance, we consider a variety of financial performance measures, including principal\ngrowth in net revenue and gross profit, our ability to control costs and operating expenses to improve our operating\nefficiency and net income. Our review of these indicators facilitates timely evaluation of the performance of our\nbusiness and effective communication of results and key decisions, allowing our business to respond promptly to\ncompetitive market conditions and different demands and preferences from our customers. The key measures that we\nuse to evaluate the performance of our business are set forth below and are discussed in greater details under “Results\nof Operations”:\nB. Business Overview\nBUSINESS\nOverview\nXi’an App-Chem’s business focuses on the manufacturing of personal care ingredients, such as plant extracted\nfragrance compounds to perfume and fragrance manufacturers, natural health supplements such as powder drinks and\nbioactive food ingredient products mostly used as food additives and nutritional supplements by its customers. Xi’an\nApp-Chem is devoted to providing high quality and competitive prices and a stable supply of products and services\nfor the functional food, personal care, natural medicine and other industries. It provides these products and services\nfor third party customers, as well as for its own proprietary brands. With “nourish life with natural essence” as the\nbusiness concept, and “becoming an innovator (leader) of natural functional ingredients and an integrated supplier of\ngreat health industry” as the goal, after more than 14 years of efforts, Xi’an App-Chem has formed four technology\nplatforms respectively for natural product large-scale separation, natural product safety improvement, natural product\nactivity enhancement, and natural product function compounding. Its products have not been approved as effective in\ntreating or preventing any health conditions and/or diseases by a regulatory agency in the PRC.\nWe were co-founded by a team of top-level executives from China’s domestic natural products industry, together with\nexperts returned from overseas. For the past 10 years, we have focused on the core needs of the natural products\nindustry, emphasizing technological innovation and supply chain integration. We are devoted to providing a stable\nsupply of high-quality products and services at competitive prices for the functional food, personal care, cosmetic and\npharmaceutical industries. “Nourish life with natural essence” is our business concept, and “Becoming an innovative\nleader of natural functional ingredients and an integrated supplier for the health industry” is our goal. We have formed\nfour technology platforms as follows:\n1. Commercial scale natural ingredient extraction and separation platform built with technologies such as\ncontinuous dynamic extraction and molecular distillation and membrane separation (“Technical Platform\n1”);\n2. Natural extraction safety improvement and assurance platform designed with technology to remove heavy\nmetal, pesticide, and other harmful residues (“Technical Platform 2”);\n3. Platform of bioactive ingredient of natural extract enhancement built with technology seeking to increase\nhuman absorption rate of naturally extracted ingredients by increasing their water solubility and utilizing\ndrug delivery system (“Technical Platform 3”); and\n4. Natural extract formulation technology platform based on steady state technology with focus on formulation\nof natural anti-oxidant and functional oligosaccharide to achieve stable output, high purity and absorption\nrate (“Technical Platform 4”).\n33\nThe four technical platforms are utilized throughout the production process of our products with applications\nillustrated as follows:\nTechnical Platform 1. Commercial scale natural ingredient extraction and separation platform:\n● Clary Sage concrete is produced by continuous countercurrent extraction, from clary sage;\n● Sclareol is produced by molecular distillation separation from clary Sage concrete;\n● Stachyose is produced by biological enzymatic hydrolysis-membrane method efficient and continuous\nseparation from stachys affinis; and\n● Apple polyphenol is produced with high-efficiency membrane separation from apples.\nTechnical Platform 2. Natural extraction safety improvement and assurance platform:\n● Solvent residues are removed in the process of producing ambroxide and Sclareolides with purity in order\nto maintain aroma when used in fragrance products;\n● Carbendazim and other pesticide residues are removed in the process of producing apple polyphenols to\nparts per billion (“PPB”) level in accordance to applicable food safety regulations; and\n● Heavy metals and other metal ions are removed in producing stachyose and the ash content is as low as\n0.01%, for product safety purpose, while improving product quality and flavor.\nTechnical Platform 3. Bioactive ingredient of natural extract enhancement\n● Mainly used in dietary supplement products currently in early commercial development stage with\napplications of technology such as water solubility enhancement and drug delivery system to seek higher\nabsorption rate by human and to yield with more active ingredients.\nTechnical Platform 4. Natural extract formulation technology platform\n● Mainly used in dietary supplement products currently in early commercial development stage with\napplications of technology such as molecule steady state technology and anti-oxidants to seek consistent\nproduct quality and extended shelf life.\nWith the combination and application of the above technology platforms, we seek to produce products with high\nquality assurance.\nIn addition, based on our technology for rehabilitation of the human microbiome, cell death regulation, and anti-aging\nproduct development, we are able to provide products and services advantageous in terms of cost, safety, performance,\nfunction and other aspects for customers in the food, personal care, cosmetics and pharmaceutical industries.\nThe services provided to our customers include customized product development and formulation and after-sale and\ntechnical support. These services are value-added provided to our customers to enhance customer loyalty and our\ncompetitiveness in the marketplace.\nProduct Categories\nFragrance compounds:\n● Clary sage extract products (Sclareol, Sclareolide, Ambroxide, Clary Sage Oil, Clary Sage Concrete);\n● Lavender essential oil;\nWhile some perfumers may still use the expensive and hard-to-find substance ambergris, which is produced in the\nintestines of sperm whales, the industry now increasingly uses a substance known as “ambroxide,” synthesized from\nthe compound “sclareol” found in clary sage plant. Ambroxide is used both as a fragrance and as a “fixative” for\nmaking scents linger longer in products. Made by our proprietary microbial fermentation process and molecular\ndistillation technology, our ambroxide products are produced with higher purity and yield than industry average. Based\non product testing reports, we have determined that our ambroxide products are produced with 99.5% purity and\nabove, while the industry average is approximately 99.0%. The yield of our ambroxide production is approximately\n63%. Our management believes the industry average yield for ambroxide production to be approximately 40% to 43%.\n34\nHealth supplements (natural, functional active ingredients for powder drinks):\nBased on our accumulations in natural functional components separation, biological activity research, product\napplication development, natural product supply chain and other areas, we are able to provide a host of solutions for\nfunctional food (health products, nutrients, etc.), functional personal care products (whitening, moisturizing, anti-acne,\netc.), natural medicine and other needs, including formulation development, ingredients supply, and product OEM. In\naddition, we have launched new over-the-counter products, including Bon Natural Micro-eco Hair Repair Shampoo;\nTianmei Jinghao Nutrition Powder. We are also in the development stage of more innovative products using natural,\nfunctional ingredients intended for the precise regulation and control of the humane micro-biome. Examples include\nour DuiJiuDangGe (JiuGe) and Gout Ease (Feng Qing Ping). Our products have not been approved as effective in\ntreating or preventing any health conditions and/or diseases by a regulatory agency in the PRC.\nBioactive food ingredients:\n● Stachyose (P60, P70, P80)\n● Milk thistle extracts (various solvent Silymarin, Silybin, Water-soluble silymarin and silybin);\n● Apple extracts (Apple polyphenol, Apple dietary fiber, Phloridzin, Phloretin)\n● Pomegranate extract products (Ellagic acid, Punicalagin,Urolithin)\nAside from macronutrients such as carbohydrates, proteins, and fatty acids, the term “bioactive food ingredients”\nrefers to natural compounds, mainly from plant foods, with specific physiological functions. These include flavonoids,\nphenolic acids, organic sulfides, terpenoids and carotenoids, coenzyme Q, γ-aminobutyric acid, melatonin, and L-\ncarnitine and other biologically active ingredients derived from animal food. These ingredients are believed to\nparticipate in the regulation of physiology and pathophysiology, such that food containing these ingredients is believed\nto have specific functions in addition to basic nutrition.\nOur biologically active food ingredients and their main uses are as follows:\n1. Apple polyphenol: widely used in high-end personal care products such as weight loss, blood lipid reduction, anti-\naging beauty, whitening, anti-wrinkle and other high-end personal care products.\n2. Stachyose: Stachyose is a prebiotic, which can promote the proliferation of human intestinal probiotics. It is widely\nused in dairy products, health drinks, personal care, health care products, ice cream, Chinese medicine, and other\nindustries.\n3. Milk thistle extract: A flavonoid derived from the plant milk thistle. It is known to have (but has not been\nscientifically proven to have) liver protection, anti-inflammatory, anti-tumor and blood pressure effects. It is used to\nseek to improve liver diseases caused by alcohol and environmental toxins.\n4. Pomegranate extract: A plant-extracted polyphenol with potential effects of anti-oxidation, anti-aging, blood\npressure lowering and whitening effects, and can be used in food, medicine and cosmetics.\n35\nOur Manufacturing Process\nThe following chart illustrates our main manufacturing process from raw material purchase to finish products:\nOur health supplements (powder drinks) are made with naturally extracted active ingredients. For example, stachyose\nis a single prebiotic, which seeks to accelerate proliferation of bacillus bifidus. Used together with other prebiotic\nbacteria, it helps greatly in adjusting intestinal bacteria groups, relieving constipation and keeping intestines youthful\nand perpetually healthy. Our quality control is throughout the entire production and starts souring from the farms with\nsuperior quality. The first step is anti-degradation extraction with a special protective agent followed by continuous\nresin chromatographic separation and purification to produce high purity stachyose.\n36\nOur fragrance compound products are plant-based natural extracts widely used as fixatives in fragrance, detergent,\nhealth supplements and tobacco flavoring. There are three different products being produced along our proprietary\nmanufacturing process, Sclareol, Sclareolide and Ambroxide. Our manufacturing process of clary sage products can\nbe summarized as: i) continuous countercurrent extraction to ensure faster, more efficient and higher yield than\ntraditional extraction methods; ii) molecular distillation to improve evaporation velocity, and liquid film distribution\nas well as to reduce heating time and degradation of thermo-sensitive materials; iii) biological transformation with\nwater as media, thus no chemical or heavy metal residues; followed by catalytic reduction; and iv) supramolecular\ncrystal reconstruction to produce our fine ambroxide for use in fragrance or detergent fixatives.\nAn example of our bioactive food ingredients is apple polyphenols, which are major antioxidants extracted from apples\nand may contribute to color, flavor, odor and oxidative stability. Therefore, apple polyphenols are widely used in\nvarious applications, including health supplements, cosmetics, and food preservation. Our proprietary manufacturing\nprocess of apple polyphenols principally involves the following steps: continuous anti-oxidant extraction, and\ncontinuous resin chromatographic separation and purification.\nIntellectual Property\nPatents\nAs a result of our collection of academic and technological expertise, as of September 30, 2022, we had 12 approved\npatents and 3 applying patent in China, as set forth in the following table:\nAuthorization\nPatent No./ Date/\nApplication Application\nNo Patent Name No. Date Status Period Holder Type\n1 Method for separating ZL 2008 1 July 20, 2011 Authorized 20 years Xi’an App- Invention\nsclareol 0231943.X Chem\n2 Preparation method of ZL 2010 1 October 5, Authorized 20 years Xi’an App- Invention\napplephenon 0179259.9 2011 Chem\n3 Method for preparing osthole ZL 2010 1 February 8, Authorized 20 years Xi’an App- Invention\n0531931.6 2012 Chem\n4 Process for separating ZL 2010 1 April 11, 2012 Authorized 20 years Xi’an App- Invention\nimperatorin from osthole 0531934.X Chem\nextract waste liquid\n5 Method for preparing ZL 2010 1 May 23, 2012 Authorized 20 years Xi’an App- Invention\npunicalagin and ellagic acid 0531940.5 Chem\nfrom pomegranate rind\n6 Molecular distillation and ZL 2010 1 August 15, Authorized 20 years Xi’an App- Invention\npurification method for 0531945.8 2012 Chem\nconjugated linolenic acid\n7 Flatstem milkvetch seed solid ZL 2010 1 December 5, Authorized 20 years Xi’an App- Invention\nbeverage and preparation 0531836.6 2012 Chem\nmethod thereof\n8 Method for extraction ZL 2013 1 March 2, 2016 Authorized 20 years Xi’an App- Invention\nseparation of rutin of tartary 0645312.3 Chem\nbuckwheat\n9 Method for synthesizing ZL 2010 1 August 22, Authorized 20 years Xi’an YH Invention\nluteolin 0531920.8 2012\n10 Method for preparing ZL 2010 1 September 26, Authorized 20 years Xi’an YH Invention\nbaicalin 0531839.X 2012\n11 Synthetic method of ZL 2013 1 July 13, 2016 Authorized 20 years Xi’an YH Invention\nbiapenem drug intermediate 0632993.X\n4-AA\n12 Functional instant tea and ZL 2015 1 January 15, Authorized 20 years Xi’an DT Invention\npreparation technology 0294685.X 2019\nthereof\n13 Preparation method of CM202011589282.5 April 25, Pending 20 Xi’an App- Invention\nsclareol 2021 years ChemChem\n14 Extraction method of sclareol CM202110130480.3 May 17, 2021 Pending 20 Xi’an App- Invention\nyears ChemChem\n15 A refinement method of 202210363869.7 April 8,2022 Pending 20 years Xi’an App- Invention\nproanthocyanidin B2, and the ChemChem\napplication thereof\n37\nKey Suppliers and Customers\nWe enjoy a broad network of raw materials suppliers and customers and distributors.

Our Raw Material Ingredients Team sells natural active ingredients such as stachyose, apple\npolyphenol, Ambroxide, and others to customers in the functional food and personal care industries, accounting for\naround 70% of the company’s total sales. The Functional Health Team focuses on human micro-biome adjustment\nand control products, providing small and medium-sized customers in the Chinese domestic Big Health industry with\none-stop solutions from product design, research and development, and procurement to OEM in digestive health,\nmetabolic health, immune health and other fields. The Functional Health Team accounts for about 30% of the\ncompany’s overall business. Our marketing efforts are focused in two areas – the international market and the domestic\nChinese market. The international market is dominated by raw materials and ingredients, while the domestic market\nis primarily focused on functional health.\nOur raw materials and ingredients businesses are promoted through exhibitions, professional journals, academic\nconferences, and social platforms (social broadcasting), with academic promotion of professional knowledge and\ngeneral scientific knowledge being the main methods. We are committed to promoting and maintaining our brand\nimage in the natural ingredients industry. Our brands and slogans, such as App-Chem, App-Chem Stachyose for\nHealthy Digestion in China (“天美水苏糖，健康中国肠”), App-Chem Cares Life (“天然至美呵护生命至美”). are\nwell recognized and widely praised in the industry. We have established a strong and widely known reputation in the\ninternational natural products industry, especially in the field of micro-biome health.\nOur functional health business focuses on adjustment and control of the micro-biome and focuses on immune health\nand digestion health as the target market. The Company promotes itself through exhibition, social platforms (stachyose\nsocial broadcasting), and Internet promotions (Ning Xiang Tang Nutrition Powder, and Tianmei Jinghao Nutrition\nPowder). Through continuous efforts, the Company has established a sound reputation in the Great Health industry\nand has become a preferred supplier for several leading clients both at home and abroad.\n39\nLeading Competitors\nOur main competitors are suppliers of functional ingredients, nutrition food, and traditional Chinese medicine\nfunctional food in the Big Health industry. They are as follows:\nQHT- a leading probiotics supplier in China\nQuantum Hi-Tech (China) Biotechnology Co., Ltd., publicly listed in 2010, is a national hi-tech enterprise committed\nto micro-ecology health. As a leading enterprise in the micro-ecological health industry, Quantum Bio has brands like\nOligo, and Sheng He Tang, and operates the largest production site of oligosaccharide in China. QHT focuses on the\nfield of probiotics with products like oligosaccharide and galactooligosaccharide, which can regulate intestinal\nmicroecological balance in dual manner by stimulating beneficial bacteria and inhibiting harmful bacteria. These\nproducts have been identified by the Public Nutrition and Development Center of the Macro Economy Institution of\nthe National Development and Reform Commission as advocacy products of nutrition and health, and emerging\nproducts with wide-ranging and promising applications. In 2013, Forbes China included QHT in its Top 200 Listed\nSmall- and Medium-sized Asian Enterprises. QHT and its logo are a well-known trademark in China. As of March\n2020, QHT’s total market value reached US $1 billion.\nChenguang Biotech (CCGB)- a leading natural ingredients supplier in China\nChenguang Biotech Group Co., Ltd., another publicly listed company, has twenty subsidiaries and is an export- and\nforeign-exchange-generation-oriented enterprise which integrates intensive processing of agricultural products and\nextract of natural plants.

As of March 2020, the total market value of Chenguang Biotech Group Co., Ltd. reached ¥ 4.7\nbillion.\nTong Ren Tang- a leading producer of traditional Chinese medicine and health products in China\nBeijing Tong Ren Tang (Group) Co., Ltd., a wholly state-owned company, is authorized by the municipal government\nto operate state-owned assets. It was founded in 1669, with a history of 343 years. The group adheres to the\ndevelopment strategy of “taking modern traditional Chinese medicine as the core, developing life and health industry,\nand becoming an internationally renowned modern traditional Chinese medicine group”. It takes “growing,\nstrengthening and expanding” as its policy, and takes innovation and technology as its mission. Its sales revenue,\nprofits, export earnings and the number of overseas terminals rank first in the industry in China. Since 1997, Tong\nRen Tang has maintained sustained and healthy development, with its economic indicators reaching double-digit\ngrowth for 15 consecutive years, doubling every five years. As of 2011, the group has a total asset of ¥14 billion, a\nsales revenue of ¥16.3 billion, a profit of ¥1.316 billion, and foreign exchange earnings of $33.92 million. It has set\nup 64 pharmacies and 1 overseas production and research base in 16 overseas countries and regions. Its products are\nsold to more than 40 overseas countries and regions.\nAt the same time, Tong Ren Tang’s dual function of being both an economic entity and a cultural carrier has become\nincreasingly apparent. It has achieved fruitful results in brand maintenance and promotion, cultural innovation and\ninheritance. The “Tong Ren Tang traditional Chinese medicine culture” has been approved as one of the first items to\nbe included in the List of National Intangible Cultural Heritage. It has signed a strategic cooperation framework\nagreement with the Confucius Institute Headquarters (Hanban) to jointly promote Tong Ren Tang traditional Chinese\nmedicine culture and has further strengthened the overseas dissemination of Tong Ren Tang Culture by using the\nConfucius Institute platform. As of March 2020, Tong Ren Tang’s total market value reached ¥ 34.3 billion.\nBY-HEALTH- a leading supplier of nutrients by indirect selling in China\nFounded in October 1995, BY-HEALTH introduced dietary supplements into China’s indirect selling market\nsystematically in 2002. It has since grown rapidly into a leading brand and benchmark enterprise of dietary\nsupplements in China. In August 2010, Yao Ming, the former international basketball superstar, signed contract to\nbecome its brand ambassador. On December 15, 2010, BY-HEALTH was listed on the Growth Enterprise Market\n(GEM) of Shenzhen Stock Exchange.\nFor more than a decade, BY-HEALTH has been adhering to differentiated global quality strategy in three steps,\nnamely, from global raw materials procurement, to establishment of its global base for the sole purpose of supplying\nraw materials, and then to the establishment of a global self-owned organic farm. So far, BY-HEALTH has sources\nof raw materials from 23 countries and regions worldwide. It has set up 5 exclusive raw materials bases in Brazil,\nAustralia and other places. Now, its own organic farms are under planning. BY-HEALTH will make unremitting\nefforts to select high-quality raw materials from all over the world, bringing together the essence of nutrition, and\nbuilding a “United Nations” of nutrients that selects the best from the better. As of March 2020, the total market value\nof BY-HEALTH reached ¥ 27.2 billion.\n40\nCompetitive Challenges and Advantages\nOur competitors’ main advantages are as follows:\n● Stronger business scale and capital strength – Our main competitors are listed public companies, with\nrelatively longer development histories, larger business scales and stronger financial strength.\n● Larger and more complete sales networks — Since our main competitors have larger business scales, their\nmarket sales networks are accordingly wider.\n● Brand recognition – Due to the advantages of being well-identified public companies, their high levels of\nmarketing and promotion and, in some cases, inherited historical advantages, our main competitors have\ngreater brand recognition.\nCompared with our main competitors, our advantages are mainly reflected in the following two aspects:\n● More advanced technology and products – Our main competitors’ technologies are mainly traditional\nphysical and chemical techniques such as extraction and separation. Relatively speaking, we employ more\nadvanced bio-manufacturing technologies, which give us enormous disproportional advantage in production\nefficiency and cost (a cost advantage of 20% to 60% over our main competitors).\nIn the production of ambroxide for example, unlike our main competitors who use chemical synthesis with\nlengthy and complex process, typically involving 10 steps, such as oxidation, crystallization and extraction\nat multiple stages as well as saponification reaction, we use a bio- technique that utilizes a six-step process\nin a mild environment, including bio-synthesis, continuous separation, reduction, extraction, cyclization and\ncrystallization to achieve what we believe is higher yield and efficiency than the industry average. As another\nexample, most of our competitors produce stachyose with the traditional approach, resin separation, which is\na lower yield method due to its intermittent process. Our continuous process is differentiated by our use of\nbio-enzyme and bio-membrane separation and purification, which we believe leads to higher yield and purity.\n● First-mover advantage – The primary market focus for our products is nutritional health and personal care\nadjusted and controlled by the human micro-biome. This relatively new and fast-growing product focus has\nbeen made possible by recent breakthroughs in human micro-biome technology. Unlike our main\ncompetitors, we are strongly focused on this rapidly expanding market. We believe this gives us an important\nfirst-mover advantage. We intend to use this growing market niche to achieve rapid development and growth\nwithout immediate and direct competitive pressure from larger firms. Our market network, financial strength,\nbrand awareness, and other areas will gradually improve as the Company grows and develops. As we become\nas more powerful market player, we will become better positioned to compete with larger, more established\ncompanies.\nDevelopment and Expansion Strategy\nThe key components of our development and expansion strategy over the next two-to-three years are as follows:\nRaw Material and Ingredients\nUsing our current projects as a foothold, we intend to expand our plants to increase productivity and enlarge our\nmarkets to ensure sustainable growth. Over the next two to three years, our raw materials and ingredients business\nwill be centered on the Great Health market and focus on the core needs of the functional food and personal care\nindustries. We view our current business in this area as foundation from which we can expand our plants, increase our\nproductivity, improve our technology and equipment, optimize our supply chain, and broaden our sales channels to\nensure a steady and sustainable growth. Management is committed to achieving a compound annual growth rate in\nthis business line of no less than 30%.\n41\nIn our functional health business, we intend a rapid expansion focused on the development and introduction of\ninnovative new products. Over the next two to three years, we will continue to place an intensive focus on human\nmicro-biome health, and actively develop a series of functional food and personal care products featuring strong and\nfasting-acting effects on the respiratory and gastrointestinal areas of the human micro-biome. These products will be\ndesigned to take advantage of precise adjustment and regulation of the human micro-biome. The quality raw materials\nproduced by our own natural ingredients business will provide us a significant cost advantage in these efforts.\nOur Strengths\nInnovation in Manufacturing Methods and Product Development\n● Xi’an App-Chem is a supplier of personal care ingredients, and we seek to be a leader in the bio-\nmanufacturing of natural products and health solutions in immunity and digestion by leveraging our\nproprietary natural essence extraction technology to focus on human micro-biome as a therapeutic target.\nTogether with our operating subsidiaries, we hold several patents issued by the PRC, relating primarily to\ncomposition and processing techniques for products and product ingredients.\n● We use bio-manufacturing technology to produce substances such as sclareol, sclareolide, ambroxide,\nextracted from Clary sage (Salvia sclarea L.), a very aromatic herbaceous plant, to replace ambergris\n(ambroxide is a substitute of ambergris which is originated from sperm whale), novel probiotics stachyose,\nand natural antioxidant apple polyphenol. Our ambroxide is made using our proprietary technology, which\nwe believe can be done at a lower cost, than the processes used by some of our competitors. Our stachyose\nmanufacturing process features a very high productivity rate (over 1,000-ton capacity), and, we believe, a\nhigher product purity, and faster and more extensive proliferation of probiotics than the primary competing\nsubstance, chrysanthemum powder.\n● Xi’an App-Chem is listed as a key enterprise with ensured supplies in the COVID-19 prevention and control\nperiod by various Chinese government agencies during the COVID-19 pandemic due to its immunity\nboosting products such as stachyose. There is no proven efficacy of Stachyose in preventing, treating or\ncontrolling the spread of COVID-19. In its “COVID-19 Treatment Solution-version 7*”, issued on March 3,\n2020, China’s National Health Commission recommended the use of supplements regulating the human gut\nmicrobiome as one of the potential treatments for COVID-19 patients in critical condition. Xi’an App-Chem,\ntogether with other companies in bio-medicine, traditional Chinese medicine, medical equipment,\ninformation service devices and system, and PPE manufacturing businesses, was qualified to be listed as a\nkey enterprise in COVID-19 prevention and control for its stachyose products. Stachyose, the main product\nof Xi’An App-Chem is the major component of the microecological regulator proposed as part of China’s\ntreatment plan for COVID-19. It has been deemed an “important raw and auxiliary material” for pandemic\ncontrol related drugs and substances, thereby allowing Xi’an App-Chem to meet the qualifications for listing\nas a key enterprise for the potential prevention and control of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nThe key enterprise selection for pandemic prevention and control is an institutional system established by a\nseries of policies issued during February and March 2020 by the Chinese government in order to combat\nCOVID-19. The main purpose of these policies is to ensure the stable supply of medical supplies, medicines,\nkey raw materials, and essential living materials during this special period.\nThe following types of companies are qualified to be listed as key enterprises:\n○ Manufacturers of important medical supplies such as medical masks and non-medical face masks,\nCOVID-19 test kits, infrared thermometers, intelligent monitoring and detection systems, and related\ndrugs and medical equipment that have been requested;\n○ A key enterprise that produces important daily necessities;\n○ Important raw and auxiliary material manufacturers, important equipment manufacturers and related\nsupporting enterprises required for the production of the above-mentioned materials;\n○ An important medical material purchase and storage enterprise;\n○ Companies that provide relevant information and communication equipment and service systems to\nrespond to the epidemic;\n○ Enterprises that undertake the above-mentioned material transportation and sales tasks in response to the\nepidemic; and\n○ Other enterprises with key guarantees in accordance with the requirements of the State Council’s joint\nprevention and control mechanism.\n42\nThe advantages of this designation to Xi’an App-Chem include expedited governmental and regulatory approval\nprocesses to resume operations, and preferential bank loans with favorable terms.\nMajor supporting measures include:\n1. Priority approval of business reopening;\n2. Priority early reopening for the transportation of raw materials and products;\n3. Work and travel support for needed employees;\n4. Working capital support for the key enterprises;\n5. Preferential tax policy support to key enterprises; and\n6. The government’s commitment to the procurement of special protective and medical equipment.\n(Items 4 and 5 are issued with official government documents; Items 1, 2, 3, and 6 are temporary support measures\nby local governments at all levels without documentation.)\n● Our process for manufacturing apple polyphenol (a source of anti-oxidants) allows us to achieve a high\nproduct anti-oxidant content of 70% to 90%, higher than some of our competitors’ products.\n● Xi’an App-Chem launched new over-the-counter products, including Bon Natural Micro-eco Hair Repair\nShampoo and Tianmei Jinghao Nutrition Powder. In addition, the Company is in the development stage of\nmore innovative products using natural, functional ingredients intended for the precise regulation and control\nof the humane micro-biome. Examples include our DuiJiuDangGe (JiuGe) and Gout Ease (Feng Qing\nPing).\nA Stable Supply Chain for Raw Materials for the Fragrance, Food and Beverage Industries\n● Xi’an App-Chem seeks to have a stable supply chain for raw materials, which is important in the natural\ningredient field. The company’s management team, through its operating experience, is constantly improving\ntheir selection of various natural raw material sources, supply chain management, supplier selection, and risk\nand quality control.\nAdvantages in Cost Control\n● The Company’s management team believes that its bio-manufacturing technology gives it an average cost\nadvantage in producing its natural ingredients (i.e., products such as Ambroxide, stachyose, apple polyphenol\nand other types of natural-ingredient products).\nProfessional and Efficient Sales Team and Branding\n● There are twelve people in our sales team, among whom four have professional backgrounds in biology,\nchemistry, medicine, pharmacy, and related fields. Six of our sales professionals majored in English,\ninternational trade and related fields. Our sales professionals have an average of over five years of relevant\nwork experience. Two of them have been stationed abroad to work on a long-term basis. With more than ten\nyears of accumulated experience, we have forged a sales system worldwide (mainly in Europe, East Asia,\nand North America).\nOur Challenges\nWe May Face Competition from Other Companies Currently In Other Categories of the Natural Ingredients and Health\nSolutions Industry.\n● Because of the and recent growth of our existing business, we may face new direct competition from some\ncounterparts engaged in other categories of the natural products and ingredients business, such as Chenguang\nBiotech from China, which is engaged in natural colors, Layn, which engaged in natural sweeteners, and\nEuropean companies like Koninklijke DSM N.V., Symrise AG, and Givaudan SA. These firms may seek to\ncompete directly with Xi’an App-Chem in its existing businesses. The size, financial strength, technology\nfoundation and development capabilities of the above-mentioned companies are strong, and potential\ncompetition from these firms will be a key competitive challenge in the near future.\n43\nLarger, more Developed Food and Ingredient Companies May Seek to Compete in Our Industry in the Near Future.\n● The rapid development of human micro-biome technology has resulted in rapid commercialization in the\nrelated products of immune health and digestive health, which has increasingly attracted the attention of some\nlarge-scale companies. For example, the French large-scale food company Danone Group recently\nannounced that it continues to place the gut and its micro-biome at the core of its health strategy to deliver\nthe company’s mission “bringing health through food to as many people as possible.” Such large companies\nmight change the current landscape of the industry, either directly or through mergers and acquisitions. These\ncompanies may challenge us by seeking to secure key raw material sources for their products and to acquire\nstability, reliability and cost advantages for their supply chains. Because of the strong capital and brand\nstrength of such companies, they might pose challenges to us in the future.\nWe May Face Additional Competition from New Entrants to the Health Industry\n● The Big Health industry has experienced sustained and rapid growth worldwide, based on the rapid\ndevelopment of information technology and life science technology in recent years. Prompted by the serious\nemergency caused by the global COVID-19, consumers and public administrators around the world have\npaid more attention to basic health issues than ever before, especially to immune health. At the core of\nimmune health, and at the core of our business focus, is the precise adjustment and control of human micro-\nbiome by natural probiotics. This area has drawn a wide external attention, which may cause firms outside\nthe health industry to seek market entry. In the future, some of the new entrants may become our competitive\nchallengers.\nOur Current Sales and Distribution Network May Be Insufficient to Support Our Planned Growth.\n● We currently sell our products through our direct sales force and distribution channel. Although our sales\nand distribution network is sufficient for our existing needs, it may be insufficient to meet future product\ndemand as we continue to grow our business. As we begin to expand our production capacity, an insufficient\ndistribution network may hinder our ability to meet demand and to grow our revenues accordingly.\nWe may face new regulations in the PRC in the future\n● Recently, the PRC government initiated a series of regulatory actions and made a number of public statements\non the regulation of business operations in China with little advance notice, including cracking down on\nillegal activities in the securities market, enhancing supervision over China-based companies listed overseas\nusing a variable interest entity structure, adopting new measures to extend the scope of cybersecurity reviews,\nand expanding efforts in anti-monopoly enforcement. We do not believe that we are directly subject to these\nregulatory actions or statements, as we do not have a variable interest entity structure and our business does\nnot involve the collection of user data, implicate cybersecurity, or involve any other type of restricted\nindustry. Because these statements and regulatory actions are new, however, it is highly uncertain how soon\nlegislative or administrative regulation making bodies in China will respond to them, or what existing or new\nlaws or regulations will be modified or promulgated, if any, or the potential impact such modified or new\nlaws and regulations will have on our daily business operations or our ability to accept foreign investments\nand continue to be listed on an U.S. exchange.\nOur Strategy for Meeting Potential Challenges\n● First, we intend to meet our possible competitive challenges by giving full play to our advantages (mainly\ntechnology, products, and supply chain) to attain greater advantage in terms of quality, cost, and supply\nstability. We intend to use these advantages to secure a larger market share and to boost our rapid\ndevelopment and expansion of our capabilities. Due to the high technical barriers to entry in our field,\nincluding the complexity of the raw materials involved and the inherent product quality challenges, we\nbelieve potential competitors seeking to enter our market will require three to five years to enter the market\nand launch truly competitive products. We believe this will allow us to press our advantages described above\nand stay ahead of new competition.\n44\n● Second, we intend to accelerate our business growth and market expansion, taking full advantage of rapid\nindustrial advancements empowered by information technology and life science technology. Our improved\nfinancial strength after a successful equity offering, combined with a sustained growth of market demand in\nthe Big Health industry (driven in part by the COVID-19 pandemic), will enhance our ability to tackle various\nchallenges.\n● Third, we will actively seek opportunities for collaboration and cooperation with large-scale enterprises that\nfocus on human micro-biome-related businesses (such as Guangzhou Wanglaoji Pharmaceutical, JDB,\nWahaha, Mengniu, Yili, Chr. Hansen, etc.), including cooperation in product sales, strategic business\nrelationships, and, if possible, equity investment.\n● Fourth, we intend to invest some of our available cash generated from operations and capital raising to add\nadditional teams to our direct sales force, to expand our geographic reach with new distribution channels into\nother provinces within China and overseas, and to establish more sales online.\nWe also face other challenges, risks and uncertainties that may materially and adversely affect our business, financial\ncondition, results of operations and prospects. You should consider the risks discussed in “Risk Factors” and elsewhere\nin this report before investing in our Shares.\nREGULATIONS\nThis section sets forth a summary of the most significant rules and regulations that affect our business activities in\nChina and the European Union or our shareholders’ rights to receive dividends and other distributions from us.\nRegulations Relating to Foreign Investment in China\nForeign investment law\nOn March 15, 2019, the National People’s Congress, or the NPC, promulgated the Foreign Investment Law of the\nPRC, or the Foreign Investment Law, which became effective on January 1, 2020, and replaced the Sino-foreign Equity\nJoint Venture Enterprise Law, the Sino-foreign Cooperative Joint Venture Enterprise Law, and the Wholly Foreign-\ninvested Enterprise Law. The organization form, organization, and activities of foreign-invested enterprises shall be\ngoverned, among others, by the PRC Company Law and the PRC Partnership Enterprise Law. Foreign-invested\nenterprises established in accordance with the Sino-foreign Equity Joint Venture Enterprise Law, the Sino-foreign\nCooperative Joint Venture Enterprise Law, and the Wholly Foreign-invested Enterprise Law before the\nimplementation of the Foreign Investment Law may retain the original business organization and so on within five\nyears after the implementation of the Foreign Investment Law. The Foreign Investment Law provides that that foreign\ninvestment refers to investment activities directly or indirectly conducted within China by foreign natural persons,\nenterprises or other entities (the “foreign investors”), which include the following forms: (a) a foreign investor,\nindividually or collectively with other investors, establishes a foreign-invested enterprise within PRC; (b) a foreign\ninvestor acquires stock shares, equity shares, property portions, or other like rights and interests of an enterprise within\nPRC; (c) a foreign investor, individually or collectively with other investors, invests in a new project within the PRC;\nand (d) other forms of investments under laws, administrative regulations, or provisions prescribed by the State\nCouncil of the PRC.\nOn December 26, 2019, the State Council promulgated the Implementing Regulations of the Foreign Investment Law\nof the PRC, or the FIE Implementing Regulations, which became effective on January 1, 2020. The FIE Implementing\nRegulations strictly implements the legislative principles and purpose of the Foreign Investment Law, it emphasizes\non promoting and protecting the foreign investment and refines the specific measures. On the same day, the Supreme\nPeople’s Court issued the Interpretation on the Application of the Foreign Investment Law of the PRC, which also\ncame into effect on January 1, 2020 and provides for interpretations on the application of laws in cases of investment\ncontracts disputes between equal parties. This interpretation shall apply to any contractual dispute arising from the\nacquisition of the relevant rights and interests by a foreign investor by way of gift, division of property, the merger of\nenterprises, division of enterprises, etc.\n45\nAccording to the FIE Implementing Regulations, the registration of foreign-invested enterprises shall be handled by\nthe State Administration for Market Regulation, or the SAMR or its authorized local counterparts. Where a foreign\ninvestor invests in an industry or field subject to licensing in accordance with laws, the relevant competent government\ndepartment responsible for granting such license shall review the license application of the foreign investor in\naccordance with the same conditions and procedures applicable to PRC domestic investors unless it is stipulated\notherwise by the laws and administrative regulations, and the competent government department shall not impose\ndiscriminatory requirements on the foreign investor in terms of licensing conditions, application materials, reviewing\nsteps and deadlines, etc. However, the relevant competent government departments shall not grant the license or permit\nenterprise registration if the foreign investor intends to invest in the industries or fields as specified in the Special\nAdministrative Measures for Market Access of Foreign Investment (Negative List) (2021 Version), or the Negative\nList 2021, without satisfying the relevant requirements. If a foreign investor invests in a prohibited field or industry\nas specified in the Negative List 2021, the relevant competent government department shall order the foreign investor\nto stop the investment activities, dispose of the shares or assets or take other necessary measures within a specified\ntime limit, and restore to the status prior to the occurrence of the aforesaid investment, and the illegal gains, if any,\nshall be confiscated. If the investment activities of a foreign investor violate the special administrative measures for\naccess restrictions on foreign investments as stipulated in the negative list, the relevant competent government\ndepartment shall order the investor to make corrections within the specified time limit and take necessary measures to\nmeet the relevant requirements. If the foreign investor fails to make corrections within the specified time limit, the\naforesaid provisions regarding the circumstance that a foreign investor invests in the prohibited field or industry shall\napply.\nAccording to the Foreign Investment Law and the FIE Implementing Regulations, Xi’an CMIT and Xi’an Youpincui\nhave registered with the High-tech Branch of Xi’an Administration Industrial and Commercial Bureau. As the\nindustries engaged by Xi’an CMIT and Xi’an Youpincui are not listed in the Negative List 2021, they do not need to\nobtain any license from other relevant competent government departments.\nRegulations Relating to Value-Added Telecommunications Services\nForeign investment in value-added telecommunications\nForeign direct investment in telecommunications companies in China is regulated by the Administrative Provisions\non Foreign-Invested Telecommunications Enterprises, or the FITE Regulation, which was issued by the State Council\non December 11, 2001, most recently amended on February 6, 2016. The FITE Regulation stipulates that a foreign-\ninvested telecommunications enterprise in the PRC, or the FITE, must be established as a sino-foreign equity joint\nventure for operations in the PRC. Under the FITE Regulation and in accordance with WTO-related agreements, the\nforeign party investing in a FITE engaging in value-added telecommunications services may hold up to 50% of the\nultimate equity interests of the FITE. In addition, the major foreign party as the shareholder of the FITE must satisfy\na number of stringent performance and operational experience requirements, including demonstrating a good track\nrecord and experience in operating a value-added telecommunications business. The FITE that meets these\nrequirements must obtain approvals from the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, or the MIIT, and\nMOFCOM or their authorized local counterparts, which retain considerable discretion in granting approvals.\nFurthermore, the foreign party investing in the e-commerce business, as a type of value-added telecommunications\nservices, has been allowed to hold up to 100% of the equity interests of the FITE based on the Circular of the Ministry\nof Industry and Information Technology on Removing the Restrictions on Shareholding Held by Foreign Investors in\nOnline Data Processing and Transaction Processing (Operating E-commerce) Business issued on June 19, 2015, and\nthe current effective Catalogue of Telecommunications Services, or the Telecom Catalog.\nOn July 13, 2006, the Ministry of Information Industry of the PRC, or the MII (which is the predecessor of the MIIT)\npromulgated the Notice of the Ministry of Information Industry on Strengthening the Administration of Foreign\nInvestment in Value-added Telecommunications Business, or the MII Notice, which reiterates certain requirements of\nthe FITE Regulation and strengthens the administration by the MII. Under the MII Notice, if a foreign investor intends\nto invest in PRC value-added telecommunications business, the foreign investor must establish a FITE and apply for\nthe relevant license for value-added telecommunications services, or the VATS License. In addition, a domestic\ncompany that holds a license for the provision of value-added telecommunications services is prohibited from leasing,\ntransferring or selling the license to foreign investors in any form, and from providing any assistance, including\nproviding resources, sites or facilities, to foreign investors to conduct value-added telecommunications businesses\nillegally in China. Trademarks and domain names that are used in the provision of value-added telecommunications\nservices must be owned by the license holder or its shareholders. The MII Notice also requires that each VATS License\nholder have appropriate facilities for its approved business operations and maintain such facilities in the business\nregions covered by its license. The VATS License holder shall perfect relevant measures for safeguarding the network\nand information, establish relevant administrative policies on information safety, set up the procedures for handling\nnetwork emergencies and information safety and implement the liabilities system for information safety.\n46\nTelecommunications regulations\nThe Telecommunications Regulations of the PRC, or the Telecom Regulations, promulgated on September 25, 2000,\nand most recently amended on February 6, 2016, are the primary PRC laws governing telecommunications services,\nwhich set out the general framework for the provision of telecommunications services by domestic PRC companies.\nThe Telecom Regulations require that telecommunications service providers shall obtain licenses prior to commencing\noperations. The Telecom Regulations distinguish basic telecommunications services and value-added\ntelecommunications services. The Telecom Catalog, promulgated by MII on February 21, 2003, and amended by the\nMIIT on December 28, 2015, and June 6, 2019, and issued as an attachment to the Telecom Regulations, identifies\ninternet information services and online data processing and transaction processing as value-added\ntelecommunications services.\nOn July 3, 2017, the MIIT issued the revised Administrative Measures for the Licensing of Telecommunications\nBusiness, or the Telecom License Measures, which became effective on September 1, 2017, to supplement the Telecom\nRegulations. The Telecom License Measures require that an operator of value-added telecommunications services\nobtain a VATS License from the MIIT or its provincial-level counterparts. The term of a VATS License is five years\nand the license holder is subject to the annual inspection.\nInternet information services\nOn September 25, 2000, the State Council promulgated the Measures for the Administration of Internet Information\nServices, or the ICP Measures, as amended on January 8, 2011. Under the ICP Measures, the internet information\nservice is categorized into commercial internet information services and non-commercial internet services. The\noperators of non-commercial internet information services must file-record with relevant governmental authorities.\nHowever, the operators of commercial internet information services in China must obtain an ICP License, from the\nrelevant governmental authorities. And the provision of particular information services, such as news, publishing,\neducation, healthcare, medicine, and medical device must also comply with relevant laws and regulations and obtain\napproval from competent governmental authorities.\nInternet information service providers are required to monitor their websites. They may not post or disseminate any\ncontent that falls within prohibited categories provided by laws or administrative regulations and must stop providing\nany such content on their websites. The PRC government may order ICP License holders that violate the content\nrestrictions to correct those violations and revoke their ICP Licenses under serious conditions.\nThe MIIT released the Circular on Regulating the Use of Domain Names in Internet Information Services on\nNovember 27, 2017, effective from January 1, 2018, which provides that the domain names used by the internet\ninformation service provider in providing internet information services shall be registered and owned by such internet\ninformation service provider, and if the internet information service provider is a legal entity, the domain name\nregistration shall be the legal entity (or any of its shareholders), or its principal or senior manager.\nRegulations Relating to Land Use Right and Construction\nPursuant to the PRC Land Administration Law promulgated in June 1986 with the latest amendment in August 2019\n(effective as of January 2020) and the PRC Civil Code, any entity that needs land for construction must obtain land\nuse right and must register with local counterparts of Ministry of Natural Resources. Land use right is established at\nthe time of registration.\nAccording to the Measures for the Administration of Grant and Transfer of Right to Use Urban State-owned Land\npromulgated by the Ministry of Construction in December 1992 with the latest amendment in 2011, and the PRC Law\non Urban and Rural Planning promulgated by the Standing Committee of the National People’s Congress in October\n2007 and became effective in January 2008 with the latest amendment in April 2019, the Measures for Administration\nof Construction Permits of Construction Projects promulgated by the Ministry of Housing and Urban-Rural\nDevelopment of the PRC (or the MOHURD) in October 1999 with the latest amendment in March 2021, and the\nAdministrative Measures on the Filings of Inspection Upon Completion of Construction of Buildings and Municipal\nInfrastructure promulgated by the MOHURD in October 2009, after obtaining land use right, the owner of land use\nright must obtain construction land planning permit, construction works planning permit from the relevant municipal\nplanning authority, and a construction permit from relevant construction authority in order to commence construction.\nAfter a building is completed, an examination of completion by the relevant governmental authorities and experts\nmust be organized.\n47\nRegulations on Production and Sale of Food Products\nBefore 2018, the China Food and Drug Administration, or the CFDA, had the regulatory authority to oversee,\nadminister, and enforce all laws, regulations, and rules concerning the food industry business operations in China.\nAfter the institutional reforms, the CFDA has been abolished, and relevant regulatory authority has been taken over\nby the SAMR under the State Council.\nThe food industry is subject to extensive regulations in China. The PRC laws and regulations governing the food\nindustry primarily consist of the PRC Food Safety Law (2009), as last amended in 2021; the Implementation\nRegulation for the Food Safety Law of PRC (2009), as amended in 2019, or the Food Safety Regulation; the\nAdministrative Measures for Food Production Licensing (2010), as last amended in 2020, or the Food Production\nLicensing Rule; and the Administrative Measures for Food Business Licensing (2015), as amended in 2017, or the\nFood Business Licensing Rule. Under the PRC Food Safety Law and the Food Safety Regulation, food product\nmanufacturers and business operators shall obtain the required food production permits; food producers and business\noperators are subject to regular quality inspection and supervision by the local governmental agencies and their product\npermits may be revoked if they no longer meet the standards and requirements for food production and operation;\nfood-producing enterprises shall establish and implement food safety management systems, such as ingredient\ninspection and acceptance, production process safety management, storage management, equipment management, and\nsubstandard product management systems; and packaging of pre-packed food shall bear a label which states\nmanufacturing permit serial number; among other things. The State Council implements a licensing system for food\nproduct manufacture and distribution. According to the Food Production Licensing Rule, a food production license\nmust be obtained prior to engaging in food production activities in the PRC. The Food Business Licensing Rule\nrequires food business operators to obtain a food business license for each business entity engaging in food business\noperations. We have obtained the required Food Production Licenses and Food Business Licenses, as set forth in the\ntable below:\nNo License Type License No. License Date Expiry Date Holder\n1 Food Production License SC12361052300601 September 25,\nJune 16, 2021 2023 Xi’an App-Chem\n2 Food Business License YB17100000290801 November 28,\n2022 N/A Xi’an App-Chem\n3 Food Production License SC10661020100062 November 21, November 20,\n2022 2027 Tongchuan DT\nIn addition to PRC laws and regulations, we strictly follow applicable safety regulations in all markets to which we\nsell our products. Through our subsidiary, Xi’an App-Chem, we have obtained REACH certification for our\nambroxide in the European Union, and Generally Recognized as Safe List (“GRAS”) certification from the FDA for\nour clary sage. We have obtained kosher and halal certifications for certain of our products as well.\n“GRAS” is an acronym for the phrase Generally Recognized As Safe. Under sections 201(s) and 409 of the U.S.\nFederal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the “Act”), any substance that is intentionally added to food is a food additive,\nthat is subject to premarket review and approval by FDA, unless the substance is generally recognized, among\nqualified experts, as having been adequately shown to be safe under the conditions of its intended use, or unless the\nuse of the substance is otherwise excepted from the definition of a food additive. General recognition of safety under\nfor a substance under U.S. law may be achieved under either of two methods:\n● Under sections 201(s) and 409 of the Act, and FDA’s implementing regulations in 21 CFR 170.3 and 21 CFR\n170.30, the use of a food substance may be GRAS either through scientific procedures or, for a substance\nused in food before 1958, through experience based on common use in food Under 21 CFR 170.30(b), general\nrecognition of safety through scientific procedures requires the same quantity and quality of scientific\nevidence as is required to obtain approval of the substance as a food additive. General recognition of safety\nthrough scientific procedures is based upon the application of generally available and accepted scientific data,\ninformation, or methods, which ordinarily are published, as well as the application of scientific principles,\nand may be corroborated by the application of unpublished scientific data, information, or methods.\n48\n● Under 21 CFR 170.30(c) and 170.3(f), general recognition of safety through experience based on common\nuse in foods requires a substantial history of consumption for food use by a significant number of consumers.\nUnder 21 CFR 182.20, clary sage has been generally recognized as safe for its intended use.\nREACH stands for “Registration, Evaluation, Authorization and Restriction of Chemicals”. REACH is the EU’s\nregulation on preventive management of all chemicals entering its market. The regulation was issued on June 1, 2007,\nand implemented on June 1, 2008. According to the EU REACH regulations, companies need to submit a registration\nto the European Chemicals Agency (ECHA) for chemical substances (substances, substances in mixtures or substances\nintentionally released in articles) whose annual output or import volume exceeds 1 ton in the EU in order to continue\nto manufacture, import or sell the chemical within the EU. Xi’an App-Chem, sells two non-food products – sclareol\nglycol and ambroxide – in the EU. Both of these products have EU REACH certification, which satisfies the EU safety\nregulations for export and allows them to be sold in compliance with the EU market rules.\nWe rely upon published and unpublished safety information including clinical studies on ingredients used in our\nproducts. These studies include the following:\n● “Safety and toxicity of silymarin, the major constituent of milk thistle extract: An updated review,” (a study\non the use of Silymarin in humans at therapeutic doses of up to 700 mg three times a day for 24 weeks.)\nSome gastrointestinal discomforts occurred like nausea and diarrhea.\n● The toxicology and safety of apple polyphenol extract,” (a study on polyphenol use in humans that included\na 90-day subchronic-toxicity test).\n● “Public Announcement Regarding Haematococcus Pluvialis and Other New Resource Food” [Evaluation\nDivision of Food Safety Standard and Inspection, No. 17 issued on October 29, 2010] (evaluating the use of\nStachyose as an ordinary food).\nRegulation on Product Liability\nThe PRC laws and regulations governing the product liability primarily consist of the PRC Product Quality Law\n(1993), as lately amended in 2018; Law on the Protection of the Rights and Interests of Consumers (1993), as lately\namended in 2013, or the Consumers Protection Law; and the PRC Civil Code.\nUnder the PRC Product Quality Law, producers and vendors of defective products may incur liability for losses and\ninjuries caused by such products. There are three circumstances under which producers or vendors can have immunity\nfrom the defective product liability: 1) the defective products are never put into the market; 2) the products defect\nwhich caused the damages did not exist when the products were put into the market; 3) the exam techniques and skills\nwere not able to find out the defects when the products were put into the market. So far, our product quality is in\nconformity with the national requirements and we have passed the regulatory agency’s examination and also\nsuccessfully obtained the certificates of GB/T 199001-2016/ISO 9001:2015, GB/T 22000-2006/ISO 22000:2005, ISO\n9001:2008/GB/T 19001-2008 system.\nUnder the PRC Civil Code, manufacturers or retailers of defective products that cause property damage or physical\ninjury to any person will be subject to civil liability. The Consumers Protection Law was enacted to protect the\nlegitimate rights and interests of end-users and consumers and to strengthen the supervision and control of the quality\nof products.\nUnder the PRC Civil Code, a customer who suffers injury from a defective product can claim damages from either the\nmanufacturer or vendor of the defective product. And, where personal injury is caused by tort, the tortfeasor shall\ncompensate the victim for the reasonable costs and expenses for treatment and rehabilitation, as well as death\ncompensation and funeral costs and expenses if it causes the death of the victim. There is no cap on monetary damages\nthe plaintiffs may seek under the PRC Civil Code.\n49\nRegulations Relating to Environmental Protection\nPursuant to the PRC Law on Environment Impact Assessment promulgated in 2002, most recently amended in 2018,\nand the Administrative Regulations on the Environmental Protection of Construction Projects promulgated in 1998,\nmost recently amended in 2017, each construction project is required to undergo an environmental impact assessment,\nand an environmental impact assessment report, an assessment form, or a registration form shall be filed with or\napproved by the relevant governmental authorities before the commencement of construction. In the event that there\nis a material change in respect of the construction site, scale, nature, the production techniques employed, or the\nmeasures adopted for preventing pollution and preventing ecological damage of a given project, a new environmental\nimpact assessment document shall be filed with or approved by the relevant governmental authorities. Moreover, in\naccordance with the Interim Measure on the Environmental Protection Completion Acceptance of Construction\nProjects promulgated in 2017, after the completion of a construction project, the construction entity is required to\nconduct acceptance check of the constructed supporting environmental protection facilities and deliver an acceptance\nreport. Failure to comply with the above-mentioned regulations may subject an enterprise to fines, suspension of the\nconstruction, and other administrative liabilities and even criminal liabilities under severe circumstances.\nRegulations Relating to Intellectual Property Rights\nThe PRC government has adopted comprehensive legislation governing intellectual property rights, including\ncopyrights, patents, trademarks, and domain names.\nCopyright. Copyright in China, including copyrighted software, is principally protected under the PRC Copyright\nLaw, promulgated by Standing Committee of NPC in September 1990 and most recently amended in November 2020\nand its implementation rules. Under the PRC Copyright Law, the term of protection for copyrighted software of legal\npersons is 50 years and ends on December 31 of the 50th year from the date of first publishing of the software.\nPatent. The PRC Patent Law, promulgated by Standing Committee of NPC in March 1984 and most recently amended\nin October 2020, provides for patentable inventions, utility models, and designs, which must meet three conditions:\nnovelty, inventiveness, and practical applicability. The State Intellectual Property Office under the State Council is\nresponsible for examining and approving patent applications. The protection period of a patent right is 10 years for\nutility models and designs and 20 years for inventions from the date of application.\nTrademark. The PRC Trademark Law, promulgated by the Standing Committee of NPC in August 1982 and most\nrecently amended in April 2019 and its implementation rules protect registered trademarks. The PRC Trademark\nOffice of State Administration of Industry and Commerce is responsible for the registration and administration of\ntrademarks throughout China. The PRC Trademark Law has adopted a “first-to-file” principle with respect to\ntrademark registration. Where registration is sought for a trademark that is identical or similar to another trademark\nthat has already registered or given preliminary examination and approval for use in the same or similar category of\ncommodities or services, the application for registration of such trademark may be rejected. Trademark registration is\neffective for a ten-year period from the date of approval of the trademark application unless otherwise revoked, which\nmay be renewed for another ten years provided relevant application procedures have been completed within twelve\nmonths before the end of the validity period.\nDomain Name. Domain names are protected under the Administrative Measures on the Internet Domain Names\npromulgated by the MIIT in August 2017. The MITT is the major regulatory body responsible for the administration\nof the PRC internet domain names, under supervision of which the China Internet Network Information Center is\nresponsible for the daily administration of “.cn” domain names and the Chinese domain names. Domain name\nregistration is handled through domain name service agencies established under the relevant regulations, and\napplicants become domain name holders upon successful registration. We have registered http://en.appchem.cn,\nhttp://www.bnlus.com and other domain names.\nRegulations Relating to Employment\nPursuant to the PRC Labor Law, promulgated by the Standing Committee of NPC in July 1994 and most recently\namended in December 2018, and the PRC Labor Contract Law, promulgated by the Standing Committee of NPC in\nJune 2007 and amended in December 2012, employers must execute written labor contracts with full-time employees.\nIf an employer fails to enter into a written employment contract with an employee within one year from the date on\nwhich the employment relationship is established, the employer must rectify the situation by entering into a written\nemployment contract with the employee and pay the employee twice the employee’s salary for the period from the\nday following the lapse of one month from the date of establishment of the employment relationship to the day prior\nto the execution of the written employment contract. All employers must comply with local minimum wage standards.\nViolation of the PRC Labor Law and the PRC Labor Contract Law may result in the imposition of fines and other\nadministrative and criminal liability in the case of a serious violation.\n50\nIn December 2012, the PRC Labor Contract Law was amended to impose more stringent requirements on the use of\nemployees of temp agencies, who are known in China as “dispatched workers”. Dispatched workers are entitled to\nequal pay with full-time employees for equal work. Employers are only allowed to use dispatched workers for\ntemporary, auxiliary, or substitutive positions, and the number of dispatched workers may not exceed 10% of the total\nnumber of employees. As of the date hereof, our consolidated subsidiaries did not use dispatched workers.\nEnterprises in China are required by PRC laws and regulations to participate in certain employee benefit plans,\nincluding social insurance funds, namely a pension plan, a medical insurance plan, an unemployment insurance plan,\na work-related injury insurance plan, and a maternity insurance plan, and a housing provident fund, and contribute to\nthe plans or funds in amounts equal to certain percentages of salaries, including bonuses and allowances, of the\nemployees as specified by the local government from time to time at locations where they operate their businesses or\nwhere they are located. According to the PRC Social Insurance Law (amended in 2018), an employer that fails to\nmake social insurance contributions may be ordered to rectify the non-compliance and pay the required contributions\nwithin a stipulated deadline and be subject to a late fee of up to 0.05% of the unpaid amount per day, as the case may\nbe. If the employer still fails to rectify the failure to make social insurance contributions within the stipulated deadline,\nit may be subject to a fine ranging from one to three times the amount overdue. According to the Regulations on\nManagement of Housing Fund employers must not suspend or reduce the payment of housing provident funds for\ntheir employees. Under the circumstances where financial difficulties indeed exist due to which an employer is unable\nto pay or pay up housing provident funds, the permission of the labor union of the employer and the approval of the\nlocal housing provident funds commission must first be obtained before the employer can suspend or reduce their\npayment of housing provident funds. Where an employer does not open accounts of housing provident funds for its\nemployees, the relevant authorities have the power to order such employer to do so within a prescribed period, failure\nof which can result in a fine of over RMB 10,000 and up to RMB 50,000 charged on the employer. An enterprise that\nfails to make housing fund contributions may be ordered to rectify the noncompliance and pay the required\ncontributions within a stipulated deadline; otherwise, an application may be made to a local court for compulsory\nenforcement.\nRegulations Relating to Foreign Exchange\nThe principal regulations governing foreign currency exchange in China are the Foreign Exchange Administration\nRegulations, most recently amended in August 2008. Payments of current account items, such as profit distributions\nand trade and service-related foreign exchange transactions, can usually be made in foreign currencies without prior\napproval from the SAFE, by complying with certain procedural requirements. By contrast, approval from or\nregistration with appropriate governmental authorities is required where the Renminbi is to be converted into foreign\ncurrency and remitted out of China to pay capital expenses such as the repayment of foreign currency-denominated\nloans, direct investments, repatriation of investments and investments in securities outside of China.\nOn March 30, 2015, SAFE issued the Circular of the State Administration of Foreign Exchange on Reforming the\nManagement Approach regarding the Settlement of Foreign Exchange Capital of Foreign-invested Enterprises, or\nSAFE Circular 19, most recently amended in December 2019. Pursuant to SAFE Circular 19, the foreign exchange\ncapital of foreign-invested enterprises is subject to the discretional foreign exchange settlement, which means the\nforeign exchange capital in the capital account of foreign-invested enterprises upon the confirmation of rights and\ninterests of monetary contribution by the local foreign exchange bureau (or the book-entry registration of monetary\ncontribution by the banks) may be settled at the banks based on the actual operational needs of the enterprises. The\nproportion of discretionary settlement of foreign exchange capital of foreign-invested enterprises is currently 100%.\nSAFE can adjust such proportion in due time based on the circumstances of the international balance of payments.\n51\nSAFE promulgated the Circular of the State Administration of Foreign Exchange on Reforming and Standardizing\nthe Foreign Exchange Settlement Management Policy of Capital Account, or SAFE Circular 16, effective June 2016,\nwhich reiterates some of the rules set forth in SAFE Circular 19. SAFE Circular 16 provides that discretionary foreign\nexchange settlement applies to foreign exchange capital, foreign debt offering proceeds and remitted foreign listing\nproceeds, and the corresponding RMB capital converted from the foreign exchange may be used to extend loans to\nrelated parties or repay inter-company loans (including advances by third parties). However, there are substantial\nuncertainties with respect to SAFE Circular 16’s interpretation and implementation in practice. SAFE Circular 19 and\nSAFE Circular 16 may delay or limit us from using the proceeds of offshore offerings to make additional capital\ncontributions to our PRC subsidiary and any violations of these circulars could result in severe monetary or other\npenalties.\nIn January 2017, SAFE promulgated the Circular on Further Improving Reform of Foreign Exchange Administration\nand Optimizing Genuineness and Compliance Verification, or SAFE Circular 3, which stipulates several capital\ncontrol measures with respect to the outbound remittance of profits from domestic entities to offshore entities,\nincluding (i) banks must check whether the transaction is genuine by reviewing board resolutions regarding profit\ndistribution, original copies of tax filing records and audited financial statements, and (ii) domestic entities must retain\nincome to account for previous years’ losses before remitting any profits. Moreover, pursuant to SAFE Circular 3,\ndomestic entities must explain in detail the sources of capital and how the capital will be used, and provide board\nresolutions, contracts, and other proof as a part of the registration procedure for outbound investment.\nOn October 23, 2019, SAFE issued Circular of the State Administration of Foreign Exchange on Further Promoting\nthe Facilitation of Cross-border Trade and Investment, or SAFE Circular 28, which took effect on the same day.\nSAFE Circular 28 allows non-investment foreign-invested enterprises to use their capital funds to make equity\ninvestments in China, provided that such investments do not violate the Negative List and the target investment\nprojects are genuine and in compliance with laws. Since SAFE Circular 28 was issued only recently, its interpretation\nand implementation in practice are still subject to substantial uncertainties.\nRegulations on Dividend Distribution\nAccording to PRC Company Law, wholly foreign-owned companies in China may pay dividends only out of their\naccumulated profits as determined in accordance with PRC accounting standards and regulations. In addition, wholly\nforeign-owned companies are required to set aside at least 10% of their after-tax profits each year, if any, to fund a\nstatutory reserve fund until the accumulative amount of such fund reaches 50% of its registered capital. Although the\nstatutory reserves can be used, among other ways, to increase the registered capital and eliminate future losses in\nexcess of retained earnings of the respective companies, the reserve funds are not distributable as cash dividends\nexcept in the event of a liquidation. At the discretion of the wholly foreign-owned companies, they may allocate a\nportion of their after-tax profits based on PRC accounting standards to staff welfare and bonus funds. These reserve\nfunds and staff welfare and bonus funds are not distributable as cash dividends.\nRegulations on Offshore Financing\nSAFE promulgated the Circular on Relevant Issues Concerning Foreign Exchange Control on Domestic Residents’\nOffshore Investment and Financing and Roundtrip Investment through Special Purpose Vehicles, or SAFE Circular\n37, on July 4, 2014, which replaced the former circular commonly known as SAFE Circular 75. SAFE Circular 37\nrequires PRC residents to register with local branches of SAFE in connection with their direct establishment or indirect\ncontrol of an offshore entity, for the purpose of overseas investment and financing, with such PRC residents’ legally\nowned assets or equity interests in domestic enterprises or offshore assets or interests, referred to in SAFE Circular\n37 as a “special purpose vehicle”. SAFE Circular 37 further requires an amendment to the registration in the event of\nany significant changes with respect to the special purpose vehicle, such as increase or decrease of capital contributed\nby PRC individuals, share transfer or exchange, merger, division, or other material events. In the event that a PRC\nshareholder holding interests in a special purpose vehicle fails to fulfill the required SAFE registration, the PRC\nsubsidiaries of that special purpose vehicle may be prohibited from making profit distributions to the offshore parent\nand from carrying out subsequent cross-border foreign exchange activities, and the special purpose vehicle may be\nrestricted in its ability to contribute additional capital into its PRC subsidiary. Furthermore, failure to comply with the\nvarious SAFE registration requirements described above could result in liability under PRC law for the evasion of\nforeign exchange controls. We have taken steps to notify significant beneficial owners of ordinary shares whom we\nknow are PRC residents of their filing obligations. However, we may not at all times be fully aware or informed of\nthe identities of all our shareholders or beneficial owners that are required to make such registrations, and we may not\nalways be able to compel them to comply with all relevant foreign exchange regulations. As a result, we cannot assure\nyou that all of our shareholders or beneficial owners who are PRC residents will at all times comply with, or in the\nfuture make or obtain any applicable registrations or approvals required by all relevant foreign exchange regulations.\n52\nOn February 13, 2015, SAFE released Circular of the State Administration of Foreign Exchange on Further\nSimplifying and Improving the Direct Investment-related Foreign Exchange Administration Policies, or SAFE\nCircular 13, most recently amended in December 2019, under which local banks will examine and handle foreign\nexchange registration for overseas direct investment, including the initial foreign exchange registration and\namendment registration, starting from June 1, 2015.\nSAFE Circular 3 stipulates several capital control measures with respect to the outbound remittance of profit from\ndomestic entities to offshore entities, including (i) under the principle of a genuine transaction, banks shall check the\nboard resolutions regarding profit distribution, the original version of tax filing records and audited financial\nstatements; and (ii) domestic entities shall hold income to account for previous years’ losses before remitting the\nprofits. Moreover, pursuant to SAFE Circular 3, domestic entities shall make detailed explanations of the sources of\ncapital and utilization arrangements, and provide board resolutions, contracts, and other proof when completing the\nregistration procedures in connection with an outbound investment.\nRegulations Relating to Stock Incentive Plans\nAccording to the Circular of the State Administration of Foreign Exchange on Issues Relating to the Foreign Exchange\nAdministration for Domestic Individuals Participating in Stock Incentive Plan of Overseas Listed Company, or the\nSAFE Circular 7, which was issued on February 15, 2012, and other regulations, directors, supervisors, senior\nmanagement and other employees participating in any share incentive plan of an overseas publicly-listed company\nwho are PRC citizens or non-PRC citizens residing in China for a continuous period of not less than one year, subject\nto certain exceptions, are required to register with the SAFE. All such participants need to authorize a qualified PRC\nagent, such as a PRC subsidiary of the overseas publicly-listed company to register with the SAFE and handle foreign\nexchange matters such as opening accounts, transferring, and settlement of the relevant proceeds. The SAFE Circular\n7 further require an offshore agent to be designated to handle matters in connection with the exercise of share options\nand sales of proceeds for the participants of the share incentive plans. Failure to complete the said SAFE registrations\nmay subject our participating directors, supervisors, senior management, and other employees to fines and legal\nsanctions.\nIn addition, the SAT, has issued certain circulars concerning employee stock options and restricted shares. Under these\ncirculars, employees working in the PRC who exercise stock options or are granted restricted shares will be subject to\nPRC individual income tax. The PRC subsidiaries of an overseas listed company are required to file documents related\nto employee stock options and restricted shares with relevant tax authorities and to withhold individual income taxes\nof employees who exercise their stock option or purchase restricted shares. If the employees fail to pay or the PRC\nsubsidiaries fail to withhold income tax in accordance with relevant laws and regulations, the PRC subsidiaries may\nface sanctions imposed by the tax authorities or other PRC governmental authorities.\nRegulations Relating to Tax\nDividend Withholding Tax\nPursuant to the PRC Enterprise Income Tax Law and its implementation rules, if a non-resident enterprise has not set\nup an organization or establishment in China, or has set up an organization or establishment but the income derived\nhas no actual connection with such organization or establishment, it will be subject to a withholding tax on its PRC-\nsourced income at a rate of 10%. Pursuant to the Arrangement between Mainland China and the Hong Kong Special\nAdministrative Region for the Avoidance of Double Taxation and Tax Evasion on Income, the withholding tax rate in\nrespect to the payment of dividends by a PRC enterprise to a Hong Kong enterprise is reduced to 5% from a standard\nrate of 10% if the Hong Kong enterprise directly holds at least 25% of the PRC enterprise. Pursuant to the Circular of\nthe State Administration of Taxation on the Issues concerning the Application of the Dividend Clauses of Tax\nAgreements, or SAT Circular 81, a Hong Kong resident enterprise must meet the following conditions, among others,\nin order to enjoy the reduced withholding tax: (i) it must directly own the required percentage of equity interests and\nvoting rights in the PRC resident enterprise; and (ii) it must have directly owned such percentage in the PRC resident\nenterprise throughout the 12 months prior to receiving the dividends. Furthermore, the Bulletin of the State Taxation\nAdministration on Issuing the Administrative Measures for Entitlement to Treaty Benefits for Non-resident Taxpayers,\nwhich became effective in January 2020, requires that where non-resident taxpayers judge by themselves that they\nmeet the conditions for entitlement to treaty benefits, they may obtain such entitlement themselves at the time of\nmaking tax declarations, or at the time of making withholding declarations via withholding agents. At the same time,\nthey shall collect, gather, and retain relevant materials for future reference in accordance with the provisions of these\nmeasures, and shall accept the follow-up administration of tax authorities. Accordingly, our direct subsidiary, Tea\nEssence Limited (Hong Kong), may be able to enjoy the 5% withholding tax rate for the dividends they receive from\nXi’an CMIT or Xi’an Youpincui, if it satisfies the conditions prescribed under SAT Circular 81 and other relevant tax\nrules and regulations. However, according to SAT Circular 81, if the relevant tax authorities consider the transactions\nor arrangements we have are for the primary purpose of enjoying a favorable tax treatment, the relevant tax authorities\nmay adjust the favorable withholding tax in the future. Additionally, the Announcement of the State Administration of\nTaxation on Issues concerning “Beneficial Owners” in Tax Treaties, promulgated by the SAT on February 3, 2018,\nand took effect on April 1, 2018, further clarified the analysis standard when determining one’s qualification for\nbeneficial owner status.\n53\nEnterprise Income Tax\nThe principal regulations governing enterprise income tax in China are the PRC Enterprise Income Tax Law and its\nimplementing rules, which became effective on January 1, 2008, most recently amended in December 2018. Under\nthe PRC Enterprise Income Tax Law, enterprises are classified as resident enterprises and non-resident enterprises.\nPRC resident enterprises typically pay an enterprise income tax at the rate of 25%. Uncertainties exist with respect to\nhow the PRC Enterprise Income Tax Law applies to the tax residence status of Bon Natural Life Limited and our\noffshore subsidiaries.\nUnder the PRC Enterprise Income Tax Law, an enterprise established outside China with its “de facto management\nbodies” located within China is considered a “resident enterprise”, meaning that it is treated in a manner similar to a\nPRC domestic enterprise for enterprise income tax purposes. The implementing rules of the PRC Enterprise Income\nTax Law define the “de facto management body” as a managing body that in practice exercises “substantial and overall\nmanagement and control over the production and operations, personnel, accounting, and properties” of the enterprise.\nThe SAT issued the Circular of the State Administration of Taxation on Issues Concerning the Identification of\nChinese-controlled Overseas Registered Enterprises as Resident Enterprises in accordance with the Actual Standards\nof Organizational Management, or SAT Circular 82, in 2009, and most recently amended in December 2017.\nAccording to SAT Circular 82, a Chinese-controlled offshore incorporated enterprise will be regarded as a PRC tax\nresident by virtue of having a “de facto management body” in China and will be subject to PRC enterprise income tax\non its worldwide income only if all of the following criteria are met: (a) the places where the senior management and\nsenior management departments responsible for the daily production, operation and management of the enterprise\nperform their duties are mainly located within the territory of China; (b) decisions relating to the enterprise’s financial\nmatters (such as money borrowing, lending, financing and financial risk management) and human resource matters\n(such as appointment, dismissal and salary and wages) are made or are subject to approval by organizations or\npersonnel in China; (c) the enterprise’s primary assets, accounting books and records, company seals, and board and\nshareholders meeting minutes are located or maintained in China, and (d) 50% or more of voting board members or\nsenior executives habitually reside in China. In addition, the SAT issued the Bulletin of the State Administration of\nTaxation on Printing and Distributing the Administrative Measures for Income Tax on Chinese-controlled Resident\nEnterprises Incorporated Overseas (Trial Implementation) in 2011, most recently amended in June 2018, providing\nmore guidance on the implementation of SAT Circular 82. This bulletin clarifies matters including resident status\ndetermination, post determination administration, and competent tax authorities. In January 2014, the SAT issued the\nBulletin of the State Administration of Taxation on Issues concerning the Determination of Resident Enterprises Based\non the Standards of Actual Management Institutions, or SAT Bulletin 9. According to SAT Bulletin 9, a Chinese-\ncontrolled offshore incorporated enterprise that satisfies the conditions prescribed under the SAT Circular 82 for being\nrecognized as a PRC tax resident must apply for being recognized as a PRC tax resident to the competent tax authority\nat the place of registration of its main investor within the territory of China.\nWe do not believe that we meet all of the conditions outlined in the immediately preceding paragraph. We believe that\nBon Natural Life Limited and our offshore subsidiaries should not be treated as a “resident enterprise” for PRC tax\npurposes if the criteria for “de facto management body” as set forth in SAT Circular 82 were deemed applicable to us.\nHowever, as the tax residency status of an enterprise is subject to determination by the PRC tax authorities and\nuncertainties remain with respect to the interpretation of the term “de facto management body” as applicable to our\noffshore entities, we may be treated as a resident enterprise for PRC tax purposes under the PRC Enterprise Income\nTax Law, and we may, therefore, be subject to PRC income tax on our global income. We are actively monitoring the\npossibility of “resident enterprise” treatment for the applicable tax years and are evaluating appropriate organizational\nchanges to avoid this treatment, to the extent possible.\n54\nIn the event that Bon Natural Life Limited or any of our offshore subsidiaries is considered to be a PRC resident\nenterprise: Bon Natural Life Limited or our offshore subsidiaries, as the case may be, may be subject to the PRC\nenterprise income tax at the rate of 25% on our worldwide taxable income; dividend income that Bon Natural Life\nLimited or our offshore subsidiaries, as the case may be, received from our PRC subsidiaries may be exempt from the\nPRC withholding tax; and interest paid to our overseas shareholders or Shares holders who are non-PRC resident\nenterprises as well as gains realized by such shareholders or Shares holders from the transfer of our shares or Shares\nmay be regarded as PRC-sourced income and as a result be subject to PRC withholding tax at a rate of up to 10%,\nsubject to any reduction or exemption set forth in relevant tax treaties, and similarly, dividends paid to our overseas\nshareholders or Shares holders who are non-PRC resident individuals, as well as gains realized by such shareholders\nor Shares holders from the transfer of our shares or Shares, may be regarded as PRC-sourced income and as a result\nbe subject to PRC withholding tax at a rate of 20%, subject to any reduction or exemption set forth in relevant tax\ntreaties. “Risk Factor—Risks Related to Doing Business in China—If we are classified as a PRC resident enterprise\nfor PRC income tax purposes, such classification could result in unfavorable tax consequences to us and our non-PRC\nshareholders or Shares holders.”\nSAT issued Bulletin of the State Administration of Taxation on Several Issues concerning the Enterprise Income Tax\non the Indirect Transfers of Properties by Non-Resident Enterprises, or SAT Bulletin 7, on February 3, 2015, which\nreplaced or supplemented certain previous rules under the Circular of the State Administration of Taxation on\nStrengthening the Administration of Enterprise Income Tax on Incomes from Equity Transfers of Non-Resident\nEnterprises, or SAT Circular 698. Under SAT Bulletin 7, an “indirect transfer” of assets, including equity interests in\na PRC resident enterprise, by non-PRC resident enterprises may be re-characterized and treated as a direct transfer of\nPRC taxable assets, if such arrangement does not have a reasonable commercial purpose and was established for the\npurpose of avoiding payment of PRC enterprise income tax. As a result, gains derived from such indirect transfer may\nbe subject to PRC enterprise income tax. According to SAT Bulletin 7, “PRC taxable assets” include assets attributed\nto an establishment in China, immovable properties in China, and equity investments in PRC resident enterprises. In\nrespect of an indirect offshore transfer of assets of a PRC establishment, the relevant gain is to be regarded as\neffectively connected with the PRC establishment and therefore included in its enterprise income tax filing, and would\nconsequently be subject to PRC enterprise income tax at a rate of 25%. Where the underlying transfer relates to the\nimmovable properties in China or to equity investments in a PRC resident enterprise, which is not effectively\nconnected to a PRC establishment of a non-resident enterprise, a PRC enterprise income tax at 10% would apply,\nsubject to available preferential tax treatment under applicable tax treaties or similar arrangements, and the party who\nis obligated to make the transfer payments has the withholding obligation. There is uncertainty as to the\nimplementation details of SAT Bulletin 7. If SAT Bulletin 7 was determined by the tax authorities to be applicable to\nsome of our transactions involving PRC taxable assets, our offshore subsidiaries conducting the relevant transactions\nmight be required to spend valuable resources to comply with SAT Bulletin 7 or to establish that the relevant\ntransactions should not be taxed under SAT Bulletin 7.\nOn October 17, 2017, the SAT issued the Bulletin of the State Administration of Taxation on Issues Concerning the\nWithholding of Non-resident Enterprise Income Tax at Source, or SAT Bulletin 37, which came into effect on\nDecember 1, 2017. The SAT Bulletin 37 further clarifies the practice and procedure of the withholding of nonresident\nenterprise income tax.\nWhere the payers fail to withhold any or sufficient tax, the non-PRC residents, as the transferors, are required to\ndeclare and pay such taxes to the tax authorities on their own within the statutory time limit. Failure to comply with\nthe tax payment obligations by the non-PRC residents will result in penalties, including full payment of taxes owed,\nfines ranging from fifty percent to five times the amount of unpaid or underpaid tax, and default interest on those\ntaxes.\nEnterprises that are recognized as high and new technology enterprises in accordance with the Administrative\nMeasures for the Determination of High and New Tech Enterprises issued by the Ministry of Science, or the MOF,\nand the SAT are entitled to enjoy a preferential enterprise income tax rate of 15%. Under which the validity period of\nthe high and new technology enterprise qualification shall be three years from the date of issuance of the certificate.\nAn enterprise can re-apply for such recognition as a high and new technology enterprise before or after the previous\ncertificate expires.\n55\nPRC Value-Added Tax\nPursuant to the Interim Regulations on Value-Added Tax of the PRC, which was promulgated by the State Council on\nDecember 13, 1993, most recently amended on November 19, 2017, and the Implementation Rules for the Interim\nRegulations on Value-Added Tax of the PRC, which was promulgated by the MOF, and SAT on December25,1993,\nand became effective on January 1, 2009, and as amended on October 28, 2011, any entity or individual conducting\nproduct sales is required to pay a value-added tax, or VAT, on the gross sales price of goods. VAT rates range up to\n17%, depending on the type of products sold. On March 21, 2019, MOF, SAT and the General Administration of\nCustoms jointly promulgated the Announcement on Relevant Policies for Deepening Value-Added Tax Reform, which\nbecame effective on April 1, 2019 and provides that (i) with respect to VAT taxable sales acts or import of goods\noriginally subject to VAT rates of 16% and 10% respectively, such tax rates shall be adjusted to 13% and 9%,\nrespectively; (ii) with respect to purchase of agricultural products originally subject to tax rate of 10%, such tax rate\nshall be adjusted to 9%; (iii) with respect to purchase of agricultural products for the purpose of production or\nconsigned processing of goods subject to tax rate of 13%, such tax shall be calculated at the tax rate of 10%; (iv) with\nrespect to export of goods and services originally subject to tax rate of 16% and export tax refund rate of 16%, the\nexport tax refund rate shall be adjusted to 13%; and (v) with respect to export of goods and cross-border taxable acts\noriginally subject to tax rate of 10% and export tax refund rate of 10%, the export tax refund rate shall be adjusted to\n9%. The VAT may be offset by VAT paid by the Company on raw materials and other materials included in the cost\nof producing or acquiring its finished products.\nRegulations Relating to Overseas Listing and M&A\nOn August 8, 2006, six PRC regulatory agencies, including the China Securities Regulatory Commission, or the\nCSRC, promulgated the Rules on the Merger and Acquisition of Domestic Enterprises by Foreign Investors, or the\nM&A Rules, which became effective on September 8, 2006, and were amended on June 22, 2009. The M&A Rules,\namong other things, require offshore special purpose vehicles formed for overseas listing purposes through\nacquisitions of PRC domestic companies and controlled by PRC domestic enterprises or individuals to obtain the\napproval of the CSRC prior to the listing and trading of such special purpose vehicle’s securities on an overseas stock\nexchange. In September 2006, the CSRC published on its official website procedures regarding its approval of\noverseas listings by special purpose vehicles. The CSRC approval procedures require the filing of a number of\ndocuments with the CSRC. Although the CSRC currently has not issued any definitive rule or interpretation\nconcerning whether offerings like our recent IPO are subject to the M&A Rules, the interpretation, and application of\nthe regulations remain unclear, and any future offerings may ultimately require approval from the CSRC. If CSRC\napproval is required, it is uncertain whether it would be possible for us to obtain the approval and any failure to obtain\nor delay in obtaining CSRC approval for a future securities offering would subject us to sanctions imposed by the\nCSRC and other PRC regulatory agencies.\nThe M&A Rules and other regulations and rules concerning mergers and acquisitions established additional procedures\nand requirements that could make merger and acquisition activities by foreign investors more time-consuming and\ncomplex. For example, the M&A Rules require that MOFCOM be notified in advance of any change-of-control\ntransaction in which a foreign investor takes control of a PRC domestic enterprise, if (i) any important industry is\nconcerned, (ii) such transaction involves factors that impact or may impact national economic security, or (iii) such\ntransaction will lead to a change in control of a domestic enterprise which holds a famous trademark or PRC time-\nhonored brand.\nIn addition, according to the Notice on Establishing the Security Review System for Mergers and Acquisitions of\nDomestic Enterprises by Foreign Investors issued by the General Office of the State Council on February 3, 2011,\nand which became effective on March 4, 2011, the Rules on Implementation of Security Review System for the Merger\nand Acquisition of Domestic Enterprises by Foreign Investors issued by MOFCOM on August 25, 2011, and which\nbecame effective on September 1, 2011, the Measures for the Security Review of Foreign Investments issued by\nMOFCOM and NDRC on December 19, 2020, which became Effective on January 18, 2021, mergers and acquisitions\nby foreign investors that raise “national defense and security” concerns and mergers and acquisitions through which\nforeign investors may acquire de facto control over domestic enterprises that raise “national security” concerns are\nsubject to strict review by MOFCOM, and the regulations prohibit any activities attempting to bypass such security\nreview, including by structuring the transaction through a proxy or contractual control arrangement.\n56\nC. Organizational Structure\nWe commenced our natural products and ingredients business through Xi’an App-Chem Bio(Tech) Co., Ltd. (“Xi’an\nApp-Chem”), a corporation formed in the People’s Republic of China in April of 2006. On April 23, 2006, Xi’an App-\nChem received its Business License (Registration No.: 6101012116403) from the Xi’an Administration for Industry\nand Commerce.\nOn December 11, 2019, Bon Natural Life Limited was incorporated under the laws of the Cayman Islands as our\noffshore holding company to facilitate financing and offshore listing. Bon Natural Life Limited subsequently\nestablished a Wholly Foreign-Owned Enterprise (“WFOE”) in PRC China, Xi’an CMIT Information and Technology\nCo., Ltd. (“Xi’an CMIT”). Xi’an CMIT is wholly owned by our direct subsidiary in Hong Kong, Tea Essence. Due to\nPRC legal restrictions on foreign ownership in companies that engage in online sales China, we originally carried out\nour business through Xi’an App-Chem, a domestic PRC company, through a variable interest entity structure.\nEffective November 1, 2021, however, we reorganized our corporate structure in the PRC and are now the indirect\nsole shareholder of Xi’an App-Chem. Xi’an App-Chem is wholly-owned by two WFOE’s Xi’an CMIT and Xi’an\nYoupincui. Each of the WFOEs are in turn wholly-owned by Tea Essence, our direct wholly-owned subsidiary in\nHong Kong. Xi’an App-Chem’s financial results are consolidated into our consolidated financial statements in\naccordance with U.S. GAAP because we have control over that entity by way of 100% equity ownership through Tea\nEssence, and in turn, Xi’an CMIT and Xi’an Youpincui.\nThe following diagram illustrates our corporate structure as of the date of this annual report:\n57\nXi’an App-Chem’s Operating Subsidiaries\nThe table below provides a summary of Xi’an App-Chem’s operating subsidiaries (“Bon Operating Companies”) and\ntheir primary business functions as of the date of this annual report:\nDate of Place of % of\nName of Entity Incorporation Incorporation Ownership Principal Activities\nBon Natural Life December 11, Cayman Islands Parent, 100% Investment holding\n2019\nTea Essence January 9, 2020 Hong Kong 100% Investment holding\nXi’an CMIT April 9, 2020 Xi.an City, PRC 100% WFOE, Investment holding\nXi’an Youpincui September 8, Xi.an City, PRC 100% WFOE, Investment holding\n2021\nPRC Subsidiaries:\nXi’an App- Chem Bio April 23, 2006 Xi’an City, PRC 100% owned by General administration and\n(Tech) WFOEs sales of the Company’s\nproducts to customers\nBon Operating Companies (owned by\nXi’an App-Chem)\nApp-Chem Health April 17, 2006 Tongchuan City, 100% owned by Registered owner of land with\nPRC Xi’an App-Chem an area of 12,904.5 square\nmeters, no other business\nactivities\nApp-Chem Ag-tech April 19, 2013 Dali County, 100% owned by Product manufacturing\nPRC Xi’an App-Chem\nXi’an YH September 15, Xi.an City, PRC 100% owned by Research and development of\n2009 Xi’an App-Chem product\nApp-Chem Guangzhou April 27, 2018 Guangzhou City, 100% owned by Raw material purchase\nPRC Xi’an App-Chem\nTongchuan DT May 22, 2017 Tongchuan City, 100% owned by Product manufacturing\nPRC Xi’an App-Chem\nXi’an DT April 24, 2015 Xi’an City, PRC 75% owned by Research and development of\nXi’an App-Chem product\nTianjin YHX September 16, Tianjin City, 51% owned by Raw material purchase\n2019 PRC Xi’an App-Chem\nGansu BMK March 11, 2020 Jiuquan City, 100% owned by Product manufacturing\nPRC Xi’an App-Chem\nD. Property, Plants and Equipment\nProperty, Plants, and Equipment\nOur current property and equipment consist of buildings, machinery, vehicles, and construction in progress with a\ntotal net book value of $21,624,437 and $19,228,642 as of September 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Xi’an App-\nChem has three facilities, one of which is in operation, and the other two of which are under construction:\nWeinan Raw Materials and Ingredients Production Site\nThis site, located in Xuzhuang Industrial Park, Dali County, Weinan, Shaanxi, occupies an area of 30 mu, or\napproximately 5 acres (1 mu=0.165 acre) and a building area of 11,000 m2, or 118,403 square feet. It is rented by the\nCompany at RMB 12,500 or $1,920 per month. It is equipped with a plant extract workshop (which has 4 sets of\nextraction equipment consisting of 6 m3 or 212 cubic feet multifunctional extraction tanks, 3 sets of concentration\nequipment, 14 sets of separation equipment and 23 sets of storage and transport equipment), a refining, drying, and\npacking workshop (2 sets of spray and drying towers, 6 sets of drying equipment, 2 sets of crushing equipment and\nover 20 other related equipment), a spices refinement workshop (70 sets of various production equipment with volume\nfrom 2000L to 5000L, 1 set of molecular distillation equipment, 1 set of water treatment equipment, 1 set of ash\ntreatment equipment and 15 sets of refrigeration and pressure equipment). This facility mainly manufactures products\nin our clary sage series, apple polyphenols series, and stachyose products.\n58\nTongchuan Functional Health Business Production Site\nThis site, located at the intersection of Datang Third Road and Changhong South Road, Southern Industrial Park, New\nDowntown District, Tongchuan, Shaanxi, covers an area of 24.8 mu or approximately 4.1 acres (1 mu=0.165 acre)\nand a construction area of 13,500 m2 or approximately 145,313 square feet. It is under construction and planned to\nestablish 3 disinfection production lines, 2 production lines of powder drinks and pressed candies, 3 paste production\nlines, 2 production lines of special diets and 1 research and development center, quality inspection center, product\nexhibition center and a comprehensive office area. After completion, the value of this new plant’s total output is\nexpected to reach up $150 million per year. Total budget was RMB 95.0 million (approximately $13.4 million) for\nconstruction of the main body of the manufacturing plant, plant decoration and purchase of machinery and equipment.\nHowever, the budget increased to RMB 114.0 million (approximately $16.0 million) on July 2, 2021 due to increased\nmaterial and labour cost, as well as longer construction period caused by COVID-19 pandemic. The construction of\nTongchuan Project was fully completed and put into production in December 2022. The Company has obtained a\nlong-term land use certificate for this site. No additional expenditures or other conditions are required to maintain the\nsustainable land use right.\nYumen Plant\nOn May 10, 2021, we acquired a land use right of 8.2 acres at cost of $267,000, through a government organized\nauction bidding in Yumen City, Gansu Province of China. We have the right to use this land for 50 years until to May\n9, 2071. We have started construction on a new manufacturing facility for raw materials and ingredients on this land.\nTotal budget for construction of this new manufacturing plant is around $5.6 million. The construction of Yumen\nProject was initially expected to be completed by October 2022. Due to resurgence of the COVID-19 pandemic, which\nresulted in the implementation of significant governmental measures, including lockdowns, closures, quarantines and\ntravel bans, the construction work is estimated to be completed in May 2023. Management expects the remaining\nrequired expenditures to be funded through the Company’s operational cash flows and bank borrowings, if necessary.\nITEM 4A.

Operating Results\nKey Financial Performance Indicators\nIn assessing our financial performance, we consider a variety of financial performance measures, including principal\ngrowth in net revenue and gross profit, our ability to control costs and operating expenses to improve our operating\nefficiency and net income. Our review of these indicators facilitates timely evaluation of the performance of our\nbusiness and effective communication of results and key decisions, allowing our business to respond promptly to\ncompetitive market conditions and different demands and preferences from our customers. The key measures that we\nuse to evaluate the performance of our business are set forth below and are discussed in greater details under “Results\nof Operations”:\nNet Revenue\nOur net revenue is driven by changes in the number of customers, sales volume, selling price, and mix of products\nsold. Our products are sold with no right of return and we do not provide other credits or sales incentive to customers.\n59\nWe sell our products to our customers in three broad product categories: fragrance compounds, health supplemental\npowder drinks and bioactive food ingredients, which accounted for 45.8%, 23.9% and 30.3% of our total revenue for\nthe year ended September 30, 2022, 50.0%, 26.1% and 23.9% of our total revenue for the year ended September 30,\n2021, and accounted for 43.3%, 21.3% and 35.4% of our total revenue for the year ended September 30, 2020,\nrespectively.\nSales volumes of our health supplemental powder drinks and bioactive food ingredients increased by 1.0% and 27.3%\nfor the year ended September 30, 2022 as compared to the same period of 2021 due to strong customer demand and\nincreased customer number. However, sales volume of our fragrance compounds decreased by 15.1% because of\nshortage of material supply caused by abnormal wet weather, and disruption of logistics caused by COVID-19\npandemic resurgence in early 2022. Average selling prices of our fragrance compounds, health supplemental powder\ndrinks and bioactive food ingredients increased by 27.5%, 7.0% and 17.4%, respectively, for the year ended September\n30, 2022 as compared to the same period of 2021 as a result of our adjusted pricing strategy in response to increased\nraw material purchase costs and market change. The total number of customers were 142 and 132 customers for the\nyears ended September 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively, increased by 10 or 9.1% as a result of our marketing efforts.\nAs a result of these change in product mix, change in sales volume, changes in average selling price and changes in\nnumber of customers, our total revenue increased by 17.3% for the year ended September 30, 2022 as compared to\nthe same period of 2021.\nSales volumes of our fragrance compounds and health supplemental powder drinks increased by 7.9% and 51.7% for\nthe year ended September 30, 2021 as compared to the same period of 2020 due to strong customer demand and\nincreased customer number. However, sales volume of our bioactive food ingredients decreased by 5.7% because of\nreduced sales orders we received from customers for our major bioactive product, Stachyose, when COVID-19\noutbreak and spread in China appeared to be under control during the year ended September 30, 2021. For the year\nended September 30, 2020, due to COVID-19 outbreak and spread, our Stachyose product, a representative product\nunder our bioactive food ingredient product category and an important ingredient or materials used in manufacturing\nof probiotic supplement to boost digestive health and immunity and fight off the bad bacteria and boost immunity, has\nbeen designated by the local government as an important supplemental material to produce COVID-19 pandemic\ncontrol related drugs and substances, resulted in an increased demand and customer orders for this product. As\nCOVID-19 has been under control, customer orders for Stachyose product decreased during the year ended September\n30, 2021 which led to decreased sales volume for our bioactive food ingredients. Average selling prices of our\nfragrance compounds and health supplemental powder drinks increased by 39.2% and 4.9%, respectively, for the year\nended September 30, 2021 as compared to the same period of 2020 as a result of our adjusted pricing strategy in\nresponse to increased raw material purchase costs and market change. The total number of customers were 132 and\n114 customers for the years ended September 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively, increased by 18 or 15.8% as a result\nof our marketing efforts. As a result of these change in product mix, change in sales volume, changes in average selling\nprice and changes in number of customers, our total revenue increased by 39.9% for the year ended September 30,\n2021 as compared to the same period of 2020.\nGross Profit\nGross profit is equal to net revenue minus cost of goods sold. Cost of goods sold primarily includes inventory costs\n(raw materials, labor, packaging cost, depreciation and amortization, third-party products purchase price, freight costs\nand overhead). Cost of goods sold generally changes as our production costs change, as these are affected by factors\nincluding the market price of raw materials, labor productivity, and in changes to the customer and product mix. Our\ncost of revenues accounted for 68.5%, 72.1% and 71.4% of our total revenue for the fiscal year 2022, 2021 and 2020,\nrespectively.\nOur gross margin was 31.5% for the year ended September 30, 2022, an increase by 3.6% from gross margin of 27.9%\nfor the year ended September 30, 2021 due to changes in product mix, and increase in selling price as a result of our\nadjusted pricing strategy in response to increased raw material purchase costs and market change.\nOur gross margin was 27.9% for the year ended September 30, 2021, a decrease by 0.7% from gross margin of 28.6%\nfor the year ended September 30, 2020 due to changes in product mix, and increase in raw material purchase costs as\naffected by COVID-19 impact and general inflation.\n60\nOperating Expenses\nOur operating expenses consist of selling expenses, general and administrative expenses and research and\ndevelopment expenses.\nOur selling expenses primarily include salary and welfare benefit expenses paid to our sales personnel, advertising\nexpenses to increase the awareness of our brand, shipping ad delivery expenses, expenses incurred for our business\ntravel, meals and other sales promotion and marketing activities related expenses. Our selling expenses accounted for\n0.7%, 0.5% and 0.9% of our total revenue for the years ended September 30, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. We\nexpect our selling expenses, including, but not limited to, salaries and advertising expenses, to continue to increase in\nthe foreseeable future, as we plan to put more marketing effort to acquire new client and promote our sales.\nOur general and administrative expenses primarily consist of employee salaries, welfare and insurance expenses,\ndepreciation, bad debt reserve expenses, inspection and maintenance expenses, office supply and utility expenses,\nbusiness travel and meals expenses, land and property taxes and professional service expenses. General and\nadministrative expenses were 7.5%, 5.2% and 7.5% of our revenues for the years ended September 30, 2022, 2021\nand 2020, respectively. We expect our general and administrative expenses, including, but not limited to, salaries and\nbusiness consulting expenses, to continue to increase in the foreseeable future, as we plan to hire additional personnel\nand incur additional expenses in connection with the expansion of our business operations. We expect our professional\nfees for legal, audit, and advisory services to increase as we become a public company since we completed the IPO in\nJuly 2021.\nOur research and development expenses primarily consist of salaries, welfare and insurance expenses paid to our\nemployees involved in the research and development activities, materials and supplies used in the development and\ntesting of our new products, depreciation, and other miscellaneous expenses.

The increase was mainly due to an increase of $140,504 in outsourcing\nR&D activities to external consulting firms.\nOther income (expenses)\nOther income (expenses) primarily includes interest income generated from our bank deposits, interest expenses\nincurred on our borrowings from various banks and financial institutions, government subsidy income, rental income,\nincome from technology transfer, unrealized foreign currency exchange gain due to our export sales, and investment\nincome of short-term investment.\nFor the Years Ended\nSeptember 30, Change\n(in US dollars, except percentage) 2022 2021 Amount %\nInterest expense, net $ (445,492 ) (414,059 ) (31,433 ) 7.6 %\nForeign currency exchange gain (loss) 18,831 (45,124 ) 63,955 (141.7 )%\nGain on disposal of fixed assets 725 - 725 -\nOther income, net\n-Government grants 1,306,627 449,972 856,655 190.4 %\n-Rental income 68,179 38,409 29,770 77.5 %\n-Investment income $ 20,361 $ 565 $ 19,796 3503.7 %\nInterest expense, net, increased by $31,433, or approximately 7.6% in fiscal year 2022 as compared to 2021. The\nincrease was mainly attributable to increased average loan balances we carried during fiscal year 2022 compared to\nthe same period of 2021.\nGovernment subsidy income primarily relate to local government’s cash award to HNTEs based on their financial\nperformance to promote entrepreneurship and stimulate local economies. Such awards are granted on a case-by-case\nbasis by various local governments. Our subsidiary, Xi’an App-chem was approved as a HNTE and received\ngovernment subsidy in the form of an export sales refund and cash awards based on our annual financial performance.\nWe recognize government subsidies as other operating income when they are received because they are not subject to\nany past or future conditions, there are no performance conditions or conditions of use, and they are not subject to\nfuture refunds. Government subsidies received in the form of a grant and recognized as other operating income totaled\n$1,306,627 and $449,972 during fiscal year 2022 and 2021, respectively.\nOur subsidiary, Xi’an App-Chem, leased office space to a third-party and recorded rental income of $68,179 and\n$38,409 during fiscal year 2022 and 2021, respectively.\nInvestment income related to income generated by our short-term investments, amounted to $20,361 and $565 during\nfiscal year 2022 and 2021, respectively.\nThe overall changes in our other income (expenses) reflected the above major factors.\nProvision for Income Taxes\nOur provision for income taxes was $1,267,025 during fiscal year 2022, an increase of $446,094, or 54.3% from\n$820,931 in the same period of 2021 due to our increased taxable income. Under the EIT Law, domestic enterprises\nand FIEs are usually subject to a unified 25% enterprise income tax rate while preferential tax rates, tax holidays and\neven tax exemption may be granted on a case-by-case basis. EIT grants preferential tax treatment to “HNTEs”. Under\nthis preferential tax treatment, HNTEs are entitled to an income tax rate of 15%, subject to a requirement that they re-\napply for their HNTE status every three years. The corporate income taxes for the years ended September 30, 2022\nand 2021 were reported at a blended reduced rate as a result of Xi’an App-chem being approved as a HNTE and\nenjoying a 15% reduced income tax rate, but subsidiaries of Xi’an App-chem are subject to a 25% income tax rate.\nThe impact of the tax holidays noted above decreased foreign taxes by $825,899 and $514,327 for the years ended\nSeptember 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The benefit of the tax holidays on net income per share (basic and diluted)\n$0.10 and $0.08 for the years ended September 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\n66\nNet income\nAs a result of the foregoing, our net income increased from $4,609,453 in fiscal year 2021 to $6,242,424 in fiscal year\n2022.\nComparison of Results of Operations for the Years Ended September 30, 2021 and 2020\nThe following table summarizes the results of our operations during the fiscal years ended September 30, 2021 and\n2020, respectively, and provides information regarding the dollar and percentage increase or (decrease) during such\nperiods.\nFor the Years Ended September 30,\n2021 2020 Variance\n% of % of\nAmount revenue Amount revenue Amount %\nREVENUE $ 25,494,564 100.0 % $ 18,219,959 100.0 % $ 7,274,605 39.9 %\nCOST OF REVENUE 18,382,637 72.1 % 13,017,646 71.4 % 5,364,991 41.2 %\nGROSS PROFIT 7,111,927 27.9 % 5,202,313 28.6 % 1,909,614 36.7 %\nOPERATING EXPENSES\nSelling expenses 138,530 0.5 % 161,719 0.9 % (23,189 ) (14.3 )%\nGeneral and administrative expenses 1,323,726 5.2 % 1,367,070 7.5 % (43,344 ) (3.2 )%\nResearch and development expenses 249,050 1.0 % 205,359 1.1 % 43,691 21.3 %\nTotal operating expenses 1,711,306 6.7 % 1,734,148 9.5 % (22,842 ) (1.3 )%\nINCOME FROM OPERATIONS 5,400,621 21.2 % 3,468,165 19.0 % 1,932,456 55.7 %\nOTHER INCOME (EXPENSE)\nInterest expense, net (414,059 ) (1.6 )% (328,388 ) (1.8 )% (85,671 ) (26.1 )%\nOther income, net 443,822 1.7 % 514,802 2.8 % (70,980 ) (13.8 )%\nTotal other income (expenses), net 29,763 0.1 % 186,414 1.0 % (156,651 ) (84.0 )%\nINCOME BEFORE INCOME TAX\nPROVISION 5,430,384 21.3 % 3,654,579 20.1 % 1,775,805 48.6 %\nPROVISION FOR INCOME\nTAXES 820,931 3.2 % 556,262 3.1 % 264,669 47.6 %\nNET INCOME $ 4,609,453 18.1 % $ 3,098,317 17.0 % $ 1,511,136 48.8 %\nRevenues\nWe currently produce our products for our customers in three broad product categories: fragrance compounds, health\nsupplemental powder drinks and bioactive food ingredients.\nTotal revenues were $25,494,564 in fiscal year 2021, an increase of $7,274,605, or approximately 39.9% as compared\nto $18,219,959 in fiscal year 2020. Specifically, the increase in revenues was primarily attributable to (i) an increase\nin average selling price of fragrance compound and health supplemental powder drinks by 39.2% and 4.9%,\nrespectively, as we raised our selling prices in response to the rising raw material costs and market change as affected\nby the COVID-19 and general inflation; (ii) an increase in sales volume of fragrance compounds and health\nsupplemental powder drinks by 7.9% and 51.7%, respectively, due to increased customer orders; (iii) a 7.1% positive\nimpact from foreign currency fluctuation when average exchange rate used in converting RMB into USD changed\nfrom US$1 to RMB 7.0066 in in fiscal year 2020 to US$1 to RMB 6.5095 in the same period of 2021; (iv) an increased\nin number of customers by 18 or 15.8% from 114 customers in fiscal year 2020 to 132 customers in fiscal year 2021\nand (v) partially offset by the decrease in sales volume of our bioactive food ingredients by 5.7% when COVID-19\noutbreak and spread in China appeared to be under the control during fiscal year 2021 as compared to fiscal year 2020,\nwhich led to decreased customer orders for our major bioactive ingredient product, Stachyose, which has been\nrecommended by local government as one of the important supplemental materials to produce COVID-19 pandemic\ncontrol related drugs and substances during fiscal year 2020.\n67\nThe following table summarizes the breakdown of revenues by categories for the periods indicated.\nRevenues\nFor the Years Ended September 30,\n2021 2020 Change Change\nUS$ % US$ % Amount %\n(Amount in US$, except percentage)\nFragrance compounds 12,744,029 50.0 % 7,879,300 43.3 % 4,864,729 61.7 %\nHealth supplements (powder drinks) 6,655,982 26.1 % 3,887,096 21.3 % 2,768,886 71.2 %\nBioactive food ingredients 6,094,553 23.9 % 6,453,563 35.4 % (359,010 ) (5.6 )%\nTotal Revenue 25,494,564 100.0 % 1 8,219,959 100.0 % 7,274,605 39.9 %\nRevenues from sales of our fragrance compound products\nOur fragrance compound products primarily include natural compounds extracted from plants for cosmetic\napplications, such as sclareolide and ambroxide, a sustainable replacement to ambergris, a secretion by sperm whales.\nRevenues from sales of our fragrance compound products increased by 61.7% or $4,864,729 to $12,744,029 in fiscal\nyear 2021 from $7,879,300 in fiscal year 2020. This increase was attributable to the following: (i) a 39.2% increase\nin average selling price of our fragrance compound products in response to increased raw materials purchase price as\naffected by COVID-19 impact and general inflation. Weighted average unit cost for this product category increased\nby 34.7% in fiscal 2021, as compared to that in fiscal year 2020 mainly due to higher raw material purchase costs in\n2021; (ii) a 7.9% increase in sales volume of our fragrance compound products from 41,765 kilograms in fiscal year\n2020 to 45,070 kilograms in fiscal year 2021.

In addition, the disruption of\nlogistics caused by COVID-19 also led to our reduced shipping and delivery expense associated with export sales to\noverseas customers. As a result, trade show and related marketing expenses decreased by $30,926 in fiscal year 2021\nas compared to fiscal year 2020.\nGeneral and administrative expenses\nFor the Years Ended\nSeptember 30, Change\n(in US dollars, except percentage) 2021 2020 Amount %\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses $ 1,323,726 $ 1,367,070 $ (43,344 ) (3.2 )%\nas a percentage of revenues 5.2 % 7.5 % (2.3 )%\nGeneral and administrative expenses decreased by $43,344, or 3.2%, from $1,367,070 in fiscal year 2020 to\n$1,323,726 in fiscal year 2021, mainly attributable to i) accrued penalty of $264,850 due to our large unpaid VAT tax\nassociated with our CIP project in fiscal year 2020, however, in accordance with notices issued by the government to\nencourage micro, small and medium-sized enterprises in manufacturing industry, for the unpaid tax liabilities,\nmanagement has discussed with local tax authorities and expects to settle the tax liabilities without interest and penalty\nbefore June 30, 2022, therefore no penalty accrued in fiscal year 2021; and offset by ii) an increase in salary expense\nof $135,497 in connection with our increased employee number from 34 to 40.\n71\nResearch and development (“R&D”) expenses\nFor the Years Ended\nSeptember 30, Change\n(in US dollars, except percentage) 2021 2020 Amount %\nResearch and Development Expenses $ 249,050 $ 205,359 $ 43,691 21.3 %\nas a percentage of revenues 1.0 % 1.1 % (0.1 )%\nResearch and development expenses increased by $43,691, or approximately 21.3%, from $205,359 in fiscal year\n2020 to $249,050 in fiscal year 2021. The increase was mainly due to an increase of $26,391 in material consumption\nand $10,647 in R&D testing and inspection related expenses.\nOther income (expenses)\nOther income (expenses) primarily includes interest income generated from our bank deposits, interest expenses\nincurred on our borrowings from various banks and financial institutions, government subsidy income, rental income,\nincome from technology transfer, unrealized foreign currency exchange gain due to our export sales, and investment\nincome of short-term investment.\nFor the Years Ended\nSeptember 30, Change\n(in US dollars, except percentage) 2021 2020 Amount %\nInterest expense, net $ (414,059) $ (328,388 ) $ (85,671 ) 26.1 %\nForeign currency exchange gain (loss) (45,124) (248 ) (44,876 ) 18095.2 %\nGain on disposal of fixed assets - 20,150 (20,150 ) (100.0 )%\nOther income, net\n-Government grants 449,972 362,187 87,785 24.2 %\n-Income from technology transfer - 93,824 (93,824 ) (100.0 )%\n-Rental income 38,409 38,889 (480 ) (1.2 )%\n-Investment income $ 565 $ - $ 565 100 %\nInterest expense, net, increased by $85,671, or approximately 26.1% in 2021 as compared to 2020. The increase was\nmainly attributable to increased average loan balances we carried during fiscal year 2021 as compared to fiscal year\n2020.\nGovernment subsidy income primarily relate to local government’s cash award to HNTEs based on their financial\nperformance to promote entrepreneurship and stimulate local economies. Such awards are granted on a case-by-case\nbasis by various local governments. Our subsidiary, Xi’an App-chem was approved as a HNTE and received\ngovernment subsidy in the form of an export sales refund and cash awards based on our annual financial performance.\nWe recognize government subsidies as other operating income when they are received because they are not subject to\nany past or future conditions, there are no performance conditions or conditions of use, and they are not subject to\nfuture refunds. Government subsidies received in the form of a grant and recognized as other operating income totaled\n$449,972 and $362,187 for the years ended September 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\nFor the year ended September 30, 2020, our subsidiary, Xi’an App-chem, sold a manufacturing process related\ntechnology to a third party and generated other income of $93,824 from such technology transfer. There was no such\nincome for the year ended September 30, 2021.\nOur subsidiary, Xi’an App-Chem, leased office space to a third-party and recorded rental income of $38,409 and\n$38,889 for the years ended September 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\nInvestment income related to income generated by our short-term investments, amounted to $565 and Nil for the years\nended September 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\nThe overall changes in our other income (expenses) reflected the above major factors.\n72\nProvision for Income Taxes\nOur provision for income taxes was $820,931 in fiscal year 2021, an increase of $264,669, or 47.6% from $556,262\nin fiscal year 2020 due to our increased taxable income. Under the EIT Law, domestic enterprises and FIEs are usually\nsubject to a unified 25% enterprise income tax rate while preferential tax rates, tax holidays and even tax exemption\nmay be granted on a case-by-case basis. EIT grants preferential tax treatment to “HNTEs”. Under this preferential tax\ntreatment, HNTEs are entitled to an income tax rate of 15%, subject to a requirement that they re-apply for their HNTE\nstatus every three years. The corporate income taxes for the years ended September 30, 2021 and 2020 were reported\nat a blended reduced rate as a result of Xi’an App-chem being approved as a HNTE and enjoying a 15% reduced\nincome tax rate, but subsidiaries of Xi’an App-chem are subject to a 25% income tax rate. The impact of the tax\nholidays noted above decreased foreign taxes by $514,327 and $372,517 for the years ended September 30, 2021 and\n2020, respectively. The benefit of the tax holidays on net income per share (basic and diluted) $0.08 and $0.07 for the\nyears ended September 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\nNet income\nAs a result of the foregoing, our net income increased from $3,098,317 in fiscal year 2020 to $4,609,453 in fiscal year\n2021.\nB. Liquidity and Capital Resources\nAs reflected in our consolidated financial statements, we are currently constructing two new manufacturing plants. As\nof September 30, 2022, we had future minimum capital expenditure commitment on our construction-in-progress\n(“CIP”) project of $728,470 within the next twelve months. Our Tongchuan project was fully completed and put into\nproduction in December 2022 and Yumen project is estimated to be completed in May 2023. The amount of working\ncapital requirement related to these projects will be $1.2m. We also had unpaid tax liabilities of approximately $1.2\nmillion, which are expected to be settled with local tax authorities within one year. Furthermore, the ongoing outbreak\nof COVID-19 may continue to negatively impact our business operations. A resurgence could negatively affect our\nability to fulfil customer sales orders and collect customer payments timely, or disrupt our supply chain. As a result,\nthere is a possibility that our revenue and cash flows may underperform in the next 12 months.\nIn assessing our liquidity, management monitors and analyzes our cash on-hand, our ability to generate sufficient\nrevenue sources in the future, and our operating and capital expenditure commitments. In June 2021, we closed the\ninitial public offering and received net proceeds of approximately $11.3 million. On January 17, 2023, we closed a\nprivate offering of ordinary shares and received subscription proceeds of $2.2 million.\nAs of September 30, 2022, we had cash on hand of $840,861. We also had outstanding accounts receivable of\napproximately $6.8 million, of which approximately $5.0 million or 73.5% has been subsequently collected as of the\ndate of this filing.\nAs of September 30, 2022, we had outstanding bank loans of approximately $4.8 million from several PRC banks\n(including short-term bank loans of $2.4 million, current portion of long-term bank loans of approximately $2.1\nmillion and long-term loan of $0.2 million). Management expects that it would be able to renew all of its existing bank\nloans upon their maturity based on past experience and our good credit history. In addition to the current borrowings,\nfrom December 2020 to December 2021, we secured an aggregate of $3.9 million (RMB 28 million) lines of credit\nwith PRC banks as working capital loan (including $2.1 million line of credit with Shanghai Pudong Development\nBank for one year and $1.8 million line of credit with Qishang Bank for three years. As of the date of this filing, we\nhad borrowed $1.8 million (RMB 13 million) out of these lines of credit and had the availability to borrow additional\nmaximum loans of $2.1 million (RMB 15 million) under these lines of credit before December 2023.\nBased on the current operating plan, management believes that the above-mentioned measures, including cash on hand\nof $840,861, $2.2 million proceeds from our private offering of ordinary shares in January 2023 and the $2.4 million\nunused line of credit, collectively will provide sufficient liquidity for us to settle the tax liabilities with local\ngovernment, to meet our future liquidity and capital expenditure requirement on the CIP project for at least 12 months\nfrom the date our consolidated financial statements for the year ended September 30, 2022 are issued.\n73\nThe following table sets forth summary of our cash flows for the periods indicated:\nFor the Fiscal Years Ended\nSeptember 30,\n2022 2021 2020\nNet cash (used in) provided by operating activities $ (187,121 ) $ 4,053,124 2,643,076\nNet cash used in investing activities (3,055,651 ) (7,443,745 ) (3,003,043 )\nNet cash provided by financing activities 2,261,516 5,352,682 112,492\nEffect of exchange rate change on cash (81,750 ) (111,301 ) 6,810\nNet (decrease) increase in cash (1,063,006 ) 1,850,761 (240,665 )\nCash, beginning of period 1,903,867 53,106 293,771\nCash, end of period $ 840,861 $ 1,903,867 53,106\nCash flows from operating activities\nNet cash used in operating activities during the year ended September 30, 2022 was $187,121, primarily attributable\nto net income of $6,242,424 for the year ended September 30, 2022, our taxes payable decreased by $3,632,922\nprimarily due to income and VAT tax paid in fiscal year 2022, an increase of $1,300,942 account receivable due to\nincreased sales in the year ended September 30, 2022, and decrease in deferred revenue of $875,295 due to changes\nin customer payment pattern related with COVID-19.\nNet cash provided by operating activities during the year ended September 30, 2021 was $4,053,124, primarily\nattributable to net income of $4,609,453 for the year ended September 30, 2021, offset by an increase of $399,262 in\nadvance payment to suppliers for raw material purchase, an increase in inventory of $209,011 to increase the raw\nmaterials stockpile in order to prepare for anticipated increase in production to fulfill increased sales orders from\ncustomers, a decrease of $969,414 in accounts payable for raw material purchase as we made payment to suppliers\nduring the year ended September 30, 2021 and accordingly we reduced the credit purchase from suppliers. In addition,\nour taxes payable increased by $410,716 primarily due to increased taxable income. As of September 30, 2021, we\nhad accrued tax liabilities of approximately $5.1 million, mostly related to the unpaid value added tax and income tax\nin China. We initially expected to settle the unpaid income tax liabilities in May 2021 when the 2020 annual income\ntax return is to be filed with local tax authority, and settle the unpaid VAT tax liabilities before September 30, 2021.\nIn May 2021, we negotiated with local tax authorities and submitted a settlement extension application in accordance\nwith the notices issued by local government to encourage enterprises to conduct public offerings. For the unpaid\nincome tax and VAT tax liabilities, the Company obtained an approval from local tax authority to extend the tax\nliability settlement date from May 2021 to December 31, 2021. In December 2021, due to recent COVID-19\nresurgence which caused strict city lockdown in Xi’an where the Company is headquartered, the Company re-\nnegotiated with local tax authorities and submitted a settlement extension application in accordance with the notices\nissued by the State Administration of Taxation to encourage micro, small and medium-sized enterprises in\nmanufacturing industry. For the unpaid income tax and VAT tax liabilities, we obtained an approval from local tax\nauthority to further extend the tax liability settlement date from December 31, 2021 to June 30, 2022 without interest\nand penalty during this extended time period.\nNet cash provided by operating activities during the year ended September 30, 2020 was $2,643,076, primarily\nattributable to (i) net income of $ 3,098,317 for the year ended September 30, 2020, (ii) a decrease of $1,636,321\ninventory due to increased sales in fiscal year 2020 and our strengthened inventory management strategy to control\nunnecessary inventory stockpile to save cost. (iii) an increase of $3,021,739 in advance to suppliers for raw material\npurchase. As of the date of this report, the September 30, 2020 advance to suppliers balance has been fully realized\nwhen we received purchased raw materials from suppliers. (iv) an increase of $2,662,542 in tax payable mostly due\nto accrued and unpaid value added tax payable. (v) a decrease of $1,982,205 in accounts payable because we arranged\nthe payment to suppliers to settle the outstanding accounts payable when we received the invoices from suppliers.\nCash flows from investing activities\nNet cash used in investing activities during the year ended September 30, 2022 was $3,055,651 which was primarily\nattributable to (i) capital expenditure on construction-in-progress in the amount of $4,708,138. As of September 30,\n2022, we had two CIP projects associated with construction of new manufacturing facilities in Tongchuan and Yumen\nCity, respectively (see Note 8). Our future minimum capital expenditures on these two CIP projects are estimated to\nbe $728,470, among which $196,809 is required for the next 12 months; (2) purchase of short-term investments in the\namount of $5,097,816 because we purchased wealth management financial products from PRC banks to earn\ninvestment income and (iii) partially offset by proceeds upon redemption of short-term investments in the amount of\n$6,776,385.\n74\nNet cash used in investing activities for the year ended September 30, 2021 was $7,443,745 which was primarily\nattributable to (i) capital expenditure on construction-in-progress in the amount of $4,432,941. As of September 30,\n2021, we had two CIP projects associated with construction of new manufacturing facilities in Tongchuan and Yumen\nCity, respectively (see Note 8), these CIP projects are expected to be completed in late 2022. Our future minimum\ncapital expenditures on these two CIP projects are estimated to be approximately $5.1 million, among which\napproximately $2.3 million is required for the next 12 months; (2) purchase of short-term investments in the amount\nof $2,159,920 because we purchased wealth management financial products from PRC banks to earn investment\nincome and (iii) payment of acquisition deposit of $1,000,000. On July 6, 2021, we entered into a consulting agreement\nwith a New York based consulting firm, pursuant to which, the consulting firm will help the Company to (i) identify\nappropriate business partner candidates in New York or California in order to jointly establish a research and\ndevelopment center in the United States for future new product development; (ii) find opportunities to establish\nbusiness relationship with U.S based companies with OEM demand and utilize the Company’s manufacturing strength\nand capability to manufacture healthcare ingredient products for U.S companies under the OEM arrangement and (iii)\nhelp the Company to purchase or lease appropriate commercial facilities in the U.S., etc. The consulting firm will be\ncompensated with $30,000 in exchange for performing these designated consulting services. Given the fact that the\nCompany lacks of credit track in the U.S, the Company is required to make a deposit of $1.5 million to the consulting\nfirm. Due to recent COVID-19 resurgence in Xi’an City and government mandatory quarantine and city lockdown,\non January 20, 2022, we and the consulting firm signed a supplemental agreement to lower down the required deposit\nfrom original $1.5 million to $1 million. As a result, we do not have further obligation to make additional deposit to\nthe consulting firm. As of September 30, 2021, we have made deposit of $1 million to the consulting firm and recorded\nit as acquisition deposit on the balance sheets. Such deposit is fully refundable if the acquisition target or commercial\nfacilities introduced by the consulting firm does not meet our expectation.\nNet cash used in investing activities for the year ended September 30, 2020 was $3,003,043 which was primarily\nattributable to the purchase of property and equipment in the amount of $31,885, capital expenditure on construction-\nin-progress in the amount of $4,301,103 and partially offset by a refund of acquisition deposit of $1,329,945, which\nwas made during 2019 and collected in 2020 after termination of the intended acquisition.\nCash flows from financing activities\nNet cash provided by financing activities for the year ended September 30, 2022 was $2,261,516, primarily include\nproceeds from short-term loans of $2,631,890, proceeds from long-term loans of $578,343, offset by repayment of\nlong-term loans of $637,147, and principal payment of capital lease of $173,961.\nNet cash provided by financing activities for the year ended September 30, 2021 was $5,352,682, primarily include\nnet proceeds from issuance of Ordinary Shares in initial public offerings of $11,271,480, proceeds from short-term\nloans of $1,257,225, proceeds from long-term loans of $1,245,871, offset by repayment of short-term loans of\n$2,563,433, repayment of long-term loans of $2,522,101, repayment of borrowings from related parties in the amount\nof $2,262,378, and repayment of borrowings from third party loans in the amount of $721,484.\nNet cash provided by financing activities for the year ended September 30, 2020 was $112,492, primarily include\nproceeds from short-term loans of $2,033,570, proceeds from long-term loans of $319,342, proceeds from borrowings\nfrom related parties of $1,067,808, proceeds from third-party loans of $238,133, offset by repayment of short-term\nloans of $2,872,778, repayment of capital lease in the amount of $392,030, and payment for deferred initial public\noffering costs of $281,553 in connection with our IPO.\nDuring the year ended September 30, 2022, we experienced a net decrease in cash of $1,063,006 as compared to 2021.\nC.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nAs of September 30, 2022 and 2021, there were no off-balance sheet arrangements.\nF. Tabular Disclosure of Contractual Obligations\nAs of September 30, 2022, we had the following contractual obligations:\nPayments Due by Period\nContractual Obligations Total Less than 1-3 years 3-5 years More than\n1 year 5 years\n(1) Debt Obligations $ 4,750,379 $ 4,560,566 $ 189,813 $ - $ -\n(2) Lease Obligations 583,669 256,467 327,202 - -\n(3) Capital expenditure commitment\nobligations on CIP project 728,470 196,809 - 531,661 -\nTotal $ 6,062,518 $ 5,013,842 $ 517,015 $ 531,661 $ -\n(1) As of September 30, 2022, we had total $4,750,379 short-term and long-term borrowings from several PRC banks\nand financing institutions (including short-term loans of $2,424,587, current portion of long-term loans of $2,135,979\nand long-term loans of $189,813) (see Footnote 10 – Debt, for details).\n(2) A two-year capital lease agreement with Taizhongyin Finance Lease (Suzhou) Ltd. (“the Lessor”), as well as\noperating lease of our factory space in Dali and office space in Xi’an.\n(3) Construction-in-progress (“CIP”) represents direct costs of construction incurred for our manufacturing facilities.\nOn August 16, 2017, our subsidiary, Xi’an App-Chem Bio(Tech) Co.,Ltd. started to construct a new manufacturing\nplant in Tongchuan City (“Tongchuan Project”), Shaanxi Province, with total budget of RMB 95 million\n(approximately $13.4 million) for construction of the main body of the manufacturing plant, plant decoration and\npurchase of machinery and equipment. The total budget increased to RMB 114 million (approximately $16.0 million)\non July 2, 2021 due to increased material and labor cost, as well as longer construction period caused by COVID-19\npandemic. The construction of Tongchuan Project was fully completed and put into production in December 2022.\nOn May 10, 2021, a subsidiary of Xi’an App-Chem, Gansu Baimeikang Bioengineering Co., Ltd. obtained a land use\nright and started to construct a new manufacturing plant in Yumen City (“Yumen Project”), Gansu Province, with\ntotal budget of RMB 40 million (approximately $5.6 million) for including the construction of the main body of the\nmanufacturing plant, plant decoration and purchase of machinery and equipment. The construction of Yumen Project\nwas initially expected to be completed by October 2022. Due to resurgence of the COVID-19 pandemic, which\nresulted in the implementation of significant governmental measures, including lockdowns, closures, quarantines and\ntravel bans, the construction work is estimated to be completed in May 2023.\nAs of September 30, 2022, we have spent approximately RMB 144.2 million (approximately $20.3 million) on the\nconstruction of the main body of the manufacturing plants located in Tongchuan and Yumen, and future minimum\ncapital expenditure on these two CIP projects is estimated to be $728,470, among which $196,809 is required for the\nnext 12 months. We currently plan to support our ongoing CIP project construction through cash flows from operations\nand bank borrowings.\nLegal proceedings\nWe are currently not a party to any material legal or administrative proceedings. We may from time to time be subject\nto various legal or administrative claims and proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business. Litigation or any\nother legal or administrative proceeding, regardless of the outcome, may result in substantial cost and diversion of our\nresources, including our management’s time and attention.\n76\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nOur discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated\nfinancial statements. These financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP, which requires us to\nmake estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of our assets and liabilities and revenues and\nexpenses, to disclose contingent assets and liabilities on the date of the consolidated financial statements, and to\ndisclose the reported amounts of revenues and expenses incurred during the financial reporting period. The most\nsignificant estimates and assumptions include the valuation of accounts receivable and inventories, useful lives of\nproperty, plant and equipment and intangible assets, the recoverability of long-lived assets, provision necessary for\ncontingent liabilities, and revenue recognition. We continue to evaluate these estimates and assumptions that we\nbelieve to be reasonable under the circumstances. We rely on these evaluations as the basis for making judgments\nabout the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Since the use of\nestimates is an integral component of the financial reporting process, actual results could differ from those estimates.\nSome of our accounting policies require higher degrees of judgment than others in their application. We believe critical\naccounting policies as disclosed in this report reflect the more significant judgments and estimates used in preparation\nof our consolidated financial statements.\nRisks and Uncertainties\nOur main operation is located in the PRC. Accordingly, our business, financial condition, and results of operations\nmay be influenced by political, economic, and legal environments in the PRC, as well as by the general state of the\nPRC economy. Our results may be adversely affected by changes in the political, regulatory and social conditions in\nthe PRC. Although we have not experienced losses from these situations and believes that we are in compliance with\nexisting laws and regulations including our organization and structure, this may not be indicative of future results.\nOur business, financial condition and results of operations may also be negatively impacted by risks related to natural\ndisasters, extreme weather conditions, health epidemics and other catastrophic incidents. Our operations may be\nfurther affected by the ongoing outbreak of COVID-19 pandemic. Although the Company resumed its operations since\nMarch 2, 2020 and the COVID-19 impact on the Company’s operating results and financial performance for the years\nended September 30, 2022 and 2021 seems to be temporary, a resurgence could negatively affect the execution of\ncustomer contracts, the collection of customer payments, or disruption of our supply chain. The continued\nuncertainties associated with COVID-19 may cause our revenue and cash flows to underperform in the next 12 months.\nThe extent of the future impact of COVID-19 is still highly uncertain and cannot be predicted as of the financial\nstatement reporting date.\nThe development and commercialization of natural and healthy extracts and compounds products is highly\ncompetitive, and the industry currently is characterized by rapidly changing technologies, significant competition and\na strong emphasis on intellectual property. We may face competition with respect to our current and future\npharmaceutical product candidates from major pharmaceutical companies in China.\nThe following critical accounting policies rely upon assumptions and estimates and were used in the preparation of\nour consolidated financial statements:\nUses of estimates\nIn preparing the consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the\nUnited States of America (“US GAAP”), management makes estimates and assumptions that affect the reported\namounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements\nand the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. These estimates are based on\ninformation as of the date of the consolidated financial statements. Significant estimates required to be made by\nmanagement include, but are not limited to, the allowance for estimated uncollectible receivables, realizability of\nadvance to suppliers, inventory valuations, useful lives of property, plant and equipment, intangible assets, the\nrecoverability of long-lived assets, provision necessary for contingent liabilities, revenue recognition and realization\nof deferred tax assets. Actual results could differ from those estimates.\n77\nAccounts receivable, net\nAccounts receivable are presented net of allowance for doubtful accounts. We determine the adequacy of reserves for\ndoubtful accounts based on individual account analysis and historical collection trend. We establish a provision for\ndoubtful receivables when there is objective evidence that we may not be able to collect amounts due. The allowance\nis based on management’s best estimate of specific losses on individual exposures, as well as a provision on historical\ntrends of collections. Actual amounts received may differ from management’s estimate of credit worthiness and the\neconomic environment. Delinquent account balances are written-off against the allowance for doubtful accounts after\nmanagement has determined that the collection is not probable, Nil, $99,528 and Nil uncollectable account receivable\nwas written-off during the years ended September 30, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Allowance for uncollectable\nbalances amounted to $13,337 and $14,691 as of September 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\nInventories, net\nInventories are stated at net realizable value using weighted average method. Costs include the cost of raw materials,\nfreight, direct labor and related production overhead. Any excess of the cost over the net realizable value of each item\nof inventories is recognized as a provision for diminution in the value of inventories. Net realizable value is the\nestimated selling price in the normal course of business less any costs to complete and sell products. We evaluate\ninventories on a quarterly basis for its net realizable value adjustments, and reduces the carrying value of those\ninventories that are obsolete or in excess of the forecasted usage to their estimated net realizable value based on various\nfactors including aging, expiration dates, as applicable, taking into consideration historical and expected future product\nsales. We recorded inventory reserve of $6,869 and $147,960 as of September 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\nRevenue recognition\nOn October 1, 2017, we adopted Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 606 using the modified retrospective\napproach.\nTo determine revenue recognition for contracts with customers, we perform the following five steps : (i) identify the\ncontract(s) with the customer, (ii) identify the performance obligations in the contract, (iii) determine the transaction\nprice, including variable consideration to the extent that it is probable that a significant future reversal will not occur,\n(iv) allocate the transaction price to the respective performance obligations in the contract, and (v) recognize revenue\nwhen (or as) we satisfy the performance obligations.\nIn accordance to ASC 606, we recognize revenue when it transfers its goods and services to customers in an amount\nthat reflects the consideration to which we expect to be entitled in such exchange. We account for the revenue\ngenerated from sales of its products to its customers, in which we are acting as a principal in these transactions, is\nsubject to inventory risk, has latitude in establishing prices, and is responsible for fulfilling the promise to provide\ncustomers the specified goods. All of our contracts have single performance obligation as the promise is to transfer\nthe individual goods to customers, and there are no other separately identifiable promises in the contracts. Our revenue\nstreams are recognized at a point in time when title and risk of loss passes and the customer accepts the goods, which\ngenerally occurs at delivery. Our products are sold with no right of return and we do not provide other credits or sales\nincentive to customers. Our sales are net of value added tax (“VAT”) and business tax and surcharges collected on\nbehalf of tax authorities in respect of product sales.\nContract Assets and Liabilities\nPayment terms are established on our pre-established credit requirements based upon an evaluation of customers’\ncredit. Contract assets are recognized for in related accounts receivable. Contract liabilities are recognized for contracts\nwhere payment has been received in advance of delivery. The contract liability balance can vary significantly\ndepending on the timing when an order is placed and when shipment or delivery occurs. As of September 30, 2022\nand 2021, other than accounts receivable and advances from customers, we had no other material contract assets,\ncontract liabilities or deferred contract costs recorded on its consolidated balance sheet. Costs of fulfilling customers’\npurchase orders, such as shipping, handling and delivery, which occur prior to the transfer of control, are recognized\nin selling, general and administrative expense when incurred.\n78\nDisaggregation of Revenues\nWe disaggregate our revenue from contracts by product types, as we believe it best depicts how the nature, amount,\ntiming and uncertainty of the revenue and cash flows are affected by economic factors. The summary of our total\nrevenues by product categories for the years ended September 30, 2022, 2021 and 2020 was as follows:\nRevenue by region\nThe summary of our total revenues by region for the years ended September 30, 2022, 2021 and 2020 was as follows:\nFor Years ended September 30,\n2022 2021 2020\nPRC $ 28,756,333 $ 23,704,259 $ 15,461,801\nOverseas 1,152,228 1,790,305 2,758,158\nTotal revenue $ 29,908,561 $ 25,494,564 $ 18,219,959\nRevenue by product categories\nThe summary of our total revenues by product categories for the years ended September 30, 2022, 2021 and 2020 was\nas follows:\nFor Years ended September 30,\n2022 2021 2020\nFragrance compounds $ 13,710,556 $ 12,744,029 $ 7,879,300\nHealth supplements (solid drinks) 7,145,708 6,655,982 3,887,096\nBioactive food ingredients 9,052,297 6,094,553 6,453,563\nTotal revenue $ 29,908,561 $ 25,494,564 $ 18,219,959\nIncome Tax\nWe account for current income taxes in accordance with the laws of the relevant tax authorities. Deferred income\ntaxes are recognized when temporary differences exist between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their reported\namounts in the consolidated financial statements. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax\nrates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be\nrecovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income\nin the period including the enactment date. Valuation allowances are established, when necessary, to reduce deferred\ntax assets to the amount expected to be realized.\nAn uncertain tax position is recognized only if it is “more likely than not” that the tax position would be sustained in\na tax examination. The amount recognized is the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being\nrealized on examination. For tax positions not meeting the “more likely than not” test, no tax benefit is recorded.\nPenalties and interest incurred related to underpayment of income tax are classified as income tax expense in the\nperiod incurred. As of September 30, 2022, we had income tax payable of $576,098, primarily related to the unpaid\nincome tax in China.\nOur operating subsidiaries in China are subject to the income tax laws of the PRC. No significant income was\ngenerated outside the PRC for the years ended September 30, 2022, 2021 and 2020. As of September 30, 2022 and\n2021, all of the tax returns of our PRC subsidiary remain open for statutory examination by PRC tax authorities.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nIn June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326), which requires\nentities to measure all expected credit losses for financial assets held at the reporting date based on historical\nexperience, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts. This replaces the existing incurred loss\nmodel and is applicable to the measurement of credit losses on financial assets measured at amortized cost. ASU 2016-\n13 was subsequently amended by ASU 2018-19, ASU 2019-04, ASU 2019-05, ASU 2019-10 and ASU 2020-02. For\npublic entities, ASU 2016-13 and its amendments are effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal\nyears, beginning after December 15, 2019. For all other entities, this guidance and its amendments will be effective\nfor fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early\napplication will be permitted for all entities for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning\nafter December 15, 2018. The Company is currently evaluating the effects of the guidance on the Company’s\nconsolidated financial statements and related disclosures.\n79\nIn March 2020, the FASB issued ASU No. 2020–04, Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Facilitation of the Effects\nof Reference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting. The pronouncement provides temporary optional expedients and\nexceptions to the current guidance on contract modifications and hedge accounting to ease the financial reporting\nburden related to the expected market transition from the London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) and other\ninterbank offered rates to alternative reference rates. The guidance was effective for all entities upon issuance and\ngenerally can be applied to applicable contract modifications through December 31, 2022. The Company is currently\nevaluating the effects of the guidance on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.\nIn October 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-10, “Codification Improvements to Subtopic 205-10, presentation of\nfinancial statements”. The amendments in this Update improve the codification by ensuring that all guidance that\nrequires or provides an option for an entity to provide information in the notes to financial statements is codified in\nthe disclosure section of the codification. That reduce the likelihood that the disclosure requirement would be missed.\nASU 2020-10 is effective for the Company for annual and interim reporting periods beginning January 1, 2022. Early\napplication of the amendments is permitted for any annual or interim period for which financial statements are\navailable to be issued. The amendments in this Update should be applied retrospectively. An entity should apply the\namendments at the beginning of the period that includes the adoption date. The Company is currently evaluating the\nimpact of this new standard on Company’s consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.\nG.

We currently anticipate that we\nwill retain any available funds to finance the growth and operation of our business and we do not anticipate paying\nany cash dividends in the foreseeable future. Additionally, our cash held in foreign countries may be subject to certain\ncontrol limitations or repatriation requirements, limiting our ability to use this cash to pay dividends.\n88\nB.

Memorandum and Articles of Association\nThe following are summaries of material provisions of our memorandum and articles of association and of the\nCompanies Law, insofar as they relate to the material terms of our ordinary shares.\nObjects of Our Company. Under our memorandum and articles of association, the objects of our company are\nunrestricted and we have the full power and authority to carry out any object not prohibited by the law of the Cayman\nIslands.\nOrdinary Shares. Our ordinary shares are issued in registered form and are issued when registered in our register of\nmembers. Our shareholders who are nonresidents of the Cayman Islands may freely hold and vote their shares.\nPreference Shares. Our preference shares may be issued in the future, upon approval of the Board of Directors, in\none or more classes or series, with rights and limitations of each class or series with regard to voting, dividends,\nconvertability, and other powers, preferences and relative, participating, optional and other special rights, and any\nqualifications, limitations and restrictions, as may be designated by the Board for each designated class.\n89\nDividends. The holders of our ordinary shares are entitled to such dividends as may be declared by our board of\ndirectors. In addition, our shareholders may by ordinary resolution declare a final dividend, but no dividend may\nexceed the amount recommended by our directors. Our articles of association provide that dividends may be declared\nand paid out of our profits, realized or unrealized, or from any reserve set aside from profits which our board of\ndirectors determine is no longer needed. Dividends may also be declared and paid out of share premium account or\nany other fund or account which can be authorized for this purpose subject to the restrictions of the Companies Law,\nprovided that in no circumstances may we pay a dividend if this would result in our company being unable to pay its\ndebts as they fall due in the ordinary course of business.\nVoting Rights. On a show of hands each shareholder is entitled to one vote or, on a poll, each shareholder is entitled\nto one vote for each ordinary share, voting together as a single class, on all matters that require a shareholder’s vote.\nVoting at any shareholders’ meeting is by show of hands unless a poll is demanded. A poll may be demanded by the\nchairman of such meeting or one or more shareholders present in person or by proxy entitled to vote and who together\nhold not less than 10 percent of the paid-up voting share capital for the Company.\nA quorum required for a meeting of shareholders consists of one or more shareholders present and holding at least a\nmajority of the votes of the issued and outstanding voting shares in our company. Shareholders may be present in\nperson or by proxy or, if the shareholder is a legal entity, by its duly authorized representative. Shareholders’ meetings\nmay be convened by our board of directors on its own initiative or upon a request to the directors by shareholders\nholding no less than 10 percent of our paid voting share capital. Advance notice of at least seven days is required for\nthe convening of our annual general shareholders’ meeting and any other general shareholders’ meeting.\nAn ordinary resolution to be passed at a meeting by the shareholders requires the affirmative vote of a simple majority\nof the votes attaching to the ordinary shares cast at a meeting, while a special resolution requires the affirmative vote\nof no less than two-thirds of the votes cast attaching to the outstanding ordinary shares at a meeting. A special\nresolution will be required for important matters such as a change of name or making changes to our memorandum\nand articles of association. Holders of the ordinary shares may, among other things, divide or combine their shares by\nordinary resolution.\nTransfer of Ordinary Shares. Any of our shareholders may transfer all or any of his or her ordinary shares by an\ninstrument of transfer in the usual or common form or any other form approved by our board of directors.\nOur board of directors may, in its absolute discretion, decline to register any transfer of any ordinary share whether or\nnot it is fully paid up without assigning any reason for doing so.\nIf our directors refuse to register a transfer they shall, within two months after the date on which the instrument of\ntransfer was lodged, send to each of the transferor and the transferee notice of such refusal.\nThe registration of transfers may be suspended and the register closed at such times and for such periods as our board\nof directors may from time to time determine, provided, however, that the registration of transfers shall not be\nsuspended nor the register closed for more than 45 days in any year as our board may determine.\nLiquidation. On a return of capital on winding up or otherwise (other than on conversion, redemption or purchase of\nshares), assets available for distribution among the holders of ordinary shares shall be distributed among the holders\nof our shares on a pro rata basis. If our assets available for distribution are insufficient to repay all of the paid-up\ncapital, the assets will be distributed so that the losses are borne by our shareholders proportionately.\nCalls on Shares and Forfeiture of Shares. Our board of directors may from time to time make calls upon shareholders\nfor any amounts unpaid on their shares in a notice served to such shareholders at least 14 days prior to the specified\ntime and place of payment. The shares that have been called upon and remain unpaid are subject to forfeiture.\n90\nRedemption of Shares. The Companies Law and our articles of association permit us to purchase, redeem or otherwise\nacquire our own shares. In accordance with our articles of association and provided the necessary shareholders or\nboard approval have been obtained, we may issue shares on terms that are subject to redemption, at our option or at\nthe option of the holders of these shares, on such terms and in such manner, including out of capital, as may be\ndetermined by our board of directors.\nVariations of Rights of Shares. The rights attached to any class or series of shares (unless otherwise provided by the\nterms of issue of the shares of that class or series), whether or not our company is being wound-up, may be varied\nwith the consent in writing of the holders of two-thirds of the issued shares of that class or series or with the sanction\nof a special resolution passed at a separate meeting of the holders of the shares of the class or series. The rights\nconferred upon the holders of the shares of any class issued shall not, unless otherwise expressly provided by the terms\nof issue of the shares of that class, be deemed to be varied by the creation or issue of further shares ranking pari passu\nwith such existing class of shares.\nIssuance of Additional Shares. Our memorandum and articles of association authorizes our board of directors to issue\nadditional ordinary shares from time to time as our board of directors shall determine, to the extent of available\nauthorized but unissued shares.\nInspection of Books and Records. Holders of our ordinary shares will have no general right under Cayman Islands\nlaw to inspect or obtain copies of our list of shareholders or our corporate records. However, we will provide our\nshareholders with annual audited financial statements. See “Where You Can Find Additional Information.”\nAnti-Takeover Provisions. Some provisions of our memorandum and articles of association may discourage, delay or\nprevent a change of control of our company or management that shareholders may consider favorable, including a\nprovision that limits the ability of shareholders to requisition and convene general meetings of shareholders, such that\nshareholders requisitioning a meeting must hold not less than ten percent of the paid up voting share capital of the\ncompany\nHowever, under Cayman Islands law, our directors may only exercise the rights and powers granted to them under\nour memorandum and articles of association for a proper purpose and for what they believe in good faith to be in the\nbest interests of our company.\nExempted Company. We are an exempted company with limited liability under the Companies Law. The Companies\nLaw distinguishes between ordinary resident companies and exempted companies. Any company that is registered in\nthe Cayman Islands but conducts business mainly outside of the Cayman Islands may apply to be registered as an\nexempted company. The requirements for an exempted company are essentially the same as for an ordinary company\nexcept that an exempted company that does not hold a license to carry on business in the Cayman Islands:\n● does not have to file an annual return of its shareholders with the Registrar of Companies;\n● is not required to open its register of members for inspection;\n● does not have to hold an annual general meeting;\n● is prohibited from making any invitation to the public in the Cayman Islands to subscribe for any of\nits securities;\n● may issue negotiable or bearer shares or shares with no par value;\n● may obtain an undertaking against the imposition of any future taxation (such undertakings are\nusually given for 20 years in the first instance);\n● may register by way of continuation in another jurisdiction and be deregistered in the Cayman\nIslands;\n● may register as an exempted limited duration company; and\n● may register as a segregated portfolio company.\n“Limited liability” means that the liability of each shareholder is limited to the amount unpaid by the shareholder on\nthe shares of the company.\n91\nC. Material Contracts\nWe have not entered into any material contracts other than in the ordinary course of business and other than those\ndescribed in Item 4 “Information on the Company,” Item 5 “Operating and Financial Review and Prospects—F.\nTabular Disclosure of Contractual Obligations,” Item 7 “Major Shareholders and Related Party Transactions,” or filed\n(or incorporated by reference) as exhibits to this annual report or otherwise described or referenced in this annual\nreport.\nD. Exchange Controls\nBVI Exchange Controls\nThere are no material exchange controls restrictions on payment of dividends, interest or other payments to the holders\nof our common stock or on the conduct of our operations in the BVI, where we were incorporated. There are no\nmaterial BVI laws that impose any material exchange controls on us or that affect the payment of dividends, interest\nor other payments to nonresident holders of our common stock. BVI law and our memorandum and articles of\nassociation do not impose any material limitations on the right of non-residents or foreign owners to hold or vote our\ncommon stock.\nPRC Exchange Controls\nRegulations on Foreign Currency Exchange\nUnder the PRC Foreign Currency Administration Rules promulgated on January 29, 1996 and last amended on August\n5, 2008 and various regulations issued by SAFE and other relevant PRC government authorities, payment of current\naccount items in foreign currencies, such as trade and service payments, payment of interest and dividends can be\nmade without prior approval from SAFE by following the appropriate procedural requirements. By contrast, the\nconversion of RMB into foreign currencies and remittance of the converted foreign currency outside the PRC for the\npurpose of capital account items, such as direct equity investments, loans and repatriation of investment, requires prior\napproval from SAFE or its local office.\nOn February 13, 2015, SAFE promulgated the Circular on Simplifying and Improving the Foreign Currency\nManagement Policy on Direct Investment, effective from June 1, 2015, which cancels the requirement for obtaining\napprovals of foreign exchange registration of foreign direct investment and overseas direct investment from SAFE.\nThe application for the registration of foreign exchange for the purpose of foreign direct investment and overseas\ndirect investment may be filed with qualified banks, which, under the supervision of SAFE, may review the application\nand process the registration.\nThe Circular of the SAFE on Reforming the Management Approach regarding the Settlement of Foreign Capital of\nForeign-invested Enterprise, or SAFE Circular 19, was promulgated on March 30, 2015 and became effective on June\n1, 2015. According to SAFE Circular 19, a foreign-invested enterprise may, according to its actual business needs,\nsettle with a bank the portion of the foreign exchange capital in its capital account for which the relevant foreign\nexchange bureau has confirmed monetary contribution rights and interests (or for which the bank has registered the\naccount-crediting of monetary contribution). For the time being, foreign-invested enterprises are allowed to settle\n100% of their foreign exchange capitals on a discretionary basis; a foreign-invested enterprise shall truthfully use its\ncapital for its own operational purposes within the scope of business; where an ordinary foreign-invested enterprise\nmakes domestic equity investment with the amount of foreign exchanges settled, the invested enterprise shall first go\nthrough domestic re-investment registration and open a corresponding Account for Foreign Exchange Settlement\nPending Payment with the foreign exchange bureau (bank) at the place of registration. The Circular of the SAFE on\nReforming and Regulating Policies on the Control over Foreign Exchange Settlement of Capital Accounts, or SAFE\nCircular 16, was promulgated and became effective on June 9, 2016. According to SAFE Circular 16, enterprises\nregistered in PRC may also convert their foreign debts from foreign currency into Renminbi on self-discretionary\nbasis. SAFE Circular 16 provides an integrated standard for conversion of foreign exchange under capital account\nitems (including but not limited to foreign currency capital and foreign debts) on self—discretionary basis, which\napplies to all enterprises registered in the PRC. SAFE Circular 16 reiterates the principle that Renminbi converted\nfrom foreign currency-denominated capital of a company may not be directly or indirectly used for purposes beyond\nits business scope and may not be used for investments in securities or other investment with the exception of bank\nfinancial products that can guarantee the principal within the PRC unless otherwise specifically provided. Besides, the\nconverted Renminbi shall not be used to make loans for related enterprises unless it is within the business scope or to\nbuild or to purchase any real estate that is not for the enterprise own use with the exception for the real estate enterprise.\n92\nOn January 26, 2017, SAFE promulgated the Circular on Further Improving Reform of Foreign Exchange\nAdministration and Optimizing Genuineness and Compliance Verification, or SAFE Circular 3, which stipulates\nseveral capital control measures with respect to the outbound remittance of profits from domestic entities to offshore\nentities, including (i) banks must check whether the transaction is genuine by reviewing board resolutions regarding\nprofit distribution, original copies of tax filing records and audited financial statements, and (ii) domestic entities must\nretain income to account for previous years’ losses before remitting any profits. Moreover, pursuant to SAFE Circular\n3, domestic entities must explain in detail the sources of capital and how the capital will be used, and provide board\nresolutions, contracts and other proof as a part of the registration procedure for outbound investment.\nRegulations on Foreign Exchange Registration of Overseas Investment by PRC Residents\nSAFE issued the Circular on Relevant Issues Relating to Domestic Resident’s Investment and Financing and\nRoundtrip Investment through Special Purpose Vehicles, or SAFE Circular 37, which became effective in July 2014,\nto replace the Circular of the State Administration of Foreign Exchange on Issues Concerning the Regulation of\nForeign Exchange in Equity Finance and Roundtrip Investments by Domestic Residents through Offshore Special\nPurpose Vehicles, to regulate foreign exchange matters in relation to the use of special purpose vehicles, or SPVs, by\nPRC residents or entities to seek offshore investment and financing or conduct round trip investment in China. SAFE\nCircular 37 defines a SPV as an offshore entity established or controlled, directly or indirectly, by PRC residents or\nentities for the purpose of seeking offshore financing or making offshore investment, using legitimate onshore or\noffshore assets or interests, while “round trip investment” is defined as direct investment in China by PRC residents\nor entities through SPVs, namely, establishing foreign-invested enterprises to obtain the ownership, control rights and\nmanagement rights. SAFE Circular 37 stipulates that, prior to making contributions into an SPV, PRC residents or\nentities be required to complete foreign exchange registration with SAFE or its local branch. In addition, SAFE\npromulgated the Notice on Further Simplifying and Improving the Administration of the Foreign Exchange\nConcerning Direct Investment in February 2015, which amended SAFE Circular 37 and became effective on June 1,\n2015, requiring PRC residents or entities to register with qualified banks rather than SAFE in connection with their\nestablishment or control of an offshore entity established for the purpose of overseas investment or financing.\nPRC residents or entities who had contributed legitimate onshore or offshore interests or assets to SPVs but had not\nobtained registration as required before the implementation of the SAFE Circular 37 must register their ownership\ninterests or control in the SPVs with qualified banks. An amendment to the registration is required if there is a material\nchange with respect to the SPV registered, such as any change of basic information (including change of the PRC\nresidents, name and operation term), increases or decreases in investment amount, transfers or exchanges of shares,\nand mergers or divisions. Failure to comply with the registration procedures set forth in SAFE Circular 37 and the\nsubsequent notice, or making misrepresentation on or failure to disclose controllers of the foreign-invested enterprise\nthat is established through round-trip investment, may result in restrictions being imposed on the foreign exchange\nactivities of the relevant foreign-invested enterprise, including payment of dividends and other distributions, such as\nproceeds from any reduction in capital, share transfer or liquidation, to its offshore parent or affiliate, and the capital\ninflow from the offshore parent, and may also subject relevant PRC residents or entities to penalties under PRC foreign\nexchange administration regulations. See “Risk Factors—PRC regulations relating to the establishment of offshore\nspecial purpose companies by PRC residents may subject our PRC resident beneficial owners or our PRC subsidiary\nto liability or penalties, limit our ability to inject capital into our PRC subsidiary, limit our PRC subsidiary’s ability to\nincrease its registered capital or distribute profits to us, or may otherwise adversely affect us.”\n93\nRegulations on Dividend Distribution\nDistribution of dividends of foreign investment enterprises are mainly governed by the Foreign Investment Enterprise\nLaw, issued in 1986 and amended in 2000 and 2016 respectively, and the Implementation Rules under the Foreign\nInvestment Enterprise Law, issued in 1990 and amended in 2001 and 2014 respectively. Under these regulations,\nforeign investment enterprises in the PRC may distribute dividends only out of their accumulative profits, if any,\ndetermined in accordance with PRC accounting standards and regulations. In addition, no less than 10% of the\naccumulated profits of the foreign investment enterprises in the PRC are required to be allocated to fund certain reserve\nfunds each year unless these reserves have reached 50% of the registered capital of the enterprises. A PRC company\nis not permitted to distribute any profits until any losses from previous fiscal years have been offset. Profits retained\nfrom prior fiscal years may be distributed together with distributable profits from the current fiscal year. Under our\ncurrent corporate structure, our BVI holding company may rely on dividend payments from our wholly foreign-owned\nenterprisse incorporated in China to fund any cash and financing requirements we may have. Limitation on the ability\nof our operating subsidiaries to make remittance to our WOFEs and on the ability of our WOFEs to pay dividends to\nus could limit our ability to access cash generated by the operations of those entities.\nE. Taxation\nThe following summary of the material Cayman Islands, PRC and U.S. federal income tax consequences of an\ninvestment in our ordinary shares is based upon laws and relevant interpretations thereof in effect as of the date of this\nregistration statement, all of which are subject to change. This summary does not deal with all possible tax\nconsequences relating to an investment in our ordinary shares, such as the tax consequences under U.S. state and local\ntax laws or under the tax laws of jurisdictions other than the Cayman Islands, the People’s Republic of China and the\nUnited States.\nCayman Islands Taxation\nThe Cayman Islands currently levies no taxes on individuals or corporations based upon profits, income, gains or\nappreciation and there is no taxation in the nature of inheritance tax or estate duty. There are no other taxes likely to\nbe material to us levied by the government of the Cayman Islands except for stamp duties which may be applicable\non instruments executed in, or after execution brought within the jurisdiction of, the Cayman Islands. No stamp duty\nis payable in the Cayman Islands on transfers of shares of Cayman Islands companies except those which hold interests\nin land in the Cayman Islands. The Cayman Islands is a party to a double tax treaty entered with the United Kingdom\nin 2010 but is otherwise not party to any double tax treaties that are applicable to any payments made to or by our\ncompany. There are no exchange control regulations or currency restrictions in the Cayman Islands.\nPeople’s Republic of China Taxation\nUnder the PRC Enterprise Income Tax Law and its implementation rules, an enterprise established outside of the PRC\nwith “de facto management body” within the PRC is considered a resident enterprise. The implementation rules define\nthe term “de facto management body” as the body that exercises full and substantial control and overall management\nover the business, productions, personnel, accounts and properties of an enterprise. In April 2009, the SAT issued the\nSAT Circular 82, which provides certain specific criteria for determining whether the “de facto management body” of\na PRC-controlled enterprise that is incorporated offshore is located in China. Although this circular only applies to\noffshore enterprises controlled by PRC enterprises or PRC enterprise groups, not those controlled by PRC individuals\nor foreigners, the criteria set forth in the circular may reflect the SAT’s general position on how the “de facto\nmanagement body” text should be applied in determining the tax resident status of all offshore enterprises. According\nto SAT Circular 82, an offshore incorporated enterprise controlled by a PRC enterprise or a PRC enterprise group will\nbe regarded as a PRC tax resident by virtue of having its “de facto management body” in China only if all of the\nfollowing conditions are met: (i) the places where the senior management and senior management departments\nresponsible for the daily production, operation and management of the enterprise perform their duties are mainly\nlocated within the territory of the PRC; (ii) decisions relating to the enterprise’s financial matters (such as money\nborrowing, lending, financing and financial risk management) and human resource matters (such as appointment,\ndismissal and salary and wages) are made or are subject to approval by organizations or personnel in the PRC; (iii)\nthe enterprise’s primary assets, accounting books and records, company seals, and board and shareholder resolutions,\nare located or maintained in the PRC; and (iv) at least 50% of voting board members or senior executives habitually\nreside in the PRC. In addition, the SAT issued the Bulletin of the State Administration of Taxation on Printing and\nDistributing the Administrative Measures for Income Tax on Chinese-controlled Resident Enterprises Incorporated\nOverseas (Trial Implementation) in 2011, providing more guidance on the implementation of SAT Circular 82. This\nbulletin clarifies matters including resident status determination, post determination administration, and competent\ntax authorities. In January 2014, the SAT issued the SAT Bulletin 9. According to SAT Bulletin 9, a Chinese-controlled\noffshore incorporated enterprise that satisfies the conditions prescribed under the SAT Circular 82 for being recognized\nas a PRC tax resident must apply for being recognized as a PRC tax resident to the competent tax authority at the place\nof registration of its main investor within the territory of China.\n94\nWe believe that Bon Natural Life Limited is not a PRC resident enterprise for PRC tax purposes. Bon Natural Life\nLimited is not controlled by a PRC enterprise or PRC enterprise group and we do not believe that Bon Natural Life\nLimited meets all of the conditions above. Bon Natural Life Limited is a company incorporated outside the PRC. As\na holding company, its key assets are its ownership interests in its subsidiaries, and its key assets are located, and its\nrecords (including the resolutions of its board of directors and the resolutions of its shareholders) are maintained,\noutside the PRC. However, the tax resident status of an enterprise is subject to determination by the PRC tax authorities\nand uncertainties remain with respect to the interpretation of the term “de facto management body.”\nIf the PRC tax authorities determine that Bon Natural Life Limited is a PRC resident enterprise for enterprise income\ntax purposes, we would be subject to 25% enterprise income tax on its worldwide income. Furthermore, we may be\nrequired to withhold a 10% withholding tax from dividends we pay to our shareholders that are non-resident\nenterprises, including the holders of our Shares. In addition, non-resident enterprise shareholders may be subject to a\n10% PRC tax on gains realized on the sale or other disposition of ordinary shares, if such income is treated as sourced\nfrom within the PRC. Furthermore, if we are deemed a PRC resident enterprise, dividends payable to our non- resident\nindividual shareholders and any gain realized on the transfer of ordinary shares by such shareholders may be subject\nto PRC tax at a rate of 20% unless a reduced rate is available under an applicable tax treaty. It is also unclear whether\nnon- resident shareholders of Bon Natural Life Limited would be able to claim the benefits of any tax treaties between\ntheir country of tax residence and the PRC in the event that Bon Natural Life Limited is treated as a PRC resident\nenterprise.\nOn February 3, 2015, the SAT issued the SAT Bulletin 7, which came into effect on February 3, 2015, but will also\napply to cases where their PRC tax treatments are not yet concluded. Pursuant to SAT Bulletin 7, an ‘‘indirect transfer’’\nof PRC assets, including a transfer of equity interests in an unlisted non-PRC holding company of a PRC resident\nenterprise, by non-PRC resident enterprises may be re-characterized and treated as a direct transfer of the underlying\nPRC assets, if such arrangement does not have a reasonable commercial purpose and was established for the purpose\nof avoiding payment of PRC enterprise income tax. As a result, gains derived from such indirect transfer may be\nsubject to PRC enterprise income tax, and the transferee or other person who is obligated to pay for the transfer is\nobligated to withhold the applicable taxes, currently at a rate of 10% for the transfer of equity interests in a PRC\nresident enterprise.\nOn October 17, 2017, the SAT issued the SAT Bulletin 37, which came into effect on December 1, 2017. The SAT\nBulletin 37 further clarifies the practice and procedure of the withholding of non-resident enterprise income tax.\nWhere a non-resident enterprise transfers taxable assets in China indirectly by disposing of the equity interests of an\noverseas holding company, which is an Indirect Transfer, the non-resident enterprise as either transferor or transferee,\nor the PRC entity whose equity is transferred, may report such Indirect Transfer to the relevant tax authority. Using a\n“substance over form” principle, the PRC tax authority may disregard the existence of the overseas holding company\nif it lacks a reasonable commercial purpose and was established for the purpose of reducing, avoiding or deferring\nPRC tax. As a result, gains derived from such Indirect Transfer may be subject to PRC enterprise income tax, and the\ntransferee or other person who is obligated to pay for the transfer is obligated to withhold the applicable taxes, currently\nat a rate of 10% for the transfer of equity interests in a PRC resident enterprise. Both the transferor and the transferee\nmay be subject to penalties under PRC tax laws if the transferee fails to withhold the taxes and the transferor fails to\npay the taxes. Our company may be subject to filing obligations or taxed if our company is transferor in such\ntransactions, and we may be subject to withholding obligations if our company is transferee in such transactions, under\nSAT Bulletin 7 and SAT Bulletin 37. For transfer of shares in our company by investors who are non-PRC resident\nenterprises, our PRC subsidiaries may be requested to assist in the filing under SAT Bulletin 7 and SAT Bulletin 37.\nAs a result, we may be required to expend valuable resources to comply with SAT Bulletin 7 and SAT Bulletin 37 or\nto request the relevant transferors from whom we purchase taxable assets to comply with these circulars, or to establish\nthat our company should not be taxed under these circulars, which may have a material adverse effect on our financial\ncondition and results of operations.\n95\nUnited States Federal Income Tax Considerations\nThe following discussion is a summary of U.S. federal income tax considerations generally applicable to the ownership\nand disposition of our ordinary shares by a U.S. Holder (as defined below) that acquires and holds our Shares as\n“capital assets” (generally, property held for investment) under the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended,\nor the Code. This discussion is based upon existing U.S. federal tax law, which is subject to differing interpretations\nor change, possibly with retroactive effect. No ruling has been sought from the Internal Revenue Service, the IRS,\nwith respect to any U.S. federal income tax consequences described below, and there can be no assurance that the IRS\nor a court will not take a contrary position. This discussion, moreover, does not address the U.S. federal estate, gift,\nMedicare, and alternative minimum tax considerations, or any state, local and non-U.S. tax considerations, relating to\nthe ownership or disposition of our ordinary shares. The following summary does not address all aspects of U.S.\nfederal income taxation that may be important to particular investors in light of their individual circumstances or to\npersons in special tax situations such as:\n● banks and other financial institutions;\n● insurance companies;\n● pension plans;\n● cooperatives;\n● regulated investment companies;\n● real estate investment trusts;\n● broker-dealers;\n● traders in securities that elect to use a mark-to-market method of accounting;\n● certain former U.S. citizens or long-term residents;\n● tax-exempt entities (including private foundations);\n● persons liable for alternative minimum tax;\n● holders who acquire their ordinary shares pursuant to any employee share option or otherwise as\ncompensation;\n● investors that will hold their ordinary shares as part of a straddle, hedge, conversion, constructive sale or\nother integrated transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes;\n● investors that have a functional currency other than the U.S. dollar;\n● persons that actually or constructively own 10% or more of the total combined voting power of all classes of\nour voting stock; or\n● partnerships or other entities taxable as partnerships for U.S. federal income tax purposes, or persons holding\nordinary shares through such entities.\nall of whom may be subject to tax rules that differ significantly from those discussed below.\nEach U.S. Holder is urged to consult its tax advisor regarding the application of U.S. federal tax law to its particular\ncircumstances, and the state, local, non-U.S. and other tax considerations of the ownership and disposition of our\nordinary shares.\nGeneral\nFor purposes of this discussion, a “U.S. Holder” is a beneficial owner of our ordinary shares that is, for U.S. federal\nincome tax purposes:\n● an individual who is a citizen or resident of the United States;\n96\n● a corporation (or other entity treated as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes) created in, or\norganized under the law of the United States or any state thereof or the District of Columbia;\n● an estate the income of which is includible in gross income for U.S. federal income tax purposes regardless\nof its source; or\n● a trust (A) the administration of which is subject to the primary supervision of a U.S. court and which has\none or more U.S. persons who have the authority to control all substantial decisions of the trust or (B) that\nhas otherwise validly elected to be treated as a U.S. person under the Code.\nIf a partnership (or other entity treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes) is a beneficial owner of\nour ordinary shares, the tax treatment of a partner in the partnership will generally depend upon the status of the partner\nand the activities of the partnership. Partnerships holding our ordinary shares and their partners are urged to consult\ntheir tax advisors regarding an investment in our ordinary shares.\nPassive Foreign Investment Company Considerations\nA non-U.S. corporation, such as our company, will be classified as a PFIC, for U.S. federal income tax purposes for\nany taxable year, if either (i) 75% or more of its gross income for such year consists of certain types of “passive”\nincome or (ii) 50% or more of the value of its assets (determined on the basis of a quarterly average) during such year\nis attributable to assets that produce or are held for the production of passive income. For this purpose, cash and assets\nreadily convertible into cash are categorized as a passive asset and the company’s goodwill and other unbooked\nintangibles are taken into account. Passive income generally includes, among other things, dividends, interest, rents,\nroyalties, and gains from the disposition of passive assets. We will be treated as owning a proportionate share of the\nassets and earning a proportionate share of the income of any other corporation in which we own, directly or indirectly,\nmore than 25% (by value) of the stock.\nAlthough the law in this regard is not entirely clear, we treat our consolidated subsidiary as being owned by us for\nU.S. federal income tax purposes because we control its management decisions and are entitled to substantially all of\nthe economic benefits associated with this entity. As a result, we consolidate its results of operations in our\nconsolidated U.S. GAAP financial statements. If it were determined, however, that we are not the owner of the\nconsolidated subsidiary for U.S. federal income tax purposes, we would likely be treated as a PFIC for the current\ntaxable year and any subsequent taxable year.\nAssuming that we are the owner of the subsidiary for U.S. federal income tax purposes, and based upon our current\nand projected income and assets, and projections as to the value of our assets, based in part on the market value of our\nShares, we do not expect to be a PFIC for the current taxable year or the foreseeable future. While we do not anticipate\nbeing or becoming a PFIC in the current or foreseeable taxable years, no assurance can be given in this regard because\nthe determination of whether we will be or become a PFIC is a factual determination made annually that will depend,\nin part, upon the composition of our income and assets. Fluctuations in the market price of our Shares may cause us\nto be classified as a PFIC for the current or future taxable years because the value of our assets for purposes of the\nasset test, including the value of our goodwill and unbooked intangibles, may be determined by reference to the market\nprice of our Shares from time to time (which may be volatile). In estimating the value of our goodwill and other\nunbooked intangibles, we have taken into account the cash proceeds and our market capitalization following our initial\npublic offering. If our market capitalization subsequently declines, we may be or become classified as a PFIC for the\ncurrent taxable year or future taxable years. Under circumstances where our revenue from activities that produce\npassive income significantly increase relative to our revenue from activities that produce non-passive income, or where\nwe determine not to deploy significant amounts of cash for active purposes, our risk of becoming classified as a PFIC\nmay substantially increase.\nIf we are classified as a PFIC for any year during which a U.S. Holder holds our ordinary shares, the PFIC rules\ndiscussed below under “Passive Foreign Investment Company Rules” generally will apply to such U.S. Holder for\nsuch taxable year, and unless the U.S. Holder makes certain elections, will apply in future years even if we cease to\nbe a PFIC.\nThe discussion below under “Dividends” and “Sale or Other Disposition” is written on the basis that we will not be\nor become classified as a PFIC for U.S. federal income tax purposes. The U.S. federal income tax rules that apply\ngenerally if we are treated as a PFIC are discussed below under “Passive Foreign Investment Company Rules.”\n97\nDividends\nSubject to the discussion below under “Passive Foreign Investment Company Rules,” any cash distributions (including\nthe amount of any PRC tax withheld) paid on our ordinary shares out of our current or accumulated earnings and\nprofits, as determined under U.S. federal income tax principles, will generally be includible in the gross income of a\nU.S. Holder as dividend income on the day actually or constructively received by the U.S. Holder. Because we do not\nintend to determine our earnings and profits on the basis of U.S. federal income tax principles, any distribution we\npay will generally be treated as a “dividend” for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Dividends received on our ordinary\nshares will not be eligible for the dividends received deduction allowed to corporations. A non-corporate U.S. Holder\nwill be subject to tax at the lower capital gain tax rate applicable to “qualified dividend income,” provided that certain\nconditions are satisfied, including that (1) our Shares are readily tradeable on an established securities market in the\nUnited States, or, in the event that we are deemed to be a PRC resident enterprise under the PRC tax law, we are\neligible for the benefit of the United States-PRC income tax treaty, (2) we are neither a PFIC nor treated as such with\nrespect to a U.S. Holder (as discussed below) for the taxable year in which the dividend was paid and the preceding\ntaxable year, and (3) certain holding period requirements are met. We expect our Shares will be readily tradeable on\nan established securities market in the United States. There can be no assurance, however, that our Shares will be\nconsidered readily tradeable on an established securities market in later years.\nIn the event that we are deemed to be a PRC resident enterprise under the PRC Enterprise Income Tax Law, a U.S.\nHolder may be subject to PRC withholding taxes on dividends paid on our ordinary shares. We may, however, be\neligible for the benefits of the United States-PRC income tax treaty. If we are eligible for such benefits, dividends we\npay on our ordinary shares would be eligible for the reduced rates of taxation described in the preceding paragraph.\nDividends will generally be treated as income from foreign sources for U.S. foreign tax credit purposes and will\ngenerally constitute passive category income. Depending on the U.S. Holder’s individual facts and circumstances, a\nU.S. Holder may be eligible, subject to a number of complex limitations, to claim a foreign tax credit in respect of any\nforeign withholding taxes imposed on dividends received on our ordinary shares. A U.S. Holder who does not elect\nto claim a foreign tax credit for foreign tax withheld may instead claim a deduction, for U.S. federal income tax\npurposes, in respect of such withholding, but only for a year in which such holder elects to do so for all creditable\nforeign income taxes. The rules governing the foreign tax credit are complex and their outcome depends in large part\non the U.S. Holder’s individual facts and circumstances. Accordingly, U.S. Holders are urged to consult their tax\nadvisors regarding the availability of the foreign tax credit under their particular circumstances.\nSale or Other Disposition\nSubject to the discussion below under “Passive Foreign Investment Company Rules,” a U.S. Holder will generally\nrecognize capital gain or loss upon the sale or other disposition of ordinary shares in an amount equal to the difference\nbetween the amount realized upon the disposition and the holder’s adjusted tax basis in such ordinary shares. Any\ncapital gain or loss will be long-term if the ordinary shares have been held for more than one year and will generally\nbe U.S.-source gain or loss for U.S. foreign tax credit purposes. In the event that gain from the disposition of the\nordinary shares is subject to tax in the PRC, such gain may be treated as PRC source gain under the United States-\nPRC income tax treaty. The deductibility of a capital loss may be subject to limitations. U.S. Holders are urged to\nconsult their tax advisors regarding the tax consequences if a foreign tax is imposed on a disposition of our ordinary\nshares, including the availability of the foreign tax credit under their particular circumstances.\nPassive Foreign Investment Company Rules\nIf we are classified as a PFIC for any taxable year during which a U.S. Holder holds our ordinary shares, and unless\nthe U.S. Holder makes a mark-to-market election (as described below), the U.S. Holder will generally be subject to\nspecial tax rules on (i) any excess distribution that we make to the U.S. Holder (which generally means any distribution\npaid during a taxable year to a U.S. Holder that is greater than 125 percent of the average annual distributions paid in\nthe three preceding taxable years or, if shorter, the U.S. Holder’s holding period for the ordinary shares), and (ii) any\ngain realized on the sale or other disposition of ordinary shares. Under the PFIC rules:\n● the excess distribution or gain will be allocated ratably over the U.S. Holder’s holding period for the ordinary\nshares;\n98\n● the amount allocated to the current taxable year and any taxable years in the U.S. Holder’s holding period\nprior to the first taxable year in which we are classified as a PFIC (each, a “pre-PFIC year”), will be taxable\nas ordinary income;\n● the amount allocated to each prior taxable year, other than a pre-PFIC year, will be subject to tax at the\nhighest tax rate in effect for individuals or corporations, as appropriate, for that year; and\n● the interest charge generally applicable to underpayments of tax will be imposed on the tax attributable to\neach prior taxable year, other than a pre-PFIC year.\nIf we are a PFIC for any taxable year during which a U.S. Holder holds our ordinary shares and any of our subsidiaries\nis also a PFIC, such U.S. Holder would be treated as owning a proportionate amount (by value) of the shares of the\nlower-tier PFIC for purposes of the application of these rules. U.S. Holders are urged to consult their tax advisors\nregarding the application of the PFIC rules to any of our subsidiaries.\nAs an alternative to the foregoing rules, a U.S. Holder of “marketable stock” in a PFIC may make a mark-to-market\nelection with respect to such stock, provided that such stock is regularly traded. For those purposes, our ordinary\nshares are treated as marketable stock due to their listing on the Nasdaq Capital Market. We anticipate that our Shares\nshould qualify as being regularly traded, but no assurances may be given in this regard. If a U.S. Holder makes this\nelection, the holder will generally (i) include as ordinary income for each taxable year that we are a PFIC the excess,\nif any, of the fair market value of Shares held at the end of the taxable year over the adjusted tax basis of such Shares\nand (ii) deduct as an ordinary loss the excess, if any, of the adjusted tax basis of the Shares over the fair market value\nof such Shares held at the end of the taxable year, but such deduction will only be allowed to the extent of the amount\npreviously included in income as a result of the mark-to-market election. The U.S. Holder’s adjusted tax basis in the\nShares would be adjusted to reflect any income or loss resulting from the mark-to-market election. If a U.S. Holder\nmakes a mark-to-market election in respect of a corporation classified as a PFIC and such corporation ceases to be\nclassified as a PFIC, the holder will not be required to take into account the gain or loss described above during any\nperiod that such corporation is not classified as a PFIC. If a U.S. Holder makes a mark-to-market election, any gain\nsuch U.S. Holder recognizes upon the sale or other disposition of our Shares in a year when we are a PFIC will be\ntreated as ordinary income and any loss will be treated as ordinary loss, but such loss will only be treated as ordinary\nloss to the extent of the net amount previously included in income as a result of the mark-to-market election.\nBecause a mark-to-market election cannot be made for any lower-tier PFICs that we may own, a U.S. Holder may\ncontinue to be subject to the PFIC rules with respect to such U.S. Holder’s indirect interest in any investments held\nby us that are treated as an equity interest in a PFIC for U.S. federal income tax purposes.\nWe do not intend to provide information necessary for U.S. Holders to make qualified electing fund elections which,\nif available, would result in tax treatment different from (and generally less adverse than) the general tax treatment for\nPFICs described above.\nIf a U.S. Holder owns our ordinary shares during any taxable year that we are a PFIC, the holder must generally file\nan annual IRS Form 8621. You should consult your tax advisors regarding the U.S. federal income tax consequences\nof owning and disposing of our ordinary shares if we are or become a PFIC.\nInformation Reporting\nCertain U.S. Holders may be required to report information to the IRS with respect to the beneficial ownership of our\nordinary shares. These rules also impose penalties if a U.S. Holder is required to submit such information to the IRS\nand fails to do so.\nIn addition, U.S. Holders may be subject to information reporting to the IRS with respect to dividends on and proceeds\nfrom the sale or other disposition of our ordinary shares. Each U.S. Holder is advised to consult with its tax advisor\nregarding the application of the U.S. information reporting rules to their particular circumstances.\n99\nF.

Subsidiary Information\nPlease see Item 4.a, Information on the Company – History and Development of the Company, above.\nITEM 11. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nForeign Exchange Risk\nForeign currency risk arises from future commercial transactions, recognized assets and liabilities and net investments\nin foreign operations. Substantially all of our revenue-generating transactions, and a majority of our expense-related\ntransactions, are denominated in Renminbi, which is the functional currency of our operations. We do not hedge\nagainst currency risk.\nThe value of the Renminbi against the U.S. dollar and other currencies may fluctuate and is affected by, among other\nthings, changes in political and economic conditions. To the extent that we need to convert U.S. dollars into Renminbi\nfor our operations, appreciation of the Renminbi against the U.S. dollar would reduce the Renminbi amount we receive\nfrom the conversion. Conversely, if we decide to convert Renminbi into U.S. dollars for the purpose of making\npayments for dividends on our ordinary shares, servicing outstanding debts, or for other business purposes,\nappreciation of the U.S. dollar against the Renminbi would reduce the U.S. dollar amounts available to us.\nOur functional currency is the RMB, and our financial statements are presented in U.S. dollars. The RMB appreciated\nby 5.1% for the year ended September 30, 2021, and depreciated by 10.2% for the year ended September 30, 2022. It\nis difficult to predict how market forces or PRC or U.S. government policy may impact the exchange rate between the\nRMB and the U.S. dollar in the future. The change in the value of the RMB relative to the U.S. dollar may affect our\nfinancial results reported in the U.S. dollar terms without giving effect to any underlying changes in our business or\nresults of operations. Currently, our assets, liabilities, revenues and costs are denominated in RMB.\n100\nInterest Rate Risk\nWe are not currently exposed to interest rate risk. We do not own any interest-bearing instruments and our interest-\nbearing debt carries a fixed rate.\nMarket Price Risk\nWe are not currently exposed to commodity price risk or market price risk.\nInflation\nInflation does not materially affect our business or the results of our operations.\nSeasonality\nSeasonality does not materially affect our business or the results of our operations.\nITEM 12. DESCRIPTION OF SECURITIES OTHER THAN EQUITY SECURITIES\nA. Debt Securities\nNot applicable.\nB. Warrants and Rights\nAs of the date of this Report, we had the following warrants and options outstanding:\n● Options issued to our independent directors as follows:\n○ Options to purchase 22,000 ordinary shares at a price of $0.01 per share, exercisable until June 23,\n2031\n○ Options to purchase 29,600 ordinary shares at a price of $0.01 per share, exercisable until July 1,\n2032.\n○ Options to purchase 22,508 ordinary shares at a price of $0.01 per share, exercisable until June 27,\n2032\n● Warrants to purchase 2,750,000 ordinary shares at a price of $0.88 per share, exercisable until January 17,\n2025\nC.

MATERIAL MODIFICATIONS TO THE RIGHTS OF SECURITY HOLDERS AND USE OF\nPROCEEDS\nNone.\n101\nITEM 15. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES\nA. Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nOur management has not completed an assessment of the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting,\nand our independent registered public accounting firm has not conducted an audit of our internal control over financial\nreporting. In the course of auditing our consolidated financial statements for the year ended September 30, 2022, we\nidentified several material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting and other control deficiencies\nas of September 30, 2022. A “material weakness” is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control\nover financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the company’s\nannual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.\nThe material weaknesses identified to date relate to a lack of accounting staff and resources with appropriate\nknowledge of generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (“U.S. GAAP”) and SEC reporting and\ncompliance requirements.\nAs a result of the above material weaknesses, management has concluded that our internal control over financial\nreporting was ineffective as of September 30, 2022.\nFollowing the identification of the material weaknesses and control deficiencies, we have taken remedial measures\nincluding (i) hiring more qualified accounting personnel with relevant U.S. GAAP and SEC reporting experience and\nqualifications to strengthen the financial reporting function and to set up a financial and system control framework;\n(ii) implementing regular and continuous U.S. GAAP accounting and financial reporting training programs for our\naccounting and financial reporting personnel; and (iii) setting up an internal audit function as well as engaging an\nexternal consulting firm to assist us with assessment of Sarbanes-Oxley compliance requirements and improvement\nof overall internal control.\nAs of the date of this report, we have not fully addressed the above-referenced weaknesses. However, we have made\nprogress in implementing remedial measures, specifically:\n● We have hired two additional mid-level financial staff in late 2020, one of whom has been staffed in\nfinancial reporting unit and the other in internal control department. In addition, we have identified three potential\ncandidates with U.S. Certified Public Accountant qualifications and related experience and skills for senior financial\nroles. We expect to hire at least one candidate prior to March 31, 2022. In the interim, we will continue using an\nexternal consultant to assist us in financial reporting.\n● Since September 30, 2020, the management team, including our chief executive officer, Mr. Yongwei Hu,\nour chief financial officer, Mr. Zhenchao Li, and other management team members of our PRC subsidiary and its\nsubsidiaries in the PRC have held internal meetings, discussions, trainings, and seminars on a monthly basis to review\nour financial statements and operational performance and to identify areas to improve our internal control procedures.\n● We have appointed directors and established an audit committee;\n● In April 2021, we engaged Grant Thornton (Special General Partnership), Xiamen Branch to assist us in\nsetting-up our financial and system control framework. Grant Thornton has completed the evaluation of the\neffectiveness of our existing financial and system control and formulated an implementation plan with expanded and\nenhanced control and procedures. We expect to fully complete the setup of our financial and system control framework\nby June 30, 2023.\nWe plan to fully implement the above-referenced measures prior to December 31, 2023.\nB. Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nThis annual report on Form 20-F does not include a report of management’s assessment regarding internal control\nover financial reporting due to a transition period established by rules of the SEC for newly public companies.\nC. Attestation Report of the Registered Public Accounting Firm\nBecause the Company is a non-accelerated filer, this annual report does not include an attestation report of our\nregistered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting. Management’s report was not\nsubject to attestation by our registered public accounting firm pursuant to rules of the SEC where domestic and foreign\nregistrants that are non-accelerated filers, which we are, and “emerging growth companies,” which we also are, are\nnot required to provide the auditor attestation report.\n102\nD. Changes in Internal Controls over Financial Reporting\nOther than as described above, there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in\nRule 13a-15(f) of the Exchange Act) that occurred during the year ended September 30, 2022 that have materially\naffected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal controls over financial reporting.\nITEM 16A. AUDIT COMMITTEE FINANCIAL EXPERT\nThe audit committee of our board of directors currently consists of three members, Jeffrey J. Guzy, James E. Burns,\nand Lawrence W. Leighton. Our board of directors has determined that all of our audit committee members are\n“independent” under the Exchange Act and have the requisite financial knowledge and experience to serve as members\nof our audit committee. In addition, our board of directors has determined that Jeffrey J. Guzy is an “audit committee\nfinancial expert” as defined in Item 16A of the Instructions to Form 20-F and meets NASDAQ’s financial\nsophistication requirements due to his current and past experience in various companies in which he was responsible\nfor, amongst others, the financial oversight responsibilities.\nITEM 16B. CODE OF ETHICS\nWe have adopted a Code of Business Conduct and Ethics (the “Code of Ethics”) that applies to all of the directors,\nofficers and employees of the Company and its subsidiaries, including our principal executive officer, principal\nfinancial officer and principal accounting officer. The Code of Ethics addresses, among other things, honesty and\nethical conduct, conflicts of interest, compliance with laws, regulations and policies, including disclosure requirements\nunder the federal securities laws, confidentiality, trading on inside information, and reporting of violations of the code.\nA copy of the Code of Ethics is filed as Exhibit 14.1 to our amended registration statement on Form F-1 filed on May\n14, 2021. During the fiscal year ended September 30, 2021, there were no waivers of our Code of Ethics.\nITEM 16C. PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTANT FEES AND SERVICES\nThe following table sets forth the aggregate fees by categories specified below in connection with services rendered\nby our principal external auditors for the periods indicated.\nFiscal Year Ended\nSeptember 30,\n2022 2021\nAudit Fees* $ 300,000 $ 275,000\n* “Audit Fees” consisted of the aggregate fees billed for professional services rendered for the audit of our annual\nfinancial statements or services that are normally provided by the accountant in connection with statutory and\nregulatory filings or engagements.\nOur Audit Committee pre-approves all auditing services and permitted non-audit services to be performed for us by\nour independent auditor, including the fees and terms thereof (subject to the de minimums exceptions for non-audit\nservices described in Section 10A(i)(l)(B) of the Exchange Act that are approved by our Audit Committee prior to the\ncompletion of the audit).\nITEM 16D. EXEMPTIONS FROM THE LISTING STANDARDS FOR AUDIT COMMITTEES\nNot applicable\nITEM 16E.

(“App-Chem\nHealth”) was incorporated on April 17, 2006 in Tongchuan City in accordance with PRC laws; (2), Shaanxi App-\nChem Ag-tech Co., Ltd (“App-Chem Ag-tech”) was incorporated on April 19, 2013 in Dali County, Shaanxi Province\nin accordance with PRC laws; (3) Xi’an Yanhuang TCM Medical Research & Development Co., Ltd (“Xi’an YH”)\nwas incorporated on September 15, 2009 in Xi’an City in accordance with PRC laws; (4) Balikun Tianmei Bio(Tech)\nCo., Ltd. (“Balikun”) was incorporated on December 16, 2016 in Balikun City in accordance with PRC laws; (5) App-\nChem Bio (Tech) (Guangzhou) Co., Ltd. (“App-Chem Guangzhou”) was incorporated on April 27, 2018 in\nGuangzhou City in accordance with PRC laws and (6) Tongchuan Dietary Therapy Health Technology Co., Ltd.\n(“Tongchuan DT”) was incorporated on May 22, 2017 in Tongchuan City in accordance with PRC laws.\nIn addition, Xi’an App-Chem also owns majority of the equity interest in the following two entities: Xi’an Dietary\nTherapy Medical Technology Co., Ltd (“Xi’an DT”) was incorporated on April 24, 2015 in accordance with PRC\nlaws, with 75% equity ownership interest owned by Xi’an App-Chem; Tianjin Yonghexiang Bio(Tech) Co., Ltd.\n(“Tianjin YHX”) was incorporated on September 16, 2019 in accordance with PRC laws, with 51% equity ownership\ninterest owned by Xi’an App-Chem. On March 11, 2020, Xi’an App-Chem established a new 100% controlled\nsubsidiary, Gansu Baimeikang Bioengineering Co., Ltd. (“Gansu BMK”).\nOn September 27, 2021, the Company disposed Balikun to a third party for RMB 1.00. As Balikun had no operating\nactivity and no material assets, the disposal of Balikun did not constitute discontinued operation.\nXi’an App-Chem, together with its subsidiaries are collectively referred to as the “Bon Operating Companies” below.\nReorganization\nA reorganization of our legal structure (“Reorganization”) was completed on May 28, 2020. The reorganization\ninvolved the incorporation of Bon Natural Life, Tea Essence and Xi’an CMIT, and entering into certain contractual\narrangements between Xi’an CMIT, the shareholders of Bon Operating Companies and the Bon Operating Companies.\nConsequently, the Company became the ultimate holding company of Tea Essence, Xi’an CMIT and Bon Operating\nCompanies.\nF-8\nBON NATURAL LIFE LIMITED AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nNOTE 1 – ORGANIZATION AND BUSINESS DESCRIPTION (continued)\nOn May 28, 2020, Xi’an CMIT entered into a series of contractual arrangements with the shareholders of the Bon\nOperating Companies. These agreements include, Exclusive Service Agreement, Share Pledge Agreement, Proxy\nAgreement, Exclusive Option Agreement, Powers of Attorney, Spousal Consent Letter, and Loan Agreement intended\nto guarantee the exercise of the Exclusive Option Agreements and Spouse Consents (collectively the “VIE\nAgreements”). Pursuant to the VIE Agreements, Xi’an CMIT has the exclusive right to provide to the Bon Operating\nCompanies consulting services related to business operations including technical and management consulting services.\nThe VIE Agreements are designed to provide Xi’an CMIT with the power, rights, and obligations equivalent in all\nmaterial respects to those it would possess as the sole equity holder of each of the Bon Operating Companies, including\ncontrol rights and the rights to the assets, property, and revenue of each of the Bon Operating Companies. As a result\nof our direct ownership in Xi’an CMIT and the VIE Agreements, we believe that the Bon Operating Companies should\nbe treated as Variable Interest Entities (“VIEs”) under the Statement of Financial Accounting Standards Board\n(“FASB”) Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 810 Consolidation and we are regarded as the primary\nbeneficiary of our VIEs. We treat our VIEs as our consolidated entities under U.S. GAAP. The Company, together\nwith its wholly owned subsidiaries and its VIEs, is effectively controlled by the same shareholders before and after\nthe Reorganization and therefore the Reorganization is considered as a recapitalization of entities under common\ncontrol. The consolidation of the Company, its subsidiaries, and its VIEs has been accounted for at historical cost and\nprepared on the basis as if the aforementioned transactions had become effective as of the beginning of the first period\npresented in the accompanying consolidated financial statements. Upon the completion of the Reorganization, the\nCompany has subsidiaries in countries and jurisdictions in the PRC and Hong Kong.\nOn September 8, 2021, Xi’an Youpincui Biotechnology Co., Ltd (“Xi’an Youpincui”) was formed as a Wholly\nForeign-Owned Enterprise (“WFOE”) in the PRC. Tea Essence owns 100% equity interest in Xi’an Youpincui. Xi’an\nYoupincui currently is not engaging in any active business operations and merely acting as an investment holding\ncompany.\nOn June 28, 2021, the Company closed its initial public offering (“IPO”) of 2,200,000 ordinary shares, par value\nUS$0.0001 per share at a public offering price of $5.00 per share, and the Company’s ordinary shares started to trade\non the Nasdaq Capital Market under the ticker symbol “BON” since June 24, 2021. On July 2, 2021, the underwriters\nexercised its over-allotment option to purchase an additional 330,000 shares, par value US$0.0001 per share at the\nprice of $5.00 per share. Gross proceeds of the Company’s IPO, including the proceeds from the sale of the over-\nallotment shares, totalled $12.65 million, before deducting underwriting discounts and other related expenses,\nresulting in net proceeds of approximately $11.3 million.\nTerminating the VIE agreements for corporate restructuring\nDue to PRC legal restrictions on foreign ownership in companies that engage in online sales China, the Company\noriginally carried out its business through Xi’an App-Chem, a domestic PRC company holding a value-added\ntelecommunications license, through a variable interest entity structure, because foreign investment in the value-added\ntelecommunication services industry in China is extensively regulated and subject to numerous restrictions. However,\nthe Company’s online sales have historically generated minimal revenues. On September 28, 2021, the Company’s\nBoard of Directors approved a restructuring of the Company’s corporate structure to terminate the original VIE\ncontractual agreements, to convert Xi’an App-Chem from a PRC domestic company into a Sino-foreign joint venture,\nand to transfer 100% of the ownership interests in Xi’an App-Chem from its original shareholders to Xi’an CMIT and\nXi’an Youpincui. Effective November 1, 2021, the Company completed the reorganization of its corporate structure\nin the PRC and are the indirect sole shareholder of Xi’an App-Chem. Xi’an App-Chem is wholly-owned by two\nWOFEs Xi’an CMIT and Xi’an Youpincui. Each of the WOFEs are in turn wholly-owned by Tea Essence, the\nCompany’s direct wholly-owned subsidiary in Hong Kong. The termination of the VIE agreements as described above\ndoes not adversely affect the Company’s business, financial condition, and results of operations because the Company,\ntogether with its wholly owned subsidiaries, are effectively controlled by the same shareholders before and after the\nrestructuring. The restructuring is therefore considered to be a recapitalization of entities under common control.\nFollowing the corporate restructuring, the value-added telecommunication license held by Xi’an App-Chem has been\nrevoked.\nF-9\nBON NATURAL LIFE LIMITED AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nNOTE 1 – ORGANIZATION AND BUSINESS DESCRIPTION (continued)\nDetails of the subsidiaries of the Company as of September 30, 2022 were set out below:\nDate of Place of\nName of Entity Incorporation Incorporation % of Ownership Principal Activities\nBon Natural Life December 11, Cayman Islands Parent, 100% Investment holding\n2019\nTea Essence January 9, 2020 Hong Kong 100% Investment holding\nXi’an CMIT April 9, 2020 Xi.an City, PRC 100% WFOE, Investment\nholding\nXi’an Youpincui September 8, Xi.an City, PRC 100% WFOE, Investment\n2021 holding\nPRC Subsidiaries:\nXi’an App- Chem Bio April 23, 2006 Xi’an City, PRC 100% owned by General administration\n(Tech) WFOEs and sales of the\nCompany’s products to\ncustomers\nBon Operating Companies (owned by Xi’an\nApp-Chem)\nApp-Chem Health April 17, 2006 Tongchuan City, 100% owned by Registered owner of\nPRC Xi’an App-Chem land with an area of\n12,904.5 square\nmeters, no other\nbusiness activities\nApp-Chem Ag-tech April 19, 2013 Dali County, PRC 100% owned by Product manufacturing\nXi’an App-Chem\nXi’an YH September 15, Xi.an City, PRC 100% owned by Research and\n2009 Xi’an App-Chem development of\nproduct\nApp-Chem Guangzhou April 27, 2018 Guangzhou City, 100% owned by Raw material purchase\nPRC Xi’an App-Chem\nTongchuan DT May 22, 2017 Tongchuan City, 100% owned by Product manufacturing\nPRC Xi’an App-Chem\nXi’an DT April 24, 2015 Xi’an City, PRC 75% owned by Research and\nXi’an App-Chem development of\nproduct\nTianjin YHX September 16, Tianjin City, PRC 51% owned by Raw material purchase\n2019 Xi’an App-Chem\nGansu BMK March 11, 2020 Jiuquan City, PRC 100% owned by Product manufacturing\nXi’an App-Chem\nNOTE 2 — SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nBasis of Presentation and Principles of Consolidation\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles\ngenerally accepted in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”) and pursuant to the rules and regulations of the\nSecurities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”). The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the\nfinancial statements of the Company, and its wholly owned subsidiaries. All inter-company balances and transactions\nare eliminated upon consolidation.\nNon-controlling interests\nNon-controlling interests represent minority shareholders’ 25% ownership interest in Xi’an DT and a minority\nshareholder’s 49% ownership interest in Tianjin YHX as of September 30, 2022 and 2021. The non-controlling\ninterests are presented in the consolidated balance sheets, separately from equity attributable to the shareholders of\nthe Company.

These estimates are based on\ninformation as of the date of the consolidated financial statements. Significant estimates required to be made by\nmanagement include, but are not limited to, the allowance for estimated uncollectible receivables, realizability of\nadvance to suppliers, inventory valuations, useful lives of property, plant and equipment, intangible assets, the\nrecoverability of long-lived assets, provision necessary for contingent liabilities, fair value of stock-based\ncompensation, revenue recognition and realization of deferred tax assets. The inputs into the Company’s judgments\nand estimates consider the economic implications of COVID-19 on the Company’s critical and significant accounting\nestimates. Actual results could differ from those estimates.\nRisks and Uncertainties\nThe main operation of the Company is located in the PRC. Accordingly, the Company’s business, financial condition,\nand results of operations may be influenced by political, economic, and legal environments in the PRC, as well as by\nthe general state of the PRC economy. The Company’s results may be adversely affected by changes in the political,\nregulatory and social conditions in the PRC. Although the Company has not experienced losses from these situations\nand believes that it is in compliance with existing laws and regulations including its organization and structure\ndisclosed in Note 1, this may not be indicative of future results.\nThe development and commercialization of natural and healthy extracts and compounds products is highly\ncompetitive, and the industry currently is characterized by rapidly changing technologies, significant competition and\na strong emphasis on intellectual property. The Company may face competition with respect to its current and future\npharmaceutical product candidates from major pharmaceutical companies in China.\nThe Company’s operations may be further affected by the ongoing outbreak of COVID-19 pandemic, A COVID-19\nresurgence could negatively affect the execution of customer contracts, the collection of customer payments, or\ndisruption of the Company’s supply chain. The continued uncertainties associated with COVID-19 may cause the\nCompany’s revenue and cash flows to underperform in the next 12 months. The extent of the future impact of COVID-\n19 is still highly uncertain and cannot be predicted as of the date the Company’s consolidated financial statements are\nreleased.\nCash and cash equivalents\nCash includes currency on hand and deposits held by banks that can be added or withdrawn without limitation. The\nCompany maintains most of its bank accounts in the PRC. Cash balances in bank accounts in PRC are not insured by\nthe Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or other programs.\nAccounts receivable, net\nThe Company determines the adequacy of reserves for doubtful accounts based on individual account analysis and\nhistorical collection trend. The Company establishes a provision for doubtful receivables when there is objective\nevidence that the Company may not be able to collect amounts due. The allowance is based on management’s best\nestimate of specific losses on individual exposures, as well as a provision on historical trends of collections. Actual\namounts received may differ from management’s estimate of credit worthiness and the economic environment.\nDelinquent account balances are written-off against the allowance for doubtful accounts after management has\ndetermined that the collection is not probable, Nil, $99,528 and Nil uncollectable account receivable was written-off\nduring the years ended September 30, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Allowance for uncollectable balances\namounted to $13,337 and $14,691 as of September 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\nF-11\nBON NATURAL LIFE LIMITED AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nNOTE 2 — SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)\nAdvances to Suppliers, net\nAdvances to suppliers consist of balances paid to suppliers for inventory raw materials and construction materials\nassociated with the Company’s construction-in-progress projects that have not been provided or received. Advances\nto suppliers are reviewed periodically to determine whether their carrying value has become impaired. The Company\nconsiders the assets to be impaired if the collectability of the advance becomes doubtful. The Company uses the aging\nmethod to estimate the allowance for unrealizable balances. In addition, at each reporting date, the Company generally\ndetermines the adequacy of allowance for doubtful accounts by evaluating all available information, and then records\nspecific allowances for those advances based on the specific facts and circumstances. As of September 30, 2022 and\n2021, no allowance for doubtful account was recorded.\nInventories, net\nInventories are stated at net realizable value using weighted average method. Costs include the cost of raw materials,\nfreight, direct labor and related production overhead. Any excess of the cost over the net realizable value of each item\nof inventories is recognized as a provision for diminution in the value of inventories. Net realizable value is the\nestimated selling price in the normal course of business less any costs to complete and sell products. The Company\nevaluates inventories on a quarterly basis for its net realizable value adjustments, and reduces the carrying value of\nthose inventories that are obsolete or in excess of the forecasted usage to their estimated net realizable value based on\nvarious factors including aging, expiration dates, as applicable, taking into consideration historical and expected future\nproduct sales. The Company recorded inventory reserve of $6,869 and $147,960 as of September 30, 2022 and 2021,\nrespectively.\nShort-term investments\nThe Company’s short-term investments consist of wealth management financial products purchased from PRC banks,\nwhich can be redeemed at any time. The banks invest the Company’s fund in certain financial instruments including\nmoney market funds, bonds or mutual funds, with floating interest rates. The carrying values of the Company’s short-\nterm investments approximate fair value because of their short-term maturities. The interest earned is recognized in\nthe consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income over the contractual term of these investments. As\nof September 30, 2022 and 2021, short-term investments consisted of the following:\nSeptember 30, September 30,\n2022 2021\nBeginning balance $ 1,703,314 $ -\nAdd: purchase wealth management financial products 5,097,816 2,159,920\nLess: proceeds received upon maturity of short-term investments (6,776,385 ) (470,082 )\nForeign currency translation adjustments (24,745 ) 13,476\nEnding balance of short-term investments $ - $ 1,703,314\nF-12\nBON NATURAL LIFE LIMITED AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nNOTE 2 — SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)\nInvestment income generated from short-term investments amounted to $20,343, $565 and Nil for the years ended\nSeptember 30, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The amount is included in other income in consolidated statements\nof income and comprehensive income.\nFair value of financial instruments\nFair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly\ntransaction between market participants at the measurement date. A three-level fair value hierarchy prioritizes the\ninputs used to measure fair value. The hierarchy requires entities to maximize the use of observable inputs and\nminimize the use of unobservable inputs. The three levels of inputs used to measure fair value are as follows:\n● Level 1 — inputs to the valuation methodology are quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities\nin active markets.\n● Level 2 — inputs to the valuation methodology include quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active\nmarkets, quoted market prices for identical or similar assets in markets that are not active, inputs other than\nquoted prices that are observable and inputs derived from or corroborated by observable market data.\n● Level 3 — inputs to the valuation methodology are unobservable.\nUnless otherwise disclosed, the fair value of the Company’s cash, short-term investment, accounts receivable,\ninventories, advance to suppliers, prepaid expenses and other current assets, accounts payable, short-term bank loans,\naccrued expenses and other current liabilities, taxes payable and due to related parties, approximate the fair value of\nthe respective assets and liabilities as of September 30, 2022 and 2021 based upon the short-term nature of the assets\nand liabilities.\nThe Company believes that the carrying amount of long-term loans approximates fair value at September 30, 2022\nand 2021 based on the terms of the borrowings and current market rates as the rates of the borrowings are reflective\nof the current market rates.\nProperty, plant and equipment, net\nProperty, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Depreciation and\namortization of property and equipment is provided using the straight-line method over their expected useful lives, as\nfollows:\nUseful life\nBuildings 20 years\nMachinery and equipment 5–10 years\nAutomobiles 8 years\nOffice and electric equipment 3–5 years\nExpenditures for maintenance and repairs, which do not materially extend the useful lives of the assets, are charged\nto expense as incurred. Expenditures for major renewals and betterments which substantially extend the useful life of\nassets are capitalized. The cost and related accumulated depreciation of assets retired or sold are removed from the\nrespective accounts, and any gain or loss is recognized in the consolidated statements of income and comprehensive\nincome in other income or expenses.\nConstruction-in-Progress (“CIP”)\nConstruction-in-progress represents property and buildings under construction and consists of construction\nexpenditures, equipment procurement, and other direct costs attributable to the construction. Construction-in-progress\nis not depreciated. Upon completion and ready for intended use, construction-in-progress is reclassified to the\nappropriate category within property, plant and equipment.\nF-13\nBON NATURAL LIFE LIMITED AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nNOTE 2 — SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)\nIntangible assets, net\nThe Company’s intangible assets primarily include two land use rights. A land use right in the PRC represents an\nexclusive right to occupy, use and develop a piece of land during the contractual term of the land use right. The cost\nof a land use right is usually paid in one lump sum at the date the right is granted. The prepayment usually covers the\nentire period of the land use right. The lump sum advance payment is capitalized and recorded as land use right and\nthen charged to expense on a straight-line basis over the period of the right, which is normally 50 years.\nThe Company acquired the first land use right of 4.1 acres located at Tongchuan City, Shaanxi Province of China at\ncost of approximately $0.2 million in 2011. The Company is now constructing a new manufacturing plant on this land\nand the construction of Tongchuan CIP Project was completed and put into production in December 2022. On May\n10, 2021, the Company acquired another land use right of 8.2 acres at cost of approximately $0.3 million, through a\ngovernment organized auction bidding in Yumen City, Gansu Province of China. The Company is now constructing\na new manufacturing plant on this land and the construction of Yumen CIP Project is expected to be completed by\nMay 2023 (see Note 8).\nImpairment of long-lived Assets\nLong-lived assets, such as property, plant and equipment, land use rights and long-term investment, are reviewed for\nimpairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of such assets may not be\nrecoverable. Recoverability of a long-lived asset or asset group to be held and used is measured by a comparison of\nthe carrying amount of an asset or asset group to the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated\nby the asset or asset group. If the carrying value of an asset or asset group exceeds its estimated undiscounted future\ncash flows, an impairment charge is recognized by the amount that the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value\nof the asset or asset group. Fair value is determined through various valuation techniques including discounted cash\nflow models, quoted market values and third-party independent appraisals, as considered necessary. Assets to be\ndisposed are reported at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell, and are no longer depreciated. No\nimpairment of long-lived assets was recognized as of September 30, 2022 and 2021.\nLeases\nASC 842 requires that lessees recognize ROU assets and lease liabilities calculated based on the present value of lease\npayments for all lease agreements with terms that are greater than twelve months. ASC 842 distinguishes leases as\neither a finance lease or an operating lease that affects how the leases are measured and presented in the statement of\noperations and statement of cash flows.\nFor operating leases, the Company calculated ROU assets and lease liabilities based on the present value of the\nremaining lease payments as of the date of adoption. There were no changes in the Company’s capital lease portfolio,\nwhich are now titled “finance leases” under ASC 842.\nUpon the adoption of the new guidance on October 1, 2020, the Company recognized operating lease right of use\nassets and operating lease liabilities of approximately $0.2 million. The remaining balance of lease liabilities are\npresented within current portion of operating lease liabilities and the non-current portion of operating lease liabilities\non the consolidated balance sheets (see Note 14).\nOn December 25, 2020, the Company’s subsidiary, Xi’an App-Chem (the “Lessee”) entered into a sale and leaseback\nagreement with Taizhongyin Finance Lease (Suzhou) Ltd. (“the Lessor”) and sold part of its plant machines with\ncarrying value of RMB 2 million (approximately $0.3 million) to the lessor and then leases them back from the lessor\nwithin two years. Pursuant to the terms of the contract, the Company is required to pay to the lessor monthly lease\npayment and interest, and is entitled to obtain the ownership of these machinery and equipment at a nominal price\nupon the expiration of the lease. Management deemed the arrangement as a finance lease (see Note 13).\nF-14\nBON NATURAL LIFE LIMITED AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nNOTE 2 — SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)\nForeign Currency Translation\nThe functional currency for Bon Natural is the U.S Dollar (“US$”).

Equity accounts\nare translated at historical rates. Income and expense accounts are translated at the average rate of exchange during\nthe reporting period. The resulting translation adjustments are reported under other comprehensive income. Gains and\nlosses resulting from the translations of foreign currency transactions and balances are reflected in the results of\noperations.\nThe RMB is not freely convertible into foreign currency and all foreign exchange transactions must take place through\nauthorized institutions. No representation is made that the RMB amounts could have been, or could be, converted into\nUS$ at the rates used in translation.\nThe following table outlines the currency exchange rates that were used in creating the consolidated financial\nstatements:\nSeptember 30, September 30, September 30,\n2022 2021 2020\nPeriod-end spot rate US$1=RMB7.1135 US$1=RMB6.4580 US$1=RMB6.8033\nAverage rate US$1=RMB6.5532 US$1=RMB6.5095 US$1=RMB7.0066\nRevenue recognition\nTo determine revenue recognition for contracts with customers, the Company performs the following five steps : (i)\nidentify the contract(s) with the customer, (ii) identify the performance obligations in the contract, (iii) determine the\ntransaction price, including variable consideration to the extent that it is probable that a significant future reversal will\nnot occur, (iv) allocate the transaction price to the respective performance obligations in the contract, and (v) recognize\nrevenue when (or as) the Company satisfies the performance obligations.\nIn accordance to ASC 606, the Company recognizes revenue when it transfers its goods and services to customers in\nan amount that reflects the consideration to which the Company expects to be entitled in such exchange. The Company\naccounts for the revenue generated from sales of its products to its customers, in which the Company is acting as a\nprincipal in these transactions, is subject to inventory risk, has latitude in establishing prices, and is responsible for\nfulfilling the promise to provide customers the specified goods. All of the Company’s contracts have single\nperformance obligation as the promise is to transfer the individual goods to customers, and there are no other separately\nidentifiable promises in the contracts.\nThe Company’s revenue streams are recognized at a point in time when title and risk of loss passes and the customer\naccepts the goods, which generally occurs at delivery. The Company’s products are sold with no right of return and\nthe Company does not provide other credits or sales incentive to customers. The Company’s sales are net of value\nadded tax (“VAT”) and business tax and surcharges collected on behalf of tax authorities in respect of product sales.\nF-15\nBON NATURAL LIFE LIMITED AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nNOTE 2 — SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)\nContract Assets and Liabilities\nPayment terms are established on the Company’s pre-established credit requirements based upon an evaluation of\ncustomers’ credit.

Costs of fulfilling customers’ purchase orders, such as shipping, handling and delivery,\nwhich occur prior to the transfer of control, are recognized in selling, general and administrative expense when\nincurred. Deferred revenue amounted to $188,745 and $1,096,101 as of September 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\nRevenue included in the beginning balance of deferred revenue and recognized in the years ended September 30,\n2022, 2021 and 2020 amounted to $1,080,178, $403,399 and $213,734, respectively.\nDisaggregation of Revenues\nThe Company disaggregates its revenue from contracts by product types, as the Company believes it best depicts how\nthe nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of the revenue and cash flows are affected by economic factors. The\nCompany’s disaggregation of revenues for the years ended September 30, 2022, 2021 and 2020 are disclosed in Note\n19 of the consolidation financial statements.\nResearch and development expenses\nThe Company expenses all internal research and development costs as incurred, which primarily comprise employee\ncosts, internal and external costs related to execution of studies, including manufacturing costs, facility costs of the\nresearch center, and amortization and depreciation to intangible assets and property, plant and equipment used in the\nresearch and development activities. For the years ended September 30, 2022, 2021 and 2020, research and\ndevelopment expense were approximately $424,558, $249,050 and $205,359, respectively.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses\nSelling expenses represents primarily costs of payroll, benefits, commissions for sales representatives and advertising\nexpenses.

Such awards are granted on a case-by-case\nbasis by local government. The Company’s subsidiary, Xi’an App-chem was approved as a HNTE and received\ngovernment subsidy in the form of export sales refund and cash awards based on annual financial performance.\nF-16\nBON NATURAL LIFE LIMITED AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nNOTE 2 — SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)\nThe Company recognizes government subsidies as other operating income when they are received because they are\nnot subject to any past or future conditions, there are no performance conditions or conditions of use, and they are not\nsubject to future refunds. Government subsidies received and recognized as other operating income totaled\n$1,306,627, $449,972 and $362,187 for the years ended September 30, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\nIncome taxes\nThe Company accounts for current income taxes in accordance with the laws of the relevant tax authorities. Deferred\nincome taxes are recognized when temporary differences exist between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their\nreported amounts in the consolidated financial statements. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using\nenacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected\nto be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in\nincome in the period including the enactment date. Valuation allowances are established, when necessary, to reduce\ndeferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized.\nAn uncertain tax position is recognized only if it is “more likely than not” that the tax position would be sustained in\na tax examination. The amount recognized is the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being\nrealized on examination. For tax positions not meeting the “more likely than not” test, no tax benefit is recorded.\nPenalties and interest incurred related to underpayment of income tax are classified as income tax expense in the\nperiod incurred. As of September 30, 2022, the Company had income tax payable of $602,236.\nThe Company’s subsidiaries in China are subject to the income tax laws of the PRC. No significant income was\ngenerated outside the PRC for the years ended September 30, 2022, 2021 and 2020. As of September 30, 2022 and\n2021, all of the Company’s tax returns of its PRC subsidiaries remain open for statutory examination by PRC tax\nauthorities.\nValue added tax (“VAT”)\nSales revenue represents the invoiced value of goods, net of VAT. The VAT is based on gross sales price and VAT\nrates range up to 17% (starting from May 1, 2018, VAT rate was lowered to 16%, and starting from April 1, 2019,\nVAT rate was further lowered to 13%), depending on the type of products sold. The VAT may be offset by VAT paid\nby the Company on raw materials and other materials included in the cost of producing or acquiring its finished\nproducts. The Company recorded a VAT payable or recoverable net of VAT payments in the accompanying\nconsolidated financial statements. As of September 30, 2022, the Company had VAT tax payable of $572,306.\nFor export sales, VAT is not imposed on gross sales price, and the VAT related to purchasing raw materials is refunded\nafter the export is completed.\nF-17\nBON NATURAL LIFE LIMITED AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nNOTE 2 — SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)\nEmployee Defined Contribution Plan\nThe Company’s subsidiaries in the PRC participate in a government-mandated multi-employer defined contribution\nplan pursuant to which pension, work-related injury benefits, maternity insurance, medical insurance, unemployment\nbenefit and housing fund are provided to eligible full-time employees. The relevant labor regulations require the\nCompany’s subsidiaries in the PRC to pay the local labor and social welfare authorities monthly contributions based\non the applicable benchmarks and rates stipulated by the local government. The contributions to the plan are expensed\nas incurred. Employee social security and welfare benefits included as expenses in the accompanying consolidated\nstatements of income and comprehensive income amounted to $80,150, $54,189 and $30,724 for the years ended\nSeptember 30, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\nShare Based Compensation\nThe Company accounts for share-based payment awards exchanged for services at the estimated grant date fair value\nof the award. The Company issued 633,333 of its ordinary shares to third-party consultants in June 2020 in lieu of\ncash payment for consulting services. The company granted stock options to independent directors to purchase 36,000,\n22,508 and 29,600 shares of the Company’s ordinary shares in June 2021, June 2022 and July 2022, respectively.\nThese options generally vest on the grant date or over a one-year period.\nThe Company estimates the fair value of stock option grants using the Black-Scholes option pricing model and the\nassumptions used in calculating the fair value of stock-based awards represent management’s best estimates and\ninvolve inherent uncertainties and the application of management’s judgment.\nExpected Term - The expected term of options represents the period that the Company’s stock-based awards are\nexpected to be outstanding based on the simplified method, which is the half-life from vesting to the end of its\ncontractual term.\nExpected Volatility - The Company computes stock price volatility over expected terms based on its historical\ncommon stock trading prices.\nRisk-Free Interest Rate - The Company bases the risk-free interest rate on the benchmark interest rate for loans from\nfinancial institutions provided by the People’s Bank of China with an equivalent remaining term.\nExpected Dividend - The Company has never declared or paid any cash dividends on its common shares and does not\nplan to pay cash dividends in the foreseeable future, and, therefore, uses an expected dividend yield of zero in its\nvaluation models.\nF-18\nBON NATURAL LIFE LIMITED AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nNOTE 2 — SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)\nEarnings per Share\nThe Company computes earnings per share (“EPS”) in accordance with ASC 260, “Earnings per Share” (“ASC 260”).\nASC 260 requires companies with complex capital structures to present basic and diluted EPS. Basic EPS is measured\nas net income divided by the weighted average common shares outstanding for the period. Diluted presents the dilutive\neffect on a per share basis of potential common shares (e.g., convertible securities, options and warrants) as if they\nhad been converted at the beginning of the periods presented, or issuance date, if later. Potential common shares that\nhave an anti-dilutive effect (i.e., those that increase income per share or decrease loss per share) are excluded from\nthe calculation of diluted EPS. For the years ended September 30, 2022, 35,290 shares of options were considered in\nthe diluted EPS calculation using treasury stock method. For the year ended September 30, 2021, 36,000 option shares\nand 101,200 underwriter warrants were considered in the diluted EPS calculation using treasury stock method. There\nwere no diluted shares for the year ended September 30, 2020.\nThe following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted earnings per share for the years ended September\n30, 2022, 2021 and 2020:\nFor the Years ended September 30,\n2022 2021 2020\nNumerator:\nNet income attributable to ordinary shareholders $ 6,237,488 $ 4,590,803 $ 3,026,673\nDenominator:\nWeighted-average number of ordinary shares\noutstanding – basic 8,360,774 6,615,833 5,210,649\nOutstanding options 35,290 35,967 -\nOutstanding warrants - 54,435 -\nPotentially dilutive shares from outstanding options\nand warrants 35,290 90,402 -\nWeighted-average number of ordinary shares\noutstanding – diluted 8,396,064 6,706,235 5,210,649\nEarnings per share – basic $ 0.75 $ 0.69 $ 0.58\nEarnings per share – diluted $ 0.74 $ 0.68 $ 0.58\nComprehensive income\nComprehensive income consists of two components, net income and other comprehensive income (loss). The foreign\ncurrency translation gain or loss resulting from translation of the financial statements expressed in RMB to US$ is\nreported in other comprehensive income (loss) in the consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income.\nStatement of Cash Flows\nIn accordance with ASC 230, “Statement of Cash Flows”, cash flows from the Company’s operations are formulated\nbased upon the local currencies. As a result, amounts related to assets and liabilities reported on the consolidated\nstatements of cash flows will not necessarily agree with changes in the corresponding balances on the consolidated\nbalance sheets.\nSegment Reporting\nThe Company uses the management approach in determining reportable operating segments. The management\napproach considers the internal reporting used by the Company’s chief operating decision maker for making operating\ndecisions about the allocation of resources of the segment and the assessment of its performance in determining the\nCompany’s reportable operating segments. Management has determined that the Company has one operating segment\n(See Note 19).\nF-19\nBON NATURAL LIFE LIMITED AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nNOTE 2 — SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nIn June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326), which requires\nentities to measure all expected credit losses for financial assets held at the reporting date based on historical\nexperience, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts. This replaces the existing incurred loss\nmodel and is applicable to the measurement of credit losses on financial assets measured at amortized cost. ASU 2016-\n13 was subsequently amended by ASU 2018-19, ASU 2019-04, ASU 2019-05, ASU 2019-10 and ASU 2020-02. For\npublic entities, ASU 2016-13 and its amendments are effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal\nyears, beginning after December 15, 2019. For all other entities, this guidance and its amendments will be effective\nfor fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early\napplication will be permitted for all entities for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning\nafter December 15, 2018. The Company is currently evaluating the effects of the guidance on the Company’s\nconsolidated financial statements and related disclosures.\nIn March 2020, the FASB issued ASU No. 2020–04, Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Facilitation of the Effects\nof Reference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting. The pronouncement provides temporary optional expedients and\nexceptions to the current guidance on contract modifications and hedge accounting to ease the financial reporting\nburden related to the expected market transition from the London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) and other\ninterbank offered rates to alternative reference rates. The guidance was effective for all entities upon issuance and\ngenerally can be applied to applicable contract modifications through December 31, 2022. The Company is currently\nevaluating the effects of the guidance on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.\nIn October 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-10, “Codification Improvements to Subtopic 205-10, presentation of\nfinancial statements”. The amendments in this Update improve the codification by ensuring that all guidance that\nrequires or provides an option for an entity to provide information in the notes to financial statements is codified in\nthe disclosure section of the codification. That reduce the likelihood that the disclosure requirement would be missed.\nASU 2020-10 is effective for the Company for annual and interim reporting periods beginning January 1, 2022. Early\napplication of the amendments is permitted for any annual or interim period for which financial statements are\navailable to be issued. The amendments in this Update should be applied retrospectively. An entity should apply the\namendments at the beginning of the period that includes the adoption date. The Company is currently evaluating the\nimpact of this new standard on Company’s consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.\nF-20\nBON NATURAL LIFE LIMITED AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nNOTE 3— LIQUIDITY\nAs reflected in the Company’s consolidated financial statements, the Company is currently constructing two new\nmanufacturing plants. As of September 30, 2022, the Company had future minimum capital expenditure commitment\non its construction-in-progress (“CIP”) project of approximately $728,470 within the next twelve months. The\nCompany’s Tongchuan project was fully completed and put into production in December 2022 and Yumen project is\nestimated to be completed in May 2023. The amount of working capital requirement related to these projects will be\n$1.2m (see Note 8). The Company also had unpaid tax liabilities of approximately $1.2 million, which are expected\nto be settled with local tax authorities within one year. Furthermore, the ongoing outbreak of COVID-19 may continue\nto negatively impact the Company’s business operations. A resurgence could negatively affect the Company’s ability\nto fulfil customer sales orders and collect customer payments timely, or disrupt the Company’s supply chain. As a\nresult, there is a possibility that the Company’s revenue and cash flows may underperform in the next 12 months.\nIn assessing its liquidity, management monitors and analyzes the Company’s cash on-hand, its ability to generate\nsufficient revenue sources in the future, and its operating and capital expenditure commitments. In June 2021, the\nCompany closed its initial public offering and received net proceeds of approximately $11.3 million (see Note 1 and\nNote 15). On January 17, 2022, the Company closed a private offering of ordinary shares and received subscription\nproceeds of $2.2 million (see Note 20).\nAs of September 30, 2022, the Company had cash on hand of $840,861. The Company also had outstanding accounts\nreceivable of approximately $6.8 million, of which approximately $5.0 million or 73.5% has been subsequently\ncollected as of the date of this filing. As of September 30, 2022, the Company had outstanding bank loans of\napproximately $4.8 million from several PRC banks (including short-term bank loans of $2.4 million, current portion\nof long-term bank loans of approximately $2.1 million and long-term loan of $0.2 million). Management expects that\nit would be able to renew all of its existing bank loans upon their maturity based on past experience and the Company’s\ngood credit history. In addition to the current borrowings, from December 2020 to December 2021, the Company\nsecured an aggregate of $3.9 million (RMB 28 million) lines of credit with PRC banks as working capital loan\n(including $2.1 million line of credit with Shanghai Pudong Development Bank for one year and $1.8 million line of\ncredit with Qishang Bank for three years.) (see Note 10). As of the date of this filing, the Company had borrowed $1.8\nmillion (RMB 13 million) out of these lines of credit and had the availability to borrow additional maximum loans of\n$2.1 million (RMB 15 million) under these lines of credit before December 2023.\nBased on the current operating plan, management believes that the above-mentioned measures, including cash on hand\nof $840,861, $2.2 million proceeds from private offering of ordinary shares in January 2023 and the $2.4 million\nunused line of credit, collectively will provide sufficient liquidity for the Company to settle the tax liabilities, to meet\nits future liquidity and capital expenditure requirement on the CIP projects for at least 12 months from the date the\nCompany’s consolidated financial statements are issued.\nNOTE 4 — ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE, NET\nAccounts receivable, net, consists of the following:\nSeptember 30, September 30,\n2022 2021\nAccounts receivable $ 6,797,644 $ 6,167,498\nLess: allowance for doubtful accounts (13,337 ) (14,691 )\nAccounts receivable, net $ 6,784,307 $ 6,152,807\nF-21\nBON NATURAL LIFE LIMITED AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nNOTE 4 — ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE, NET (continued)\nThe Company’s accounts receivable primarily includes balance due from customers when the Company’s products\nare sold and delivered to customers.
