(\"Greenlane\" or the \"Company\") (NASDAQ:GNLN), one of the premier global sellers of premium cannabis accessories, child-resistant packaging, and specialty vaporization products, today announced an exclusive multi-year distribution agreement with Safety Strips Tech Corp (\"Safety Strips\"). Under the agreement, Greenlane will exclusively distribute Safety Strips fentanyl, xylazine and drink spike detection test strips in the U.S.\n\n![](https://www.accesswire.com/imagelibrary/50444625-4d08-4096-a3de-35cdf391f0ba/939930/image.jpeg) ![](https://www.accesswire.com/imagelibrary/f566ed49-d467-4816-b511-fc058d57bee3/939930/image.jpeg)\n\nSafety Strips, Inc. Testing Strips\n\n\"Entering this adjacent product category has been high on our strategic priority list due to the alarming fact that the opioid crisis shows no signs of slowing and our customers are seeing increasing demand for more quality, affordable test strip options. We believe providing economical and reliable substance testing is critical to help prevent accidental overdoses as well as protecting individuals from drug-induced date rape,\" said Barbara Sher, Chief Executive Officer for Greenlane.\n\nAdded Sher \"Given the strong customer demand for high quality and value in this segment, we are very pleased to have completed this deal with Safety Strips who, we believe, has industry-leading quality and technology.\"\n\nProducts are available to order today via the Company's multiple online retail storefronts, ([vapor.com](https://pr.report/42o7), [puffitup.com](https://pr.report/42o8), and [higherstandards.com/](https://pr.report/42o9)) as well as its wholesale portal ([wholesale.greenlane.com](https://pr.report/42oa)).\n\n**Safety Strips Test Portfolio**\n\nSafety Strips offers a single, low-cost test strip that provides an affordable, reliable way for people to test substances for fentanyl and xylazine (popularly known as tranq), two dangerous adulterants that are exacerbating the already critical and growing opioid epidemic.\n\nSafety Strips Fentanyl Test Strip (FTS) ISO 13485 validated product, is an easy-to-use lateral flow immunoassay designedto swiftly detect potent synthetic opioids, including 3-Methyl Fentanyl, Acetyl Fentanyl, Butyryl Fentanyl, Carfentanil, Fentanyl, Furanyl Fentanyl, Ocfentanil, Remifentanil, Sufentanil, Valeryl Fentanyl, and p-Fluoro Fentanyl.\n\nTo use the test, a trace amount of the sample substance is mixed with water. The test strip is then dipped into the liquid for 15 seconds. After waiting approximately five minutes, the results can be read. One line indicates fentanyl is present in the sample; two lines indicate a negative result. Test strips are the easiest, fastest, and most accurate way to detect ultra-low nanogram trace amounts of fentanyl or xylazine in powders, pills or injectables and can help prevent accidental overdoses.\n\n**About Greenlane Holdings, Inc.**\n\nFounded in 2005, Greenlane is a premier global platform for the development and distribution of premium smoking accessories, vape devices, and lifestyle products to thousands of producers, processors, specialty retailers, smoke shops, convenience stores, and retail consumers.

BUSINESS OPERATIONS AND ORGANIZATION**\n\n**Organization**\n\nGreenlane Holdings, Inc. (“Greenlane” and, collectively with the Operating Company (as defined below) and its consolidated subsidiaries, the “Company”, “we”, “us”, and “our”) was formed as a Delaware corporation on May 2, 2018. We are a holding company that was formed for the purpose of completing an underwritten initial public offering (“IPO”) of shares of our Class A common stock, $0.01 par value per share (“Class A common stock”), in order to carry on the business of Greenlane Holdings, LLC (the “Operating Company”). The Operating Company was organized under the laws of the state of Delaware on September 1, 2015, and is based in Boca Raton, Florida. Unless the context otherwise requires, references to the “Company” refer to us, and our consolidated subsidiaries, including the Operating Company.\n\nWe merchandise premium cannabis accessories, child-resistant packaging, specialty vaporization solutions and lifestyle products in the United States, Canada, Europe and Latin America, serving a diverse and expansive customer base with thousands of retail locations, licensed cannabis dispensaries, smoke shops, multi-state operators (“MSOs”), specialty retailers, and retail consumers.\n\nWe have been developing a portfolio of our own proprietary brands (the “Greenlane Brands”) that we believe will, over time, deliver higher margins and create long-term value for our customers and shareholders. Our wholly-owned Greenlane Brands includes Groove – our more affordable product line and Higher Standards – our premium smoke shop and ancillary product brand, and our award winning Vapor.com website and brand. We also have category exclusive licenses for the premium Marley Natural branded products, as well as the K.Haring branded products.\n\nWe are the sole manager of the Operating Company and our principal asset is Common Units of the Operating Company (“Common Units”). As the sole manager of the Operating Company, we operate and control all of the business and affairs of the Operating Company, and we conduct our business through the Operating Company and its subsidiaries. We have a board of directors and executive officers, but no employees. All of our assets are held and all of the employees are employed by wholly owned subsidiaries of the Operating Company.\n\nWe have the sole voting interest in, and control the management of, the Operating Company, and we have the obligation to absorb losses of, and receive benefits from, the Operating Company, that could be significant. We determined that the Operating Company is a variable interest entity (“VIE”) and that we are the primary beneficiary of the Operating Company. Accordingly, pursuant to the VIE accounting model, beginning in the fiscal quarter ended June 30, 2019, we consolidated the Operating Company in our consolidated financial statements and reported a non-controlling interest related to the Common Units held by the members of the Operating Company (other than the Common Units held by us) on our consolidated financial statements.\n\nOn August 31, 2021, we completed our merger with KushCo Holdings, Inc. (“KushCo”) and have included the results of operations of KushCo in our consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss from that date forward. In connection with the merger with KushCo, the Greenlane Certificate of Incorporation was amended and restated (the “A&R Charter”) in order to (i) increase the number of authorized shares of Greenlane Class B common stock, $0.0001 par value per share (the “Class B Common stock”), from 10 million shares to 30 million shares in order to effect the conversion of each outstanding share of Class C common stock, $0.0001 par value per share (the “Class C common stock”), into one-third of one share of Class B common stock, (ii) increase the number of authorized shares of Class A common stock from 125 million shares to 600 million shares, and (iii) eliminate references to the Class C common stock. Pursuant to the terms of an Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of March 31, 2021 (the “Merger Agreement”) with KushCo, immediately prior to the consummation of the business combination, holders of Class C common stock received one-third of one share of Class B common stock for each share of Class C common stock held immediately prior to the closing of the merger.\n\nOur corporate structure is commonly referred to as an “Up-C” structure. The Up-C structure allows the Operating Company to continue to realize tax benefits associated with owning interests in an entity that is treated as a partnership, or “pass-through” entity. One of these benefits is that future taxable income of the Operating Company that is allocated to its members will be taxed on a flow-through basis and therefore will not be subject to corporate taxes at the Operating Company entity level. Additionally, because a member may redeem their Common Units for shares of Class A common stock on a one-for-one basis or, at our option, for cash, the Up-C structure also provides the member with potential liquidity that holders of non-publicly traded limited liability companies are not typically afforded.\n\n8  \n---  \n  \nIn connection with the IPO, we entered into a Tax Receivable Agreement (the “TRA”) with the Operating Company and the Operating Company’s members and a Registration Rights Agreement (the “Registration Rights Agreement”) with the Operating Company’s members. The TRA provides for the payment by us to the Operating Company’s member(s) of 85.0% of the amount of tax benefits, if any, that we may actually realize (or in some cases, are deemed to realize) as a result of (i) the step-up in tax basis in our share of the Operating Company’s assets resulting from the redemption of Common Units under the mechanism described above and (ii) certain other tax benefits attributable to payments made under the TRA. Pursuant to the Registration Rights Agreement, we have agreed to register the resale of shares of Class A common stock that are issuable to the Operating Company’s members upon redemption or exchange of their Common Units.\n\nThe A&R Charter and the Fourth Amended and Restated Operating Agreement of the Operating Company (the “Operating Agreement”) require that (a) we at all times maintain a ratio of one Common Unit owned by us for each share of our Class A common stock issued by us (subject to certain exceptions), and (b) the Operating Company at all times maintains (i) a one-to-one ratio between the number of shares of our Class A common stock issued by us and the number of Common Units owned by us, and (ii) a one-to-one ratio between the number of shares of our Class B common stock owned by the non-founder members of the Operating Company and the number of Common Units owned by the non-founder members of the Operating Company.\n\nAs of December 31, 2022, all Common Units of the Operating Company and Class B common stock had been exchanged for Class A common stock, and we owned 100% of the voting and economic interests in Greenlane through the holders’ ownership of Class A common stock. See “Note 9 - Stockholder’s Equity.”\n\n**Reverse Stock Splits**\n\nOn June 2, 2023, we filed a Certificate of Amendment to the A&R Charter with the Secretary of State for the State of Delaware (“SSSD”), which effected a one-for-ten reverse stock split (the “2023 Reverse Stock Split” and together with the 2022 Reverse Stock Split, the “Reverse Stock Splits”) of our issued and outstanding shares of Common Stock at 5:01 PM Eastern Time on June 5, 2023. As a result of the 2023 Reverse Stock Split, every ten shares of common stock issued and outstanding were converted into one share of common stock. We paid cash in lieu of fractional shares, and accordingly, no fractional shares were issued in connection with the 2023 Reverse Stock Split.\n\nOn July 23, 2024, the Board approved the reverse split at a ratio of one-for-11 and the Amendment has been filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware, which became effective on August 5, 2024 at 12:01 AM Eastern Time, before the opening of trading on the Nasdaq.\n\nThe Reverse Stock Splits did not change the par value of the Common Stock or the authorized number of shares of Common Stock. All outstanding options, restricted stock awards, warrants and other securities entitling their holders to purchase or otherwise receive shares of our Common Stock have been adjusted as a result of the Reverse Stock Splits, as required by the terms of each security. The number of shares available to be awarded under our Amended and Restated 2019 Equity Incentive Plan have also been appropriately adjusted. See “Note 10 — Compensation Plans” for more information.\n\nAll share and per share amounts in these consolidated financial statements and notes thereto have been retroactively adjusted for all periods presented to give effect to the Reverse Stock Splits, including reclassifying an amount equal to the reduction in par value of Common Stock to additional paid-in capital.\n\n**Liquidity and Going Concern**\n\nPursuant to ASC 205-40, Presentation of Financial Statements — Going Concern (“ASC 205-40”), management must evaluate whether there are conditions and events, considered in the aggregate, that raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern for one year after the date that these condensed consolidated financial statements are issued. In accordance with ASC 205-40, management’s analysis can only include the potential mitigating impact of management’s plans that have not been fully implemented as of the issuance date if (a) it is probable that management’s plans will be effectively implemented on a timely basis, and (b) it is probable that the plans, when implemented, will alleviate the relevant conditions or events that raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern.\n\nOur primary requirements for liquidity and capital are working capital, debt service related to recent acquisitions and general corporate needs. Our primary sources of liquidity are our cash on hand and the cash flow that we generate from our operations, as well as proceeds from other equity issuances.\n\nWe believe that our cash on hand and the cash flow that we generate from our operations will not be sufficient to fund our working capital and capital expenditure requirements, as well as our debt repayments and other liquidity requirements associated with our existing operations, for the next 12 months. Based on our cash on hand and working capital at September 30, 2024, we may have insufficient cash to fund planned operations into the fourth quarter of 2024. This is evident from our continued efforts to raise capital and leverage external funding to fulfil our capital needs.\n\n9  \n---  \n  \n**ATM Program and Shelf Registration Statement**\n\nWe formerly used a shelf registration statement on Form S-3 (the “Shelf Registration Statement”) to conduct securities offerings from time to time in order to meet our liquidity needs. In August 2021, we filed a prospectus supplement and established an “at-the-market” equity offering program (the “ATM Program”) that provided for the sale of shares of our Class A common stock having an aggregate offering price of up to $50 million, from time to time.\n\nSince the launch of the ATM program in August 2021 and through December 31, 2022, we sold shares of our Class A common stock which generated gross proceeds of approximately $12.7 million and we paid fees to the sales agent of approximately $0.4 million. Due to the untimely filing of certain of our Quarterly and Annual Reports, we are unable to issue additional shares of Class A common stock pursuant to the ATM Program or otherwise use the Shelf Registration Statement, which will limit our liquidity options in the capital markets.\n\n**Common Stock and Warrant Offerings.**\n\nOn June 29, 2023, we entered into securities purchase agreements with certain investors, pursuant to which we agreed to issue and sell an aggregate of 560,476 shares of our Class A common stock, pre-funded warrants to purchase up to 3,487,143 shares of our Class A Common Stock (the “July 2023 Pre-Funded Warrants”) and warrants to purchase up to 8,095,238 shares of our Class A common stock (the “July 2023 Standard Warrants”). The July 2023 units were offered pursuant to a Registration Statement on Form S-1 (the “July 2023 Offering”). The July 2023 Offering generated gross proceeds of approximately $4.3 million and net proceeds to the Company of approximately $3.8 million and closed on July 3, 2023. See “Note 9 – Stockholders’ Equity” for further information.\n\nOn August 12, 2024, the Company entered into a securities purchase agreement with a single institutional investor for aggregate gross cash proceeds of $6.5 million. In connection with the private placement, the Company will issue an aggregate of 2,363,637 units and pre-funded units. The pre-funded units will be sold at the same purchase price as the units, less the pre-funded warrant exercise price of $0.00001. Each unit and pre-funded unit will consist of one share of common stock (or one pre-funded warrant) and two common warrants, each exercisable for one share of common stock at an exercise price of $2.50 per share. The common warrant will be exercisable on the initial exercise date described in the common warrant and will expire 5.0 years from such date.\n\n**Asset-Based Loan**\n\nOn August 9, 2022, we entered into an asset-based loan agreement dated as of August 8, 2022 (the “Loan Agreement”), which made available to the Company a term loan of up to $15.0 million. On February 9, 2023, we entered into Amendment No. 2 to the Loan Agreement, in which we agreed to, among other things, voluntarily prepay approximately $6.6 million (inclusive of early termination fees and expenses) under the terms provided for under the Loan Agreement and the lenders under the Loan Agreement agreed to release $5.7 million in funds held in a blocked account pursuant to the terms of the Loan Agreement.\n\nOn August 7, 2023, we repaid the approximately $4.3 million in aggregate principal amount (the “Loan Repayment”) which remained outstanding under the terms of the Loan Agreement. As a result of the Loan Repayment, the Company has been released from its obligations under the Loan Agreement, in accordance with the terms of the Loan Agreement. See “Note 6 - Long Term Debt” for more information.\n\n10  \n---  \n  \n**ERC Sale**\n\nOn February 16, 2023, two of our wholly owned subsidiaries, Warehouse Goods LLC and Kim International LLC, entered into an agreement with a third-party institutional investor pursuant to which the investor purchased, for approximately $4.9 million in cash, an economic participation interest, at a discount, in our rights to payment from the United States Internal Revenue Service for certain periods with respect to the employee retention credits filed by us under the Employee Retention Credit program.\n\n**Future Receivables Financing**\n\nIn July, August, October, and November 2023, the Company received an aggregate of approximately $3.9 million in cash pursuant to the terms of future receivables financings (collectively, the “Future Receivables Financings”) entered into with two private lenders. At September 30, 2024, $4.6 million of such financing remained outstanding. See “Note 6 - Long Term Debt” for more information.\n\n**Secured Bridge Loan**\n\nOn September 22, 2023, the Company entered into a secured loan pursuant to a Loan and Security Agreement (the “September 2023 Loan Agreement”), dated as of September 22, 2023 with Synergy Imports, LLC (the “Secured Bridge Loan Lender”).\n\nPursuant to the September 2023 Loan Agreement, the Secured Bridge Loan Lender agreed to make available to the Company a six-month bridge loan of $2.2 million in new funds. Additionally, the Secured Bridge Loan Lender agreed to defer payments totaling $2,028,604 already owed by the Company under existing payment obligations and potentially defer up to an additional $2,655,778 which may become due pursuant to existing agreements during the term of the September 2023 Loan Agreement.\n\nSubject to certain exceptions, the Company agreed to pledge all of its assets, with the exception of deposit accounts and accounts receivable, as collateral. Additionally, the Company agreed to transfer one US patent and two related foreign patents and a related trademark in exchange for an exclusive license back of such assets in the area of smoking products and accessories in connection with the September 2023 Loan Agreement.\n\nIn May 2024, the Company modified its debt agreement with Synergy to reduce the principal balance due by $2.7 million from $5.1 million as part of the Loan Modification Agreement concurrent with the Asset Purchase Agreement. Synergy acquired certain assets from the Company in exchange for the reduction in overall principal owed. At September 30, 2024, $2.7 million of such financing remained outstanding. See “Note 6 - Long Term Debt” for more information.\n\n**Note Payable**\n\nOn June 7, 2024, the Company entered into a subscription agreement with Cobra Alternative Capital Strategies, LLC. As of September 30, 2024, the Company has been loaned $3.1 million with net cash proceeds of $2.6 million. The note was issued with a 20% original issue discount and is due in full on December 7, 2024. See “Note 6 - Long Term Debt” for more information. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, the Company repaid $2.1 million and the remaining outstanding balance was approximately $1.0 million. The Company has elected to measure these notes using the fair value option under ASC 825, Financial Instruments. Given the short-term duration of the notes, the carrying value of the notes at September 30, 2024 approximate the fair value and as such no fair value adjustment was recorded in the statement of operations.\n\n**Management Initiatives**\n\nWe have completed several initiatives to optimize our working capital requirements due to our inability to access capital markets on equitable terms and stock-outs and shortages of higher velocity inventory. In the fourth quarter of 2022, we launched Groove, a new, innovative Greenlane Brands product line, and we also rationalized and improved our third-party brands product offering, which enabled us to reduce inventory carrying costs and working capital requirements while increasing our offerings.\n\nIn April 2023, we entered into two strategic partnerships. First, we entered into a strategic partnership (the “MJ Packaging Partnership”) with A&A Global Imports d/b/a MarijuanaPackaging.com (“MJ Pack”), a leading provider of packaging solutions to the cannabis industry. On August 8, 2024 the Company terminated its strategic partnership with MJ Packaging and is resuming its business as a direct provider of packaging solutions to the cannabis industry. MJ Packaging however, remains a distribution customer of the Company. \n\nSecond, we entered into a strategic partnership with an affiliate of one of our existing vape suppliers (“Vape Partner”) to service certain key customers with vaporizer goods and services (the “Vape Partnership”). As part of the Vape Partnership, we will introduce our Vape Partner to certain key customers, assist with the promotion and the sale of certain vaporizer goods and services, and help coordinate the logistics, storage and distribution of such vaporizer products. If our Vape Partner and key customer(s) enter into a direct relationship, the customers would directly purchase vaporizer goods and services, which we currently sell them, directly from our Vape Partner and we would no longer need to purchase such vape inventory on behalf of such key customer(s). In exchange we would earn quarterly and annual commission payments from our strategic partner. While the strategic partnership may result in a decrease in top line revenue for these vape products, this partnership combined with some of our other restructuring initiatives should allow us to reduce our overall cost-structure and enhance our margins, thereby improving our balance sheet.\n\nWe have successfully renegotiated many of our vendor and supplier partnership terms and are continuing to improve working capital arrangements with our vendors and suppliers. We have made progress consolidating and streamlining our office, warehouse, and distribution operations footprint. We have reduced our workforce significantly to reduce costs and align with our revenue projections.\n\nThe Company has incurred net losses of $8.9 million and $27.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, cash (used in) provided by operating activities were $(5.2) million and $1.2 million, respectively. The recent macroeconomic environment has caused weaker demand than contemplated under the Company’s business plan, resulting in a reduction in projected revenue and cash flows for the twelve-month period included in the going concern evaluation.\n\n11  \n---  \n  \nAs a result of our losses and our projected cash needs, combined with our current liquidity level, substantial doubt exists about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. The Company’s ability to continue as a going concern is contingent upon successful execution of management’s intended plan over the next twelve months to improve the Company’s liquidity and profitability, which includes, without limitation:\n\n■ | Further reducing operating costs expense by taking additional restructuring actions to align cost with revenue to achieve profitability.  \n---|---  \n■ | Increasing revenue by introducing new products, acquiring new customers, and enhancing our sales force  \n■ | Execute on strategic partnerships accretive to margins and operating cash  \n■ | Seeking additional capital through the issuance of debt or equity securities.  \n  \nThe unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that may result from the outcome of this going concern uncertainty. For a more complete description of our initiatives, see the Management Discussion and Analysis.\n\n**NOTE 2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES**\n\n**Basis of Presentation**\n\nOur unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”) and applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) regarding interim financial reporting. Certain information and note disclosures normally included in the financial statements prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP have been condensed or omitted pursuant to such rules and regulations. As such, the information included in this Form 10-Q should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. The condensed consolidated results of operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the year ending December 31, 2024, or any other future annual or interim period. In the opinion of management, the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements reflect all adjustments necessary for a fair statement of the Company’s financial position and operating results. Certain reclassifications have been made to prior year amounts or balances to conform to the presentation adopted in the current year.\n\n**Principles of Consolidation**\n\nOur condensed consolidated financial statements include our accounts, the accounts of the Operating Company, and the accounts of the Operating Company’s consolidated subsidiaries. All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.\n\n12  \n---  \n  \n**Use of Estimates**\n\nConformity with U.S. GAAP requires the use of estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. These estimates form the basis for judgments we make about the carrying values of our assets and liabilities, which are not readily apparent from other sources. We base our estimates and judgments on historical information and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. U.S. GAAP requires us to make estimates and judgments in several areas. Such areas include, but are not limited to the following: the collectability of accounts receivable; the allowance for slow-moving or obsolete inventory; the realizability of deferred tax assets; the fair value of contingent consideration arrangements; the useful lives property and equipment; the calculation of our VAT taxes receivable and VAT taxes, fines, and penalties payable; our loss contingencies, including our TRA liability; and the valuation and assumptions underlying equity-based compensation. These estimates are based on management’s knowledge about current events and expectations about actions we may undertake in the future. The actual results could differ materially from those estimates.\n\n**Segment Reporting**\n\nWe manage our global business operations through our operating and reportable business segments. As of September 30, 2024, we determined that we have one remaining and reportable operating business segment. Our reportable segment has been identified based on how our chief operating decision maker (“CODM”), which is a committee comprised of our Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”) and our Chief Financial and Legal Officer (“CFO”), manages our business, makes resource allocation and operating decisions, and evaluates operating performance.\n\n**Revenue Recognition**\n\nRevenue is recognized when customers obtain control of goods and services promised by us. Revenue is measured based on the amount of consideration that we expect to receive in exchange for those goods or services, reduced by promotional discounts and estimates for return allowances and refunds. Taxes collected from customers for remittance to governmental authorities are excluded from net sales.\n\nWe generate revenue primarily from the sale of finished products to customers, whereby each product unit represents a single performance obligation. We recognize revenue from product sales when the customer has obtained control of the products, which is either at point of sale or delivery to the customer, depending upon the specific terms and conditions of the arrangement, or at the point of sale for our retail store sales. We provide no warranty on products sold. Product warranty is provided by the manufacturers. For certain product offerings such as child-resistant packaging, closed-system vaporization solutions and custom-branded retail products, we may receive a deposit from the customer (generally 25% - 50% of the total order cost, but the amount can vary by customer contract) when an order is placed by a customer. We typically complete these orders within one to six months from the date of order, depending on the complexity of the customization and the size of the order, but the completion timeline can vary by product type and terms of sales with each customer. See “Note 8—Supplemental Financial Statement Information” for a summary of changes to our customer deposits liability balance during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and the year ended December 31, 2023.\n\nWe estimate product returns based on historical experience and record them as a refund liability that reduces the net sales for the period. We analyze actual historical returns, current economic trends and changes in order volume when evaluating the adequacy of our sales returns allowance in any reporting period. Our liability for returns, which is included within “Accrued expenses and other current liabilities” in our consolidated balance sheet, was approximately $0.1 million December 31, 2023. There were no liabilities related to refunds as of September 30, 2024.\n\nWe elected to account for shipping and handling expenses that occur after the customer has obtained control of products as a fulfillment activity in cost of sales. Shipping and handling fees charged to customers are included in net sales upon completion of our performance obligations. We apply the practical expedient provided for by the applicable revenue recognition guidance by not adjusting the transaction price for significant financing components for periods less than one year. We also apply the practical expedient provided by the applicable revenue recognition guidance based upon which we generally expense sales commissions when incurred because the amortization period is one year or less. Sales commissions are recorded within “Salaries, benefits and payroll tax expenses” in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss.\n\nThe Company transitioned to a commission revenue model for the majority of the sales for the Industrial segment. The company operates as a sales agent servicing vape customers and receives a commission for these services. The company was previously working directly with these customers and recognizing gross revenue versus straight commission revenue. The Company recognizes this fee on a periodic basis when the products have been shipped for the end consumer. In working with their partner, the Company is not responsible for fulfilling a promise to provide the specified goods, does not establish the pricing with its partners customers, and does not have control over the goods that will be shipped. As such, the Company is an agent and recognizes its revenue on a net basis for its service. The partner company pays Greenlane a negotiated percentage-based fee on a quarterly basis.\n\nTwo customers represented approximately 36% and 27%, respectively, of net sales for the three months ended September 30, 2024. Two customers represented approximately 16% and 16%, respectively, of net sales for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, one customer represented approximately 13% and 28% of net sales. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company has a concentration of credit risk with its accounts receivable balance as one customer represented approximately 15% and 31%, respectively, of accounts receivable.\n\n13  \n---  \n  \n**Value Added Taxes**\n\nDuring the third quarter of 2020, as part of a global tax strategy review, we determined that our European subsidiaries based in the Netherlands, which we acquired on September 30, 2019, had historically collected and remitted value added tax (“VAT”) payments, which related to direct-to-consumer sales to other European Union (“EU”) member states, directly to the Dutch tax authorities. In connection with our subsidiaries’ payment of VAT to Dutch tax authorities rather than other EU member states, we may become subject to civil or criminal enforcement actions in certain EU jurisdictions, which could result in penalties.\n\nWe performed an analysis of the VAT overpayments to the Dutch tax authorities, which we expected to be refunded to us, and VAT payable to other EU member states, including potential fines and penalties. Based on this analysis, we recorded VAT payable of approximately $0.6 and $0.4 million, respectively, relating to this matter within “Accrued expenses and other current liabilities” in our condensed consolidated balance sheets as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023.\n\nPursuant to the purchase and sale agreement by which we acquired our European subsidiaries, the sellers are required to indemnify us against certain specified matters and losses, including any and all liabilities, claims, penalties and costs incurred or sustained by us in connection with non-compliance with tax laws in relation to activities of the sellers. The indemnity (or indemnification receivable) is limited to an amount equal to the purchase price under the purchase and sale agreement.\n\nAs noted above, we have voluntarily disclosed VAT owed to several relevant tax authorities in the EU member states and believe in doing so we will reduce our liability for penalties and interest. Nonetheless, we may incur expenses in future periods related to such matters, including litigation costs and other expenses to defend our position. The outcome of such matters is inherently unpredictable and subject to significant uncertainties. Refer to “Note 7—Commitments and Contingencies” for additional discussion regarding our contingencies.\n\n**Recently Issued Accounting Guidance Not Yet Adopted**\n\nIn June 2022, the FASB issued ASU No. 2022-03, _Fair Value Measurement of Equity Securities Subject to Contractual Sale Restrictions_ , which clarifies that a contractual sale restriction prohibiting the sale of an equity security is a characteristic of the reporting entity holding the equity security and is not included in the equity security’s unit of account. This standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, with early adoption permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting the standard.\n\nIn November 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-07, _Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures_ , which improves reportable segment disclosure requirements, primarily through enhanced disclosures about significant segment expenses. The amendments in this update require public companies to disclose on an annual and interim basis, significant segment expenses that are regularly provided to the chief operating decision maker (CODM) and require that a public entity disclose, on an annual and interim basis, an amount for other segment items by reportable segment and a description of its composition. In addition, the amendment requires that a public entity provide all annual disclosures about a reportable segment’s profit or loss and assets currently required in interim periods and require that a public entity disclose the title and position of the CODM and an explanation of how the CODM uses the reported measure(s) of segment profit or loss in assessing segment performance and deciding how to allocate resources. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of ASU 2023-07 on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. This amendment will go into effect for the fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024.\n\nIn December 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-09, _Income Taxes (Topic 740)_ : _Improvements To Income Tax Disclosures,_ to enhance the transparency and decision usefulness of income tax disclosures. The amendments in this Update address investor requests for more transparency about income tax information through improvements to income tax disclosures primarily related to the rate reconciliation and income taxes paid information.\n\n14  \n---  \n  \nThe amendments in this Update require that entities on an annual basis (1) disclose specific categories in the rate reconciliation and (2) provide additional information for reconciling items that meet a quantitative threshold (if the effect of those reconciling items is equal to or greater than 5 percent of the amount computed by multiplying pretax income (or loss) by the applicable statutory income tax rate). In addition, public business entities are required to provide certain qualitative disclosure about the rate reconciliation.\n\nThe amendments in this Update require that all entities disclose on an annual basis the amount of income taxes paid (net of refunds received) disaggregated (1) by federal (national), state, and foreign taxes and (2) by individual jurisdictions in which income taxes paid (net of refunds received) is equal to or greater than 5 percent of total income taxes paid (net of refunds received).\n\nThis Update also includes certain other amendments to improve the effectiveness of income tax disclosures, such as requiring that all entities disclose the following information:\n\n1. | Income (or loss) from continuing operations before income tax expense (or benefit) disaggregated between domestic and foreign.  \n---|---  \n2. | Income tax expense (or benefit) from continuing operations disaggregated by federal (national), state, and foreign.  \n  \nThe amendments in this ASU require a cumulative-effect adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings (or other appropriate components of equity or net assets) as of the beginning of the annual reporting period in which an entity adopts the amendments. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of ASU 2023-09 on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. This amendment will go into effect for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2024.\n\n**NOTE 3. BUSINESS ACQUISITIONS AND DISPOSITIONS**\n\n**EU Subsidiary Purchase Agreement**\n\nIn May 2024, the Company entered into an agreement with a group of individuals to sell 100% equity interests of one of the Company’s wholly-owned subsidiaries, Shavita B.V. and substantially all of the assets of ARI Logistics B.V. As of the date that these financial statements were available to be issued, the close of the transaction is in dispute as there was pending consideration obligations due to be transferred to the Company not met, as well as other monetary obligations of the purchasers that remain unsatisfied. The Company intends to vigorously pursue its claims against Shavita and the purchaser group. The Company does not believe any circumstances arising from the ARI and Shavita transactions will have a material adverse effect on the Company, its financial condition or results of operations.\n\n**NOTE 4. FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS**\n\n**Assets and Liabilities that are Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis**\n\nThe carrying amounts for certain of our financial instruments, including cash, accounts receivable, accounts payable and certain accrued expenses and other assets and liabilities, approximate fair value due to the short-term nature of these instruments.\n\nAs of December 31, 2023, we had contingent consideration that is required to be measured at fair value on a recurring basis.\n\nSCHEDULE OF FAIR VALUE, LIABILITIES MEASURED ON RECURRING BASIS\n\nOur financial instruments measured at fair value on a recurring basis were as follows at the dates indicated:\n\n(in thousands) | Level 1 | Level 2 | Level 3 | Total  \n---|---|---|---|---  \nCondensed Consolidated Balance Sheet Caption | Fair Value at December 31, 2023  \n(in thousands) | Level 1 | Level 2 | Level 3 | Total  \nLiabilities:  \nContingent consideration - current | Accrued expenses and other current liabilities | $| — | $| — | 1,500 | 1,500  \nTotal Liabilities | $| — | $| — | $| 1,500 | $| 1,500  \n  \nThere were no transfers between Level 1 and Level 2 and no transfers to or from Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\n\n15  \n---  \n  \n**Contingent Consideration**\n\nEach period we revalue our contingent consideration obligations associated with business acquisitions to their fair value. We estimate the fair value of the Product Launch Contingent Payments using a form of the scenario-based method, which includes significant unobservable inputs such as management’s identification of probability-weighted outcomes and a risk-adjusted discount rate over the earn-out period. Significant increases or decreases in these inputs could result in a significantly lower or higher fair value measurement of the contingent consideration liability. Changes in the fair value of contingent consideration are included within “Other income (expense), net” in our condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss.\n\nA reconciliation of our liabilities that are measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring basis using significant unobservable inputs (Level 3) is as follows:\n\nSCHEDULE OF FAIR VALUE, LIABILITIES MEASURED ON RECURRING BASIS, UNOBSERVABLE INPUT RECONCILIATION\n\n(in thousands) | Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024  \n---|---  \nBalance at December 31, 2023 | $| 1,000  \nCash payments for earned contingent consideration | —  \nTransfer to notes payable | —  \nGain from fair value adjustments included in results of operations | (1,000| )  \nBalance September 30, 2024 | $| —  \n(in thousands) | Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023  \n---|---  \nBalance at December 31, 2022 | $| 2,738  \nBeginning balance | $| 2,738  \nCash payments for earned contingent consideration | (350| )  \nTransfer to notes payable | (1,150| )  \nLoss (gain) from fair value adjustments included in results of operations | 262  \nBalance at September 30, 2023 | $| 1,500  \nEnding balance | $| 1,500  \n  \n**Equity Securities Without a Readily Determinable Fair Value**\n\nOur investment in equity securities without readily determinable fair value consist of ownership interests in Airgraft Inc., Sun Grown Packaging, LLC (“Sun Grown”) and Vapor Dosing Technologies, Inc. (“VIVA”). We determined that our ownership interests do not provide us with significant influence over the operations of these investments. Accordingly, we account for our investments in these entities as equity securities.\n\n16  \n---  \n  \nAirgraft Inc., Sun Grown, and VIVA are private entities and their equity securities do not have a readily determinable fair value. We elected to measure these securities under the measurement alternative election at cost minus impairment, if any, with adjustments through earnings for observable price changes in orderly transactions for the identical or similar investment of the same issuer. We acquired our investments in Sun Grown and VIVA as part of our merger with KushCo, which we completed in August 2021. We did not identify any fair value adjustments related to these equity securities during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\n\nAs of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the carrying value of our investment in equity securities without a readily determinable fair value was approximately $1.9 million, respectively, included within “Other assets” in our condensed consolidated balance sheets.\n\n**NOTE 5. LEASES**\n\n**Greenlane as a Lessee**\n\nAs of September 30, 2024, we had facilities financed under operating leases consisting of warehouses and offices with lease term expirations between 2023 and 2027. Lease terms are generally three to seven years for warehouses and office space. Our lease agreements do not contain any material residual value guarantees or material restrictive covenants.\n\nThe following table provides details of our future minimum lease payments under operating lease liabilities recorded in our condensed consolidated balance sheet as of September 30, 2024.

The Company will make weekly payments under the Future Receivables Financings and is scheduled to repay the amounts due under the Future Receivables Financings in full in approximately six to eight months. The total amount to be repaid under the initial Future Receivables Financings was approximately $4.5 million. In connection with the Future Receivables Financings, the Company granted the lenders security interests in Company’s accounts receivable equal to the amounts due thereunder, and in connection with any event of default, the lenders may file financing statements evidencing the security interests. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company’s financings were in a series of transactions refinanced as they were not able to make the proscribed monthly payments for the repayment of cash advances. As such the refinancings restructured the payment schedule and the total balance increased to $4.6 million which included deferred financing fees of approximately $2.8 million.\n\n**Note Payable**\n\nOn June 7, 2024, the Company entered into a subscription agreement for a note payable with Cobra Alternative Capital Strategies, LLC. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had been loaned $3.1 million with net cash proceeds of $2.6 million, with an remaining balance due of $1.0 million. The note was issued with a 20% original issue discount and is due in full on December 7, 2024. Upon default, the note can be converted at a variable price equal to 30% discount to the average daily volume weighted average price (“VWAP”) for the 20 trading days preceding the date of conversion. As of September 30, 2024, the note is not considered convertible.\n\n**Secured Bridge Loan**\n\nOn September 22, 2023, the Company entered into a secured loan pursuant to a Loan and Security Agreement (the “September 2023 Loan Agreement”), dated as of September 22, 2023 with Synergy Imports, LLC (the “Secured Bridge Loan Lender” or “Synergy”).\n\nPursuant to the September 2023 Loan Agreement, the Secured Bridge Loan Lender agreed to make available to the Company a six-month bridge loan of $2.2 million in new funds. Additionally, the Secured Bridge Loan Lender agreed to defer payments totaling $2,028,604 already owed by the Company under existing payment obligations and potentially defer up to an additional $2,655,778 which may become due pursuant to existing agreements during the term of the September 2023 Loan Agreement.\n\nSubject to certain exceptions, the Company agreed to pledge all of its assets, with the exception of deposit accounts and accounts receivable, as collateral. Additionally, the Company agreed to transfer one US patent and two related foreign patents and a related trademark in exchange for an exclusive license back of such assets in the area of smoking products and accessories in connection with the September 2023 Loan Agreement.\n\nOn May 6, 2024, the Company, Warehouse Goods and Synergy entered into an asset purchase agreement, dated May 1, 2024 (the “Asset Purchase Agreement”) pursuant to which Synergy purchased all of the intellectual property, a specified amount of inventory, and other assets related to the Eyce and DaVinci brands. In consideration for the acquisition, all parties entered into a loan modification agreement, effective May 1, 2024 (the “Loan Modification Agreement”) and an amended and restated secured promissory note, effective May 1, 2024 (the “Amended and Restated Secured Promissory Note”), an amendment to the original Eyce and Davinci Asset Purchase Agreements, a distribution agreement, the termination of a license granted by Eyce, and the termination of certain consulting and employment agreements. As part of the overall modification, the principal balance with Synergy decreased by $2.7 million from $5.1 million. Synergy acquired certain assets from the Company in exchange for the reduction in overall principal owed and as part of the transaction, the Company recognized a gain on the debt modification of $2.2 million. This amount is included in the accompanying financial statements within the statement of operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 within other income (expense). At September 30, 2024, $2.5 million of such financing remained outstanding. The updated date of maturity will be through the end of 2024. \n\n**Future Minimum Principal Payments**\n\nThe following table summarizes future scheduled minimum principal payments of debt at September 30, 2024. Future debt principal payments are presented based upon the stated maturity dates in the respective debt agreement.\n\nSCHEDULE OF MATURITIES OF LONG-TERM DEBT\n\n(in thousands) | Remainder 2024 | 2025 | 2026 | 2027 | 2028 | Total  \n---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \nYear Ending December 31,  \n(in thousands) | Remainder 2024 | 2025 | 2026 | 2027 | 2028 | Total  \nFuture Receivables Financing | $| 4,617 | $| — | $| — | $| — | $| — | $| 4,617  \nNote payable | 1,353 | — | — | — | — | 1,353  \nSecured Bridge Loan | 2,656 | — | — | — | — | 2,656  \nTotal | $| 8,626 | $| — | $| — | $| — | $| — | $| 8,626  \n  \n18  \n---  \n  \n**NOTE 7. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES**\n\n**Legal Proceedings**\n\nIn the ordinary course of business, we are involved in various legal proceedings involving a variety of matters. We do not believe there are any pending legal proceedings that will have a material adverse effect on our business, consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. However, the outcome of such legal matters is inherently unpredictable and subject to significant uncertainties. We have not taken any reserves for litigation for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\n\n**Other Contingencies**\n\nWe are potentially subject to claims related to various non-income taxes (such as sales, value added, consumption, and similar taxes) from various tax authorities, including in jurisdictions in which we already collect and remit such taxes. If the relevant taxing authorities were successfully to pursue these claims, we could be subject to significant additional tax liabilities.\n\nSee “Note 5—Leases” for details of our future minimum lease payments under operating lease liabilities. See “Note 11—Incomes Taxes” for information regarding income tax contingencies.\n\n**NOTE 8. SUPPLEMENTAL FINANCIAL STATEMENT INFORMATION**\n\n**ERC Sale**\n\nAs of December 31, 2022, we had recorded an Employee Retention Credit (“ERC”) receivable of $4.9 million within “Other current assets” on our consolidated balance sheets, and a corresponding amount was included in “Other income (expense), net” in our consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive loss for the year ended December 31, 2022. On February 16, 2023, two of Greenlane Holdings, Inc.’s subsidiaries, Warehouse Goods LLC and KIM International LLC (collectively, the “Company”), entered into an agreement with a third-party institutional investor pursuant to which the investor purchased, for approximately $4.9 million in cash, an economic participation interest, at a discount, in all of the Company’s rights to payment from the United States Internal Revenue Service with respect to the employee retention credits filed by the Company under the ERC program.\n\n**Other Current Assets**\n\nThe following table summarizes the composition of other current assets as of the dates indicated:\n\nSCHEDULE OF OTHER CURRENT ASSETS\n\n(in thousands) | September 30, 2024 | December 31, 2023  \n---|---|---  \nAs of  \n(in thousands) | September 30, 2024 | December 31, 2023  \nOther current assets:  \nVAT refund receivable (Note 2) | $| 224 | $| 78  \nPrepaid expenses | 109 | 1,207  \nIndemnification receivable, net | 7 | 7  \nCustoms bonds | 1,122 | 1,229  \nOther | 817 | 798  \nOther current assets | $| 2,279 | $| 3,319  \n  \n19  \n---  \n  \n**Accrued Expenses and Other Current Liabilities**\n\nThe following table summarizes the composition of accrued expenses and other current liabilities as of the dates indicated:\n\nSCHEDULE OF ACCRUED EXPENSES AND OTHER CURRENT LIABILITIES\n\n(in thousands) | September 30, 2024 | December 31, 2023  \n---|---|---  \nAs of  \n(in thousands) | September 30, 2024 | December 31, 2023  \nAccrued expenses and other current liabilities:  \nVAT payable (including amounts related to VAT matter described in Note 2) | $| 629 | $| 313  \nContingent consideration | — | 1,000  \nAccrued employee compensation | 1,122 | 861  \nAccrued professional fees and other expenses | 267 | 499  \nRefund liability (including accounts receivable credit balances) | — | 68  \nSales tax payable | 507 | 315  \nAccrued expenses and other current liabilities | $| 2,525 | $| 3,056  \n  \n**Customer Deposits**\n\nFor certain product offerings we may receive a deposit from the customer (generally 25% - 50% of the total order cost, but the amount can vary by customer contract), when an order is placed by a customer. We typically complete orders related to customer deposits within one to six months from the date of order, depending on the complexity of the customization and the size of the order, but the order completion timeline can vary by product type and terms of sale with each customer. Changes in our customer deposits liability balance during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were as follows:\n\nSCHEDULE OF CHANGES IN CUSTOMER DEPOSIT LIABILITY\n\n(in thousands) | Customer Deposits  \n---|---  \nBalance as of December 31, 2023 | $| 2,775  \nIncreases due to deposits received, net of other adjustments | —  \nCustomer Overpayments | —  \nRevenue recognized | (1,520| )  \nBalance as of September 30, 2024 | $| 1,255  \n  \n**Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income**\n\nThe components of accumulated other comprehensive income for the periods presented were as follows:\n\nSCHEDULE OF COMPONENTS OF ACCUMULATED COMPREHENSIVE INCOME LOSS\n\n(in thousands) | Foreign Currency Translation | Unrealized Gain or (Loss) on Derivative Instrument | Total  \n---|---|---|---  \nBalance at December 31, 2023 | $|  245 | $|  — | $| 245  \nOther comprehensive income | 3 | — | 3  \nLess: Other comprehensive (income) loss attributable to non-controlling interest  \nBalance at September 30, 2024 | $| 248 | $| — | $| 248  \n(in thousands) | Foreign Currency Translation | Unrealized Gain or (Loss) on Derivative Instrument | Total  \n---|---|---|---  \nBalance at December 31, 2022 | $|  55 | $|  — | $| 55  \nOther comprehensive income (loss) | 183 | — | 183  \nLess: Other comprehensive (income) loss attributable to non-controlling interest | — | — | —  \nBalance at September 30, 2023 | $| 238 | $| — | $| 238  \n  \n**Supplier Concentration**\n\nOur four largest vendors accounted for an aggregate of approximately 43.8% and 18.2% of our total purchases for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, and an aggregate of approximately 89.9% and 82.2% of our total purchases for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively.\n\n20  \n---  \n  \n**Related Party Transactions**\n\nNicholas Kovacevich, our former Chief Corporate Development Officer owns capital stock of Blum Holdings Inc. (“Blum”). Net sales to Blum totaled approximately $0.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. Total accounts receivable due from Blum were approximately $0.4 million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. On February 8, 2023, we filed a lawsuit against Blum in Superior Court of California, Orange County, seeking to compel the repayment of Blum’s open balance due to us. As of the date of these financial statements were available to be issued, there has been a judgement received in favor of the Company.\n\nThree individuals who were employees of the Company at the time are principals in Synergy Imports, LLC the Lender on the Secured Bridge Loan taken out on September 22, 2023, however, none were executive officers or directors of the Company\n\n**NOTE 9. STOCKHOLDERS’ EQUITY**\n\nShares of our Class A common stock have both voting interests and economic interests (i.e., the right to receive distributions or dividends, whether cash or stock, and proceeds upon dissolution, winding up or liquidation), while shares of our Class B common stock have voting interests but no economic interests. Each share of our Class A common stock, and except as otherwise required in the A&R Charter, the holders of Common Stock will vote together as a single class on all matters (or, if any holders of our preferred stock are entitled to vote together with the holders of Common Stock, as a single class with such holders of preferred stock).\n\nEffective June 5, 2023, we completed a one-for-10 reverse stock split (the “2023 Reverse Stock Split” and together with the 2022 Reverse Stock Split, the “Reverse Stock Splits”) of our issued and outstanding shares of Common Stock, as further described in “Note 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies.” As a result of the 2023 Reverse Stock Split, every 10 shares of Common Stock issued and outstanding were converted into one share of Common Stock. We paid cash in lieu of fractional shares, and accordingly, no fractional shares were issued in connection with the 2023 Reverse Stock Split.\n\nOn June 18, 2024, the Board unanimously approved and declared advisable, and recommended that our stockholders approve at a Special Meeting that took place on July 29, 2024, the adoption of the 2024 Amendment to effect a reverse stock split of our Common Stock at any whole number between, and inclusive of, one-for-two to one-for-twenty. Approval of the Proposed 2024 Reverse Stock Split at the 2024 Special Meeting granted the Board the authority, but not the obligation, to file the 2024 Amendment to effect the Proposed 2024 Reverse Stock Split no later than August 5, 2024, with the exact ratio and timing of the Proposed 2024 Reverse Stock Split to be determined at the discretion of the Board. On July 23, 2024, the Board approved the reverse split at a ratio of one-for-11 and the Amendment has been filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware, that became effective on August 5, 2024 at 12:01 AM Eastern Time, before the opening of trading on the Nasdaq. For additional information about the July 29, 2024 Special Meeting and the 2024 Reverse Stock Split, see the Company’s Definitive Proxy Statement filed with the SEC on June 28, 2024 and Form 8-K filed with the SEC on July 31, 2024.\n\nThe Reverse Stock Splits did not change the par value of the Common Stock or the authorized number of shares of Common Stock. All share and per share amounts in these unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and notes thereto have been retroactively adjusted for all periods presented to give effect to the Reverse Stock Splits, including reclassifying an amount equal to the reduction in par value of Common Stock to additional paid-in capital.\n\n**Non-Controlling Interest**\n\nAs discussed in “Note 1—Business Operations and Organization”, we consolidate the financial results of the Operating Company in our consolidated financial statements and report a non-controlling interest related to the Common Units held by non-controlling interest holders. As of December 31, 2022, all Common Units of the Operating Company and Class B common stock had been exchanged for Class A common stock, and we owned 100.0% of the economic interests in the Operating Company. The non-controlling interest in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss represents the portion of the net loss attributable to the economic interest in the Operating Company previously held by the non-controlling holders of Common Units calculated based on the weighted average non-controlling interests’ ownership during the periods presented.\n\n**At-the-Market Equity Offering**\n\nIn August 2021, we established an “at-the-market” equity offering program (the “ATM Program”) that provides for the sale of shares of our Class A common stock having an aggregate offering price of up to $50 million, from time to time, through Cowen and Company, LLC (“Cowen”), as the sales agent. Net proceeds from sales of our shares of Class A common stock under the ATM Program are expected to be used for working capital and general corporate purposes.\n\nSales of our Class A common stock under the ATM Program may be made by means of transactions that are deemed to be an “at the market offering” as defined in Rule 415(a)(4) under the Securities Act, including sales made directly on the Nasdaq Capital Market or sales made to or through a market maker or through an electronic communications network. We are under no obligation to offer and sell shares of our Class A common stock under the ATM Program.\n\n21  \n---  \n  \nShares of our Class A common stock will be issued pursuant to our effective shelf registration statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-257654), and a prospectus supplement relating to the Class A common stock that was filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on April 18, 2022. Pursuant to Instruction I.B.6, in no event will the Company sell Class A common stock through the ATM Program with a value exceeding more than one-third of the Company’s “public float” (the market value of the Company’s Class A common stock and any other equity securities that it issues in the future that are held by non-affiliates) in any twelve-month period so long as the Company’s public float remains below $75.0 million.\n\nOn April 18, 2022, we entered into Amendment No. 1 (the “ATM Amendment”) to the sales agreement dated August 2, 2022 with Cowen. The purpose of the Amendment was to add the limitations imposed on the ATM Program by Instruction I.B.6 to the sales agreement. At the time of our entry into the ATM Amendment, approximately $37.3 million in shares remained available for issuance under the ATM Program.\n\nDue to the untimely filing of our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended March 31, 2023 we are unable to issue additional shares of Class A common stock pursuant to the ATM Program or otherwise use the Shelf Registration Statement for a period of 12 months, which will limit our liquidity options in the capital markets.\n\nThe table below summarizes sales of our Class A common stock under the ATM program:\n\nSUMMARIZES SALES OF OUR CLASS A COMMON STOCK\n\n($ in thousands) | August 2021 (Inception) through September 30, 2024  \n---|---  \nClass A shares sold | 8,842  \nGross proceeds | $| 12,684  \nFees paid to sales agent | $| 381  \nNet proceeds | $| 12,303  \n  \n**Common Stock and Warrant Offerings**\n\n_July 2023 Offering_\n\nOn June 29, 2023, we entered into securities purchase agreements with certain investors, pursuant to which we agreed to issue and sell an aggregate of 50,952 shares of our Class A common stock, pre-funded warrants to purchase up to 317,013 shares of our Class A common stock (the “July 2023 Pre-Funded Warrants”) and warrants to purchase up to 735,931 shares of our Class A common stock (the “July 2023 Standard Warrants”). The July 2023 units each consisted of one share of Class A common stock or a July 2023 Pre-Funded Warrant and two July 2023 Standard Warrants to purchase one share of our Class A common stock. The July 2023 units were offered pursuant to an effective Registration Statement on Form S-1. The July 2023 Standard Warrants are exercisable immediately at an exercise price equal to $1.05 per share of Class A common stock for a period of five years. Each July 2023 Pre-Funded Warrant is exercisable immediately with no expiration date for one share of Class A common stock at an exercise price of $0.0001. The July 2023 Offering generated gross proceeds of approximately $4.3 million and net proceeds to the Company of approximately $3.8 million.\n\nAs of the date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, all July 2023 Pre-Funded Warrants have been exercised, based upon which we issued additional shares of our Class A common stock, for de minimis net proceeds.\n\nIn connection with the July 2023 Offering, the Company entered into privately negotiated agreements with holders participating in the offering to amend existing outstanding warrants to purchase up to 122,215 shares of Class A common stock that were previously issued in connection with the June 2022 and October 2022 Offerings at exercise prices per share of $50.00 and $9.00, respectively, and expire on December 29, 2027 and November 1, 2029, respectively (collectively, the “Prior Warrants”), effective upon the closing of the July 2023 Offering to reduce the exercise price of the Prior Warrants to $1.05, the exercise price of the warrants to purchase shares of Class A common stock offered in the July 2023 Offering. All other terms of the Prior Warrants remained unchanged.\n\n_August 2024 Private Placement_\n\nOn August 12, 2024, the Company entered into a securities purchase agreement with a single institutional investor pursuant to which we agreed to issue and sell an aggregate of 58,000 shares of our Class A common stock, pre-funded warrants to purchase up to 2,305,637 shares of our Class A common stock (the “August 2024 Pre-Funded Warrants”) and warrants to purchase up to 4,727,274 shares of our Class A common stock (the “August 2024 Standard Warrants”). for aggregate gross cash proceeds of $6.5 million. In connection with the private placement, the Company will issue an aggregate of 2,363,637 units and pre-funded units. The pre-funded units will be sold at the same purchase price as the units, less the pre-funded warrant exercise price of $0.00001. Each unit and pre-funded unit will consist of one share of common stock (or one pre-funded warrant) and two common warrants, each exercisable for one share of common stock at an exercise price of $2.50 per share. The common warrant will be exercisable on the initial exercise date described in the common warrant and will expire 5.0 years from such date.\n\nAs of September 30, 2024, there were 2,176,647 warrants that remained unexercised.\n\n**Net Loss Per Share**\n\nBasic net loss per share of Class A common stock is computed by dividing net loss attributable to Greenlane by the weighted-average number of shares of Class A common stock outstanding during the period. Diluted net loss per share of Class A common stock is computed by dividing net loss attributable to Greenlane by the weighted-average number of shares of Class A common stock outstanding adjusted to give effect to potentially dilutive instruments.\n\nA reconciliation of the numerator and denominator used in the calculation of basic and diluted net loss per share of our Class A common stock is as follows (in thousands, except per share amounts):\n\nSCHEDULE OF EARNINGS PER SHARE BASIC AND DILUTED\n\nThree months ended September 30, | Nine months ended September 30,  \n---|---  \n(in thousands, except per share data) | 2024 | 2023 | 2024 | 2023  \nNumerator:  \nNet loss | $| (3,757| ) | $| (10,098| ) | $| (8,882| ) | $| (27,869| )  \nLess: Net income (loss) attributable to non-controlling interests | — | 19 | (17| ) | (27| )  \nPlus: Deemed Dividend on “October 2022 Standard Warrants” | — | (388| ) | — | (388| )  \nNet loss attributable to Class A common stockholders | $| (3,757| ) | $| (10,467| ) | $| (8,899| ) | $| (28,284| )  \nDenominator:  \nWeighted average shares of Class A common stock outstanding | 1,647 | 501 | 726 | 265  \nNet loss per share of Class A common stock - basic and diluted | $| (2.28| ) | $| (20.89| ) | $| (12.26| ) | $| (106.73| )  \n  \n22  \n---  \n  \nAs of September 30, 2024, there were 2,245,629 warrants that remained unexercised which we used in determining the weighted average shares outstanding.\n\nFor the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, stock options and warrants to purchase Class A common stock were excluded from the weighted-average in the computation of diluted net loss per share of Class A common stock because the effect would have been anti-dilutive.\n\n**NOTE 10. COMPENSATION PLANS**\n\n**Amended and Restated 2019 Equity Incentive Plan**\n\nIn April 2019, we adopted the 2019 Equity Incentive Plan (the “2019 Plan”). In August 2021, we adopted, and our shareholders approved, the Amended and Restated 2019 Equity Incentive Plan (the “Amended 2019 Plan”), which amends and restates the 2019 Plan in its entirety. At our 2022 Annual Meeting of Stockholders on August 4, 2022, stockholders approved the Second Amended and Restated 2019 Equity Incentive Plan (the “Second Amended 2019 Plan”) which, among other things, increased the number of shares of Class A common stock authorized for issuance under the Amended 2019 Plan. Following the effect of the Reverse Stock Splits, the total number of shares of Class A common stock authorized for issuance is 10,000 shares.\n\nThe Second Amended 2019 Plan provides eligible participants with compensation opportunities in the form of cash and equity incentive awards. The Second Amended 2019 Plan is designed to enhance our ability to attract, retain and motivate our employees, directors, and executive officers, and incentivizes them to increase our long-term growth and equity value in alignment with the interests of our stockholders.\n\nOn June 2, 2023, the Company’s stockholders approved a third amendment and restatement of the 2019 Plan (the “Third Amended Plan”). The Third Amended Plan, among other things, increases the number of shares of Class A common stock authorized for issuance under the Second Amended 2019 Plan by 19,078 shares to an aggregate of 29,078 shares. As of the date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, we have not filed a Registration Statement on Form S-8 with the Securities and Exchange Commission to register the additional shares authorized under the Third Amended Plan.\n\n**Equity-Based Compensation Expense**\n\nEquity-based compensation expense is included within “salaries, benefits and payroll taxes” in our condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. We recognized equity-based compensation expense as follows:\n\nSCHEDULE OF EQUITY BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE\n\n(in thousands) | 2024 | 2023 | 2024 | 2023  \n---|---|---|---|---  \nFor the three months ended September 30, | For the nine months ended September 30,  \n(in thousands) | 2024 | 2023 | 2024 | 2023  \nStock options - Class A common stock | $| — | $| (77| ) | $| — | $| 2  \nRestricted shares - Class A common stock | — | 8 | 86 | 29  \nTotal equity-based compensation expense | $| — | $| (69| ) | $| 86 | $| 31  \n  \nAs of September 30, 2024, there was no remaining unrecognized compensation expense.\n\n23  \n---  \n  \n**NOTE 11. INCOME TAXES**\n\nAs a result of the IPO and the related transactions completed in April 2019, we owned a portion of the Common Units of the Operating Company, which is treated as a partnership for U.S. federal and most applicable state and local income tax purposes. As a partnership, the Operating Company was generally not subject to U.S. federal and certain state and local income taxes. Any taxable income or loss generated by the Operating Company was passed through to and included in the taxable income or loss of its members, including Greenlane, on a pro-rata basis, in accordance with the terms of the Operating Agreement. The Operating Company was also subject to taxes in foreign jurisdictions. We are a corporation subject to U.S. federal income taxes, in addition to state and local income taxes, based on our share of the Operating Company’s pass-through taxable income.\n\nEffective on December 31, 2022, the Operating Company became wholly owned by us. As a result, the Operating Company’s tax status was converted from a partnership to a disregarded entity. Starting in 2023, 100% of the Operating Company’s U.S. income and expenses is included in our US and state tax returns.\n\nDuring the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, management performed an assessment of the realizability of our deferred tax assets based upon which management determined that it is not more likely than not that the results of operations will generate sufficient taxable income to realize portions of the net operating loss benefits. Consequently, we established a full valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets and reflected a carrying balance of $0 as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. In the event that management determines that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of their net recorded amount, an adjustment to the valuation allowance will be made, which would reduce December the provision for income taxes.\n\n**Uncertain Tax Positions**\n\nFor the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, we did not have any unrecognized tax benefits as a result of tax positions taken during a prior period or during the current period. No interest or penalties have been recorded as a result of tax uncertainties. The Company is subject to audit examination for federal and state purposes for the years 2019 – 2023. As of the date these financial statements were issued, there were not any ongoing income tax audits.\n\n**Tax Receivable Agreement (TRA)**\n\nWe entered into the TRA with the Operating Company and each of the members (other than Greenlane Holdings, Inc.) that provides for the payment by the Operating Company to the members of 85% of the amount of tax benefits, if any, that we may actually realize (or in some circumstances are deemed to realize) as a result of (i) increases in tax basis resulting from any future redemptions of Common Units as described in “Note 1—Business Operations and Organization” and (ii) certain other tax benefits attributable to payments made under the TRA.\n\nThe annual tax benefits are computed by calculating the income taxes due, including such tax benefits, and the income taxes due without such benefits. The Operating Company expects to benefit from the remaining 15% of any tax benefits that it may actually realize. The TRA payments are not conditioned upon any continued ownership interest in the Operating Company. The rights of each noncontrolling interest holder under the TRA are assignable to transferees of its interest in the Operating Company. The timing and amount of aggregate payments due under the TRA may vary based on a number of factors, including the amount and timing of the taxable income the Operating Company generates each year and the applicable tax rate.\n\nAs noted above, we evaluated the realizability of the deferred tax assets resulting from the IPO and the related transactions completed in April 2019 and established a full valuation allowance against those benefits. As a result, we determined that the amount or timing of payments to noncontrolling interest holders under the TRA are no longer probable or reasonably estimable. Based on this assessment, our TRA liability was $0 as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023.\n\nIf utilization of the deferred tax assets subject to the TRA becomes more likely than not in the future, we will record a liability related to the TRA, which would be recognized as expense within our condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive (loss) income.\n\nDuring the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, we did not make any payments, inclusive of interest, to members of the Operating Company pursuant to the TRA.\n\n24  \n---  \n  \n**NOTE 12. SUBSEQUENT EVENTS**\n\nOn October 29, 2024, the Company entered into an Exchange Agreement with its Senior Subordinated Lender, whereby the Company agreed to exchange an aggregate of $4,617,307 of debt originally owed to Agile Capital Funding LLC and Cedar Advance LLC in a 3(a)(9) exchange for new Senior Subordinated Notes in the principal amount of $4,000,000 due one year from issuance (the “Exchange Note”), reducing outstanding indebtedness by approximately $617,000. The Exchange Note is convertible at the option of the holder at $3.17 per share. In connection with the Exchange, the Company issued an aggregate of 1,261,830 five year warrants with an exercise price of $3.04 per share (the “Exchange Warrants”).\n\nIn addition, pursuant to the terms of the Exchange Agreement, the Company agreed to issue warrants to the Holders, with an initial exercise price of $3.04, exercisable 180 days after issuance (the “Exchange Inducement Warrants”). The Exchange Inducement Warrants were issued to incentivize the holders to exercise some or all of their existing warrants originally issued on August 13, 2024 (the “Existing Warrants”) for cash, which existing warrants have an exercise price of $2.50 per share. The Exchange Inducement Warrants are initially exercisable for zero shares, but to the extent that the Holders exercise any of such Existing Warrants during the one-hundred sixty day inducement period, the Exchange Inducement Warrants will become exercisable on April 30, 2025 for 200% of the number of Existing Warrants exercised for cash during such inducement period.\n\nAlso, pursuant to the Exchange Agreement, the Senior Subordinated Lender agreed that it will exercise its Existing Warrants for cash prior to exercising any of its outstanding pre-funded warrants, contingent on the market price of the common stock being above $2.50 per share and certain other conditions. The above agreement will terminate upon the Company receiving certain cash proceeds and prepaying at least $2,250,000 of Cobra Alternative Capital Strategies LLC (“Cobra”) Notes.\n\nOn October 29, 2024, the Company entered into the First Amendment to Amended and Restated Secured Promissory Note (the “Note Amendment”) with Cobra. Pursuant to the Note Amendment, Cobra agreed to extend the Maturity Date of its senior promissory note dated May 1, 2024, which is currently due. The new Maturity Date will be October 29, 2025. In consideration for the extension, the Company (i) agreed to make such Notes convertible at the option of Cobra with a conversion price of $3.17 per share, (ii) agreed to prepay Cobra’s debt with 50% of any money raised by the Company from warrant exercise proceeds and from capital raise transactions, and (iii) issued Cobra an aggregate of 500,000 five year warrants with an exercise price of $3.04 per share which are identical to the Exchange Warrants.\n\n25  \n---  \n  \n**ITEM 2.

In 2021, we completed several acquisitions along with a transformative merger with KushCo Holdings, adding a significant industrial line of business to the Greenlane platform. These acquisitions strengthened our leading position as a consumer ancillary products business and significantly expanded our customer network, bringing strategic relationships with leading cannabis multi-state-operators (“MSOs”), cannabis single-state operators (“SSOs”), and Canadian licensed-producers (“LPs”). Greenlane is a leading ancillary cannabis company, providing a wide array of consumer ancillary products and industrial ancillary products to thousands of cannabis producers, processors, brands, and retailers (“related Cannabis Operators”), in addition to specialty retailers, smoke shops and head shops, convenience stores, and consumers directly through our own proprietary web stores and large online marketplaces such as Amazon.\n\nWe have been developing a world-class portfolio of our own proprietary brands (the “Greenlane Brands”) and carefully curated third-party products that we believe will, over time, deliver higher margins and create long-term value for our customers and shareholders. Our wholly-owned Greenlane Brands includes our recently launched more affordable product line – Groove, innovative silicone pipes and accessories and premium ancillary product brand – Higher Standards. We also have category exclusive licenses for the premium Marley Natural branded products, as well as the K. Haring Glass Collection.\n\nSince the end of 2021, the Company has invested significantly in technology, including its e-commerce platforms, internal ERP systems, and B2B capabilities. Our world-class product portfolio is offered to customers through our proprietary, owned and operated e-commerce platforms which include Vapor.com, PuffItUp.com, HigherStandards.com, MarleyNaturalShop.com and Wholesale.Greenlane.com. These platforms allow us to reach customers directly with helpful resources and a seamless purchasing experience.\n\nWe merchandise vaporizers, packaging, and other ancillary products in the United States, Canada, Europe and Latin America. We distribute products to retailers through wholesale operations and distribute products to consumers through our e-commerce platforms We operate our own distribution centers in the United States, while also utilizing third-party logistics (“3PL”) locations in Canada. We have made tremendous progress consolidating and streamlining our warehouse and distribution operations over the last two years.\n\nWe manage our business in two different, but complementary, business segments. The first is the Consumer Goods segment, which focuses on serving consumers across wholesale, retail, and e-commerce operations—offering both our Greenlane Brands as well as ancillary products and accessories from select leading third-party brands, such as Storz and Bickel, Grenco Science, PAX, Arizer and more. The Consumer Goods segment forms a central part of our growth strategy, especially as it relates to scaling our own portfolio of higher-margin proprietary owned brands. In addition to our Consumer Goods segment, we have our Industrial Goods segment, which focuses on serving Cannabis Operators by providing ancillary products essential to their daily operations and growth, such as packaging and vaporization solutions, including our Greenlane Brand Pollen Gear. Refer to “Note 12— Segment Reporting” within this Form 10-Q for additional information on our reportable segments.\n\n27  \n---  \n  \n_Plan to Accelerate Path to Profitability and Capitalize the Business_\n\nIn today’s economic landscape, particularly within the cannabis industry, achieving profitability and preserving working capital are paramount. At Greenlane, we are intensely focused on making our business profitable and well-capitalized for long-term sustainability. Our key initiatives include:\n\n1. | Technology Enhancements: We remain fully committed to improving our technology, particularly our B2B and e-commerce platforms, to provide a seamless shopping experience for our wholesale and retail customers.  \n---|---  \n2. | Facility Footprint Rationalization: In 2023 and 2024, we optimized our facilities footprint by reducing warehouse and office space while increasing operational efficiency and improving fulfillment practices. The full benefit of those efforts are expected to be realized in 2024.   \n3. | Headcount Reduction: We have significantly reduced our headcount and associated salary expenses, focusing on maintaining a core group of key employees as we collectively right-size the business.  \n4. | Cost Structure Optimization: We continue to reduce our overall cost structure while improving margins. In April 2023, we formed two strategic partnerships (described below in greater detail) to increase margins and significantly reduce working capital requirements in our Industrial Goods segment. Similarly, our Consumer Goods segment restructured arrangements with several third-party brands in 2022 and 2023 to reduce our working capital needs.  \n5. | Inventory Management: In 2023, we implemented a new inventory management and lifecycle strategy that is focused on a quarterly turn and a regular review of inventory to avoid future write-offs.  \n6. | Sales Force Upgrade: We have upgraded and will continue to upgrade our sales force from a solely account management centric team to a skilled and driven sales team to acquire new customers while maintaining excellent service with our existing customers  \n7. | Product Innovation: We launched Groove, an innovative new product line with a value-based price point and in 2024 we have begun to expand our product offering to further enhance our assortment available to our customers.   \n8. | Capital Investment: We continue to seek opportunities for securing investment capital to leverage our platform, increase availability and reduce stockouts of our high demand third-party brands, invest in marketing and sales, and improve our product offerings.   \n  \nManagement believes that these initiatives will significantly reduce costs, help accelerate the Company’s path to profitability, support business growth, and allow the Company to reinvest capital into its highest demand and highest potential product lines.\n\nDuring 2023 and 2024, the Company received capital from various sources permitting it to right-size the business and position the company for growth. Such sources are described in greater detail in the Liquidity and Capital Resources Section of this report.\n\nDuring 2023 and 2024, the Company also entered into certain arrangements to reduce working capital requirements and improve its balance sheet.\n\nIn April 2023, we entered into two strategic partnerships. First, we entered into a strategic partnership (the “MJ Packaging Partnership”) with A&A Global Imports d/b/a MarijuanaPackaging.com (“MJ Pack”), a leading provider of packaging solutions to the cannabis industry. On August 8, 2024 the Company terminated its strategic partnership with MJ Packaging and is resuming its business as a direct provider of packaging solutions to the cannabis industry. MJ Packaging however, remains a distribution customer of the Company. Second, we entered into a strategic partnership with an affiliate of one of our existing vape suppliers (“Vape Partner”) to service certain key customers with vaporizer goods and services (the “Vape Partnership”). As part of the Vape Partnership, we will introduce our Vape Partner to certain key customers, assist with the promotion and the sale of certain vaporizer goods and services, and help coordinate the logistics, storage and distribution of such vaporizer products. If our Vape Partner and key customer(s) enter into a direct relationship, the customers would directly purchase vaporizer goods and services, which we currently sell them, directly from our Vape Partner and we would no longer need to purchase such vape inventory on behalf of such key customer(s). In exchange we would earn quarterly and annual commission payments from our strategic partner. While the strategic partnership may result in a decrease in top line revenue for these vape products, this partnership combined with some of our other restructuring initiatives should allow us to reduce our overall cost-structure and enhance our margins, thereby improving our balance sheet.\n\n28  \n---  \n  \nOn May 6, 2024, the Company, Warehouse Goods and Synergy entered into an asset purchase agreement, dated May 1, 2024 (the “Asset Purchase Agreement”) pursuant to which Synergy purchased all of the intellectual property, a specified amount of inventory, and other assets related to the Eyce and DaVinci brands. In consideration for the acquisition, all parties entered into a loan modification agreement, effective May 1, 2024 (the “Loan Modification Agreement”) and an amended and restated secured promissory note, effective May 1, 2024 (the “Amended and Restated Secured Promissory Note”), an amendment to the original Eyce and Davinci Asset Purchase Agreements, a distribution agreement, the termination of a license granted by Eyce, and the termination of certain consulting and employment agreements. As part of the overall modification, the principal balance with Synergy decreased by $2.7 million from $5.1 million. Synergy acquired certain assets from the Company in exchange for the reduction in overall principal owed and as part of the transaction, the Company recognized a gain on the debt modification of $2.2 million. This amount is included in the accompanying financial statements within the statement of operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 within other income (expense). At September 30, 2024, $2.7 million of such financing remained outstanding. As of the filing date of this statement and as a result of restructuring efforts, the maturity of this note is October 2025.\n\n_USPS PACT Act Exemption_\n\nOn January 11, 2022, we announced via press release that the United States Postal Service (the “USPS”) had approved our application for a business and regulatory exemption to the PACT Act (with respect to the business and regulatory exemption granted by the USPS, the “PACT Act Exemption”), allowing us to ship vaporizers and accessories classified as electronic nicotine delivery systems (“ENDS”) products to other compliant businesses. With this approval, over 97% of our total annual sales became eligible for shipment by freight, USPS and other major parcel carriers. The PACT Act Exemption also enables us to partner with other businesses that ship ENDS products and had their supply chains disrupted by PACT Act compliance.\n\nOn June 24, 2022, we provided via press release an update on the progress of the PACT Act Exemption, following our successful implementation of the controls, processes and systems required by the USPS in connection with the shipment of ENDS products. We expect the ability to fulfill ENDS orders with the USPS to allow us to reduce shipping costs, decrease fulfillment times and enhance the overall customer experience for approved wholesale customers.\n\n_Reverse Stock Split_\n\nOn June 2, 2023, we filed a Certificate of Amendment to the A&R Charter with the SSSD, which effected a one-for-10 reverse stock split (the “2023 Reverse Stock Split” and together with the 2022 Reverse Stock Split, the “Reverse Stock Splits”) of our issued and outstanding shares of Common Stock at 5:01 PM Eastern Time on June 5, 2023. As a result of the 2023 Reverse Stock Split, every 10 shares of common stock issued and outstanding were converted into one share of common stock. We paid cash in lieu of fractional shares, and accordingly, no fractional shares were issued in connection with the 2023 Reverse Stock Split.\n\nThe Reverse Stock Split did not change the par value of the Common Stock or the authorized number of shares of Common Stock. All outstanding options, restricted stock awards, warrants and other securities entitling their holders to purchase or otherwise receive shares of our Common Stock have been adjusted as a result of the Reverse Stock Split, as required by the terms of each security. The number of shares available to be awarded under our Second Amended and Restated 2019 Equity Incentive Plan have also been appropriately adjusted. See “Note 10 — Compensation Plans” for more information.\n\nOn July 23, 2024, the Board approved the reverse split at a ratio of one-for-11 and the Amendment has been filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware, which became effective on August 5, 2024 at 12:01 AM Eastern Time, before the opening of trading on the Nasdaq.\n\nAll share and per share amounts were retroactively adjusted for all periods presented to give effect to the Reverse Stock Split.\n\n**Critical Accounting Estimates**\n\nWe prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”). The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. We evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis. We base our estimates on historical experience, outside advice from parties believed to be experts in such matters, and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Judgments and uncertainties affecting the application of those policies may result in materially different amounts being reported under different conditions or using different assumptions. See “Note 2—Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K for a description the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.\n\n**_Inventories_**\n\nInventories, consisting of finished products, are primarily accounted for using the weighted-average method, and are valued at the lower of cost and net realizable value. This valuation requires us to make judgments, based on currently available information, about the likely method of disposition, such as through sales to customers or liquidations. Assumptions about the future disposition of inventory are inherently uncertain and changes in our estimates and assumptions may cause us to realize material write-downs in the future.\n\n29  \n---  \n  \n**_Income Taxes and TRA Liability_**\n\nWe are a corporation subject to income taxes in the United States. Certain subsidiaries of the Operating Company are taxable separately from us. Our proportional share of the Operating Company’s subsidiaries’ provisions are included in our consolidated financial statements.\n\nAs of December 31, 2022, we held all the outstanding Common Units in the Operating Company and are the sole member. As a result, in 2023, 100% of the Operating Company’s US and state income and expenses are now included in our US and state tax returns.\n\nOur deferred income tax assets and liabilities are computed for differences between the tax basis and financial statement amounts that will result in taxable or deductible amounts in the future. We compute deferred balances based on enacted tax laws and applicable rates for the periods in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income. A valuation allowance is recognized for deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the net deferred tax assets will not be realized. In making such a determination, we consider all available positive and negative evidence, including future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, projected future taxable income, tax-planning strategies, and results of recent operations. If we determine we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets for which a valuation allowance had been recorded, then we would adjust the deferred tax asset valuation allowance, which would reduce our provision for income taxes.\n\nWe evaluate the tax positions taken on income tax returns that remain open and positions expected to be taken on the current year tax returns to identify uncertain tax positions. Unrecognized tax benefits on uncertain tax positions are recorded on the basis of a two-step process in which (1) we determine whether it is more likely than not that the tax positions will be sustained on the basis of the technical merits of the position and (2) for those tax positions that meet the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold, the largest amount of tax benefit that is more than 50 percent likely to be realized is recognized. Interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits are recorded in income tax benefit. We have no uncertain tax positions that qualify for inclusion in our consolidated financial statements.\n\nIn addition to tax expenses, we may incur expenses related to our operations and may be required to make payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement (the “TRA”), which could be significant. Pursuant to the Greenlane Operating Agreement, Greenlane Holdings, LLC will generally make pro rata tax distributions to its members in an amount sufficient to fund all or part of their tax obligations with respect to the taxable income of Greenlane Holdings, LLC that is allocated to them and possibly in excess of such amount.\n\n**Recent Accounting Pronouncements**\n\nSee “Note 2—Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of our Form 10-K filed on July 19, 2024.\n\n**Results of Operations**\n\nThe following table presents operating results for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023:\n\nThree Months Ended September 30, | Nine Months Ended September 30,  \n---|---  \n% of Net sales | Change | % of Net sales | Change  \n2024 | 2023 | 2024 | 2023 | $ | % | 2024 | 2023 | 2024 | 2023 | $ | %  \nNet sales | 4,038 | 11,800 | 100.0| % | 100.0| % | $| (7,762| ) | (65.8| )% | 11,616 | 55,384 | 100.0| % | 100.0| % | $| (43,768| ) | (79.0| )%  \nCost of sales | 1,011 | 8,671 | 25.0| % | 73.5| % | (7,660| ) | (88.3| )% | 6,066 | 42,162 | 52.2| % | 76.1| % | (36,096| ) | (85.6| )%  \nGross profit | 3,027 | 3,129 | 75.0| % | 26.5| % | (102| ) | (3.3| )% | 5,550 | 13,222 | 47.8| % | 23.9| % | (7,672| ) | (58.0| )%  \nOperating expenses:  \nSalaries, benefits and payroll taxes | 1,609 | 4,059 | 39.8| % | 34.4| % | (2,450| ) | (60.4| )% | 6,066 | 14,586 | 52.2| % | 26.3| % | (8,520| ) | (58.4| )%  \nGeneral and administrative | 1,771 | 5,433 | 43.9| % | 46.0| % | (3,662| ) | (67.4| )% | 6,864 | 20,209 | 59.1| % | 36.5| % | (13,345| ) | (66.0| )%  \nDepreciation and amortization | 185 | 524 | 4.6| % | 7.4| % | (339| ) | (64.7| )% | 635 | 1,492 | 5.5| % | 2.7| % | (857| ) | (57.4| )%  \nTotal operating expenses | 3,565 | 10,016 | 88.3| % | 84.8| % | (6,451| ) | (64.4| )% | 13,565 | 36,287 | 116.8| % | 65.5| % | (22,722| ) | (62.6| )%  \nLoss from operations | (538| ) | (6,887| ) | (13.3| )% | (58.3| )% | 6,349 | (92.2| )% | (8,015| ) | (23,065| ) | (69.0| )% | (41.6| )% | 15,050 | (65.3| )%  \nOther income (expense), net:  \nInterest expense | (3,219| ) | (3,415| ) | (79.7| )% | (28.9| )% | 196 | (5.7| )% | (4,030| ) | (5,148| ) | (34.7| )% | (9.3| )% | 1,118 | (21.7| )%  \nChange in fair value of contingent consideration | - | - | - | - | - | -| % | 1,000 | - | 8.6| % | - | 1,000 | 100.0| %  \nGain on extinguishment of debt | - | - | - | - | - | -| % | 2,166 | - | 18.6| % | - | 2,166 | 100.0| %  \nOther income (expense), net | - | 204 | - | 1.7| % | (204| ) | (100| )% | (3| ) | 338 | -| % | 0.6| % | (341| ) | (100.9| )%  \nTotal other expense, net | (3,219| ) | (3,211| ) | (79.7| )% | (27.2| )% | (8| ) | 0.2| % | (867| ) | (4,810| ) | (7.5| )% | (8.7| ) | 3,943 | (82.0| )  \nLoss before income taxes | (3,757| ) | (10,098| ) | (93.0| )% | (85.5| )% | 6,341 | (62.8| )% | (8,882| ) | (27,875| ) | (76.5| )% | (50.3| )% | 18,993 | (68.1| )%  \nProvision for (benefit from) income taxes | - | - | -| % | —| % | - | -| % | - | (6| ) | -| % | —| % | 6 | (100.0| )%  \nNet loss | (3,757| ) | (10,098| ) | (93.0| )% | (85.5| )% | 6,341 | (62.8| )% | (8,882| ) | (27,869| ) | (76.5| )% | (50.3| )% | 18,987 | (68.1| )%  \nNet income (loss) attributable to non-controlling interest | - | 19 | - | 0.2| % | (19| ) | (100.0| )% | (17| ) | (27| ) | (0.1| )% | (0.2| )% | 10 | (37.0| )%  \nNet loss attributable to Greenlane Holdings, Inc. | $| (3,757| ) | $| (10,117| ) | (93.0| )% | (85.7| )% | $| 6,360 | (62.9| )% | $| (8,865| ) | $| (27,842| ) | (76.4| )% | (50.1| )% | 18,977 | (68.2| )%  \n  \n30  \n---  \n  \n_Consolidated Results of Operations_\n\n_Net Sales_\n\nFor the three months ended September 30, 2024, net sales were approximately $4.0 million, compared to approximately $11.8 million for the same period in 2024, representing a decrease of $7.8 million, or 65.8%. The year-over-year decrease in net sales was due to a major restructuring of our Industrial Group in April of 2023, involving our packaging and industrial vaping product lines; transitioning much of this business from a gross sales to a commission structure to preserve working capital. Revenues decreased in the Consumer Brands Group due, in part, to restructuring efforts and shift in strategy to focus on in-house brands that carry a higher margin profile while rationalizing third-party brand offerings, which generated top line revenue with lower margins. The consumer products were affected by the inability to access capital markets on equitable terms, resulting in stock-outs and shortages of higher velocity inventory. The Company is continuing to focus on profitable revenue and as a result top line revenue has significantly been reduced. Concurrently, the Company has continued its focus on right-sizing the business during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 and through present, in an effort to reduce sales and marketing costs and reduce or eliminate certain administrative functions.\n\nFor the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net sales were approximately $11.6 million, compared to approximately $55.4 million for the same period in 2024, representing a decrease of $43.8 million, or 79.0%.

Concurrently, the Company has continued its focus on right-sizing the business during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 and through present, in an effort to reduce sales and marketing costs and reduce or eliminate certain administrative functions.\n\n_Cost of Sales and Gross Margin_\n\nFor the three months ended September 30, 2024, cost of sales decreased by $7.7 million, or 88.3%, as compared to the same period in 2023. The decrease in the cost of sales is driven by the 65.8% decrease in revenue in addition to a decrease in damaged and obsolete inventory write-offs.\n\nFor the nine months ended September 30, 2024, cost of sales decreased by $36.1 million, or 85.6%, as compared to the same period in 2023. The decrease in the cost of sales is driven by the 79.0% decrease in revenue in addition to a decrease in damaged and obsolete inventory write-offs.\n\nGross margin percentage increased 48.4% to 75.0% for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 26.5% for the same period in 2023.\n\nGross margin percentage increased 23.9% to 47.8% for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 23.9% for the same period in 2023.\n\n_Salaries, Benefits and Payroll Taxes_\n\nSalaries, benefits and payroll taxes expenses decreased by approximately $2.5 million, or 60.4%, to $1.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to $4.1 million for the same period in 2023. The decrease is related to the reduction in workforce to right-size the business and focus on profitability.\n\nSalaries, benefits and payroll taxes expenses decreased by approximately $8.5 million, or 58.4%, to $6.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to $14.6 million for the same period in 2023. The decrease is related to the reduction in workforce to right-size the business and focus on profitability.\n\nAs we continue to closely monitor the evolving business landscape, we remain focused on identifying cost-saving opportunities while delivering on our strategy to recruit, train, promote and retain the most talented and success-driven personnel in the industry.\n\n31  \n---  \n  \n_General and Administrative Expenses_\n\nGeneral and administrative expenses decreased by approximately $3.7 million, or 67.4%, for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period in 2023. The decrease is related to major restructuring effort by the Company to reduce cost and right-size the business. Compared with the first quarter of 2023, the Company focused on reduction across the board in general and administrative expenses and saw large decreases in professional and outside services, facility expenses, outbound freight, other general and administrative, marketing, taxes and licenses, and general insurance.\n\nGeneral and administrative expenses decreased by approximately $13.3 million, or 66.0%, for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period in 2023. The decrease is related to major restructuring effort by the Company to reduce cost and right-size the business. Compared with the first quarter of 2023, the Company focused on reduction across the board in general and administrative expenses and saw large decreases in professional and outside services, facility expenses, outbound freight, other general and administrative, marketing, taxes and licenses, and general insurance.\n\n_Depreciation and Amortization Expense_\n\nDepreciation and amortization expense decreased $0.3 million, or 64.7%, for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period in 2023. The decrease is related to a major restructuring effort to reduce cost and right-size the business resulting in the sale and disposal of assets related to reducing our warehousing and office footprint.\n\nDepreciation and amortization expense decreased $0.9 million, or 57.4%, for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period in 2023. The decrease is related to a major restructuring effort to reduce cost and right-size the business resulting in the sale and disposal of assets related to reducing our warehousing and office footprint.\n\n_Other Income (Expense), Net_\n\n_Interest expense._\n\nInterest expense decreased approximately $0.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023. The decrease is primarily related to reduction in overall debt financing and refinancing debt for more favorable terms.\n\nInterest expense decreased approximately $1.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023. The decrease is primarily related to reduction in overall debt financing and refinancing debt for more favorable terms.\n\n_Change in fair value of contingent consideration_\n\nThere was a change in fair value of contingent consideration of approximately $1.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023. The change is primarily related to known reductions in earnouts related to Davinci and Eyce products.\n\n32  \n---  \n  \n_Gain on debt extinguishment_\n\nThere was an increase in gain on debt extinguishment of approximately $2.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period in 2023. The change is primarily related to a difference in the reduction in overall debt modification with Synergy, offset by the carrying value of the Davinci and Eyce assets acquired by Synergy. For further information, see Note 6, “Debt” of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q.\n\n_Provision for (Benefit from) Income Taxes_\n\nFor the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, the effective tax rate differed from the U.S. federal statutory tax rate of 21% primarily due to the Operating Company’s pass-through structure for U.S. income tax purposes (through December 31, 2022), the relative mix in earnings and losses in the U.S. versus foreign tax jurisdictions, and the valuation allowance against the deferred tax asset.\n\n**Liquidity, Capital Resources and Going Concern**\n\nOur primary requirements for liquidity and capital are working capital, debt service related to recent acquisitions and general corporate needs. Our primary sources of liquidity are our cash on hand and the cash flow that we generate from our operations, as well as proceeds other equity issuances. As of September 30, 2024, we had approximately $2.3 million of cash, of which none was restricted and $0.1 million was held in foreign bank accounts, and approximately $2.5 million of negative working capital, which is calculated as total current assets minus total current liabilities, as compared to approximately $0.5 million of cash, of which $0.1 million was held in foreign bank accounts, and approximately $3.7 million of working capital as of December 31, 2023. The repatriation of cash balances from our foreign subsidiaries could have adverse tax impacts or be subject to capital controls; however, these balances are generally available to fund the ordinary business operations of our foreign subsidiaries without legal or other restrictions.\n\nWe believe that our cash on hand and the cash flow that we generate from our operations will not be sufficient to fund our working capital and capital expenditure requirements, as well as our debt repayments and other liquidity requirements associated with our existing operations, for the next 12 months. Based on our cash on hand and working capital at September 30, 2024, we may have insufficient cash to fund planned operations into the fourth quarter of 2024. This is evident from our continued efforts to raise capital and leverage external funding to fulfil our capital needs as highlighted below.\n\n33  \n---  \n  \nATM Program and Shelf Registration Statement\n\nWe formerly used a shelf registration statement on Form S-3 (the “Shelf Registration Statement”) to conduct securities offerings. In August 2021, we filed a prospectus supplement and established an “at-the-market” equity offering program (the “ATM Program”) that provided for the sale of shares of our Class A common stock having an aggregate offering price of up to $50 million, from time to time.\n\nSince the launch of the ATM program in August 2021 and through December 31, 2022, we sold shares of our Class A common stock which generated gross proceeds of approximately $12.7 million and we paid fees to the sales agent of approximately $0.4 million. Due to the untimely filing of certain of our Quarterly and Annual Reports, we are unable to issue additional shares of Class A common stock pursuant to the ATM Program or otherwise use the Shelf Registration Statement.\n\nCommon Stock and Warrant Offerings\n\nOn June 29, 2023, we entered into securities purchase agreements with certain investors, pursuant to which we agreed to issue and sell an aggregate of 50,952 shares of our Class A common stock, pre-funded warrants to purchase up to 317,013 shares of our Class A Common Stock (the “July 2023 Pre-Funded Warrants”) and warrants to purchase up to 735,931 shares of our Class A common stock (the “July 2023 Standard Warrants”). The July 2023 units were offered pursuant to a Registration Statement on Form S-1 (the “July 2023 Offering”). The July 2023 Offering generated gross proceeds of approximately $4.3 million and net proceeds to the Company of approximately $3.8 million and closed on July 3, 2023.\n\nOn August 12, 2024, the Company entered into a securities purchase agreement with a single institutional investor for aggregate gross cash proceeds of $6.5 million. In connection with the private placement, the Company will issue an aggregate of 2,363,637 units and pre-funded units. The pre-funded units will be sold at the same purchase price as the units, less the pre-funded warrant exercise price of $0.00001. Each unit and pre-funded unit will consist of one share of common stock (or one pre-funded warrant) and two common warrants, each exercisable for one share of common stock at an exercise price of $2.50 per share. The common warrant will be exercisable on the initial exercise date described in the common warrant and will expire 5.0 years from such date.\n\nAsset-Based Loan\n\nOn August 9, 2022, we entered into an asset-based loan agreement dated as of August 8, 2022 (the “Loan Agreement”), which made available to the Company a term loan of up to $15.0 million. On February 9, 2023, we entered into Amendment No. 2 to the Loan Agreement, in which we agreed to, among other things, voluntarily prepay approximately $6.6 million (inclusive of early termination fees and expenses) under the terms provided for under the Loan Agreement and the lenders under the Loan Agreement agreed to release $5.7 million in funds held in a blocked account pursuant to the terms of the Loan Agreement.\n\nOn August 7, 2023, we repaid the approximately $4.3 million in aggregate principal amount (the “Loan Repayment”) which remained outstanding under the terms of the Loan Agreement. As a result of the Loan Repayment, the Company has been released from its obligations under the Loan Agreement, in accordance with the terms of the Loan Agreement. See “Note 6 - Long Term Debt” for more information.\n\nERC Sale\n\nOn February 16, 2023, two of our wholly owned subsidiaries, Warehouse Goods LLC and KIM International LLC, entered into an agreement with a third-party institutional investor pursuant to which the investor purchased, for approximately $4.9 million in cash, an economic participation interest, at a discount, in our rights to payment from the United States Internal Revenue Service for certain periods with respect to the employee retention credits filed by us under the Employee Retention Credit program.\n\nFuture Receivables Financings\n\nIn July, August, October, and November 2023, the Company received an aggregate of approximately $3.9 million in cash pursuant to the terms of future receivables financings (collectively, the “Future Receivables Financings”) entered into with two private lenders. See “Note 6 - Long Term Debt” for more information.\n\nNotes Payable\n\nOn June 7, 2024, the Company entered into a subscription agreement with Cobra Alternative Capital Strategies, LLC. As of September 30, 2024, the Company has been loaned $3.1 million with net cash proceeds of $2.6 million with a remaining balance of $1.0 million. The note was issued with a 20% original issue discount and is due in full on December 7, 2024. See “Note 6 - Long Term Debt” for more information.\n\n34  \n---  \n  \nManagement Initiatives\n\nWe have completed several initiatives to optimize our working capital requirements. We launched Groove, a new, innovative Greenlane Brands product line, and we also rationalized our third-party brands product offering, which enables us to reduce inventory carrying costs and working capital requirements.\n\nIn April 2023, we entered into two strategic partnerships. First, we entered into a strategic partnership (the “MJ Packaging Partnership”) with A&A Global Imports d/b/a MarijuanaPackaging.com (“MJ Pack”), a provider of packaging solutions to the cannabis industry. On August 8, 2024 the Company terminated its strategic partnership with MJ Packaging and is resuming its business as a direct provider of packaging solutions to the cannabis industry. MJ Packaging however, remains a distribution customer of the Company. Second, we entered into a strategic partnership with an affiliate of one of our existing vape suppliers (“Vape Partner”) to service certain key customers with vaporizer goods and services (the “Vape Partnership”). As part of the Vape Partnership, we will introduce our Vape Partner to certain key customers, assist with the promotion and the sale of certain vaporizer goods and services, and help coordinate the logistics, storage and distribution of such vaporizer products. If our Vape Partner and key customer(s) enter into a direct relationship, the customers would directly purchase vaporizer goods and services, which we currently sell them, directly from our Vape Partner and we would no longer need to purchase such vape inventory on behalf of such key customer(s). In exchange we would earn quarterly and annual commission payments from our strategic partners. While the strategic partnership may result in a decrease in top line revenue for these vape products, this partnership combined with some of our other restructuring initiatives should allow us to reduce our overall cost-structure and enhance our margins, thereby improving our balance sheet.\n\nWe have successfully renegotiated supplier partnership terms and are continuing to improve working capital arrangements with suppliers. We have made progress consolidating and streamlining our office, warehouse, and distribution operations footprint. We have reduced our workforce by approximately 49% throughout fiscal year 2023 to reduce costs and align with our revenue projections.\n\nWe have incurred net losses of $8.9 million and $27.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, cash used in operating activities was $5.2 million and cash used in operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2023 was $1.8 million. The recent macroeconomic environment has caused weaker demand than contemplated under our business plan, resulting in a reduction in projected revenue and cash flows for the twelve-month period included in the going concern evaluation.\n\nAs a result of our losses and our projected cash needs, combined with our current liquidity level, substantial doubt exists about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. The Company’s ability to continue as a going concern is contingent upon successful execution of management’s intended plan over the next twelve months to improve the Company’s liquidity and profitability, which includes, without limitation:\n\n■ | Further reducing operating costs expense by taking additional restructuring actions to align cost with revenue to achieve profitability.  \n---|---  \n■ | Increasing revenue by introducing new products and acquiring new customers.  \n■ | Execute on strategic partnerships accretive to margins and operating cash  \n■ | Seeking additional capital through the issuance of debt or equity securities.  \n  \nOur opinions concerning liquidity are based on currently available information. To the extent this information proves to be inaccurate, or if circumstances change, future availability of trade credit or other sources of financing may be reduced and our liquidity could be adversely affected. Our future capital requirements and the adequacy of available funds will depend on many factors, including those described in the section titled “Risk Factors” in Item 1A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. Depending on the severity and direct impact of these factors on us, we may be unable to secure additional financing to meet our operating requirements on terms favorable to us, or at all.\n\nAs of September 30, 2024, we did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that are reasonably likely to have a material current or future effect on our financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures, or capital resources.\n\n35  \n---  \n  \n_Cash Flows_\n\nThe following summary of cash flows for the periods indicated has been derived from our condensed consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q:\n\nNine Months Ended September 30,  \n---  \n(in thousands) | 2024 | 2023  \nNet cash (used in) provided by operating activities | $| (5,232| ) | $| 4,656  \nNet cash used in investing activities | (173| ) | (253| )  \nNet cash provided by (used in) financing activities | 7,248 | (12,133| )  \n  \n_Net Cash (Used in) Provided by Operating Activities_\n\nDuring the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net cash used in operating activities of $5.2 million consisted of a net loss of $8.8 million, offset partially by non-cash adjustments to the net loss of $1.0 million and a $1.2 million decrease in working capital driven by decreases in inventories of $4.2 million and decreases in accrued expenses of $0.5 million reduced by a decrease in customer deposits of $1.5 million and an increase in accounts receivable of $0.7 million.\n\nDuring the nine months ended September 30, 2023, net cash “provided” by operating activities of approximately $1.2 million consisted of a net loss of $27.9 million offset by non-cash adjustments to net loss of approximately $4.4 million and a $24.7 million increase in working capital driven by an $18 million decrease in inventory, a $4.7 million decrease in accounts receivable, and a $4.0 million decrease in other assets reduced by a $3.1 million decrease in accounts payable.\n\n_Net Cash Used in Investing Activities_\n\nDuring the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net cash used in investing activities of approximately $0.2 million consisted primarily of capital expenditures.\n\nDuring the nine months ended September 30, 2023, net cash provided by investing activities of approximately $0.6 million , offset by cash used for development costs for our new enterprise resource planning (ERP) system of $0.6 million.\n\n_Net Cash Provided bv (Used in) Financing Activities_\n\nDuring the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net cash provided by financing activities of approximately $7.2 million primarily consisted of approximately $0.9 million in payments on loans against future accounts receivable, approximately $0.2 million in proceeds from future receivables financing, approximately $2.1 million in proceeds from notes payable, $3.0 in repayments on notes payable, and $5.6 million in net proceeds from the issuance of common stock.\n\n36  \n---  \n  \nDuring the nine months ended September 30, 2023, net cash provided by financing activities of approximately $10.5 million primarily consisted of cash proceeds of approximately $3.9 million from the issuance of Class A common stock through our ATM Program and the June 2022 Offering, offset primarily by approximately $2.5 million in payments on notes payable, finance lease obligations and other long-term liabilities, and approximately $0.3 million in payments of contingent consideration related to the Eyce LLC acquisition.\n\n**Cybersecurity**\n\nRisk Management and Strategy\n\nWe recognize the critical importance of developing, implementing, and maintaining robust cybersecurity measures to safeguard our information systems and protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of our data.\n\nManaging Material Risks & Integrated Overall Risk Management\n\nWe have strategically integrated cybersecurity risk management into our broader risk management framework to promote a company-wide culture of cybersecurity risk management. This integration ensures that cybersecurity considerations are an integral part of our decision-making processes at every level. Our management team continuously evaluates and addresses cybersecurity risks in alignment with our business objectives and operational needs.\n\nOversee Third-party Risk\n\nBecause we are aware of the risks associated with third-party service providers, we have implemented stringent processes to oversee and manage these risks. We conduct thorough security assessments of all third-party providers before engagement and maintain ongoing monitoring to ensure compliance with our cybersecurity standards. The monitoring includes annual assessments of the SOC reports of our providers and implementing complementary controls. This approach is designed to mitigate risks related to data breaches or other security incidents originating from third-parties.\n\nRisks from Cybersecurity Threats\n\nWe have not encountered cybersecurity challenges that have materially impaired our operations or financial standing.\n\n**ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK**\n\nNot required.\n\n**ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES**\n\n_Management’s Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures_\n\nWe have established disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms, and is accumulated and communicated to management, including our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow for timely decisions regarding disclosure. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and management is required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. Accordingly, even effective disclosure controls and procedures can only provide reasonable assurance of achieving their control objectives.\n\nUnder the supervision and with the participation of management, including our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, we evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2024. Based upon their evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of September 30, 2024, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective because of the material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting described in Item 9A of Part II of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, which have not yet been remediated as of September 30, 2024.\n\n_Material Weaknesses Remediation Plan and Status_\n\nAs previously described in Item 9A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021, we began implementing a remediation plan to address the material weaknesses identified in the prior year, and our management continues to be actively engaged in the remediation efforts.\n\nAs previously disclosed, in 2020, we began a multi-year implementation of a new ERP system, which will replace our existing core financial systems, and which was completed in 2023. Management is required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures, based upon which, management focused its allocation of organizational resources to ensure the successful implementation of the new ERP system during 2023, and is continuing to add additional processes for the design and implementation of effective control activities. Conversely, management noted limited efforts related to re-designing user access roles and permissions in the legacy ERP system. Based on these considerations, and subject to management’s ongoing assessment, we do not expect that the previously reported material weaknesses related to ineffective user access controls will be considered remediated until our new ERP system has been fully utilize to its potential and we have properly set controls in place. Additionally, to remediate the identified material weaknesses, we are continuing to take the following remediation actions:\n\n● | implement enhancements to company-wide risk assessment processes and to process and control documentation;  \n---|---  \n● | enhance the Company’s review and sign-off procedures for IT implementations;  \n● | implement additional review procedures designed to enhance the control owner’s execution of control activities, including entity level controls, through the implementation of improved documentation standards evidencing execution of these controls, oversight, and training;  \n● | improve control activities and procedures associated with certain accounting areas, including proper segregation of duties and assigning personnel with the appropriate experience as preparers and reviewers over analyses relating to such accounting areas;  \n● | educate and train control owners regarding internal control processes to mitigate identified risks and maintain adequate documentation to evidence the effective design and operation of such processes;  \n● | and implement enhanced controls to monitor the effectiveness of the underlying business process controls that are dependent on the data and financial reports generated from the relevant information systems.  \n  \n37  \n---  \n  \nWe are also continuing to evaluate additional controls and procedures that may be required to remediate the identified material weaknesses. We cannot provide assurances that the previously reported material weaknesses will be considered remediated until the applicable controls operate for a sufficient period of time and management has concluded, through testing, that these controls are operating effectively.\n\n_Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting_\n\nAs discussed above, in 2020 we began a multi-year implementation of a new ERP system which fully replaced our legacy financial systems in 2023. The ERP system is designed to accurately maintain the Company’s financial records, enhance the flow of financial information, improve data management and provide timely information to our management team. Subsequent to implementation of the new ERP system, we are continuing to change certain processes and procedures which, in turn, are expected to result in changes to our internal control over financial reporting. As such changes occur, we will evaluate quarterly whether such changes materially affect our internal control over financial reporting.\n\nThere were no other changes to our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.\n\n**PART II. OTHER INFORMATION**\n\n**ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS**\n\nFor a description of our material pending legal proceedings, see Note 7 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.\n\n**ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS**\n\nThere have been no material changes from the risk factors disclosed in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, filed with the SEC on July 19, 2024, except as set forth below.\n\n_There is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern through the next 12 months from the date of the condensed consolidated financial statements in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q._\n\nThe Company has incurred net losses of $8.9 million and $27.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and the prior year comparable period, respectively. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, cash used in operating activities was $5.2 million, and cash used in operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2023 was $1.8 million. Based on our cash on hand and working capital at September 30, 2024, we may have insufficient cash to fund planned operations into the fourth quarter of 2024. As a result of our losses and our projected cash needs, combined with our current liquidity level, substantial doubt exists about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern over the next 12 months. The recent macroeconomic environment has caused weaker demand than contemplated under the Company’s business plan, resulting in a reduction in projected revenue and cash flows for the twelve-month period included in the going concern evaluation.\n\nOur ability to continue as a going concern is contingent upon successful execution of management’s intended plan over the next twelve months to improve the our liquidity and profitability, which includes, without limitation:\n\n■ | Further reducing operating costs expense by taking additional restructuring actions to align cost with revenue  \n---|---  \n■ | Increasing revenue by introducing new products and acquiring new customers.  \n■ | Execute on strategic partnerships accretive to margins and operating cash  \n■ | Seeking additional capital through the issuance of equity securities or obtaining debt financing.  \n  \nThere can be no assurance that any such measures will be successful. If we are not successful in improving our liquidity position and the profitability of our operations, we may need to consider all strategic alternatives, including seeking additional debt or equity capital, reducing or delaying our business activities and strategic initiatives, or selling assets, other strategic transactions and/or other measures, including receivership or, to the extent available, bankruptcy protection. In addition, the perception that we may not be able to continue as a going concern may cause vendors and customers to choose not to do business with us due to concerns about our ability to meet our contractual obligations. If we seek additional financing to fund our operations and there remains substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern, our financing sources may be unwilling to provide additional funding to us on commercially reasonable terms or at all. The consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that may result from the outcome of this going concern uncertainty. Such adjustments could be material.\n\n38  \n---  \n  \n_We have failed, and may continue to fail, to meet the listing standards of Nasdaq, and as a result our Class A common stock may become delisted, which could have a material adverse effect on the liquidity of our Class A common stock._\n\nIf we fail to continue to satisfy the continued listing requirements of Nasdaq, such as the corporate governance or public float requirements, or the minimum closing bid price requirement, Nasdaq will take steps to de-list our Class A common stock. As a result of several factors, including but not limited to our financial performance, market sentiment about the cannabis industry, volatility in the financial markets generally due to the tightening of monetary policy by the Board of Governors of the United States Federal Reserve Bank (the “Federal Reserve”) and other geopolitical events, events such as the ongoing wars around the world, the per share price of our Class A common stock has declined below the minimum bid price threshold required for continued listing. Such a de-listing would likely have a negative effect on the price of our Class A common stock and would impair your ability to sell or purchase our Class A common stock when you wish to do so, as well as adversely affect our ability to issue additional securities and obtain additional financing in the future.\n\nOn August 21, 2023, we received a letter from the staff of Nasdaq indicating that we were not in compliance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5450(a)(1) because the closing bid price per share for our Class A common stock had closed below $1.00 for the previous 30 consecutive business days (the “Minimum Bid Price Requirement”). We were given 180 days, or until February 20, 2024 to regain compliance with the Minimum Bid Price Requirement. We also filed an application to transfer the listing of our Class A common stock from the Nasdaq Global Market to the Nasdaq Capital Market, which transfer was approved and occurred on February 9, 2024. As a result of the transfer, we became eligible to request an additional an additional 180-day compliance period.\n\nOn February 21, 2024, Nasdaq notified us in writing that while we had not regained compliance with the Minimum Bid Price Requirement, we were eligible for an additional 180-day compliance period, or until August 19, 2024, to regain compliance with the Minimum Bid Price Requirement. Nasdaq’s determination was based on us having met the continued listing requirement for market value of publicly held shares and all other applicable requirements for initial listing on The Nasdaq Capital Market, with the exception of the Minimum Bid Price Requirement, and on our written notice to Nasdaq of our intention to cure the deficiency during the second compliance period by effecting a reverse stock split, if necessary.\n\nIf we do not regain compliance during the second 180-day period, then Nasdaq will notify us of its determination to delist our Class A common stock, at which point we would have an opportunity to appeal the delisting determination to a hearings panel. We would remain listed on Nasdaq pending the hearings panel’s decision. There can be no assurance that, if we do appeal the delisting determination by Nasdaq to the hearings panel, that such appeal would be successful.\n\nOn January 24, 2024, Gina Collins gave notice of her resignation from our Board of Directors and from each committee of the Board, effective immediately. Ms. Collins was an independent director, and as a result of her resignation, we no longer comply with the majority independent board requirement of Nasdaq as set forth in Nasdaq Listing Rule 5605(b)(1) because independent directors do not comprise a majority of the Board of Directors, and Nasdaq’s audit committee requirements as set forth in Nasdaq Listing Rule 5605(c)(2)(A) because the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors is not comprised of at least three independent directors.\n\nOn January 29, 2024, in accordance with Nasdaq Listing Rules, we notified Nasdaq of Ms. Collins’ resignation and the resulting non-compliance. On January 30, 2024, we received a notice from Nasdaq acknowledging the fact that we do not meet the requirements of such rules. In accordance with Nasdaq Listing Rules 5605(b)(1)(A) and 5605(c)(4), to regain compliance with the Nasdaq Listing Rules, we have until the earlier of our next annual stockholders meeting or January 24, 2025.\n\nOn April 18, 2024, we received a notice from Nasdaq stating that because we had not yet filed our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, we were no longer in compliance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5250(c)(1). Nasdaq Listing Rule 5250(c)(1) requires listed companies to timely file all required periodic financial reports with the Securities and Exchange Commission.\n\nOn May 21, 2024, we received a notice from Nasdaq stating that because we had not yet filed our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended March 31, 2024, we were no longer in compliance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5250(c)(1).\n\nThe Company had 60 calendar days from April 18, 2024, or until June 17, 2024, to regain compliance by filing the Form 10-K and the Form 10-Q or to submit to Nasdaq a plan to regain compliance with the Nasdaq Listing Rules. We timely submitted the plan to regain compliance to Nasdaq and Nasdaq granted us additional time to file the Form 10K and 10Q. As of the date of this filing we have filed both the 10K and 10Q within the additional time period granted.\n\n39  \n---  \n  \n**ITEM 2.

BUSINESS OPERATIONS AND ORGANIZATION\nOrganization\nGreenlane Holdings, Inc. (“Greenlane” and, collectively with the Operating Company (as defined below) and its consolidated subsidiaries, the “Company”, “we”, “us”, and\n“our”) was formed as a Delaware corporation on May 2, 2018. We are a holding company that was formed for the purpose of completing an underwritten initial public offering\n(“IPO”) of shares of our Class A common stock, $0.01 par value per share (“Class A common stock”), in order to carry on the business of Greenlane Holdings, LLC (the\n“Operating Company”). The Operating Company was organized under the laws of the state of Delaware on September 1, 2015, and is based in Boca Raton, Florida. Unless the\ncontext otherwise requires, references to the “Company” refer to us, and our consolidated subsidiaries, including the Operating Company.\nWe merchandise premium cannabis accessories, child-resistant packaging, specialty vaporization solutions and lifestyle products in the United States, Canada, Europe and Latin\nAmerica, serving a diverse and expansive customer base with thousands of retail locations, licensed cannabis dispensaries, smoke shops, multi-state operators (“MSOs”),\nspecialty retailers, and retail consumers.\nWe have been developing a portfolio of our own proprietary brands (the “Greenlane Brands”) that we believe will, over time, deliver higher margins and create long-term value\nfor our customers and shareholders. Our wholly-owned Greenlane Brands includes Groove – our more affordable product line and Higher Standards – our premium smoke shop\nand ancillary product brand, and our award winning Vapor.com website and brand. We also have category exclusive licenses for the premium Marley Natural branded products,\nas well as the K.Haring branded products.\nWe are the sole manager of the Operating Company and our principal asset is Common Units of the Operating Company (“Common Units”). As the sole manager of the\nOperating Company, we operate and control all of the business and affairs of the Operating Company, and we conduct our business through the Operating Company and its\nsubsidiaries. We have a board of directors and executive officers, but no employees. All of our assets are held and all of the employees are employed by wholly owned\nsubsidiaries of the Operating Company.\nWe have the sole voting interest in, and control the management of, the Operating Company, and we have the obligation to absorb losses of, and receive benefits from, the\nOperating Company, that could be significant. We determined that the Operating Company is a variable interest entity (“VIE”) and that we are the primary beneficiary of the\nOperating Company. Accordingly, pursuant to the VIE accounting model, beginning in the fiscal quarter ended June 30, 2019, we consolidated the Operating Company in our\nconsolidated financial statements and reported a non-controlling interest related to the Common Units held by the members of the Operating Company (other than the Common\nUnits held by us) on our consolidated financial statements.\nOn August 31, 2021, we completed our merger with KushCo Holdings, Inc. (“KushCo”) and have included the results of operations of KushCo in our consolidated statements\nof operations and comprehensive loss from that date forward. In connection with the merger with KushCo, the Greenlane Certificate of Incorporation was amended and restated\n(the “A&R Charter”) in order to (i) increase the number of authorized shares of Greenlane Class B common stock, $0.0001 par value per share (the “Class B Common stock”),\nfrom 10 million shares to 30 million shares in order to effect the conversion of each outstanding share of Class C common stock, $0.0001 par value per share (the “Class C\ncommon stock”), into one-third of one share of Class B common stock, (ii) increase the number of authorized shares of Class A common stock from 125 million shares to 600\nmillion shares, and (iii) eliminate references to the Class C common stock. Pursuant to the terms of an Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of March 31, 2021 (the “Merger\nAgreement”) with KushCo, immediately prior to the consummation of the business combination, holders of Class C common stock received one-third of one share of Class B\ncommon stock for each share of Class C common stock held immediately prior to the closing of the merger.\nOur corporate structure is commonly referred to as an “Up-C” structure. The Up-C structure allows the Operating Company to continue to realize tax benefits associated with\nowning interests in an entity that is treated as a partnership, or “pass-through” entity. One of these benefits is that future taxable income of the Operating Company that is\nallocated to its members will be taxed on a flow-through basis and therefore will not be subject to corporate taxes at the Operating Company entity level. Additionally, because\na member may redeem their Common Units for shares of Class A common stock on a one-for-one basis or, at our option, for cash, the Up-C structure also provides the member\nwith potential liquidity that holders of non-publicly traded limited liability companies are not typically afforded.\n8\nIn connection with the IPO, we entered into a Tax Receivable Agreement (the “TRA”) with the Operating Company and the Operating Company’s members and a Registration\nRights Agreement (the “Registration Rights Agreement”) with the Operating Company’s members. The TRA provides for the payment by us to the Operating Company’s\nmember(s) of 85.0% of the amount of tax benefits, if any, that we may actually realize (or in some cases, are deemed to realize) as a result of (i) the step-up in tax basis in our\nshare of the Operating Company’s assets resulting from the redemption of Common Units under the mechanism described above and (ii) certain other tax benefits attributable\nto payments made under the TRA. Pursuant to the Registration Rights Agreement, we have agreed to register the resale of shares of Class A common stock that are issuable to\nthe Operating Company’s members upon redemption or exchange of their Common Units.\nThe A&R Charter and the Fourth Amended and Restated Operating Agreement of the Operating Company (the “Operating Agreement”) require that (a) we at all times maintain\na ratio of one Common Unit owned by us for each share of our Class A common stock issued by us (subject to certain exceptions), and (b) the Operating Company at all times\nmaintains (i) a one-to-one ratio between the number of shares of our Class A common stock issued by us and the number of Common Units owned by us, and (ii) a one-to-one\nratio between the number of shares of our Class B common stock owned by the non-founder members of the Operating Company and the number of Common Units owned by\nthe non-founder members of the Operating Company.\nAs of December 31, 2022, all Common Units of the Operating Company and Class B common stock had been exchanged for Class A common stock, and we owned 100% of\nthe voting and economic interests in Greenlane through the holders’ ownership of Class A common stock. See “Note 9 - Stockholder’s Equity.”\nReverse Stock Splits\nOn June 2, 2023, we filed a Certificate of Amendment to the A&R Charter with the Secretary of State for the State of Delaware (“SSSD”), which effected a one-for-ten reverse\nstock split (the “2023 Reverse Stock Split” and together with the 2022 Reverse Stock Split, the “Reverse Stock Splits”) of our issued and outstanding shares of Common Stock\nat 5:01 PM Eastern Time on June 5, 2023. As a result of the 2023 Reverse Stock Split, every ten shares of common stock issued and outstanding were converted into one share\nof common stock. We paid cash in lieu of fractional shares, and accordingly, no fractional shares were issued in connection with the 2023 Reverse Stock Split.\nOn July 23, 2024, the Board approved the reverse split at a ratio of one-for-11 and the Amendment has been filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware, which\nbecame effective on August 5, 2024 at 12:01 AM Eastern Time, before the opening of trading on the Nasdaq.\nThe Reverse Stock Splits did not change the par value of the Common Stock or the authorized number of shares of Common Stock. All outstanding options, restricted stock\nawards, warrants and other securities entitling their holders to purchase or otherwise receive shares of our Common Stock have been adjusted as a result of the Reverse Stock\nSplits, as required by the terms of each security. The number of shares available to be awarded under our Amended and Restated 2019 Equity Incentive Plan have also been\nappropriately adjusted. See “Note 10 — Compensation Plans” for more information.\nAll share and per share amounts in these consolidated financial statements and notes thereto have been retroactively adjusted for all periods presented to give effect to the\nReverse Stock Splits, including reclassifying an amount equal to the reduction in par value of Common Stock to additional paid-in capital.\nLiquidity and Going Concern\nPursuant to ASC 205-40, Presentation of Financial Statements — Going Concern (“ASC 205-40”), management must evaluate whether there are conditions and events,\nconsidered in the aggregate, that raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern for one year after the date that these condensed consolidated\nfinancial statements are issued. In accordance with ASC 205-40, management’s analysis can only include the potential mitigating impact of management’s plans that have not\nbeen fully implemented as of the issuance date if (a) it is probable that management’s plans will be effectively implemented on a timely basis, and (b) it is probable that the\nplans, when implemented, will alleviate the relevant conditions or events that raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern.\nOur primary requirements for liquidity and capital are working capital, debt service related to recent acquisitions and general corporate needs. Our primary sources of liquidity\nare our cash on hand and the cash flow that we generate from our operations, as well as proceeds from other equity issuances.\nWe believe that our cash on hand and the cash flow that we generate from our operations will not be sufficient to fund our working capital and capital expenditure requirements,\nas well as our debt repayments and other liquidity requirements associated with our existing operations, for the next 12 months. Based on our cash on hand and working capital\nat September 30, 2024, we may have insufficient cash to fund planned operations into the fourth quarter of 2024. This is evident from our continued efforts to raise capital and\nleverage external funding to fulfil our capital needs.\n9\nATM Program and Shelf Registration Statement\nWe formerly used a shelf registration statement on Form S-3 (the “Shelf Registration Statement”) to conduct securities offerings from time to time in order to meet our liquidity\nneeds. In August 2021, we filed a prospectus supplement and established an “at-the-market” equity offering program (the “ATM Program”) that provided for the sale of shares\nof our Class A common stock having an aggregate offering price of up to $50 million, from time to time.\nSince the launch of the ATM program in August 2021 and through December 31, 2022, we sold shares of our Class A common stock which generated gross proceeds of\napproximately $12.7 million and we paid fees to the sales agent of approximately $0.4 million. Due to the untimely filing of certain of our Quarterly and Annual Reports, we\nare unable to issue additional shares of Class A common stock pursuant to the ATM Program or otherwise use the Shelf Registration Statement, which will limit our liquidity\noptions in the capital markets.\nCommon Stock and Warrant Offerings.\nOn June 29, 2023, we entered into securities purchase agreements with certain investors, pursuant to which we agreed to issue and sell an aggregate of 560,476 shares of our\nClass A common stock, pre-funded warrants to purchase up to 3,487,143 shares of our Class A Common Stock (the “July 2023 Pre-Funded Warrants”) and warrants to purchase\nup to 8,095,238 shares of our Class A common stock (the “July 2023 Standard Warrants”). The July 2023 units were offered pursuant to a Registration Statement on Form S-1\n(the “July 2023 Offering”). The July 2023 Offering generated gross proceeds of approximately $4.3 million and net proceeds to the Company of approximately $3.8 million and\nclosed on July 3, 2023. See “Note 9 – Stockholders’ Equity” for further information.\nOn August 12, 2024, the Company entered into a securities purchase agreement with a single institutional investor for aggregate gross cash proceeds of $6.5 million. In\nconnection with the private placement, the Company will issue an aggregate of 2,363,637 units and pre-funded units. The pre-funded units will be sold at the same purchase\nprice as the units, less the pre-funded warrant exercise price of $0.00001. Each unit and pre-funded unit will consist of one share of common stock (or one pre-funded warrant)\nand two common warrants, each exercisable for one share of common stock at an exercise price of $2.50 per share. The common warrant will be exercisable on the initial\nexercise date described in the common warrant and will expire 5.0 years from such date.\nAsset-Based Loan\nOn August 9, 2022, we entered into an asset-based loan agreement dated as of August 8, 2022 (the “Loan Agreement”), which made available to the Company a term loan of up\nto $15.0 million. On February 9, 2023, we entered into Amendment No. 2 to the Loan Agreement, in which we agreed to, among other things, voluntarily prepay approximately\n$6.6 million (inclusive of early termination fees and expenses) under the terms provided for under the Loan Agreement and the lenders under the Loan Agreement agreed to\nrelease $5.7 million in funds held in a blocked account pursuant to the terms of the Loan Agreement.\nOn August 7, 2023, we repaid the approximately $4.3 million in aggregate principal amount (the “Loan Repayment”) which remained outstanding under the terms of the Loan\nAgreement. As a result of the Loan Repayment, the Company has been released from its obligations under the Loan Agreement, in accordance with the terms of the Loan\nAgreement. See “Note 6 - Long Term Debt” for more information.\n10\nERC Sale\nOn February 16, 2023, two of our wholly owned subsidiaries, Warehouse Goods LLC and Kim International LLC, entered into an agreement with a third-party institutional\ninvestor pursuant to which the investor purchased, for approximately $4.9 million in cash, an economic participation interest, at a discount, in our rights to payment from the\nUnited States Internal Revenue Service for certain periods with respect to the employee retention credits filed by us under the Employee Retention Credit program.\nFuture Receivables Financing\nIn July, August, October, and November 2023, the Company received an aggregate of approximately $3.9 million in cash pursuant to the terms of future receivables financings\n(collectively, the “Future Receivables Financings”) entered into with two private lenders. At September 30, 2024, $4.6 million of such financing remained outstanding. See\n“Note 6 - Long Term Debt” for more information.\nSecured Bridge Loan\nOn September 22, 2023, the Company entered into a secured loan pursuant to a Loan and Security Agreement (the “September 2023 Loan Agreement”), dated as of September\n22, 2023 with Synergy Imports, LLC (the “Secured Bridge Loan Lender”).\nPursuant to the September 2023 Loan Agreement, the Secured Bridge Loan Lender agreed to make available to the Company a six-month bridge loan of $2.2 million in new\nfunds. Additionally, the Secured Bridge Loan Lender agreed to defer payments totaling $2,028,604 already owed by the Company under existing payment obligations and\npotentially defer up to an additional $2,655,778 which may become due pursuant to existing agreements during the term of the September 2023 Loan Agreement.\nSubject to certain exceptions, the Company agreed to pledge all of its assets, with the exception of deposit accounts and accounts receivable, as collateral. Additionally, the\nCompany agreed to transfer one US patent and two related foreign patents and a related trademark in exchange for an exclusive license back of such assets in the area of\nsmoking products and accessories in connection with the September 2023 Loan Agreement.\nIn May 2024, the Company modified its debt agreement with Synergy to reduce the principal balance due by $2.7 million from $5.1 million as part of the Loan Modification\nAgreement concurrent with the Asset Purchase Agreement. Synergy acquired certain assets from the Company in exchange for the reduction in overall principal owed. At\nSeptember 30, 2024, $2.7 million of such financing remained outstanding. See “Note 6 - Long Term Debt” for more information.\nNote Payable\nOn June 7, 2024, the Company entered into a subscription agreement with Cobra Alternative Capital Strategies, LLC. As of September 30, 2024, the Company has been loaned\n$3.1 million with net cash proceeds of $2.6 million. The note was issued with a 20% original issue discount and is due in full on December 7, 2024. See “Note 6 - Long Term\nDebt” for more information. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, the Company repaid $2.1 million and the remaining outstanding balance was approximately\n$1.0 million. The Company has elected to measure these notes using the fair value option under ASC 825, Financial Instruments. Given the short-term duration of the notes, the\ncarrying value of the notes at September 30, 2024 approximate the fair value and as such no fair value adjustment was recorded in the statement of operations.\nManagement Initiatives\nWe have completed several initiatives to optimize our working capital requirements due to our inability to access capital markets on equitable terms and stock-outs and\nshortages of higher velocity inventory. In the fourth quarter of 2022, we launched Groove, a new, innovative Greenlane Brands product line, and we also rationalized and\nimproved our third-party brands product offering, which enabled us to reduce inventory carrying costs and working capital requirements while increasing our offerings.\nIn April 2023, we entered into two strategic partnerships. First, we entered into a strategic partnership (the “MJ Packaging Partnership”) with A&A Global Imports d/b/a\nMarijuanaPackaging.com (“MJ Pack”), a leading provider of packaging solutions to the cannabis industry. On August 8, 2024 the Company terminated its strategic partnership\nwith MJ Packaging and is resuming its business as a direct provider of packaging solutions to the cannabis industry. MJ Packaging however, remains a distribution customer of\nthe Company.\nSecond, we entered into a strategic partnership with an affiliate of one of our existing vape suppliers (“Vape Partner”) to service certain key customers with vaporizer goods and\nservices (the “Vape Partnership”). As part of the Vape Partnership, we will introduce our Vape Partner to certain key customers, assist with the promotion and the sale of certain\nvaporizer goods and services, and help coordinate the logistics, storage and distribution of such vaporizer products. If our Vape Partner and key customer(s) enter into a direct\nrelationship, the customers would directly purchase vaporizer goods and services, which we currently sell them, directly from our Vape Partner and we would no longer need to\npurchase such vape inventory on behalf of such key customer(s). In exchange we would earn quarterly and annual commission payments from our strategic partner. While the\nstrategic partnership may result in a decrease in top line revenue for these vape products, this partnership combined with some of our other restructuring initiatives should allow\nus to reduce our overall cost-structure and enhance our margins, thereby improving our balance sheet.\nWe have successfully renegotiated many of our vendor and supplier partnership terms and are continuing to improve working capital arrangements with our vendors and\nsuppliers. We have made progress consolidating and streamlining our office, warehouse, and distribution operations footprint. We have reduced our workforce significantly to\nreduce costs and align with our revenue projections.\nThe Company has incurred net losses of $8.9 million and $27.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. For the nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024 and 2023, cash (used in) provided by operating activities were $(5.2) million and $1.2 million, respectively. The recent macroeconomic environment has\ncaused weaker demand than contemplated under the Company’s business plan, resulting in a reduction in projected revenue and cash flows for the twelve-month period\nincluded in the going concern evaluation.\n11\nAs a result of our losses and our projected cash needs, combined with our current liquidity level, substantial doubt exists about the Company’s ability to continue as a going\nconcern. The Company’s ability to continue as a going concern is contingent upon successful execution of management’s intended plan over the next twelve months to improve\nthe Company’s liquidity and profitability, which includes, without limitation:\n■ Further reducing operating costs expense by taking additional restructuring actions to align cost with revenue to achieve profitability.\n■ Increasing revenue by introducing new products, acquiring new customers, and enhancing our sales force\n■ Execute on strategic partnerships accretive to margins and operating cash\n■ Seeking additional capital through the issuance of debt or equity securities.\nThe unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that may result from the outcome of this going concern uncertainty. For a more\ncomplete description of our initiatives, see the Management Discussion and Analysis.\nNOTE 2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nBasis of Presentation\nOur unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America\n(“U.S. GAAP”) and applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) regarding interim financial reporting. Certain information and note\ndisclosures normally included in the financial statements prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP have been condensed or omitted pursuant to such rules and regulations. As\nsuch, the information included in this Form 10-Q should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included in our Annual\nReport on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. The condensed consolidated results of operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 are not\nnecessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the year ending December 31, 2024, or any other future annual or interim period. In the opinion of management,\nthe unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements reflect all adjustments necessary for a fair statement of the Company’s financial position and operating results.\nCertain reclassifications have been made to prior year amounts or balances to conform to the presentation adopted in the current year.\nPrinciples of Consolidation\nOur condensed consolidated financial statements include our accounts, the accounts of the Operating Company, and the accounts of the Operating Company’s consolidated\nsubsidiaries. All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.\n12\nUse of Estimates\nConformity with U.S. GAAP requires the use of estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes.\nThese estimates form the basis for judgments we make about the carrying values of our assets and liabilities, which are not readily apparent from other sources. We base our\nestimates and judgments on historical information and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. U.S. GAAP requires us to make\nestimates and judgments in several areas. Such areas include, but are not limited to the following: the collectability of accounts receivable; the allowance for slow-moving or\nobsolete inventory; the realizability of deferred tax assets; the fair value of contingent consideration arrangements; the useful lives property and equipment; the calculation of\nour VAT taxes receivable and VAT taxes, fines, and penalties payable; our loss contingencies, including our TRA liability; and the valuation and assumptions underlying equity-\nbased compensation. These estimates are based on management’s knowledge about current events and expectations about actions we may undertake in the future. The actual\nresults could differ materially from those estimates.\nSegment Reporting\nWe manage our global business operations through our operating and reportable business segments. As of September 30, 2024, we determined that we have one remaining and\nreportable operating business segment. Our reportable segment has been identified based on how our chief operating decision maker (“CODM”), which is a committee\ncomprised of our Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”) and our Chief Financial and Legal Officer (“CFO”), manages our business, makes resource allocation and operating\ndecisions, and evaluates operating performance.\nRevenue Recognition\nRevenue is recognized when customers obtain control of goods and services promised by us. Revenue is measured based on the amount of consideration that we expect to\nreceive in exchange for those goods or services, reduced by promotional discounts and estimates for return allowances and refunds. Taxes collected from customers for\nremittance to governmental authorities are excluded from net sales.\nWe generate revenue primarily from the sale of finished products to customers, whereby each product unit represents a single performance obligation. We recognize revenue\nfrom product sales when the customer has obtained control of the products, which is either at point of sale or delivery to the customer, depending upon the specific terms and\nconditions of the arrangement, or at the point of sale for our retail store sales. We provide no warranty on products sold. Product warranty is provided by the manufacturers. For\ncertain product offerings such as child-resistant packaging, closed-system vaporization solutions and custom-branded retail products, we may receive a deposit from the\ncustomer (generally 25% - 50% of the total order cost, but the amount can vary by customer contract) when an order is placed by a customer. We typically complete these\norders within one to six months from the date of order, depending on the complexity of the customization and the size of the order, but the completion timeline can vary by\nproduct type and terms of sales with each customer. See “Note 8—Supplemental Financial Statement Information” for a summary of changes to our customer deposits liability\nbalance during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and the year ended December 31, 2023.\nWe estimate product returns based on historical experience and record them as a refund liability that reduces the net sales for the period. We analyze actual historical returns,\ncurrent economic trends and changes in order volume when evaluating the adequacy of our sales returns allowance in any reporting period. Our liability for returns, which is\nincluded within “Accrued expenses and other current liabilities” in our consolidated balance sheet, was approximately $0.1 million December 31, 2023. There were no\nliabilities related to refunds as of September 30, 2024.\nWe elected to account for shipping and handling expenses that occur after the customer has obtained control of products as a fulfillment activity in cost of sales. Shipping and\nhandling fees charged to customers are included in net sales upon completion of our performance obligations. We apply the practical expedient provided for by the applicable\nrevenue recognition guidance by not adjusting the transaction price for significant financing components for periods less than one year. We also apply the practical expedient\nprovided by the applicable revenue recognition guidance based upon which we generally expense sales commissions when incurred because the amortization period is one year\nor less. Sales commissions are recorded within “Salaries, benefits and payroll tax expenses” in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss.\nThe Company transitioned to a commission revenue model for the majority of the sales for the Industrial segment. The company operates as a sales agent servicing vape\ncustomers and receives a commission for these services. The company was previously working directly with these customers and recognizing gross revenue versus straight\ncommission revenue. The Company recognizes this fee on a periodic basis when the products have been shipped for the end consumer. In working with their partner, the\nCompany is not responsible for fulfilling a promise to provide the specified goods, does not establish the pricing with its partners customers, and does not have control over the\ngoods that will be shipped. As such, the Company is an agent and recognizes its revenue on a net basis for its service. The partner company pays Greenlane a negotiated\npercentage-based fee on a quarterly basis.\nTwo customers represented approximately 36% and 27%, respectively, of net sales for the three months ended September 30, 2024. Two customers represented approximately\n16% and 16%, respectively, of net sales for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, one customer represented\napproximately 13% and 28% of net sales. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company has a concentration of credit risk with its accounts receivable\nbalance as one customer represented approximately 15% and 31%, respectively, of accounts receivable.\n13\nValue Added Taxes\nDuring the third quarter of 2020, as part of a global tax strategy review, we determined that our European subsidiaries based in the Netherlands, which we acquired on\nSeptember 30, 2019, had historically collected and remitted value added tax (“VAT”) payments, which related to direct-to-consumer sales to other European Union (“EU”)\nmember states, directly to the Dutch tax authorities. In connection with our subsidiaries’ payment of VAT to Dutch tax authorities rather than other EU member states, we may\nbecome subject to civil or criminal enforcement actions in certain EU jurisdictions, which could result in penalties.\nWe performed an analysis of the VAT overpayments to the Dutch tax authorities, which we expected to be refunded to us, and VAT payable to other EU member states,\nincluding potential fines and penalties. Based on this analysis, we recorded VAT payable of approximately $0.6 and $0.4 million, respectively, relating to this matter within\n“Accrued expenses and other current liabilities” in our condensed consolidated balance sheets as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023.\nPursuant to the purchase and sale agreement by which we acquired our European subsidiaries, the sellers are required to indemnify us against certain specified matters and\nlosses, including any and all liabilities, claims, penalties and costs incurred or sustained by us in connection with non-compliance with tax laws in relation to activities of the\nsellers. The indemnity (or indemnification receivable) is limited to an amount equal to the purchase price under the purchase and sale agreement.\nAs noted above, we have voluntarily disclosed VAT owed to several relevant tax authorities in the EU member states and believe in doing so we will reduce our liability for\npenalties and interest. Nonetheless, we may incur expenses in future periods related to such matters, including litigation costs and other expenses to defend our position. The\noutcome of such matters is inherently unpredictable and subject to significant uncertainties. Refer to “Note 7—Commitments and Contingencies” for additional discussion\nregarding our contingencies.\nRecently Issued Accounting Guidance Not Yet Adopted\nIn June 2022, the FASB issued ASU No. 2022-03, Fair Value Measurement of Equity Securities Subject to Contractual Sale Restrictions, which clarifies that a contractual sale\nrestriction prohibiting the sale of an equity security is a characteristic of the reporting entity holding the equity security and is not included in the equity security’s unit of\naccount. This standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, with early adoption permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of\nadopting the standard.\nIn November 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures, which improves reportable segment\ndisclosure requirements, primarily through enhanced disclosures about significant segment expenses. The amendments in this update require public companies to disclose on an\nannual and interim basis, significant segment expenses that are regularly provided to the chief operating decision maker (CODM) and require that a public entity disclose, on an\nannual and interim basis, an amount for other segment items by reportable segment and a description of its composition. In addition, the amendment requires that a public entity\nprovide all annual disclosures about a reportable segment’s profit or loss and assets currently required in interim periods and require that a public entity disclose the title and\nposition of the CODM and an explanation of how the CODM uses the reported measure(s) of segment profit or loss in assessing segment performance and deciding how to\nallocate resources. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of ASU 2023-07 on its consolidated financial statements and related\ndisclosures. This amendment will go into effect for the fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15,\n2024.\nIn December 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-09, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements To Income Tax Disclosures, to enhance the transparency and decision\nusefulness of income tax disclosures. The amendments in this Update address investor requests for more transparency about income tax information through improvements to\nincome tax disclosures primarily related to the rate reconciliation and income taxes paid information.\n14\nThe amendments in this Update require that entities on an annual basis (1) disclose specific categories in the rate reconciliation and (2) provide additional information for\nreconciling items that meet a quantitative threshold (if the effect of those reconciling items is equal to or greater than 5 percent of the amount computed by multiplying pretax\nincome (or loss) by the applicable statutory income tax rate). In addition, public business entities are required to provide certain qualitative disclosure about the rate\nreconciliation.\nThe amendments in this Update require that all entities disclose on an annual basis the amount of income taxes paid (net of refunds received) disaggregated (1) by federal\n(national), state, and foreign taxes and (2) by individual jurisdictions in which income taxes paid (net of refunds received) is equal to or greater than 5 percent of total income\ntaxes paid (net of refunds received).\nThis Update also includes certain other amendments to improve the effectiveness of income tax disclosures, such as requiring that all entities disclose the following\ninformation:\n1. Income (or loss) from continuing operations before income tax expense (or benefit) disaggregated between domestic and foreign.\n2. Income tax expense (or benefit) from continuing operations disaggregated by federal (national), state, and foreign.\nThe amendments in this ASU require a cumulative-effect adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings (or other appropriate components of equity or net assets) as of\nthe beginning of the annual reporting period in which an entity adopts the amendments. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of ASU\n2023-09 on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. This amendment will go into effect for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2024.\nNOTE 3. BUSINESS ACQUISITIONS AND DISPOSITIONS\nEU Subsidiary Purchase Agreement\nIn May 2024, the Company entered into an agreement with a group of individuals to sell 100% equity interests of one of the Company’s wholly-owned subsidiaries, Shavita\nB.V. and substantially all of the assets of ARI Logistics B.V. As of the date that these financial statements were available to be issued, the close of the transaction is in dispute as\nthere was pending consideration obligations due to be transferred to the Company not met, as well as other monetary obligations of the purchasers that remain unsatisfied. The\nCompany intends to vigorously pursue its claims against Shavita and the purchaser group. The Company does not believe any circumstances arising from the ARI and Shavita\ntransactions will have a material adverse effect on the Company, its financial condition or results of operations.\nNOTE 4. FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS\nAssets and Liabilities that are Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis\nThe carrying amounts for certain of our financial instruments, including cash, accounts receivable, accounts payable and certain accrued expenses and other assets and\nliabilities, approximate fair value due to the short-term nature of these instruments.\nAs of December 31, 2023, we had contingent consideration that is required to be measured at fair value on a recurring basis.\nOur financial instruments measured at fair value on a recurring basis were as follows at the dates indicated:\nCondensed Consolidated Fair Value at\nBalance Sheet Caption December 31, 2023\n(in thousands) Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total\nLiabilities:\nAccrued expenses and other current\nContingent consideration - current liabilities $ — $ — 1,500 1,500\nTotal Liabilities $ — $ — $ 1,500 $ 1,500\nThere were no transfers between Level 1 and Level 2 and no transfers to or from Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024\nand 2023, respectively.\n15\nContingent Consideration\nEach period we revalue our contingent consideration obligations associated with business acquisitions to their fair value. We estimate the fair value of the Product Launch\nContingent Payments using a form of the scenario-based method, which includes significant unobservable inputs such as management’s identification of probability-weighted\noutcomes and a risk-adjusted discount rate over the earn-out period. Significant increases or decreases in these inputs could result in a significantly lower or higher fair value\nmeasurement of the contingent consideration liability. Changes in the fair value of contingent consideration are included within “Other income (expense), net” in our condensed\nconsolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss.\nA reconciliation of our liabilities that are measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring basis using significant unobservable inputs (Level 3) is as follows:\nNine Months Ended\n(in thousands) September 30, 2024\nBalance at December 31, 2023 $ 1,000\nCash payments for earned contingent consideration —\nTransfer to notes payable —\nGain from fair value adjustments included in results of operations (1,000)\nBalance September 30, 2024 $ —\nNine Months Ended\n(in thousands) September 30, 2023\nBalance at December 31, 2022 $ 2,738\nCash payments for earned contingent consideration (350)\nTransfer to notes payable (1,150)\nLoss (gain) from fair value adjustments included in results of operations 262\nBalance at September 30, 2023 $ 1,500\nEquity Securities Without a Readily Determinable Fair Value\nOur investment in equity securities without readily determinable fair value consist of ownership interests in Airgraft Inc., Sun Grown Packaging, LLC (“Sun Grown”) and\nVapor Dosing Technologies, Inc. (“VIVA”). We determined that our ownership interests do not provide us with significant influence over the operations of these investments.\nAccordingly, we account for our investments in these entities as equity securities.\n16\nAirgraft Inc., Sun Grown, and VIVA are private entities and their equity securities do not have a readily determinable fair value. We elected to measure these securities under\nthe measurement alternative election at cost minus impairment, if any, with adjustments through earnings for observable price changes in orderly transactions for the identical\nor similar investment of the same issuer. We acquired our investments in Sun Grown and VIVA as part of our merger with KushCo, which we completed in August 2021. We\ndid not identify any fair value adjustments related to these equity securities during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\nAs of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the carrying value of our investment in equity securities without a readily determinable fair value was approximately $1.9\nmillion, respectively, included within “Other assets” in our condensed consolidated balance sheets.\nNOTE 5. LEASES\nGreenlane as a Lessee\nAs of September 30, 2024, we had facilities financed under operating leases consisting of warehouses and offices with lease term expirations between 2023 and 2027. Lease\nterms are generally three to seven years for warehouses and office space. Our lease agreements do not contain any material residual value guarantees or material restrictive\ncovenants.\nThe following table provides details of our future minimum lease payments under operating lease liabilities recorded in our condensed consolidated balance sheet as of\nSeptember 30, 2024. The table below does not include commitments that are contingent on events or other factors that are currently uncertain or unknown.\n(in thousands) Operating Leases\nRemainder of 2024 $ 230\n2025 942\n2026 81\n2027 —\n2028 and thereafter —\nTotal minimum lease payments $ 1,253\nLess: imputed interest 41\nPresent value of minimum lease payments $ 1,212\nLess: current portion 886\nLong-term portion $ 326\nRent expense under operating leases was approximately $0.3 million and $0.8 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, and approximately\n$0.4 million and $1.5 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively.\nThe following expenses related to our operating leases were included in “general and administrative” expenses within our condensed consolidated statements of operations and\ncomprehensive loss:\nFor the nine months ended September 30,\n(in thousands) 2024 2023\nOperating lease cost 685 1,474\nVariable lease cost — 461\nTotal lease cost $ 685 $ 1,935\nThe table below presents lease-related terms and discount rates as of September 30, 2024:\nOperating Leases\nWeighted average remaining lease terms 1.3 years\nWeighted average discount rate 2.3%\n17\nNOTE 6.

The Company will make weekly payments under the Future Receivables Financings\nand is scheduled to repay the amounts due under the Future Receivables Financings in full in approximately six to eight months. The total amount to be repaid under the initial\nFuture Receivables Financings was approximately $4.5 million. In connection with the Future Receivables Financings, the Company granted the lenders security interests in\nCompany’s accounts receivable equal to the amounts due thereunder, and in connection with any event of default, the lenders may file financing statements evidencing the\nsecurity interests. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company’s financings were in a series of transactions refinanced as they were not able to make the\nproscribed monthly payments for the repayment of cash advances. As such the refinancings restructured the payment schedule and the total balance increased to $4.6 million\nwhich included deferred financing fees of approximately $2.8 million.\nNote Payable\nOn June 7, 2024, the Company entered into a subscription agreement for a note payable with Cobra Alternative Capital Strategies, LLC. As of September 30, 2024, the\nCompany had been loaned $3.1 million with net cash proceeds of $2.6 million, with an remaining balance due of $1.0 million. The note was issued with a 20% original issue\ndiscount and is due in full on December 7, 2024. Upon default, the note can be converted at a variable price equal to 30% discount to the average daily volume weighted\naverage price (“VWAP”) for the 20 trading days preceding the date of conversion. As of September 30, 2024, the note is not considered convertible.\nSecured Bridge Loan\nOn September 22, 2023, the Company entered into a secured loan pursuant to a Loan and Security Agreement (the “September 2023 Loan Agreement”), dated as of September\n22, 2023 with Synergy Imports, LLC (the “Secured Bridge Loan Lender” or “Synergy”).\nPursuant to the September 2023 Loan Agreement, the Secured Bridge Loan Lender agreed to make available to the Company a six-month bridge loan of $2.2 million in new\nfunds. Additionally, the Secured Bridge Loan Lender agreed to defer payments totaling $2,028,604 already owed by the Company under existing payment obligations and\npotentially defer up to an additional $2,655,778 which may become due pursuant to existing agreements during the term of the September 2023 Loan Agreement.\nSubject to certain exceptions, the Company agreed to pledge all of its assets, with the exception of deposit accounts and accounts receivable, as collateral. Additionally, the\nCompany agreed to transfer one US patent and two related foreign patents and a related trademark in exchange for an exclusive license back of such assets in the area of\nsmoking products and accessories in connection with the September 2023 Loan Agreement.\nOn May 6, 2024, the Company, Warehouse Goods and Synergy entered into an asset purchase agreement, dated May 1, 2024 (the “Asset Purchase Agreement”) pursuant to\nwhich Synergy purchased all of the intellectual property, a specified amount of inventory, and other assets related to the Eyce and DaVinci brands. In consideration for the\nacquisition, all parties entered into a loan modification agreement, effective May 1, 2024 (the “Loan Modification Agreement”) and an amended and restated secured\npromissory note, effective May 1, 2024 (the “Amended and Restated Secured Promissory Note”), an amendment to the original Eyce and Davinci Asset Purchase Agreements,\na distribution agreement, the termination of a license granted by Eyce, and the termination of certain consulting and employment agreements. As part of the overall\nmodification, the principal balance with Synergy decreased by $2.7 million from $5.1 million. Synergy acquired certain assets from the Company in exchange for the reduction\nin overall principal owed and as part of the transaction, the Company recognized a gain on the debt modification of $2.2 million. This amount is included in the accompanying\nfinancial statements within the statement of operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 within other income (expense). At September 30, 2024, $2.5\nmillion of such financing remained outstanding. The updated date of maturity will be through the end of 2024.\nFuture Minimum Principal Payments\nThe following table summarizes future scheduled minimum principal payments of debt at September 30, 2024.

COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES\nLegal Proceedings\nIn the ordinary course of business, we are involved in various legal proceedings involving a variety of matters. We do not believe there are any pending legal proceedings that\nwill have a material adverse effect on our business, consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. However, the outcome of such legal matters is\ninherently unpredictable and subject to significant uncertainties. We have not taken any reserves for litigation for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023,\nrespectively.\nOther Contingencies\nWe are potentially subject to claims related to various non-income taxes (such as sales, value added, consumption, and similar taxes) from various tax authorities, including in\njurisdictions in which we already collect and remit such taxes. If the relevant taxing authorities were successfully to pursue these claims, we could be subject to significant\nadditional tax liabilities.\nSee “Note 5—Leases” for details of our future minimum lease payments under operating lease liabilities. See “Note 11—Incomes Taxes” for information regarding income tax\ncontingencies.\nNOTE 8. SUPPLEMENTAL FINANCIAL STATEMENT INFORMATION\nERC Sale\nAs of December 31, 2022, we had recorded an Employee Retention Credit (“ERC”) receivable of $4.9 million within “Other current assets” on our consolidated balance sheets,\nand a corresponding amount was included in “Other income (expense), net” in our consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive loss for the year ended December\n31, 2022. On February 16, 2023, two of Greenlane Holdings, Inc.’s subsidiaries, Warehouse Goods LLC and KIM International LLC (collectively, the “Company”), entered\ninto an agreement with a third-party institutional investor pursuant to which the investor purchased, for approximately $4.9 million in cash, an economic participation interest,\nat a discount, in all of the Company’s rights to payment from the United States Internal Revenue Service with respect to the employee retention credits filed by the Company\nunder the ERC program.\nOther Current Assets\nThe following table summarizes the composition of other current assets as of the dates indicated:\nAs of\n(in thousands) September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023\nOther current assets:\nVAT refund receivable (Note 2) $ 224 $ 78\nPrepaid expenses 109 1,207\nIndemnification receivable, net 7 7\nCustoms bonds 1,122 1,229\nOther 817 798\n$ 2,279 $ 3,319\n19\nAccrued Expenses and Other Current Liabilities\nThe following table summarizes the composition of accrued expenses and other current liabilities as of the dates indicated:\nAs of\n(in thousands) September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023\nAccrued expenses and other current liabilities:\nVAT payable (including amounts related to VAT matter described in Note 2) $ 629 $ 313\nContingent consideration — 1,000\nAccrued employee compensation 1,122 861\nAccrued professional fees and other expenses 267 499\nRefund liability (including accounts receivable credit balances) — 68\nSales tax payable 507 315\n$ 2,525 $ 3,056\nCustomer Deposits\nFor certain product offerings we may receive a deposit from the customer (generally 25% - 50% of the total order cost, but the amount can vary by customer contract), when an\norder is placed by a customer. We typically complete orders related to customer deposits within one to six months from the date of order, depending on the complexity of the\ncustomization and the size of the order, but the order completion timeline can vary by product type and terms of sale with each customer. Changes in our customer deposits\nliability balance during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were as follows:\n(in thousands) Customer Deposits\nBalance as of December 31, 2023 $ 2,775\nIncreases due to deposits received, net of other adjustments —\nCustomer Overpayments —\nRevenue recognized (1,520)\nBalance as of September 30, 2024 $ 1,255\nAccumulated Other Comprehensive Income\nThe components of accumulated other comprehensive income for the periods presented were as follows:\nUnrealized Gain or\nForeign Currency (Loss) on Derivative\n(in thousands) Translation Instrument Total\nBalance at December 31, 2023 $ 245 $ — $ 245\nOther comprehensive income 3 — 3\nBalance at September 30, 2024 $ 248 $ — $ 248\nUnrealized Gain or\nForeign Currency (Loss) on Derivative\n(in thousands) Translation Instrument Total\nBalance at December 31, 2022 $ 55 $ — $ 55\nOther comprehensive income (loss) 183 — 183\nLess: Other comprehensive (income) loss attributable to non-controlling interest — — —\nBalance at September 30, 2023 $ 238 $ — $ 238\nSupplier Concentration\nOur four largest vendors accounted for an aggregate of approximately 43.8% and 18.2% of our total purchases for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024,\nrespectively, and an aggregate of approximately 89.9% and 82.2% of our total purchases for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively.\n20\nRelated Party Transactions\nNicholas Kovacevich, our former Chief Corporate Development Officer owns capital stock of Blum Holdings Inc. (“Blum”). Net sales to Blum totaled approximately $0.4\nmillion for the year ended December 31, 2022. Total accounts receivable due from Blum were approximately $0.4 million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023,\nrespectively. On February 8, 2023, we filed a lawsuit against Blum in Superior Court of California, Orange County, seeking to compel the repayment of Blum’s open balance\ndue to us. As of the date of these financial statements were available to be issued, there has been a judgement received in favor of the Company.\nThree individuals who were employees of the Company at the time are principals in Synergy Imports, LLC the Lender on the Secured Bridge Loan taken out on September 22,\n2023, however, none were executive officers or directors of the Company\nNOTE 9. STOCKHOLDERS’ EQUITY\nShares of our Class A common stock have both voting interests and economic interests (i.e., the right to receive distributions or dividends, whether cash or stock, and proceeds\nupon dissolution, winding up or liquidation), while shares of our Class B common stock have voting interests but no economic interests. Each share of our Class A common\nstock, and except as otherwise required in the A&R Charter, the holders of Common Stock will vote together as a single class on all matters (or, if any holders of our preferred\nstock are entitled to vote together with the holders of Common Stock, as a single class with such holders of preferred stock).\nEffective June 5, 2023, we completed a one-for-10 reverse stock split (the “2023 Reverse Stock Split” and together with the 2022 Reverse Stock Split, the “Reverse Stock\nSplits”) of our issued and outstanding shares of Common Stock, as further described in “Note 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies.” As a result of the 2023 Reverse\nStock Split, every 10 shares of Common Stock issued and outstanding were converted into one share of Common Stock. We paid cash in lieu of fractional shares, and\naccordingly, no fractional shares were issued in connection with the 2023 Reverse Stock Split.\nOn June 18, 2024, the Board unanimously approved and declared advisable, and recommended that our stockholders approve at a Special Meeting that took place on July 29,\n2024, the adoption of the 2024 Amendment to effect a reverse stock split of our Common Stock at any whole number between, and inclusive of, one-for-two to one-for-twenty.\nApproval of the Proposed 2024 Reverse Stock Split at the 2024 Special Meeting granted the Board the authority, but not the obligation, to file the 2024 Amendment to effect\nthe Proposed 2024 Reverse Stock Split no later than August 5, 2024, with the exact ratio and timing of the Proposed 2024 Reverse Stock Split to be determined at the discretion\nof the Board. On July 23, 2024, the Board approved the reverse split at a ratio of one-for-11 and the Amendment has been filed with the Secretary of State of the State of\nDelaware, that became effective on August 5, 2024 at 12:01 AM Eastern Time, before the opening of trading on the Nasdaq. For additional information about the July 29, 2024\nSpecial Meeting and the 2024 Reverse Stock Split, see the Company’s Definitive Proxy Statement filed with the SEC on June 28, 2024 and Form 8-K filed with the SEC on\nJuly 31, 2024.\nThe Reverse Stock Splits did not change the par value of the Common Stock or the authorized number of shares of Common Stock. All share and per share amounts in these\nunaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and notes thereto have been retroactively adjusted for all periods presented to give effect to the Reverse Stock Splits,\nincluding reclassifying an amount equal to the reduction in par value of Common Stock to additional paid-in capital.\nNon-Controlling Interest\nAs discussed in “Note 1—Business Operations and Organization”, we consolidate the financial results of the Operating Company in our consolidated financial statements and\nreport a non-controlling interest related to the Common Units held by non-controlling interest holders. As of December 31, 2022, all Common Units of the Operating Company\nand Class B common stock had been exchanged for Class A common stock, and we owned 100.0% of the economic interests in the Operating Company. The non-controlling\ninterest in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss represents the portion of the net loss attributable to the economic interest in the\nOperating Company previously held by the non-controlling holders of Common Units calculated based on the weighted average non-controlling interests’ ownership during the\nperiods presented.\nAt-the-Market Equity Offering\nIn August 2021, we established an “at-the-market” equity offering program (the “ATM Program”) that provides for the sale of shares of our Class A common stock having an\naggregate offering price of up to $50 million, from time to time, through Cowen and Company, LLC (“Cowen”), as the sales agent. Net proceeds from sales of our shares of\nClass A common stock under the ATM Program are expected to be used for working capital and general corporate purposes.\nSales of our Class A common stock under the ATM Program may be made by means of transactions that are deemed to be an “at the market offering” as defined in Rule 415(a)\n(4) under the Securities Act, including sales made directly on the Nasdaq Capital Market or sales made to or through a market maker or through an electronic communications\nnetwork. We are under no obligation to offer and sell shares of our Class A common stock under the ATM Program.\n21\nShares of our Class A common stock will be issued pursuant to our effective shelf registration statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-257654), and a prospectus supplement\nrelating to the Class A common stock that was filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on April 18, 2022. Pursuant to Instruction I.B.6, in no event will the\nCompany sell Class A common stock through the ATM Program with a value exceeding more than one-third of the Company’s “public float” (the market value of the\nCompany’s Class A common stock and any other equity securities that it issues in the future that are held by non-affiliates) in any twelve-month period so long as the\nCompany’s public float remains below $75.0 million.\nOn April 18, 2022, we entered into Amendment No. 1 (the “ATM Amendment”) to the sales agreement dated August 2, 2022 with Cowen. The purpose of the Amendment was\nto add the limitations imposed on the ATM Program by Instruction I.B.6 to the sales agreement. At the time of our entry into the ATM Amendment, approximately $37.3 million\nin shares remained available for issuance under the ATM Program.\nDue to the untimely filing of our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended March 31, 2023 we are unable to issue additional shares of Class A common\nstock pursuant to the ATM Program or otherwise use the Shelf Registration Statement for a period of 12 months, which will limit our liquidity options in the capital markets.\nThe table below summarizes sales of our Class A common stock under the ATM program:\nAugust 2021 (Inception)\nthrough\n($ in thousands) September 30, 2024\nClass A shares sold 8,842\nGross proceeds $ 12,684\nFees paid to sales agent $ 381\nNet proceeds $ 12,303\nCommon Stock and Warrant Offerings\nJuly 2023 Offering\nOn June 29, 2023, we entered into securities purchase agreements with certain investors, pursuant to which we agreed to issue and sell an aggregate of 50,952 shares of our\nClass A common stock, pre-funded warrants to purchase up to 317,013 shares of our Class A common stock (the “July 2023 Pre-Funded Warrants”) and warrants to purchase up\nto 735,931 shares of our Class A common stock (the “July 2023 Standard Warrants”). The July 2023 units each consisted of one share of Class A common stock or a July 2023\nPre-Funded Warrant and two July 2023 Standard Warrants to purchase one share of our Class A common stock. The July 2023 units were offered pursuant to an effective\nRegistration Statement on Form S-1. The July 2023 Standard Warrants are exercisable immediately at an exercise price equal to $1.05 per share of Class A common stock for a\nperiod of five years. Each July 2023 Pre-Funded Warrant is exercisable immediately with no expiration date for one share of Class A common stock at an exercise price of\n$0.0001. The July 2023 Offering generated gross proceeds of approximately $4.3 million and net proceeds to the Company of approximately $3.8 million.\nAs of the date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, all July 2023 Pre-Funded Warrants have been exercised, based upon which we issued additional shares of our Class A\ncommon stock, for de minimis net proceeds.\nIn connection with the July 2023 Offering, the Company entered into privately negotiated agreements with holders participating in the offering to amend existing outstanding\nwarrants to purchase up to 122,215 shares of Class A common stock that were previously issued in connection with the June 2022 and October 2022 Offerings at exercise prices\nper share of $50.00 and $9.00, respectively, and expire on December 29, 2027 and November 1, 2029, respectively (collectively, the “Prior Warrants”), effective upon the\nclosing of the July 2023 Offering to reduce the exercise price of the Prior Warrants to $1.05, the exercise price of the warrants to purchase shares of Class A common stock\noffered in the July 2023 Offering. All other terms of the Prior Warrants remained unchanged.\nAugust 2024 Private Placement\nOn August 12, 2024, the Company entered into a securities purchase agreement with a single institutional investor pursuant to which we agreed to issue and sell an aggregate of\n58,000 shares of our Class A common stock, pre-funded warrants to purchase up to 2,305,637 shares of our Class A common stock (the “August 2024 Pre-Funded Warrants”)\nand warrants to purchase up to 4,727,274 shares of our Class A common stock (the “August 2024 Standard Warrants”). for aggregate gross cash proceeds of $6.5 million. In\nconnection with the private placement, the Company will issue an aggregate of 2,363,637 units and pre-funded units. The pre-funded units will be sold at the same purchase\nprice as the units, less the pre-funded warrant exercise price of $0.00001. Each unit and pre-funded unit will consist of one share of common stock (or one pre-funded warrant)\nand two common warrants, each exercisable for one share of common stock at an exercise price of $2.50 per share. The common warrant will be exercisable on the initial\nexercise date described in the common warrant and will expire 5.0 years from such date.\nAs of September 30, 2024, there were 2,176,647 warrants that remained unexercised.\nNet Loss Per Share\nBasic net loss per share of Class A common stock is computed by dividing net loss attributable to Greenlane by the weighted-average number of shares of Class A common\nstock outstanding during the period. Diluted net loss per share of Class A common stock is computed by dividing net loss attributable to Greenlane by the weighted-average\nnumber of shares of Class A common stock outstanding adjusted to give effect to potentially dilutive instruments.\nA reconciliation of the numerator and denominator used in the calculation of basic and diluted net loss per share of our Class A common stock is as follows (in thousands,\nexcept per share amounts):\nThree months ended September 30, Nine months ended September 30,\n(in thousands, except per share data) 2024 2023 2024 2023\nNumerator:\nNet loss $ (3,757) $ (10,098) $ (8,882) $ (27,869)\nLess: Net income (loss) attributable to non-controlling\ninterests — 19 (17) (27)\nPlus: Deemed Dividend on “October 2022 Standard\nWarrants” — (388) — (388)\nNet loss attributable to Class A common stockholders $ (3,757) $ (10,467) $ (8,899) $ (28,284)\nDenominator:\nWeighted average shares of Class A common stock\noutstanding 1,647 501 726 265\nNet loss per share of Class A common stock - basic and diluted $ (2.28) $ (20.89) $ (12.26) $ (106.73)\n22\nAs of September 30, 2024, there were 2,245,629 warrants that remained unexercised which we used in determining the weighted average shares outstanding.\nFor the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, stock options and warrants to purchase Class A common stock were excluded from the\nweighted-average in the computation of diluted net loss per share of Class A common stock because the effect would have been anti-dilutive.\nNOTE 10. COMPENSATION PLANS\nAmended and Restated 2019 Equity Incentive Plan\nIn April 2019, we adopted the 2019 Equity Incentive Plan (the “2019 Plan”). In August 2021, we adopted, and our shareholders approved, the Amended and Restated 2019\nEquity Incentive Plan (the “Amended 2019 Plan”), which amends and restates the 2019 Plan in its entirety. At our 2022 Annual Meeting of Stockholders on August 4, 2022,\nstockholders approved the Second Amended and Restated 2019 Equity Incentive Plan (the “Second Amended 2019 Plan”) which, among other things, increased the number of\nshares of Class A common stock authorized for issuance under the Amended 2019 Plan. Following the effect of the Reverse Stock Splits, the total number of shares of Class A\ncommon stock authorized for issuance is 10,000 shares.\nThe Second Amended 2019 Plan provides eligible participants with compensation opportunities in the form of cash and equity incentive awards. The Second Amended 2019\nPlan is designed to enhance our ability to attract, retain and motivate our employees, directors, and executive officers, and incentivizes them to increase our long-term growth\nand equity value in alignment with the interests of our stockholders.\nOn June 2, 2023, the Company’s stockholders approved a third amendment and restatement of the 2019 Plan (the “Third Amended Plan”). The Third Amended Plan, among\nother things, increases the number of shares of Class A common stock authorized for issuance under the Second Amended 2019 Plan by 19,078 shares to an aggregate of 29,078\nshares. As of the date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, we have not filed a Registration Statement on Form S-8 with the Securities and Exchange Commission to register\nthe additional shares authorized under the Third Amended Plan.\nEquity-Based Compensation Expense\nEquity-based compensation expense is included within “salaries, benefits and payroll taxes” in our condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss.\nWe recognized equity-based compensation expense as follows:\nFor the three months ended For the nine months ended\nSeptember 30, September 30,\n(in thousands) 2024 2023 2024 2023\nStock options - Class A common stock $ — $ (77) $ — $ 2\nRestricted shares - Class A common stock — 8 86 29\nTotal equity-based compensation expense $ — $ (69) $ 86 $ 31\nAs of September 30, 2024, there was no remaining unrecognized compensation expense.\n23\nNOTE 11. INCOME TAXES\nAs a result of the IPO and the related transactions completed in April 2019, we owned a portion of the Common Units of the Operating Company, which is treated as a\npartnership for U.S. federal and most applicable state and local income tax purposes. As a partnership, the Operating Company was generally not subject to U.S. federal and\ncertain state and local income taxes. Any taxable income or loss generated by the Operating Company was passed through to and included in the taxable income or loss of its\nmembers, including Greenlane, on a pro-rata basis, in accordance with the terms of the Operating Agreement. The Operating Company was also subject to taxes in foreign\njurisdictions. We are a corporation subject to U.S. federal income taxes, in addition to state and local income taxes, based on our share of the Operating Company’s pass-\nthrough taxable income.\nEffective on December 31, 2022, the Operating Company became wholly owned by us. As a result, the Operating Company’s tax status was converted from a partnership to a\ndisregarded entity. Starting in 2023, 100% of the Operating Company’s U.S. income and expenses is included in our US and state tax returns.\nDuring the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, management performed an assessment of the realizability of our deferred tax assets based\nupon which management determined that it is not more likely than not that the results of operations will generate sufficient taxable income to realize portions of the net\noperating loss benefits. Consequently, we established a full valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets and reflected a carrying balance of $0 as of September 30, 2024\nand December 31, 2023, respectively. In the event that management determines that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of their net\nrecorded amount, an adjustment to the valuation allowance will be made, which would reduce December the provision for income taxes.\nUncertain Tax Positions\nFor the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, we did not have any unrecognized tax benefits as a result of tax positions taken during a prior\nperiod or during the current period. No interest or penalties have been recorded as a result of tax uncertainties. The Company is subject to audit examination for federal and\nstate purposes for the years 2019 – 2023. As of the date these financial statements were issued, there were not any ongoing income tax audits.\nTax Receivable Agreement (TRA)\nWe entered into the TRA with the Operating Company and each of the members (other than Greenlane Holdings, Inc.) that provides for the payment by the Operating Company\nto the members of 85% of the amount of tax benefits, if any, that we may actually realize (or in some circumstances are deemed to realize) as a result of (i) increases in tax basis\nresulting from any future redemptions of Common Units as described in “Note 1—Business Operations and Organization” and (ii) certain other tax benefits attributable to\npayments made under the TRA.\nThe annual tax benefits are computed by calculating the income taxes due, including such tax benefits, and the income taxes due without such benefits. The Operating\nCompany expects to benefit from the remaining 15% of any tax benefits that it may actually realize. The TRA payments are not conditioned upon any continued ownership\ninterest in the Operating Company. The rights of each noncontrolling interest holder under the TRA are assignable to transferees of its interest in the Operating Company. The\ntiming and amount of aggregate payments due under the TRA may vary based on a number of factors, including the amount and timing of the taxable income the Operating\nCompany generates each year and the applicable tax rate.\nAs noted above, we evaluated the realizability of the deferred tax assets resulting from the IPO and the related transactions completed in April 2019 and established a full\nvaluation allowance against those benefits. As a result, we determined that the amount or timing of payments to noncontrolling interest holders under the TRA are no longer\nprobable or reasonably estimable. Based on this assessment, our TRA liability was $0 as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023.\nIf utilization of the deferred tax assets subject to the TRA becomes more likely than not in the future, we will record a liability related to the TRA, which would be recognized\nas expense within our condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive (loss) income.\nDuring the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, we did not make any payments, inclusive of interest, to members of the Operating\nCompany pursuant to the TRA.\n24\nNOTE 12. SUBSEQUENT EVENTS\nOn October 29, 2024, the Company entered into an Exchange Agreement with its Senior Subordinated Lender, whereby the Company agreed to exchange an aggregate of\n$4,617,307 of debt originally owed to Agile Capital Funding LLC and Cedar Advance LLC in a 3(a)(9) exchange for new Senior Subordinated Notes in the principal amount of\n$4,000,000 due one year from issuance (the “Exchange Note”), reducing outstanding indebtedness by approximately $617,000. The Exchange Note is convertible at the option\nof the holder at $3.17 per share. In connection with the Exchange, the Company issued an aggregate of 1,261,830 five year warrants with an exercise price of $3.04 per share\n(the “Exchange Warrants”).\nIn addition, pursuant to the terms of the Exchange Agreement, the Company agreed to issue warrants to the Holders, with an initial exercise price of $3.04, exercisable 180 days\nafter issuance (the “Exchange Inducement Warrants”). The Exchange Inducement Warrants were issued to incentivize the holders to exercise some or all of their existing\nwarrants originally issued on August 13, 2024 (the “Existing Warrants”) for cash, which existing warrants have an exercise price of $2.50 per share. The Exchange Inducement\nWarrants are initially exercisable for zero shares, but to the extent that the Holders exercise any of such Existing Warrants during the one-hundred sixty day inducement period,\nthe Exchange Inducement Warrants will become exercisable on April 30, 2025 for 200% of the number of Existing Warrants exercised for cash during such inducement period.\nAlso, pursuant to the Exchange Agreement, the Senior Subordinated Lender agreed that it will exercise its Existing Warrants for cash prior to exercising any of its outstanding\npre-funded warrants, contingent on the market price of the common stock being above $2.50 per share and certain other conditions. The above agreement will terminate upon\nthe Company receiving certain cash proceeds and prepaying at least $2,250,000 of Cobra Alternative Capital Strategies LLC (“Cobra”) Notes.\nOn October 29, 2024, the Company entered into the First Amendment to Amended and Restated Secured Promissory Note (the “Note Amendment”) with Cobra. Pursuant to the\nNote Amendment, Cobra agreed to extend the Maturity Date of its senior promissory note dated May 1, 2024, which is currently due. The new Maturity Date will be October\n29, 2025. In consideration for the extension, the Company (i) agreed to make such Notes convertible at the option of Cobra with a conversion price of $3.17 per share, (ii)\nagreed to prepay Cobra’s debt with 50% of any money raised by the Company from warrant exercise proceeds and from capital raise transactions, and (iii) issued Cobra an\naggregate of 500,000 five year warrants with an exercise price of $3.04 per share which are identical to the Exchange Warrants.\n25\nITEM 2.

These acquisitions strengthened our leading position as a consumer ancillary products business and significantly expanded our customer network, bringing strategic\nrelationships with leading cannabis multi-state-operators (“MSOs”), cannabis single-state operators (“SSOs”), and Canadian licensed-producers (“LPs”). Greenlane is a leading\nancillary cannabis company, providing a wide array of consumer ancillary products and industrial ancillary products to thousands of cannabis producers, processors, brands,\nand retailers (“related Cannabis Operators”), in addition to specialty retailers, smoke shops and head shops, convenience stores, and consumers directly through our own\nproprietary web stores and large online marketplaces such as Amazon.\nWe have been developing a world-class portfolio of our own proprietary brands (the “Greenlane Brands”) and carefully curated third-party products that we believe\nwill, over time, deliver higher margins and create long-term value for our customers and shareholders. Our wholly-owned Greenlane Brands includes our recently launched\nmore affordable product line – Groove, innovative silicone pipes and accessories and premium ancillary product brand – Higher Standards. We also have category exclusive\nlicenses for the premium Marley Natural branded products, as well as the K. Haring Glass Collection.\nSince the end of 2021, the Company has invested significantly in technology, including its e-commerce platforms, internal ERP systems, and B2B capabilities. Our\nworld-class product portfolio is offered to customers through our proprietary, owned and operated e-commerce platforms which include Vapor.com, PuffItUp.com,\nHigherStandards.com, MarleyNaturalShop.com and Wholesale.Greenlane.com. These platforms allow us to reach customers directly with helpful resources and a seamless\npurchasing experience.\nWe merchandise vaporizers, packaging, and other ancillary products in the United States, Canada, Europe and Latin America. We distribute products to retailers\nthrough wholesale operations and distribute products to consumers through our e-commerce platforms We operate our own distribution centers in the United States, while also\nutilizing third-party logistics (“3PL”) locations in Canada. We have made tremendous progress consolidating and streamlining our warehouse and distribution operations over\nthe last two years.\nWe manage our business in two different, but complementary, business segments. The first is the Consumer Goods segment, which focuses on serving consumers\nacross wholesale, retail, and e-commerce operations—offering both our Greenlane Brands as well as ancillary products and accessories from select leading third-party brands,\nsuch as Storz and Bickel, Grenco Science, PAX, Arizer and more. The Consumer Goods segment forms a central part of our growth strategy, especially as it relates to scaling\nour own portfolio of higher-margin proprietary owned brands. In addition to our Consumer Goods segment, we have our Industrial Goods segment, which focuses on serving\nCannabis Operators by providing ancillary products essential to their daily operations and growth, such as packaging and vaporization solutions, including our Greenlane Brand\nPollen Gear. Refer to “Note 12— Segment Reporting” within this Form 10-Q for additional information on our reportable segments.\n27\nPlan to Accelerate Path to Profitability and Capitalize the Business\nIn today’s economic landscape, particularly within the cannabis industry, achieving profitability and preserving working capital are paramount. At Greenlane, we are\nintensely focused on making our business profitable and well-capitalized for long-term sustainability. Our key initiatives include:\n1. Technology Enhancements: We remain fully committed to improving our technology, particularly our B2B and e-commerce platforms, to provide a seamless shopping\nexperience for our wholesale and retail customers.\n2. Facility Footprint Rationalization: In 2023 and 2024, we optimized our facilities footprint by reducing warehouse and office space while increasing operational\nefficiency and improving fulfillment practices. The full benefit of those efforts are expected to be realized in 2024.\n3. Headcount Reduction: We have significantly reduced our headcount and associated salary expenses, focusing on maintaining a core group of key employees as we\ncollectively right-size the business.\n4. Cost Structure Optimization: We continue to reduce our overall cost structure while improving margins. In April 2023, we formed two strategic partnerships (described\nbelow in greater detail) to increase margins and significantly reduce working capital requirements in our Industrial Goods segment. Similarly, our Consumer Goods\nsegment restructured arrangements with several third-party brands in 2022 and 2023 to reduce our working capital needs.\n5. Inventory Management: In 2023, we implemented a new inventory management and lifecycle strategy that is focused on a quarterly turn and a regular review of\ninventory to avoid future write-offs.\n6. Sales Force Upgrade: We have upgraded and will continue to upgrade our sales force from a solely account management centric team to a skilled and driven sales team\nto acquire new customers while maintaining excellent service with our existing customers\n7. Product Innovation: We launched Groove, an innovative new product line with a value-based price point and in 2024 we have begun to expand our product offering to\nfurther enhance our assortment available to our customers.\n8. Capital Investment: We continue to seek opportunities for securing investment capital to leverage our platform, increase availability and reduce stockouts of our high\ndemand third-party brands, invest in marketing and sales, and improve our product offerings.\nManagement believes that these initiatives will significantly reduce costs, help accelerate the Company’s path to profitability, support business growth, and allow the\nCompany to reinvest capital into its highest demand and highest potential product lines.\nDuring 2023 and 2024, the Company received capital from various sources permitting it to right-size the business and position the company for growth. Such sources\nare described in greater detail in the Liquidity and Capital Resources Section of this report.\nDuring 2023 and 2024, the Company also entered into certain arrangements to reduce working capital requirements and improve its balance sheet.\nIn April 2023, we entered into two strategic partnerships. First, we entered into a strategic partnership (the “MJ Packaging Partnership”) with A&A Global Imports\nd/b/a MarijuanaPackaging.com (“MJ Pack”), a leading provider of packaging solutions to the cannabis industry. On August 8, 2024 the Company terminated its strategic\npartnership with MJ Packaging and is resuming its business as a direct provider of packaging solutions to the cannabis industry. MJ Packaging however, remains a distribution\ncustomer of the Company. Second, we entered into a strategic partnership with an affiliate of one of our existing vape suppliers (“Vape Partner”) to service certain key\ncustomers with vaporizer goods and services (the “Vape Partnership”). As part of the Vape Partnership, we will introduce our Vape Partner to certain key customers, assist with\nthe promotion and the sale of certain vaporizer goods and services, and help coordinate the logistics, storage and distribution of such vaporizer products. If our Vape Partner and\nkey customer(s) enter into a direct relationship, the customers would directly purchase vaporizer goods and services, which we currently sell them, directly from our Vape\nPartner and we would no longer need to purchase such vape inventory on behalf of such key customer(s). In exchange we would earn quarterly and annual commission\npayments from our strategic partner. While the strategic partnership may result in a decrease in top line revenue for these vape products, this partnership combined with some of\nour other restructuring initiatives should allow us to reduce our overall cost-structure and enhance our margins, thereby improving our balance sheet.\n28\nOn May 6, 2024, the Company, Warehouse Goods and Synergy entered into an asset purchase agreement, dated May 1, 2024 (the “Asset Purchase Agreement”)\npursuant to which Synergy purchased all of the intellectual property, a specified amount of inventory, and other assets related to the Eyce and DaVinci brands. In consideration\nfor the acquisition, all parties entered into a loan modification agreement, effective May 1, 2024 (the “Loan Modification Agreement”) and an amended and restated secured\npromissory note, effective May 1, 2024 (the “Amended and Restated Secured Promissory Note”), an amendment to the original Eyce and Davinci Asset Purchase Agreements,\na distribution agreement, the termination of a license granted by Eyce, and the termination of certain consulting and employment agreements. As part of the overall\nmodification, the principal balance with Synergy decreased by $2.7 million from $5.1 million. Synergy acquired certain assets from the Company in exchange for the reduction\nin overall principal owed and as part of the transaction, the Company recognized a gain on the debt modification of $2.2 million. This amount is included in the accompanying\nfinancial statements within the statement of operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 within other income (expense). At September 30, 2024, $2.7\nmillion of such financing remained outstanding. As of the filing date of this statement and as a result of restructuring efforts, the maturity of this note is October 2025.\nUSPS PACT Act Exemption\nOn January 11, 2022, we announced via press release that the United States Postal Service (the “USPS”) had approved our application for a business and regulatory\nexemption to the PACT Act (with respect to the business and regulatory exemption granted by the USPS, the “PACT Act Exemption”), allowing us to ship vaporizers and\naccessories classified as electronic nicotine delivery systems (“ENDS”) products to other compliant businesses. With this approval, over 97% of our total annual sales became\neligible for shipment by freight, USPS and other major parcel carriers. The PACT Act Exemption also enables us to partner with other businesses that ship ENDS products and\nhad their supply chains disrupted by PACT Act compliance.\nOn June 24, 2022, we provided via press release an update on the progress of the PACT Act Exemption, following our successful implementation of the controls,\nprocesses and systems required by the USPS in connection with the shipment of ENDS products. We expect the ability to fulfill ENDS orders with the USPS to allow us to\nreduce shipping costs, decrease fulfillment times and enhance the overall customer experience for approved wholesale customers.\nReverse Stock Split\nOn June 2, 2023, we filed a Certificate of Amendment to the A&R Charter with the SSSD, which effected a one-for-10 reverse stock split (the “2023 Reverse Stock\nSplit” and together with the 2022 Reverse Stock Split, the “Reverse Stock Splits”) of our issued and outstanding shares of Common Stock at 5:01 PM Eastern Time on June 5,\n2023. As a result of the 2023 Reverse Stock Split, every 10 shares of common stock issued and outstanding were converted into one share of common stock. We paid cash in\nlieu of fractional shares, and accordingly, no fractional shares were issued in connection with the 2023 Reverse Stock Split.\nThe Reverse Stock Split did not change the par value of the Common Stock or the authorized number of shares of Common Stock. All outstanding options, restricted\nstock awards, warrants and other securities entitling their holders to purchase or otherwise receive shares of our Common Stock have been adjusted as a result of the Reverse\nStock Split, as required by the terms of each security. The number of shares available to be awarded under our Second Amended and Restated 2019 Equity Incentive Plan have\nalso been appropriately adjusted. See “Note 10 — Compensation Plans” for more information.\nOn July 23, 2024, the Board approved the reverse split at a ratio of one-for-11 and the Amendment has been filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware,\nwhich became effective on August 5, 2024 at 12:01 AM Eastern Time, before the opening of trading on the Nasdaq.\nAll share and per share amounts were retroactively adjusted for all periods presented to give effect to the Reverse Stock Split.\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nWe prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”). The\npreparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent\nassets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. We evaluate our estimates and\nassumptions on an ongoing basis. We base our estimates on historical experience, outside advice from parties believed to be experts in such matters, and on various other\nassumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and\nliabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Judgments and uncertainties affecting the application of those policies may result in materially different amounts\nbeing reported under different conditions or using different assumptions. See “Note 2—Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial\nStatements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K for a description the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of our consolidated financial\nstatements.\nInventories\nInventories, consisting of finished products, are primarily accounted for using the weighted-average method, and are valued at the lower of cost and net realizable\nvalue. This valuation requires us to make judgments, based on currently available information, about the likely method of disposition, such as through sales to customers or\nliquidations. Assumptions about the future disposition of inventory are inherently uncertain and changes in our estimates and assumptions may cause us to realize material\nwrite-downs in the future.\n29\nIncome Taxes and TRA Liability\nWe are a corporation subject to income taxes in the United States. Certain subsidiaries of the Operating Company are taxable separately from us. Our proportional\nshare of the Operating Company’s subsidiaries’ provisions are included in our consolidated financial statements.\nAs of December 31, 2022, we held all the outstanding Common Units in the Operating Company and are the sole member. As a result, in 2023, 100% of the Operating\nCompany’s US and state income and expenses are now included in our US and state tax returns.\nOur deferred income tax assets and liabilities are computed for differences between the tax basis and financial statement amounts that will result in taxable or\ndeductible amounts in the future. We compute deferred balances based on enacted tax laws and applicable rates for the periods in which the differences are expected to affect\ntaxable income. A valuation allowance is recognized for deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the net deferred tax assets will not be realized.\nIn making such a determination, we consider all available positive and negative evidence, including future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, projected future\ntaxable income, tax-planning strategies, and results of recent operations. If we determine we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets for which a valuation allowance\nhad been recorded, then we would adjust the deferred tax asset valuation allowance, which would reduce our provision for income taxes.\nWe evaluate the tax positions taken on income tax returns that remain open and positions expected to be taken on the current year tax returns to identify uncertain tax\npositions. Unrecognized tax benefits on uncertain tax positions are recorded on the basis of a two-step process in which (1) we determine whether it is more likely than not that\nthe tax positions will be sustained on the basis of the technical merits of the position and (2) for those tax positions that meet the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold, the\nlargest amount of tax benefit that is more than 50 percent likely to be realized is recognized. Interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits are recorded in income\ntax benefit. We have no uncertain tax positions that qualify for inclusion in our consolidated financial statements.\nIn addition to tax expenses, we may incur expenses related to our operations and may be required to make payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement (the\n“TRA”), which could be significant. Pursuant to the Greenlane Operating Agreement, Greenlane Holdings, LLC will generally make pro rata tax distributions to its members in\nan amount sufficient to fund all or part of their tax obligations with respect to the taxable income of Greenlane Holdings, LLC that is allocated to them and possibly in excess of\nsuch amount.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nSee “Note 2—Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of our Form 10-K filed on\nJuly 19, 2024.\nResults of Operations\nThe following table presents operating results for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023:\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, September 30,\n% of Net sales Change % of Net sales Change\n2024 2023 2024 2023 $ % 2024 2023 2024 2023 $ %\nNet sales 4,038 11,800 100.0% 100.0% $(7,762) (65.8)% 11,616 55,384 100.0% 100.0% $(43,768) (79.0)%\nCost of sales 1,011 8,671 25.0% 73.5% (7,660) (88.3)% 6,066 42,162 52.2% 76.1% (36,096) (85.6)%\nGross profit 3,027 3,129 75.0% 26.5% (102) (3.3)% 5,550 13,222 47.8% 23.9% (7,672) (58.0)%\nOperating expenses:\nSalaries, benefits and payroll taxes 1,609 4,059 39.8% 34.4% (2,450) (60.4)% 6,066 14,586 52.2% 26.3% (8,520) (58.4)%\nGeneral and administrative 1,771 5,433 43.9% 46.0% (3,662) (67.4)% 6,864 20,209 59.1% 36.5% (13,345) (66.0)%\nDepreciation and amortization 185 524 4.6% 7.4% (339) (64.7)% 635 1,492 5.5% 2.7% (857) (57.4)%\nTotal operating expenses 3,565 10,016 88.3% 84.8% (6,451) (64.4)% 13,565 36,287 116.8% 65.5% (22,722) (62.6)%\nLoss from operations (538) (6,887) (13.3)% (58.3)% 6,349 (92.2)% (8,015) (23,065) (69.0)% (41.6)% 15,050 (65.3)%\nOther income (expense), net:\nInterest expense (3,219) (3,415) (79.7)% (28.9)% 196 (5.7)% (4,030) (5,148) (34.7)% (9.3)% 1,118 (21.7)%\nChange in fair value of contingent\nconsideration - - - - - -% 1,000 - 8.6% - 1,000 100.0%\nGain on extinguishment of debt - - - - - -% 2,166 - 18.6% - 2,166 100.0%\nOther income (expense), net - 204 - 1.7% (204) (100)% (3) 338 -% 0.6% (341) (100.9)%\nTotal other expense, net (3,219) (3,211) (79.7)% (27.2)% (8) 0.2% (867) (4,810) (7.5)% (8.7) 3,943 (82.0)\nLoss before income taxes (3,757) (10,098) (93.0)% (85.5)% 6,341 (62.8)% (8,882) (27,875) (76.5)% (50.3)% 18,993 (68.1)%\nProvision for (benefit from) income taxes - - -% —% - -% - (6) -% —% 6 (100.0)%\nNet loss (3,757) (10,098) (93.0)% (85.5)% 6,341 (62.8)% (8,882) (27,869) (76.5)% (50.3)% 18,987 (68.1)%\nNet income (loss) attributable to non-\ncontrolling interest - 19 - 0.2% (19) (100.0)% (17) (27) (0.1)% (0.2)% 10 (37.0)%\nNet loss attributable to Greenlane Holdings,\nInc. $(3,757) $(10,117) (93.0)% (85.7)% $ 6,360 (62.9)% $(8,865) $(27,842) (76.4)% (50.1)% 18,977 (68.2)%\n30\nConsolidated Results of Operations\nNet Sales\nFor the three months ended September 30, 2024, net sales were approximately $4.0 million, compared to approximately $11.8 million for the same period in 2024,\nrepresenting a decrease of $7.8 million, or 65.8%. The year-over-year decrease in net sales was due to a major restructuring of our Industrial Group in April of 2023, involving\nour packaging and industrial vaping product lines; transitioning much of this business from a gross sales to a commission structure to preserve working capital. Revenues\ndecreased in the Consumer Brands Group due, in part, to restructuring efforts and shift in strategy to focus on in-house brands that carry a higher margin profile while\nrationalizing third-party brand offerings, which generated top line revenue with lower margins. The consumer products were affected by the inability to access capital markets\non equitable terms, resulting in stock-outs and shortages of higher velocity inventory. The Company is continuing to focus on profitable revenue and as a result top line revenue\nhas significantly been reduced. Concurrently, the Company has continued its focus on right-sizing the business during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 and through\npresent, in an effort to reduce sales and marketing costs and reduce or eliminate certain administrative functions.\nFor the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net sales were approximately $11.6 million, compared to approximately $55.4 million for the same period in 2024,\nrepresenting a decrease of $43.8 million, or 79.0%.

Concurrently, the Company has continued its focus on right-sizing the business during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 and through\npresent, in an effort to reduce sales and marketing costs and reduce or eliminate certain administrative functions.\nCost of Sales and Gross Margin\nFor the three months ended September 30, 2024, cost of sales decreased by $7.7 million, or 88.3%, as compared to the same period in 2023. The decrease in the cost of\nsales is driven by the 65.8% decrease in revenue in addition to a decrease in damaged and obsolete inventory write-offs.\nFor the nine months ended September 30, 2024, cost of sales decreased by $36.1 million, or 85.6%, as compared to the same period in 2023. The decrease in the cost\nof sales is driven by the 79.0% decrease in revenue in addition to a decrease in damaged and obsolete inventory write-offs.\nGross margin percentage increased 48.4% to 75.0% for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 26.5% for the same period in 2023.\nGross margin percentage increased 23.9% to 47.8% for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 23.9% for the same period in 2023.\nSalaries, Benefits and Payroll Taxes\nSalaries, benefits and payroll taxes expenses decreased by approximately $2.5 million, or 60.4%, to $1.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024,\ncompared to $4.1 million for the same period in 2023. The decrease is related to the reduction in workforce to right-size the business and focus on profitability.\nSalaries, benefits and payroll taxes expenses decreased by approximately $8.5 million, or 58.4%, to $6.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024,\ncompared to $14.6 million for the same period in 2023. The decrease is related to the reduction in workforce to right-size the business and focus on profitability.\nAs we continue to closely monitor the evolving business landscape, we remain focused on identifying cost-saving opportunities while delivering on our strategy to\nrecruit, train, promote and retain the most talented and success-driven personnel in the industry.\n31\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nGeneral and administrative expenses decreased by approximately $3.7 million, or 67.4%, for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same\nperiod in 2023. The decrease is related to major restructuring effort by the Company to reduce cost and right-size the business. Compared with the first quarter of 2023, the\nCompany focused on reduction across the board in general and administrative expenses and saw large decreases in professional and outside services, facility expenses,\noutbound freight, other general and administrative, marketing, taxes and licenses, and general insurance.\nGeneral and administrative expenses decreased by approximately $13.3 million, or 66.0%, for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same\nperiod in 2023. The decrease is related to major restructuring effort by the Company to reduce cost and right-size the business. Compared with the first quarter of 2023, the\nCompany focused on reduction across the board in general and administrative expenses and saw large decreases in professional and outside services, facility expenses,\noutbound freight, other general and administrative, marketing, taxes and licenses, and general insurance.\nDepreciation and Amortization Expense\nDepreciation and amortization expense decreased $0.3 million, or 64.7%, for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period in 2023. The\ndecrease is related to a major restructuring effort to reduce cost and right-size the business resulting in the sale and disposal of assets related to reducing our warehousing and\noffice footprint.\nDepreciation and amortization expense decreased $0.9 million, or 57.4%, for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period in 2023. The\ndecrease is related to a major restructuring effort to reduce cost and right-size the business resulting in the sale and disposal of assets related to reducing our warehousing and\noffice footprint.\nOther Income (Expense), Net\nInterest expense.\nInterest expense decreased approximately $0.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023. The decrease is primarily\nrelated to reduction in overall debt financing and refinancing debt for more favorable terms.\nInterest expense decreased approximately $1.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023. The decrease is primarily\nrelated to reduction in overall debt financing and refinancing debt for more favorable terms.\nChange in fair value of contingent consideration\nThere was a change in fair value of contingent consideration of approximately $1.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same\nperiod in 2023. The change is primarily related to known reductions in earnouts related to Davinci and Eyce products.\n32\nGain on debt extinguishment\nThere was an increase in gain on debt extinguishment of approximately $2.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period in\n2023. The change is primarily related to a difference in the reduction in overall debt modification with Synergy, offset by the carrying value of the Davinci and Eyce assets\nacquired by Synergy. For further information, see Note 6, “Debt” of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q.\nProvision for (Benefit from) Income Taxes\nFor the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, the effective tax rate differed from the U.S. federal statutory tax rate of 21% primarily\ndue to the Operating Company’s pass-through structure for U.S. income tax purposes (through December 31, 2022), the relative mix in earnings and losses in the U.S. versus\nforeign tax jurisdictions, and the valuation allowance against the deferred tax asset.\nLiquidity, Capital Resources and Going Concern\nOur primary requirements for liquidity and capital are working capital, debt service related to recent acquisitions and general corporate needs. Our primary sources of\nliquidity are our cash on hand and the cash flow that we generate from our operations, as well as proceeds other equity issuances. As of September 30, 2024, we had\napproximately $2.3 million of cash, of which none was restricted and $0.1 million was held in foreign bank accounts, and approximately $2.5 million of negative working\ncapital, which is calculated as total current assets minus total current liabilities, as compared to approximately $0.5 million of cash, of which $0.1 million was held in foreign\nbank accounts, and approximately $3.7 million of working capital as of December 31, 2023. The repatriation of cash balances from our foreign subsidiaries could have adverse\ntax impacts or be subject to capital controls; however, these balances are generally available to fund the ordinary business operations of our foreign subsidiaries without legal or\nother restrictions.\nWe believe that our cash on hand and the cash flow that we generate from our operations will not be sufficient to fund our working capital and capital expenditure\nrequirements, as well as our debt repayments and other liquidity requirements associated with our existing operations, for the next 12 months. Based on our cash on hand and\nworking capital at September 30, 2024, we may have insufficient cash to fund planned operations into the fourth quarter of 2024. This is evident from our continued efforts to\nraise capital and leverage external funding to fulfil our capital needs as highlighted below.\n33\nATM Program and Shelf Registration Statement\nWe formerly used a shelf registration statement on Form S-3 (the “Shelf Registration Statement”) to conduct securities offerings. In August 2021, we filed a prospectus\nsupplement and established an “at-the-market” equity offering program (the “ATM Program”) that provided for the sale of shares of our Class A common stock having an\naggregate offering price of up to $50 million, from time to time.\nSince the launch of the ATM program in August 2021 and through December 31, 2022, we sold shares of our Class A common stock which generated gross proceeds\nof approximately $12.7 million and we paid fees to the sales agent of approximately $0.4 million. Due to the untimely filing of certain of our Quarterly and Annual Reports, we\nare unable to issue additional shares of Class A common stock pursuant to the ATM Program or otherwise use the Shelf Registration Statement.\nCommon Stock and Warrant Offerings\nOn June 29, 2023, we entered into securities purchase agreements with certain investors, pursuant to which we agreed to issue and sell an aggregate of 50,952 shares\nof our Class A common stock, pre-funded warrants to purchase up to 317,013 shares of our Class A Common Stock (the “July 2023 Pre-Funded Warrants”) and warrants to\npurchase up to 735,931 shares of our Class A common stock (the “July 2023 Standard Warrants”). The July 2023 units were offered pursuant to a Registration Statement on\nForm S-1 (the “July 2023 Offering”). The July 2023 Offering generated gross proceeds of approximately $4.3 million and net proceeds to the Company of approximately $3.8\nmillion and closed on July 3, 2023.\nOn August 12, 2024, the Company entered into a securities purchase agreement with a single institutional investor for aggregate gross cash proceeds of $6.5 million.\nIn connection with the private placement, the Company will issue an aggregate of 2,363,637 units and pre-funded units. The pre-funded units will be sold at the same purchase\nprice as the units, less the pre-funded warrant exercise price of $0.00001. Each unit and pre-funded unit will consist of one share of common stock (or one pre-funded warrant)\nand two common warrants, each exercisable for one share of common stock at an exercise price of $2.50 per share. The common warrant will be exercisable on the initial\nexercise date described in the common warrant and will expire 5.0 years from such date.\nAsset-Based Loan\nOn August 9, 2022, we entered into an asset-based loan agreement dated as of August 8, 2022 (the “Loan Agreement”), which made available to the Company a term\nloan of up to $15.0 million. On February 9, 2023, we entered into Amendment No. 2 to the Loan Agreement, in which we agreed to, among other things, voluntarily prepay\napproximately $6.6 million (inclusive of early termination fees and expenses) under the terms provided for under the Loan Agreement and the lenders under the Loan\nAgreement agreed to release $5.7 million in funds held in a blocked account pursuant to the terms of the Loan Agreement.\nOn August 7, 2023, we repaid the approximately $4.3 million in aggregate principal amount (the “Loan Repayment”) which remained outstanding under the terms of\nthe Loan Agreement. As a result of the Loan Repayment, the Company has been released from its obligations under the Loan Agreement, in accordance with the terms of the\nLoan Agreement. See “Note 6 - Long Term Debt” for more information.\nERC Sale\nOn February 16, 2023, two of our wholly owned subsidiaries, Warehouse Goods LLC and KIM International LLC, entered into an agreement with a third-party\ninstitutional investor pursuant to which the investor purchased, for approximately $4.9 million in cash, an economic participation interest, at a discount, in our rights to payment\nfrom the United States Internal Revenue Service for certain periods with respect to the employee retention credits filed by us under the Employee Retention Credit program.\nFuture Receivables Financings\nIn July, August, October, and November 2023, the Company received an aggregate of approximately $3.9 million in cash pursuant to the terms of future receivables\nfinancings (collectively, the “Future Receivables Financings”) entered into with two private lenders. See “Note 6 - Long Term Debt” for more information.\nNotes Payable\nOn June 7, 2024, the Company entered into a subscription agreement with Cobra Alternative Capital Strategies, LLC. As of September 30, 2024, the Company has\nbeen loaned $3.1 million with net cash proceeds of $2.6 million with a remaining balance of $1.0 million. The note was issued with a 20% original issue discount and is due in\nfull on December 7, 2024. See “Note 6 - Long Term Debt” for more information.\n34\nManagement Initiatives\nWe have completed several initiatives to optimize our working capital requirements. We launched Groove, a new, innovative Greenlane Brands product line, and we\nalso rationalized our third-party brands product offering, which enables us to reduce inventory carrying costs and working capital requirements.\nIn April 2023, we entered into two strategic partnerships. First, we entered into a strategic partnership (the “MJ Packaging Partnership”) with A&A Global Imports\nd/b/a MarijuanaPackaging.com (“MJ Pack”), a provider of packaging solutions to the cannabis industry. On August 8, 2024 the Company terminated its strategic partnership\nwith MJ Packaging and is resuming its business as a direct provider of packaging solutions to the cannabis industry. MJ Packaging however, remains a distribution customer of\nthe Company. Second, we entered into a strategic partnership with an affiliate of one of our existing vape suppliers (“Vape Partner”) to service certain key customers with\nvaporizer goods and services (the “Vape Partnership”). As part of the Vape Partnership, we will introduce our Vape Partner to certain key customers, assist with the promotion\nand the sale of certain vaporizer goods and services, and help coordinate the logistics, storage and distribution of such vaporizer products. If our Vape Partner and key\ncustomer(s) enter into a direct relationship, the customers would directly purchase vaporizer goods and services, which we currently sell them, directly from our Vape Partner\nand we would no longer need to purchase such vape inventory on behalf of such key customer(s). In exchange we would earn quarterly and annual commission payments from\nour strategic partners. While the strategic partnership may result in a decrease in top line revenue for these vape products, this partnership combined with some of our other\nrestructuring initiatives should allow us to reduce our overall cost-structure and enhance our margins, thereby improving our balance sheet.\nWe have successfully renegotiated supplier partnership terms and are continuing to improve working capital arrangements with suppliers. We have made progress\nconsolidating and streamlining our office, warehouse, and distribution operations footprint. We have reduced our workforce by approximately 49% throughout fiscal year 2023\nto reduce costs and align with our revenue projections.\nWe have incurred net losses of $8.9 million and $27.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. For the nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024, cash used in operating activities was $5.2 million and cash used in operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2023 was $1.8 million. The recent\nmacroeconomic environment has caused weaker demand than contemplated under our business plan, resulting in a reduction in projected revenue and cash flows for the\ntwelve-month period included in the going concern evaluation.\nAs a result of our losses and our projected cash needs, combined with our current liquidity level, substantial doubt exists about the Company’s ability to continue as a\ngoing concern. The Company’s ability to continue as a going concern is contingent upon successful execution of management’s intended plan over the next twelve months to\nimprove the Company’s liquidity and profitability, which includes, without limitation:\n■ Further reducing operating costs expense by taking additional restructuring actions to align cost with revenue to achieve profitability.\n■ Increasing revenue by introducing new products and acquiring new customers.\n■ Execute on strategic partnerships accretive to margins and operating cash\n■ Seeking additional capital through the issuance of debt or equity securities.\nOur opinions concerning liquidity are based on currently available information. To the extent this information proves to be inaccurate, or if circumstances change,\nfuture availability of trade credit or other sources of financing may be reduced and our liquidity could be adversely affected. Our future capital requirements and the adequacy\nof available funds will depend on many factors, including those described in the section titled “Risk Factors” in Item 1A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2023. Depending on the severity and direct impact of these factors on us, we may be unable to secure additional financing to meet our operating requirements on\nterms favorable to us, or at all.\nAs of September 30, 2024, we did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that are reasonably likely to have a material current or future effect on our financial\ncondition, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures, or capital resources.\n35\nCash Flows\nThe following summary of cash flows for the periods indicated has been derived from our condensed consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this\nQuarterly Report on Form 10-Q:\nNine Months Ended\nSeptember 30,\n(in thousands) 2024 2023\nNet cash (used in) provided by operating activities $ (5,232) $ 4,656\nNet cash used in investing activities (173) (253)\nNet cash provided by (used in) financing activities 7,248 (12,133)\nNet Cash (Used in) Provided by Operating Activities\nDuring the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net cash used in operating activities of $5.2 million consisted of a net loss of $8.8 million, offset partially by non-\ncash adjustments to the net loss of $1.0 million and a $1.2 million decrease in working capital driven by decreases in inventories of $4.2 million and decreases in accrued\nexpenses of $0.5 million reduced by a decrease in customer deposits of $1.5 million and an increase in accounts receivable of $0.7 million.\nDuring the nine months ended September 30, 2023, net cash “provided” by operating activities of approximately $1.2 million consisted of a net loss of $27.9 million\noffset by non-cash adjustments to net loss of approximately $4.4 million and a $24.7 million increase in working capital driven by an $18 million decrease in inventory, a $4.7\nmillion decrease in accounts receivable, and a $4.0 million decrease in other assets reduced by a $3.1 million decrease in accounts payable.\nNet Cash Used in Investing Activities\nDuring the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net cash used in investing activities of approximately $0.2 million consisted primarily of capital expenditures.\nDuring the nine months ended September 30, 2023, net cash provided by investing activities of approximately $0.6 million , offset by cash used for development costs\nfor our new enterprise resource planning (ERP) system of $0.6 million.\nNet Cash Provided bv (Used in) Financing Activities\nDuring the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net cash provided by financing activities of approximately $7.2 million primarily consisted of approximately $0.9\nmillion in payments on loans against future accounts receivable, approximately $0.2 million in proceeds from future receivables financing, approximately $2.1 million in\nproceeds from notes payable, $3.0 in repayments on notes payable, and $5.6 million in net proceeds from the issuance of common stock.\n36\nDuring the nine months ended September 30, 2023, net cash provided by financing activities of approximately $10.5 million primarily consisted of cash proceeds of\napproximately $3.9 million from the issuance of Class A common stock through our ATM Program and the June 2022 Offering, offset primarily by approximately $2.5 million\nin payments on notes payable, finance lease obligations and other long-term liabilities, and approximately $0.3 million in payments of contingent consideration related to the\nEyce LLC acquisition.\nCybersecurity\nRisk Management and Strategy\nWe recognize the critical importance of developing, implementing, and maintaining robust cybersecurity measures to safeguard our information systems and protect\nthe confidentiality, integrity, and availability of our data.\nManaging Material Risks & Integrated Overall Risk Management\nWe have strategically integrated cybersecurity risk management into our broader risk management framework to promote a company-wide culture of cybersecurity\nrisk management. This integration ensures that cybersecurity considerations are an integral part of our decision-making processes at every level. Our management team\ncontinuously evaluates and addresses cybersecurity risks in alignment with our business objectives and operational needs.\nOversee Third-party Risk\nBecause we are aware of the risks associated with third-party service providers, we have implemented stringent processes to oversee and manage these risks. We\nconduct thorough security assessments of all third-party providers before engagement and maintain ongoing monitoring to ensure compliance with our cybersecurity standards.\nThe monitoring includes annual assessments of the SOC reports of our providers and implementing complementary controls. This approach is designed to mitigate risks related\nto data breaches or other security incidents originating from third-parties.\nRisks from Cybersecurity Threats\nWe have not encountered cybersecurity challenges that have materially impaired our operations or financial standing.\nITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nNot required.\nITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES\nManagement’s Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nWe have established disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange\nAct”), that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed,\nsummarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms, and is accumulated and communicated to management, including our Chief Executive\nOfficer and our Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow for timely decisions regarding disclosure. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures,\nmanagement recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control\nobjectives, and management is required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. Accordingly, even effective\ndisclosure controls and procedures can only provide reasonable assurance of achieving their control objectives.\nUnder the supervision and with the participation of management, including our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, we evaluated the effectiveness of our\ndisclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2024. Based upon their evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of\nSeptember 30, 2024, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective because of the material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting described in\nItem 9A of Part II of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, which have not yet been remediated as of September 30, 2024.\nMaterial Weaknesses Remediation Plan and Status\nAs previously described in Item 9A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021, we began implementing a remediation plan to address the\nmaterial weaknesses identified in the prior year, and our management continues to be actively engaged in the remediation efforts.\nAs previously disclosed, in 2020, we began a multi-year implementation of a new ERP system, which will replace our existing core financial systems, and which was\ncompleted in 2023. Management is required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures, based upon which,\nmanagement focused its allocation of organizational resources to ensure the successful implementation of the new ERP system during 2023, and is continuing to add additional\nprocesses for the design and implementation of effective control activities. Conversely, management noted limited efforts related to re-designing user access roles and\npermissions in the legacy ERP system. Based on these considerations, and subject to management’s ongoing assessment, we do not expect that the previously reported material\nweaknesses related to ineffective user access controls will be considered remediated until our new ERP system has been fully utilize to its potential and we have properly set\ncontrols in place. Additionally, to remediate the identified material weaknesses, we are continuing to take the following remediation actions:\n● implement enhancements to company-wide risk assessment processes and to process and control documentation;\n● enhance the Company’s review and sign-off procedures for IT implementations;\n● implement additional review procedures designed to enhance the control owner’s execution of control activities, including entity level controls, through the\nimplementation of improved documentation standards evidencing execution of these controls, oversight, and training;\n● improve control activities and procedures associated with certain accounting areas, including proper segregation of duties and assigning personnel with the appropriate\nexperience as preparers and reviewers over analyses relating to such accounting areas;\n● educate and train control owners regarding internal control processes to mitigate identified risks and maintain adequate documentation to evidence the effective design\nand operation of such processes;\n● and implement enhanced controls to monitor the effectiveness of the underlying business process controls that are dependent on the data and financial reports\ngenerated from the relevant information systems.\n37\nWe are also continuing to evaluate additional controls and procedures that may be required to remediate the identified material weaknesses. We cannot provide assurances that\nthe previously reported material weaknesses will be considered remediated until the applicable controls operate for a sufficient period of time and management has concluded,\nthrough testing, that these controls are operating effectively.\nChanges in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nAs discussed above, in 2020 we began a multi-year implementation of a new ERP system which fully replaced our legacy financial systems in 2023. The ERP system is\ndesigned to accurately maintain the Company’s financial records, enhance the flow of financial information, improve data management and provide timely information to our\nmanagement team. Subsequent to implementation of the new ERP system, we are continuing to change certain processes and procedures which, in turn, are expected to result in\nchanges to our internal control over financial reporting. As such changes occur, we will evaluate quarterly whether such changes materially affect our internal control over\nfinancial reporting.\nThere were no other changes to our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are\nreasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.\nPART II. OTHER INFORMATION\nITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS\nFor a description of our material pending legal proceedings, see Note 7 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this\nQuarterly Report on Form 10-Q.\nITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nThere have been no material changes from the risk factors disclosed in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, filed with\nthe SEC on July 19, 2024, except as set forth below.\nThere is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern through the next 12 months from the date of the condensed consolidated financial statements in this\nQuarterly Report on Form 10-Q.\nThe Company has incurred net losses of $8.9 million and $27.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and the prior year comparable period,\nrespectively. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, cash used in operating activities was $5.2 million, and cash used in operating activities for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2023 was $1.8 million. Based on our cash on hand and working capital at September 30, 2024, we may have insufficient cash to fund planned operations into the\nfourth quarter of 2024. As a result of our losses and our projected cash needs, combined with our current liquidity level, substantial doubt exists about the Company’s ability to\ncontinue as a going concern over the next 12 months. The recent macroeconomic environment has caused weaker demand than contemplated under the Company’s business\nplan, resulting in a reduction in projected revenue and cash flows for the twelve-month period included in the going concern evaluation.\nOur ability to continue as a going concern is contingent upon successful execution of management’s intended plan over the next twelve months to improve the our\nliquidity and profitability, which includes, without limitation:\n■ Further reducing operating costs expense by taking additional restructuring actions to align cost with revenue\n■ Increasing revenue by introducing new products and acquiring new customers.\n■ Execute on strategic partnerships accretive to margins and operating cash\n■ Seeking additional capital through the issuance of equity securities or obtaining debt financing.\nThere can be no assurance that any such measures will be successful. If we are not successful in improving our liquidity position and the profitability of our\noperations, we may need to consider all strategic alternatives, including seeking additional debt or equity capital, reducing or delaying our business activities and strategic\ninitiatives, or selling assets, other strategic transactions and/or other measures, including receivership or, to the extent available, bankruptcy protection. In addition, the\nperception that we may not be able to continue as a going concern may cause vendors and customers to choose not to do business with us due to concerns about our ability to\nmeet our contractual obligations. If we seek additional financing to fund our operations and there remains substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern, our\nfinancing sources may be unwilling to provide additional funding to us on commercially reasonable terms or at all. The consolidated financial statements do not include any\nadjustments that may result from the outcome of this going concern uncertainty. Such adjustments could be material.\n38\nWe have failed, and may continue to fail, to meet the listing standards of Nasdaq, and as a result our Class A common stock may become delisted, which could have a material\nadverse effect on the liquidity of our Class A common stock.\nIf we fail to continue to satisfy the continued listing requirements of Nasdaq, such as the corporate governance or public float requirements, or the minimum closing\nbid price requirement, Nasdaq will take steps to de-list our Class A common stock. As a result of several factors, including but not limited to our financial performance, market\nsentiment about the cannabis industry, volatility in the financial markets generally due to the tightening of monetary policy by the Board of Governors of the United States\nFederal Reserve Bank (the “Federal Reserve”) and other geopolitical events, events such as the ongoing wars around the world, the per share price of our Class A common\nstock has declined below the minimum bid price threshold required for continued listing. Such a de-listing would likely have a negative effect on the price of our Class A\ncommon stock and would impair your ability to sell or purchase our Class A common stock when you wish to do so, as well as adversely affect our ability to issue additional\nsecurities and obtain additional financing in the future.\nOn August 21, 2023, we received a letter from the staff of Nasdaq indicating that we were not in compliance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5450(a)(1) because the closing\nbid price per share for our Class A common stock had closed below $1.00 for the previous 30 consecutive business days (the “Minimum Bid Price Requirement”). We were\ngiven 180 days, or until February 20, 2024 to regain compliance with the Minimum Bid Price Requirement. We also filed an application to transfer the listing of our Class A\ncommon stock from the Nasdaq Global Market to the Nasdaq Capital Market, which transfer was approved and occurred on February 9, 2024. As a result of the transfer, we\nbecame eligible to request an additional an additional 180-day compliance period.\nOn February 21, 2024, Nasdaq notified us in writing that while we had not regained compliance with the Minimum Bid Price Requirement, we were eligible for an\nadditional 180-day compliance period, or until August 19, 2024, to regain compliance with the Minimum Bid Price Requirement. Nasdaq’s determination was based on us\nhaving met the continued listing requirement for market value of publicly held shares and all other applicable requirements for initial listing on The Nasdaq Capital Market,\nwith the exception of the Minimum Bid Price Requirement, and on our written notice to Nasdaq of our intention to cure the deficiency during the second compliance period by\neffecting a reverse stock split, if necessary.\nIf we do not regain compliance during the second 180-day period, then Nasdaq will notify us of its determination to delist our Class A common stock, at which point\nwe would have an opportunity to appeal the delisting determination to a hearings panel. We would remain listed on Nasdaq pending the hearings panel’s decision. There can be\nno assurance that, if we do appeal the delisting determination by Nasdaq to the hearings panel, that such appeal would be successful.\nOn January 24, 2024, Gina Collins gave notice of her resignation from our Board of Directors and from each committee of the Board, effective immediately. Ms.\nCollins was an independent director, and as a result of her resignation, we no longer comply with the majority independent board requirement of Nasdaq as set forth in Nasdaq\nListing Rule 5605(b)(1) because independent directors do not comprise a majority of the Board of Directors, and Nasdaq’s audit committee requirements as set forth in Nasdaq\nListing Rule 5605(c)(2)(A) because the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors is not comprised of at least three independent directors.\nOn January 29, 2024, in accordance with Nasdaq Listing Rules, we notified Nasdaq of Ms. Collins’ resignation and the resulting non-compliance. On January 30,\n2024, we received a notice from Nasdaq acknowledging the fact that we do not meet the requirements of such rules. In accordance with Nasdaq Listing Rules 5605(b)(1)(A)\nand 5605(c)(4), to regain compliance with the Nasdaq Listing Rules, we have until the earlier of our next annual stockholders meeting or January 24, 2025.\nOn April 18, 2024, we received a notice from Nasdaq stating that because we had not yet filed our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December\n31, 2023, we were no longer in compliance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5250(c)(1). Nasdaq Listing Rule 5250(c)(1) requires listed companies to timely file all required periodic\nfinancial reports with the Securities and Exchange Commission.\nOn May 21, 2024, we received a notice from Nasdaq stating that because we had not yet filed our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended March\n31, 2024, we were no longer in compliance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5250(c)(1).\nThe Company had 60 calendar days from April 18, 2024, or until June 17, 2024, to regain compliance by filing the Form 10-K and the Form 10-Q or to submit to\nNasdaq a plan to regain compliance with the Nasdaq Listing Rules. We timely submitted the plan to regain compliance to Nasdaq and Nasdaq granted us additional time to file\nthe Form 10K and 10Q. As of the date of this filing we have filed both the 10K and 10Q within the additional time period granted.\n39\nITEM 2. UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS\nNone.\nITEM 5.

Many of the forward-looking statements are located in Part, Item 7 of this Form 10-K under the heading “Management’s Discussion and\nAnalysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.” Forward-looking statements provide current expectations of future events based on certain assumptions and include\nany statement that does not directly relate to any historical or current fact. In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements by terminology such as “anticipate,”\n“estimate,” “plan,” “project,” “continuing,” “ongoing,” “expect,” “believe,” “intend,” “may,” “will,” “should,” “could” and similar expressions. Examples of forward-looking\nstatements include, without limitation:\n● statements regarding our growth and other strategies, results of operations or liquidity;\n● statements concerning projections, predictions, expectations, estimates or forecasts as to our business, financial and operational results and future economic\nperformance;\n● statements regarding our industry;\n● statements of management’s goals and objectives;\n● statements regarding laws, regulations, and policies relevant to our business;\n● projections of revenue, earnings, capital structure and other financial items;\n● assumptions underlying statements regarding us or our business; and\n● other similar expressions concerning matters that are not historical facts.\nForward-looking statements should not be read as a guarantee of future performance or results and will not necessarily be accurate indications of the times at, or by,\nwhich such performance or results will be achieved. Forward-looking statements are based on information available at the time those statements are made or management’s\ngood faith belief as of that time with respect to future events and are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual performance or results to differ materially from\nthose expressed in or suggested by the forward-looking statements. Important factors that could cause such differences include, but are not limited to, those discussed in Part I,\nItem 1A of this Form 10-K under the heading “Risk Factors” and in other documents that we file from time to time with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”).\nForward-looking statements involve estimates, assumptions, known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results to differ\nmaterially from any future results, performances, or achievements expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements. These risks include, but are not limited to, those\nlisted below and those discussed in greater detail in Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K under the heading “Risk Factors.”\n● our strategy, outlook, and growth prospects;\n● general economic trends, trends in the industry, and the competitive markets in which we operate;\n● our ability to generate adequate cash from our existing business to support our growth;\n● our ability to raise capital on favorable terms, or at all, to support the continued growth of the business, including high inflation and increasing interest rates;\n● our dependence on, and our ability to establish and maintain business relationships with third-party suppliers and service suppliers, including vulnerability to third-\nparty transportation risks;\n● our ability to accurately estimate demand for our products and maintain appropriate levels of inventory;\n● our ability to maintain or improve our operating margins and meet sales expectations;\n● our ability to adapt to changes in consumer spending and general economic conditions;\n● our ability to maintain consumer brand recognition and loyalty of our products;\n● our ability to protect our intellectual property rights and use or license certain trademarks;\n● our ability to successfully identify and complete strategic acquisitions and/or dispositions;\n● our ability to address product defects and contamination of, or damage to, our products;\nour exposure to potential various claims, lawsuits, and administrative proceedings;\n● our and our customers’ ability to establish or maintain banking relationships;\n● the impact of governmental laws and regulations and the outcomes of regulatory or agency proceedings;\n● fluctuations in U.S. federal, state, local, and foreign tax obligations and changes in tariffs;\n● any unfavorable scientific studies on the long-term health risks of vaporizers, electronic cigarettes, or cannabis and hemp-derived products, including cannabidiol\n(“CBD”);\n● failure of our information technology systems to support our current and growing business;\n● our ability to prevent and recover from Internet security breaches;\n● our sensitivity to global economic conditions and international trade issues;\n1\n● the onset of an economic recession in the United States or other countries, including the impact of the ongoing wars, and their impact on the economy generally;\n● natural disasters, adverse weather conditions, operating hazards, environmental incidents and labor disputes;\n● public heath crises;\n● the potential delisting of our Class A common stock from Nasdaq;\n● increased costs as a result of being a public company; and\n● our failure to maintain adequate internal controls over financial reporting.\nAdditional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially adversely affect our business, financial\ncondition or operating results.\nThe forward-looking statements speak only as of the date on which they are made, and, except as required by law, we undertake no obligation to update any forward-\nlooking statement to reflect events or circumstances after the date on which the statement is made or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events. In addition, we cannot\nassess the impact of each factor on our business or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained\nin any forward-looking statements. Consequently, you should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements.\nSummary Risk Factors\nOur business is subject to a number of risks, including risks that may prevent us from achieving our business objectives or may materially and adversely affect our\nbusiness, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and prospects. These risks are discussed more fully in Item 1A. Risk Factors herein. These risks include, but are\nnot limited to, the following:\n● Global economic conditions, including inflation and supply chain disruptions, could materially and adversely our business, prospects, results of operations, financial\ncondition or cash flows.\n● A significant percentage of our revenue is dependent on sales of products from a relatively small number of key suppliers, and a decline in sales of products from these\nsuppliers could materially harm our business.\n● We do not have long-term agreements or guaranteed price or delivery arrangements with most of our suppliers. The loss of a significant supplier would require us to\nrely more heavily on our other existing suppliers or to develop relationships with new suppliers. Such a loss may have an adverse effect on our product offerings and\nour business.\n● We are vulnerable to third-party transportation risks, including governmental laws and common carriers’ policies that prevent the shipment of the types of products we\nsell.\n● If we are unable to successfully execute our on our liquidity and strategic initiatives, we may have significant cash constraints, which would have a material and\nadverse impact on our business and results of operations and ability to pay our debts as they come due.\n● Complications and disruptions associated with the design and implementation of our new ERP system have occurred and could adversely impact our business and\noperations in the future.\n● We may be required to seek additional financing sources, which may not be available to us on attractive terms if at all and could restrict our ability to engage in\nimportant business activities.\n● While we believe that our business and sales do not violate the Federal Paraphernalia Law, legal proceedings alleging violations of such law or changes in such law or\ninterpretations thereof could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, or results of operations.\n● Officials of the U.S. Customs and Border Protection agency (“CBP”) have broad discretion regarding products imported into the United States, and the CBP has on\noccasion seized imported products, and seizures of the products we sell could have a material adverse effect on our business operations or our results of operations.\n● Our business depends partly on continued purchases by businesses and individuals selling or using cannabis and cannabis ancillary products pursuant to federal and\nstate laws in the United States and laws in Canada, the European Union, United Kingdom, Mexico, and Latin America. Because our business is dependent, in part,\nupon continued market acceptance of cannabis by consumers, any negative trends could materially and adversely affect our business, financial conditions or results of\noperations. Additionally, we are subject to legislative uncertainty that could slow or halt the legalization and use of cannabis, which could negatively affect our\nbusiness.\n● The market for vaporizer products and related items is a niche market, subject to a great deal of uncertainty and is still evolving, including uncertainty related to the\nregulation of vaporization products and certain other consumption accessories. Increased regulatory compliance burdens, no matter how they arise, could have a\nmaterial adverse impact on our business development efforts and our operations.\n● Recently adopted laws prohibit the mailing of certain vaporizer products through the United States Postal Service (“USPS”) and place certain regulatory requirements\non shipment of those products through other carriers. Additionally, carriers including UPS and FedEx have imposed policies restricting the shipment of vaporizers. If a\nsignificant volume of the products we carry cannot be shipped by the USPS or private carriers, or we must comply with burdensome policies and regulations, our\nshipping costs could increase materially and we could lose our ability to deliver products to customers in a timely and economical matter.\n2\n● The FDA has expressed growing concern about the popularity among youth of certain vaporization products, including electronic nicotine delivery systems (“ENDS”)\nand has imposed significant regulation on ENDS products. Additional regulatory actions may further impact our ability to sell these products, as well as other\nvaporization products, in the United States or online.\n● Our narrow margins may magnify the impact of variations in operating costs and of adverse or unforeseen events on operating results.\n● Management and employee turnover creates uncertainties and could harm our business.\n● We and our customers may have difficulty accessing the service of banks, which may make it difficult for us and for them to sell our products.\n● We have failed, and may continue to fail, to meet the listing standards of Nasdaq, and as a result our Class A common stock may become delisted, which could have a\nmaterial adverse effect on the liquidity of our Class A common stock.\n● The market price of our Class A common stock has been volatile and has declined significantly since our initial public offering and may face more volatility and price\ndeclines in the future. As a result, you may not be able to resell your shares at or above the price at which you have acquired or will acquire shares of our Class A\ncommon stock.\n● Substantial sales and issuances of our Class A common stock have occurred and may continue to occur, or may be anticipated, which have caused and could continue\nto cause our stock price to decline and your percentage ownership may be diluted in the future.\nPART I\nITEM 1. BUSINESS\nGeneral\nFounded in 2005, Greenlane is a premier global platform for the development and distribution of premium cannabis accessories, vape devices, and lifestyle products.\nWith three different mergers in 2021, Greenlane was able to strengthen its leading position as a consumer ancillary products house-of-brands business, significantly expanding\nits customer network, bringing strategic relationships with leading cannabis multi-state operators (“MSOs”), cannabis single-state operators (“SSOs”), and Canadian licensed\nproducers (“LPs”). Greenlane provides a wide array of consumer ancillary products and industrial ancillary products to thousands of cannabis producers, processors, brands,\nand retailers (“Cannabis Operators”). In addition, it serves specialty retailers, smoke shops, head shops, convenience stores, and consumers directly through its own proprietary\nweb stores and large online marketplaces such as Amazon.\nWe have been developing a world-class portfolio of both our own proprietary brands (the “Greenlane Brands”) along with close partner brands that we believe will,\nover time, deliver higher margins and create long-term value for our customers and shareholders. Our Greenlane Brands include our more affordable product line – Groove, our\npremium smoke shop and ancillary product brand – Higher Standards, and our child-resistant packaging brand - Pollen Gear. In collaboration with our partner brands, including\nthe innovative silicone pipes and accessories line, Eyce, and the premium vaporizer brand, DaVinci, Greenlane is strategically positioned to serve as a comprehensive one-stop\nshop for all buyers. We also have category exclusive licenses for the premium Marley Natural branded products, as well as the Keith Haring branded products.\nThe Greenlane Brands, along with a curated set of third-party products, are offered to customers through our proprietary, owned and operated e-commerce platforms\nwhich include Wholesale.Greenlane.com, Vapor.com, PuffItUp.com, HigherStandards.com, and MarleyNaturalShop.com. Additionally, our presence on popular e-commerce\nplatforms such as Amazon, Etsy, and eBay enables us to reach customers directly, providing them with valuable resources and a seamless purchasing experience.\nWe merchandise vaporizers, packaging, and other ancillary products in the United States, Canada, Europe, and Latin America. We distribute products to retailers\nthrough wholesale operations and distribute products to consumers through constantly evolving e-commerce activities. We operate our own distribution centers in the United\nStates, while also utilizing third-party logistics (“3PL”) locations in the United States, Europe, and Canada. We have made tremendous progress consolidating and streamlining\nour warehouse and distribution in 2023, including the consolidations of our warehouse in Worcester, MA and 3PL location in Hebron, KY to our owned facility in Moreno\nValley, California in 2023.\nGreenlane offers a full-spectrum of Consumer and Industrial Goods, positioning us to meet all our customers’ growing demands. Our Consumer Goods segment\nfocuses on serving consumers across wholesale, retail, and e-commerce operations—offering all of our Greenlane Brands, as well as ancillary products and accessories from\nselect leading third-party brands such as Storz and Bickel, Grenco Science, PAX, Cookies, and more. The Consumer Goods segment forms a central part of our growth strategy,\nespecially as it relates to scaling our own portfolio of higher-margin proprietary owned brands. In addition to our Consumer Goods segment, we have our Industrial Goods\nsegment, which focuses on serving Cannabis Operators by providing ancillary products essential to their daily operations and growth, such as packaging and vaporization\nsolutions, including our Greenlane Brand Pollen Gear. Refer to Note 11 — Segment Reporting within Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information on\nour reportable segments\nWe have historically experienced only moderate seasonality in the Consumer Goods side of our business, particularly during the fourth quarter. This coincides with\nCyber Monday (the first Monday after Thanksgiving, when online retailers typically offer holiday discounts), and as our customers build up their inventories in anticipation of\nthe holiday season. We also have related promotional marketing campaigns during this period. Our Industrial Goods business is generally not affected by seasonality, which\nprovides an important advantage to our overall business model. The stability of the Industrial Goods segment helps to offset the moderate seasonality in Consumer Goods,\nproviding a more consistent revenue stream throughout the year. This diversification in our business segments contributes to greater overall financial stability and resilience\nagainst market fluctuations.\n3\nOrganization\nGreenlane Holdings, Inc. (“Greenlane” and, collectively with the Operating Company (as defined below) and its consolidated subsidiaries, the “Company”, “we”, “us”\nand “our”) was formed as a Delaware corporation on May 2, 2018. We are a holding company that was formed for the purpose of completing an underwritten initial public\noffering (“IPO”) of shares of our Class A common stock on April 23, 2019 and other related transactions in order to carry on the business of Greenlane Holdings, LLC (the\n“Operating Company”). The Operating Company was organized under the laws of the state of Delaware on September 1, 2015, and is based in Boca Raton, Florida. Refer to\n“Note 1—Business Operations and Organization” within Item 8 for further information on the Company’s organization and the IPO and related transactions. We are the sole\nmanager of the Operating Company and, as of December 31, 2023, owned a 100% interest in the Operating Company.\nOur Business Relating to the Cannabis Industry\nWhile we do not cultivate, distribute or dispense marijuana as that term is defined by the Controlled Substances Act, several of the products we distribute, such as\nvaporizers, pipes, rolling papers, and packaging solutions, can be used with marijuana or marijuana derivatives, as well as several other legal substances.\nWe believe the global cannabis industry is experiencing a transformation from a state of prohibition toward a state of legalization. We expect the number of states,\ncountries, and other jurisdictions legalizing cannabis for medical and adult use will continue to increase, which will create numerous opportunities for market participants,\nincluding us.\nThe North American Cannabis Landscape\nUnited States and Territories.\nTwenty-four states, and the District of Columbia, have legalized cannabis for non-medical adult use with additional states, such as New Hampshire , actively\nconsidering the legalization of cannabis for non-medical adult use. An additional seventeen states have legalized medical cannabis in some form, with certain of those states\npermitting only low tetrahydrocannabinol (“THC”) oils for a limited class of patients. Notwithstanding the continued trend toward further state legalization, cannabis continues\nto be categorized as a Schedule I controlled substance under the Federal Controlled Substances Act (the “CSA”) and, accordingly, the cultivation, processing, distribution, sale,\nand possession of cannabis violate federal law in the United States as discussed further in Item 1A under the heading “Risk Factors.” However, after President Biden first\ndirected federal agencies in October 2022 to review how cannabis is scheduled, the Department of Health and Human Services reviewed and made recommendations in August\n2023 to reschedule cannabis from a Schedule I to Schedule III controlled substance. On May 16, 2024, the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (the “DEA”) issued a\nproposed rule to reclassify marijuana from its current classification as a Schedule I drug to a Schedule III drug. Schedule III classification represents a moderate to low potential\nfor physical and psychological dependence and reclassification of marijuana from a Schedule I to a Schedule III drug would thereby loosen DEA restrictions. Nonetheless, the\nDEA has made clear that if reclassification were to take place, the “regulatory controls applicable to Schedule III controlled substances would apply” which includes controls\nrelated to the manufacture, distribution, dispensing, and possession of marijuana. Our business depends partly on continued purchases by businesses and individuals selling or\nusing cannabis and cannabis ancillary products pursuant to state laws in the United States.\nIn the United States, the legal cannabis market generated $26.5 billion in 2022, which increased to $31.4 billion in 2023, reflecting an 18.5% growth (XYZ Cannabis\nMarket Report 2023). The number of U.S. states with legalized cannabis increased from 18 in 2022 to 23 in 2023, a 27.8% rise in state participation (National Cannabis\nIndustry Association Reports). The cannabis consumers base for legal cannabis has expanded notably across all regions. In the United States, the number of users grew from 42\nmillion in 2022 to 47 million in 2023, an 11.9% increase (Cannabis Consumer Trends Study 2023.\nCanada.\nLegal access to dried cannabis for medical purposes was first allowed in Canada in 1999. The Cannabis Act (the “Cannabis Act”) currently governs the production,\nsale and distribution of medical cannabis and related oil extracts in Canada.\n4\nOn April 13, 2017, the Government of Canada introduced Bill C-45, which proposed the enactment of the Cannabis Act to legalize and regulate access to cannabis.\nThe Cannabis Act proposed a strict legal framework for controlling the production, distribution, sale and possession of medical and recreational adult-use cannabis in Canada.\nOn June 21, 2018, the Government of Canada announced that Bill C-45 received Royal Assent. On July 11, 2018, the Government of Canada published the Cannabis\nRegulations under the Cannabis Act, which has been subsequently amended. The Cannabis Regulations provide more detail on the medical and recreational regulatory regimes\nfor cannabis, including regarding licensing, security clearances and physical security requirements, product practices, outdoor growing, packaging and labelling, cannabis-\ncontaining drugs, document retention requirements, reporting and disclosure requirements, the new access to cannabis for medical purposes regime and industrial hemp. The\nmajority of the Cannabis Act and the Cannabis Regulations came into force on October 17, 2018, with additional Cannabis regulations coming into effect on October 17, 2019.\nWhile the Cannabis Act provides for the regulation by the federal government of, among other things, the commercial cultivation and processing of cannabis for\nrecreational purposes, it provides the provinces and territories of Canada with the authority to regulate in respect of the other aspects of recreational cannabis, such as\ndistribution, sale, minimum age requirements, places where cannabis can be consumed, and a range of other matters.\nThe governments of every Canadian province and territory have implemented regulatory regimes for the distribution and sale of cannabis for recreational purposes.\nMost provinces and territories have announced a minimum age of 19 years old, except for Alberta, where the minimum age will be 18. Certain provinces, such as Ontario, have\nlegislation in place that restricts the packaging of vapor products and the manner in which vapor products are displayed or promoted in stores.\nThe Canadian market grew from CAD 4.8 billion in 2022 to CAD 5.6 billion in 2023, marking a 16.7% increase (Government of Canada, Cannabis Market Reports).\nIn Canada, all ten provinces and three territories have legalized cannabis, with significant improvements in regulatory frameworks and retail infrastructure between 2022 and\n2023, particularly in Ontario and British Columbia (Health Canada Reports). In Canada, cannabis consumers increased from 7.6 million in 2022 to 8.3 million in 2023, a 9.2%\nrise (Canadian Cannabis Consumer Survey 2023).\nThe European Cannabis Landscape\nEurope’s population is larger than that of the U.S. and Canadian markets combined, suggesting the potential of a very significant market. The changes in regulations\nfor cannabis products across Europe are expected to result in a market growth of approximately $6.2 billion in annual sales in 2024, a significant growth from approximately\n$3.7 billion in 2023.\nMany European Union countries allow limited cannabis use for medicinal purposes, with some of those countries operating pilot programs. It has been widely reported\nthat other countries are considering following suit. Additionally, certain countries in Europe, including Germany, which approved a plan to legalize some recreational cannabis\nuse in August 2023, are considering the adoption of laws that would legalize cannabis for adult use.\nEurope’s legal cannabis market also saw significant growth, with revenues rising from €2.1 billion in 2022 to €2.5 billion in 2023, a 19% increase (Prohibition\nPartners Europe Cannabis Report 2023). In Europe, the number of countries with legalized medical cannabis grew from seven in 2022 (Germany, Italy, Netherlands, Czech\nRepublic, Greece, Denmark, and Poland) to nine in 2023, with Luxembourg and Malta joining the list, representing a 28.6% increase (European Monitoring Centre for Drugs\nand Drug Addiction, EMCDDA). Europe also saw a significant rise in cannabis consumers, from 1.2 million in 2022 to 1.5 million in 2023, a 25% increase (Prohibition\nPartners Europe Cannabis Report 2023).\nOther Drivers for the Legal Cannabis Industry\nSeveral factors have driven the growth of the legal cannabis industry. Legislative changes have been pivotal, with ongoing legalization efforts in various regions\ncontributing to market expansion. For instance, recent legislation in Germany is set to make it the largest cannabis market in Europe. Medical advancements have also played a\ncrucial role, with increasing acceptance of cannabis for medical purposes driven by research and positive patient outcomes, particularly in Europe where medical cannabis\nprograms are rapidly expanding. Consumer trends towards wellness and natural products have boosted demand for cannabis-based products such as CBD oils, edibles, and\ntopicals. Economic benefits have been significant, with governments recognizing the potential for job creation, tax revenues, and reduced law enforcement and incarceration\ncosts related to cannabis offenses. Additionally, technological innovations in cultivation techniques, product development, and delivery methods have enhanced product quality\nand consumer experience, further driving market growth.\n5\nProduct Information\nConsumers of cannabis, herbs, flavored compounds, aromatherapy oils, and nicotine require the types of products we distribute, including vaporizers, pipes, rolling\npapers and packaging. Producers of cannabis products are able to source compliant packaging, vape hardware, and other products needed in the manufacturing and distribution\nstages of the supply chain. We believe we distribute the “picks & shovels” for these rapidly-growing industries and producers. As the world of cannabis and its respective\naesthetic continues to expand, we strive to keep our product mix relevant, popular, and innovative; offering an array of products from vaporizers, grinders, pipes and other\ninhalation devices to storage solutions, to rolling papers and even apparel lines. As our product offerings continue to develop, we expect our revenue by categories to increase\naccordingly.\nInhalation Delivery Methods\nThere are two prevalent types of inhalation methods for cannabis and nicotine: combustion and vaporization. Vaporizers are devices that heat materials to temperatures\nbelow the point of combustion, extracting the flavors, aromas and effects of dry herbs and concentrates in the form of vapor. Measured by revenue, vaporizers are our largest\nproduct category.\nThe Science and Popularity of Vaporization\nVaporizers continue to increase in popularity and as a preferred method of consumption among a variety of demographics of consumers. They have elements that are\ndesigned to quickly heat material, causing vaporization to occur without the carbon dioxide that is typically generated through combustion. The vapor byproduct is then\nimmediately inhaled through the mouthpiece on the device itself, or through a hose or an inflatable bag. Vaporizers can heat a variety of dry materials, viscous liquids and\nwaxes, and provide a convenient way for users to consume the active ingredient such as tobacco, nicotine extracts, legal herbs, hemp-derived CBD, aromatherapy oils,\ncannabis, and propylene glycol and glycerin blends.\nVaporization Technology. Consumers have a wide array of vaporization devices at their disposal, which can be broadly categorized into two primary categories:\ndesktop and portable vaporizers. Our vaporizer portfolio spans just shy of 200 distinct products across 12 brands.\nDesktop Vaporizers. Vaporizers were first developed as desktop models that were powered through traditional electric power sources. Desktop vaporizers are capable\nof heating the material to a more precise temperature choice determined by the consumer or as advised by a health practitioner.\nPortable Vaporizers. With the development of lithium batteries, vaporizers have now become portable. Technological advances are resulting in lighter, sleeker, and\nmore visually-appealing units that are capable of quickly heating material to the user’s desired temperature setting. Portable vaporizers, of which vape pens are a sub-set, are\ndifferentiated by many features, including output, battery life, recharge time, material, capacity, and design.\nOther Methods of Consumption. In addition to vaporizers, consumers have a wide array of methods of consumption at their disposal, including, hand pipes, water\npipes, rolling papers, and oral and topical delivery methods.\nHand and Water Pipes. We offer a diverse portfolio of over 200 hand and water pipes across five brands, including products within our Greenlane Brands. Many\ndisplay iconic, licensed logos and artwork, as pipes have grown into an artistic expression and are available in countless creative forms and functionality. Hand pipes are small,\nportable and simple to use, and function by trapping the smoke produced from burning materials. Water pipes include large table-top models, bubblers and rigs, and incorporate\nthe cooling effects of water to the burning materials before inhalation.\nRolling Papers. Rolling papers are a traditional consumption method used to smoke dried plant material in a “roll-your-own” application. These include papers, cones\nand wraps. Our rolling papers category is comprised of over 100 products across two unique brands, not including accessories such as rolling trays or tips.\n6\nOur Competitive Strengths\nWe attribute our success to the following competitive strengths:\nA Clear Market Leader in an Attractive Industry.\nWe are a global platform for the development and distribution of premium cannabis accessories, packaging, vape solutions, and lifestyle products, reaching thousands\nof retail locations, including, licensed cannabis dispensaries, smoke shops, head shops, and specialty retailers. We also own and operate one of the industry’s most visited North\nAmerican direct-to-consumer e-commerce websites, Vapor.com, as well as PuffItUp.com, and Vaposhop which serves the European market. We also sell our proprietary\nproducts direct to consumers via Higherstandards.com, and MarleyNaturalShop.com. We operate storefronts on Amazon, Ebay, Etsy, and other online high traffic marketplaces.\nMarket Knowledge and Understanding.\nBecause of our experience and our extensive, long-term industry relationships, we believe we have a deep understanding of customer needs and desires in our\nConsumer Goods and Industrial Goods business segments. This allows us to influence customer demand and the pipeline between product manufacturers, suppliers, advertisers\nand the marketplace. We have also established strong relationships with a wide array of industry participants including leading MSOs, SSOs, retailers, and third party ancillary\nproduct producers.\nComprehensive and Best-in-Class Product Offering.\nWe offer a curated portfolio of products and accessories across many major categories with diverse, best-in-class offerings that cater to our customers’ needs. This\ncomprehensive and best-in-class product offering creates a “one-stop shop” for many of our customers and positively distinguishes us from our competitors. In addition, we\nhave carefully cultivated a portfolio of well-known brands and premium products and have helped many of the brands we distribute to become established names in the\nindustry.\nEntrepreneurial Culture.\nWe believe our entrepreneurial, results-driven culture fosters highly-dedicated employees who provide our customers with superior service. We invest in our talent by\nproviding ongoing training and have successfully developed programs that provide comprehensive product knowledge and tools needed to have a unique understanding of our\ncustomers’ goals and decision-making processes.\nCustomers. We believe we offer superior services and solutions due to our comprehensive product offering, proprietary industry data and analytics, product expertise\nand quality of service. We deliver products to our customers in a precise, safe and timely manner with complementary support from our dedicated sales and service teams. In\n2022, we launched our new business to business (“B2B”) customer portal at Wholesale.Greenlane.com which provides our business customers seamless access to our catalog of\nproducts for purchase 24-hours a day, 365 days a year. Consumers can access our products easily by purchasing from our e-commerce properties or access many of our\nproducts via large marketplaces such Amazon.\nSuppliers. Our industry knowledge, market reach, and resources allow us to establish trusted relationships with many industry suppliers. Our senior management team\nmakes tremendous efforts to establish and build these key relationships to help ensure Greenlane has a strong supply chain established for in-demand products at favorable\npricing. Our suppliers can be categorized into two buckets, factories that produce our Greenlane Brand’s products, as well as some generic products, and other third party\nbranded products (who either manufacture themselves or outsource production) that Greenlane will, in essence, resell. While we purchase our products from over 150 suppliers,\na significant percentage of our net sales is dependent on sales of products from a small number of key suppliers, which is why strong relationships are essential to our future\nsuccess. An important reason we have elected to focus on our Greenlane Brands is, since we own the brand itself (or license it), we can control which factory produces our\nproducts. Generally, there are a variety of capable factory partners and we are able to leverage our Greenlane Brands to negotiate better pricing and service. When reselling an\nestablished third-party brand’s products, we are somewhat beholden to the one supplier who owns or distributes that brand. However, we do believe there is a trend of third-\nparty branded suppliers in our industry to consolidate their relationships to do more business with fewer distribution partners. We believe our established track record, historical\nrelationships, ability to be value-added, and overall size and scale position us to benefit from this trend.\nEmployees. We aim to recruit best-in-class talent to join our Greenlane team. We provide our employees with an entrepreneurial culture, a safe, fun and fast-paced\nwork environment, financial incentives and career development opportunities.\nExperienced and Proven Management Team Driving Organic and Acquisition Growth.\nWe recently revamped our management team to directly align with our strategic goals and initiatives. Our management team features vast relevant experience in\nconsumer-packaged goods, brand building, and e-commerce. In addition, our management team has expertise in accounting and finance, mergers and acquisitions, supply\nchain, information technology, and operations.\n7\nOur Operating Strategies\nWe intend to leverage our competitive strengths to increase shareholder value through the following core strategies:\nPlan to Accelerate Path to Profitability and Capitalize the Business\nIn today’s economic landscape, particularly within the cannabis industry, achieving profitability and preserving working capital are paramount. At Greenlane, we are\nintensely focused on making our business profitable and well-capitalized for long-term sustainability. Our key initiatives include:\n1. Technology Enhancements: We remain fully committed to improving our technology, particularly our B2B and e-commerce platforms, to provide a seamless shopping\nexperience for our wholesale and retail customers.\n2. Facility Footprint Rationalization: In 2023, we optimized our facilities footprint by reducing warehouse and office space while increasing operational efficiency and\nimproving fulfillment practices. The full benefit of those efforts are expected to be realized in 2024.\n3. Headcount Reduction: We have significantly reduced our headcount and associated salary expenses, focusing on maintaining a core group of key employees as we\ncollectively right-size the business.\n4. Cost Structure Optimization: We continue to reduce our overall cost structure while improving margins. In April 2023, we formed two strategic partnerships (described\nbelow in greater detail) to increase margins and significantly reduce working capital requirements in our Industrial Goods segment. Similarly, our Consumer Goods\nsegment restructured arrangements with several third-party brands in 2022 and 2023 to reduce our working capital needs.\n5. Inventory Management: In 2023, we implemented a new inventory management and lifecycle strategy that is focused on a quarterly turn and a regular review of\ninventory to avoid future write-offs.\n6. Sales Force Upgrade: We have upgraded and will continue to upgrade our sales force from a solely account management centric team to a skilled and driven sales team\nto acquire new customers while maintaining excellent service with our existing customers\n7. Product Innovation: In 2023, we launched Groove, an innovative new product line with a value-based price point and in 2024 we have begun to expand our product\noffering to further enhance our assortment available to our customers.\n8. Capital Investment: We continue to seek opportunities for securing investment capital to leverage our platform, increase availability and reduce stockouts of our high\ndemand third-party brands, invest in marketing and sales, and improve our product offerings.\nManagement believes that these initiatives will significantly reduce costs, help accelerate the Company’s path to profitability, support business growth, and allow the\nCompany to reinvest capital into its highest demand and highest potential product lines.\nDuring 2022 and 2023, the Company received capital from various sources permitting it to right-size the business and position the company for growth. Such sources\nare described in greater detail in the Liquidity and Capital Resources Section of this report. During 2022, the Company also monetized several non-core assets to provide\nnecessary working capital including the sale and lease-back of its headquarters building and the sale of its interest in the Vibes brand.\nDuring 2023 and 2024, the Company also entered into certain arrangements to reduce working capital requirements and improve its balance sheet.\nIn April 2023, we entered into two strategic partnerships. First, we entered into a strategic partnership (the “MJ Packaging Partnership”) with A&A Global Imports\nd/b/a MarijuanaPackaging.com (“MJ Pack”), a provider of packaging solutions to the cannabis industry. Second, we entered into a strategic partnership with an affiliate of one\nof our existing vape suppliers (“Vape Partner”) to service certain key customers with vaporizer goods and services (the “Vape Partnership”). As part of the Vape Partnership, we\nwill introduce our Vape Partner to certain key customers, assist with the promotion and the sale of certain vaporizer goods and services, and help coordinate the logistics,\nstorage and distribution of such vaporizer products. If our Vape Partner and key customer(s) enter into a direct relationship, the customers would directly purchase vaporizer\ngoods and services, which we currently sell them, directly from our Vape Partner and we would no longer need to purchase such vape inventory on behalf of such key\ncustomer(s). In exchange we would earn quarterly and annual commission payments from our strategic partners. While the strategic partnerships may result in a decrease in top\nline revenue for these packaging and vape products, these partnerships combined with some of our other restructuring initiatives should allow us to reduce our overall cost-\nstructure and enhance our margins, thereby improving our balance sheet.\nOn May 6, 2024, the Company, Warehouse Goods and Synergy Imports LLC (“Synergy”) entered into an asset purchase agreement, dated May 1, 2024 (the “Asset\nPurchase Agreement”) pursuant to which Synergy purchased all of the intellectual property, a specified amount of inventory, and other assets related to the Eyce and DaVinci\nbrands. In consideration for the acquisition, all parties entered into a loan modification agreement, effective May 1, 2024 (the “Loan Modification Agreement”) and an amended\nand restated secured promissory note, effective May 1, 2024 (the Amended and Restated Secured Promissory Note”), an amendment to the original Eyce and Davinci Asset\nPurchase Agreements, a distribution agreement, the termination of a license granted by Eyce, and the termination of certain consulting and employment agreements.\nDeveloping A World-Class Portfolio of Products.\nWe intend to continue to develop a portfolio of brands that includes our Greenlane Brands, exclusively licensed brands and third party brand products, which over time\nwill help to increase our blended margins and create increased long-term value. Our brand development is based upon our proprietary industry intelligence that allows us to\nidentify market opportunities for new brands and products. We leverage our distribution infrastructure and customer relationships to penetrate the market quickly with our\nproprietary brands and to gain placement in thousands of retail stores. Currently, we sell such products directly to consumers through our brand websites and our e-commerce\nproperties. Over time, we expect an increasing percentage of our overall sales to be from our Greenlane Brands, which in turn should allow our gross margin to trend upwards\nand should allow for lasting brand value to be built in the marketplace.\n8\nUSPS PACT Act Exemption\nOn January 11, 2022, we announced via press release that the United States Postal Service (the “USPS”) had approved our application for a business and regulatory\nexemption to the PACT Act (with respect to the business and regulatory exemption granted by the USPS, the “PACT Act Exemption”), allowing us to ship vaporizers and\naccessories classified as electronic nicotine delivery systems (“ENDS”) products to other compliant businesses. With this approval, over 97% of our total annual sales became\neligible for shipment by freight, USPS and other major parcel carriers. The PACT Act Exemption also enables us to partner with other businesses that ship ENDS products and\nhad their supply chains disrupted by PACT Act compliance.\nOn June 24, 2022, we provided via press release an update on the progress of the PACT Act Exemption, following our successful implementation of the controls,\nprocesses and systems required by the USPS in connection with the shipment of ENDS products. We expect the ability to fulfill ENDS orders with the USPS to allow us to\nreduce shipping costs, decrease fulfillment times and enhance the overall customer experience for approved wholesale customers.\nEnhance Our Operating Margins.\nWe expect to enhance our operating margins as our business expands through a combination of additional product purchasing discounts, reduced inbound and\noutbound shipping and handling rates, reduced transaction processing fees, increased operating efficiencies, and realization of benefits through leveraging our existing assets\nand consolidated distribution facilities.. We are focused on converting more of our overall sales to be completed through technology platforms such as our e-commerce\nconsumer sites, large marketplace sites like Amazon, and our proprietary B2B ordering portal at Wholesale.Greenlane.com. Transacting a higher percentage of our sales\nthrough automated technological platforms, versus the manual phone and email efforts in play today, should improve our overall operating margins.\nBuild Upon Strong Customer and Supplier Relationships to Expand Organically.\nOur North American footprint and broad supplier relationships, combined with our regular interaction with our large and diverse customer base, provides us key\ninsights and positions us to be a critical link in the supply chain for premium vaporization products and consumption accessories. Our suppliers benefit from access to\nthousands of brick and mortar retail locations as we are a single point of contact for improved production, planning and efficiency. Our customers, in turn, benefit from our\nmarket leadership, talented sales force, broad product offerings, high inventory availability, timely delivery and exceptional customer service. We believe our strong customer\nand supplier relationships will enable us to expand and broaden our market share in the premium vaporization products and consumption accessories marketplace and expand\ninto new categories.\nBe the Employer of Choice.\nWhen it comes to attracting and retaining top talent, Greenlane strives to be the employer of choice. At Greenlane we are committed to creating valuable career\nopportunities for our employees, supporting them and fostering a culture that invites and encourages diverse opinions and ideas. This work is grounded in the belief that we are\nat our best when we create inclusive, supportive and welcoming environments, where we uplift one another with dignity, respect and kindness. We are focused on ensuring our\nemployees see Greenlane as a home of possibility with good jobs, a sense of belonging, and a bright future.\n9\nBusiness Seasonality\nWe have historically experienced only moderate seasonality in our Consumer Goods business, particularly during the fourth quarter, which coincides with Cyber\nMonday (the first Monday after Thanksgiving, when online retailers typically offer holiday discounts), and as our customers build up their inventories in anticipation of the\nholiday season and for which we have related promotional marketing campaigns. Our Industrial Goods business is generally not affected by seasonality.\nHuman Capital Resources\nAs of July 18, 2024, we had 66 full-time employees. Approximately 54 were employed in the U.S., and 12 were employed in Europe. None of our employees are\nrepresented by a labor union. We have never experienced a labor-related work stoppage.\nDuring 2022 and 2023, we completed a series of reductions in force, which we expect to result in approximately $10.0 million in annualized cash compensation cost\nsavings. We believe our current headcount and resources are sufficient to execute our plan of achieving profitability in the near-term, while remaining flexible to scale our\nhiring as industry demand and our sales grow.\nAs we mention in our core operating strategies, we aim to be the employer of choice, as our employees are the key drivers of our success. We aim to recruit, train,\npromote and retain the most talented and success-driven personnel in the industry. Our industry knowledge and scale provide opportunities for our employees to obtain\nstructured training and career path opportunities across all departments and positions. We are a company that operates with three core values: never settle, never follow, and\nnever disrespect.\nCulture and Engagement\nWe exist to elevate all elements of the consumption experience. We are the driving force behind broadening accessibility to best-in-class ancillary products. We\ncultivate a passionate culture that empowers our team to thrive within our rapidly evolving industry. Our values are to: never settle, never follow, and never disrespect. We\nenvision a world where humanity is free to enjoy mother nature’s magic, and we pledge that each of our employees will play an integral role in helping us make our vision a\nreality.\nEverything we do is powered by our vision and core values and our culture reflects that. As a result, we enjoy a highly motivated and skilled workforce committed to\nour company. We send out regular employee engagement surveys, and in consultation with our employees we have addressed several opportunities to further improve our\nculture. By being open, honest, and transparent, our employees feel more actively engaged in our success.\nTotal Rewards, Pay Equity and Retention\nWe strive to attract and retain diverse, high caliber employees who raise the talent bar by offering competitive compensation and benefit packages, regardless of their\ngender, race, or other personal characteristics. We regularly review and survey our compensation and benefit programs against the market to ensure we remain competitive in\nour hiring practices. We provide employee salaries that are competitive and consider factors such as an employee’s role and experience, the location of their job and their\nperformance. We also encourage, support, and compensate our employees based on our philosophy of recognizing and rewarding exceptional performance. We believe that\nperformance and development is an ongoing process in which all employees should be active participants. Individual and company key performance goals are linked to\nemployee compensation, and we have begun work on a Greenlane Learning and Development curriculum that will include a blended approach to both in person and virtual\nlearning.\nCompetition\nBusiness-to-Business. We operate in an evolving industry in which the market and its participants remain highly fragmented. Although it is difficult to find reliable\nindependent research, we believe there is a vast number of potential B2B customers in North America comprised of licensed cannabis dispensaries, smoke shops, and specialty\nretailers. Our B2B customers compete primarily on the basis of the breadth, style, quality, pricing and availability of merchandise, the level of customer service, brand\nrecognition and loyalty. We successfully reach our B2B customers through our direct sales force and other marketing initiatives, and provide them with our strategically-curated\nmix of brands and products, merchandise planning strategies and exceptional customer service. Among vaporizer product distributors, we compete against both suppliers and\nother distributors. A number of suppliers choose to distribute directly in some sales channels and may also operate their own e-commerce platforms. We face competition from\nmany small privately-owned regional distributors that carry a narrow range of products. We believe there are only a select few wholesale distributors carrying a complete line of\npremium vaporization products and consumption accessories. This has led to our emphasis on our wholesale business through our business-to-business (B2B) customer portal\nat Greenlane.Wholesale.com. This platform provides our business customers seamless access to our catalog of products for purchase 24 hours a day, 365 days a year. The\nwholesale website offers customers an improved user experience with an easy-to-use layout that streamlines processes and allows customers to interact with us at their\nconvenience.\nBusiness-to-Consumer. A number of suppliers of vaporizers and specialized consumption products and accessories operate their own e-commerce websites through\nwhich they sell their items directly to end consumers. Additionally, there are hundreds of websites that sell products similar to those we offer in North America, Europe,\nAustralia and other parts of the world. We believe we compete effectively with other e-commerce websites. Further, we provide fulfillment services to the owners of some of\nthese websites as they do not carry their own inventory, are not able to ship as efficiently as we do and are unable to meet certain regulatory requirements, such as sales tax\ncollection. Our primary e-commerce website, Vapor.com, ranks above many of our competitors’ websites in various search engine categories. We believe our market\nknowledge, large product selection, relationships with vaporizer brands, in-house search engine optimization teams, social media focus and distribution facilities will enable us\nto remain a market leader in e-commerce.\n10\nTrademarks\nWe own a number of registered trademarks and service marks, including without limitation, trademarks in the relevant classes of goods for Greenlane, Higher\nStandards, Aerospaced, Groove, and Pollen Gear. We also license certain trademarks and other intellectual property, most notably those associated with our Marley Natural and\nKeith Haring brands. Solely for convenience, trademarks and trade names referred to in this Form 10-K may appear without the ® or TM symbols, but such references are not\nintended to indicate, in any way, that we will not assert, to the fullest extent under applicable law, our rights or the rights of the applicable licensor to these trademarks and trade\nnames. In addition, this Form 10-K contains trade names, trademarks and service marks of other companies that we do not own. We do not intend our use or display of other\ncompanies’ trade names, trademarks or service marks to imply a relationship with, or endorsement or sponsorship of us by, these other companies. We believe our largest\ntrademarks are widely recognized throughout the world and have considerable value. The duration of trademark registrations varies from country to country. However,\ntrademarks are generally valid and may be renewed indefinitely as long as they are in use and/or their registrations are properly maintained.\nRegulatory Developments\nOur operating results and prospects will be impacted, directly and indirectly, by regulatory developments at the local, state, and federal levels. Certain changes in local,\nstate, national, and international laws and regulations, such as increased legalization of cannabis, create significant opportunities for our business. However, other changes to\nlaws and regulations result in restrictions on which products we are permitted to sell and the manner in which we market our products, increased taxation of our products, and\nnegative changes to the public perceptions of our products, among other effects.\nWe believe the ongoing trend of states legalizing medicinal and adult-use cannabis will likely drive increased demand for many of our products. In the 2020 election,\nvoters approved initiatives for adult-use cannabis in New Jersey, Arizona, Montana, and South Dakota, as well as medical marijuana in Mississippi and South Dakota.\nSubsequent years saw Connecticut and Virginia (2021), Maryland and Missouri (2022), and Delaware, Minnesota, and Ohio (2023) legalizing adult-use cannabis. Although we\ncannot guarantee that state-level legalization will continue, the Department of Justice’s proposal to reclassify cannabis from Schedule I to Schedule III of the Controlled\nSubstances Act is a significant indicator of potential regulatory changes. This reclassification could have a profound impact on nationwide regulation, boosting market\nconfidence.\nIn addition, 30 states and the District of Columbia have recently adopted laws imposing taxes on vaping products. Additionally, as of 2022, at least 31 states have\nadopted laws imposing taxes on vaporizers. These taxes will result in increased prices to end consumers, which may adversely impact the demand for our products. We expect\nthese taxes would impact our competitors similarly, assuming their compliance with applicable laws.\n11\nThe Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021, which was signed into law on December 27, 2020, contains provisions that prohibit the mailing of electronic nicotine\ndelivery systems (“ENDS”) through the United States Postal Service (“USPS”) and place certain regulatory requirements on shipment of ENDS through other carriers. Certain\nprivate carriers, including UPS and FedEx, also have policies restricting or prohibiting the shipment of many vaporization products we sell. On December 30, 2021, the USPS\ngranted us an exception that permits Greenlane to continue shipping ENDS business to business via the USPS. This exception, combined with our use of alternative carriers,\npermits us to continue shipping almost all of our products to the vast majority of our customers, provided that we continue to meet all regulatory requirements. While we\ncurrently retain our ability to ship products to customers, additional legal or policy changes concerning the shipment of vaporizers could increase our costs materially and\ndeprive us of our ability to timely deliver certain products to certain types of customers.\nCorporate Information\nOur executive offices are located at 1095 Broken Sound Parkway, Suite 100, Boca Raton, Florida 33487. Our telephone number at our executive offices is (877) 292-\n7660.\nAvailable Information\nThe Company’s Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K, and amendments to reports filed pursuant to Sections 13(a) and 15(d) of\nthe Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), are filed with the SEC.

RISK FACTORS\nOur operations and financial results are subject to various risks and uncertainties, including but not limited to those described below, which could harm our business,\nreputation, financial condition, and operating results. The following is a description of what we consider the key challenges and material risks to our business and an investment\nin our Class A common stock.\nRisks Related to Our Business and Industry\nGlobal economic conditions, including inflation and supply chain disruptions, could materially and adversely our business, prospects, results of operations, financial\ncondition, or cash flows.\nOur business and operations are sensitive to global economic conditions. General global economic downturns and macroeconomic trends, including heightened\ninflation, volatility in the capital markets, interest rate and currency rate fluctuations, the ongoing war in Ukraine, and economic slowdown or recession, may result in\nunfavorable conditions that could negatively affect demand for our products and exacerbate some of the other risks that affect our business, financial condition and results of\noperations. Both domestic and international markets experienced significant inflationary pressures in 2022 and inflation rates in the U.S. are currently expected to continue at\nelevated levels for the near-term. In addition, the Federal Reserve has raised, and is expected to continue to raise, interest rates in response to concerns about inflation, which,\ncoupled with reduced government spending and volatility in financial markets, may have the effect of further increasing economic uncertainty and heightening these risks.\nInterest rate increases or other government actions taken to reduce inflation could also result in an economic recession.\nA material decline in the economic conditions affecting consumers, which results in a reduction in disposable income for the average consumer, may change\nconsumption patterns, and may result in a reduction in spending on vaporization products and consumption accessories or a switch to cheaper products or products obtained\nthrough illicit channels. Many of our products are relatively new to the market and may be regarded by consumers as a novelty item and expendable. As such, demand for our\nvaporizer products may be particularly sensitive to economic conditions such as inflation, recession, high energy costs, unemployment, changes in interest rates and money\nsupply, changes in the political environment and other factors beyond our control, any combination of which could result in a material adverse effect on our business, results of\noperations and financial condition.\n12\nOur ability to fund our capital requirements will depend on many factors, and if we are unsuccessful in increasing sales and generating positive cash flows we may have to\nfurther reduce our costs by curtailing future operations to continue as a business.\nOur ability to fund our capital requirements out of our available cash and cash generated from our operations in the future will depend on many factors, but largely on\nour ability to (i) increase sales of our products, (ii) raise capital on favorable terms, and (iii) generate positive cash flow and/or profits from our operations. If we are not\nsuccessful in generating needed funds from operations or in equity or debt capital raising transactions, we may need to further reduce our costs, which measures could include\nselling or consolidating certain operations or assets, and delaying, canceling or scaling back product development and marketing programs.\nIn addition, our low cash balance and negative cash flow may cause an inability to pay our vendors on time, purchase all the inventory we need, and meet various other\nobligations going forward. Also, if we are not successful in generating funds from operations or from capital-raising transactions, substantial doubt may be raised about our\nstatus as a going concern.\nIf we are required to seek additional financing sources, they may not be available to us on attractive terms if at all and could restrict our ability to engage in certain\nbusiness activities.\nDue to limited access to the debt markets, we have been required to issue equity at prices that are dilutive to stockholders. We may be forced to continue to seek equity\ncapital at dilutive prices through other means if other financing is not available to us to fund our working capital needs. In the past, because of the nature of our industry, we\nhave had difficulties establishing relationships with certain financial institutions and may continue to face such difficulties. As a result, indebtedness or other forms of financing\nmay not be available to us on attractive terms or at all. Furthermore, we may have to seek financing from non-traditional sources such as private equity and hedge funds, which\nmay require us to give up significant governance or other rights or agree to economic and other terms that are not favorable.\nIn addition, future financing agreements we may enter into in the future may contain customary negative covenants and other financial and operating covenants that,\namong other things:\n● restrict our ability to incur additional indebtedness;\n● restrict our ability to incur additional liens;\n● restrict our ability to make certain investments (including capital expenditures);\n● restrict our ability to merge with another company;\n● restrict our ability to sell or dispose of assets;\n● restrict our ability to make distributions to stockholders; and\n● require us to satisfy minimum financial coverage ratios, minimum net worth requirements, maximum leverage ratios, or other financial covenants.\nWe had cash available as of December 31, 2023 of $0.5 million. In addition, our revenue for the year ended December 31, 2023 was down from prior years and has\ndeclined in recent quarters. If we are unable to access additional liquidity through successful execution of our cost cutting strategic initiatives and revenue goals, we may have\nsignificant cash constraints, which would have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations and ability to pay our debts as they come due.\nWe have failed, and may continue to fail, to meet the listing standards of Nasdaq, and as a result our Class A common stock may become delisted, which could have a\nmaterial adverse effect on the liquidity of our Class A common stock.\nIf we fail to continue to satisfy the continued listing requirements of Nasdaq, such as the corporate governance or public float requirements, or the minimum closing\nbid price requirement, Nasdaq will take steps to de-list our Class A common stock. As a result of several factors, including but not limited to our financial performance, market\nsentiment about the cannabis industry, volatility in the financial markets generally due to the tightening of monetary policy by the Board of Governors of the United States\nFederal Reserve Bank (the “Federal Reserve”) and other geopolitical events, events such as the ongoing wars around the world, the per share price of our Class A common\nstock has declined below the minimum bid price threshold required for continued listing. Such a de-listing would likely have a negative effect on the price of our Class A\ncommon stock and would impair your ability to sell or purchase our Class A common stock when you wish to do so, as well as adversely affect our ability to issue additional\nsecurities and obtain additional financing in the future.\n13\nOn August 21, 2023, we received a letter from the staff of Nasdaq indicating that we were not in compliance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5450(a)(1) because the closing\nbid price per share for our Class A common stock had closed below $1.00 for the previous 30 consecutive business days (the “Minimum Bid Price Requirement”). We were\ngiven 180 days, or until February 20, 2024 to regain compliance with the Minimum Bid Price Requirement. We also filed an application to transfer the listing of our Class A\ncommon stock from the Nasdaq Global Market to the Nasdaq Capital Market, which transfer was approved and occurred on February 9, 2024. As a result of the transfer, we\nbecame eligible to request an additional an additional 180-day compliance period.\nOn February 21, 2024, Nasdaq notified us in writing that while we had not regained compliance with the Minimum Bid Price Requirement, we were eligible for an\nadditional 180-day compliance period, or until August 19, 2024, to regain compliance with the Minimum Bid Price Requirement. Nasdaq’s determination was based on us\nhaving met the continued listing requirement for market value of publicly held shares and all other applicable requirements for initial listing on The Nasdaq Capital Market,\nwith the exception of the Minimum Bid Price Requirement, and on our written notice to Nasdaq of our intention to cure the deficiency during the second compliance period by\neffecting a reverse stock split, if necessary.\nIf we do not regain compliance during the second 180-day period, then Nasdaq will notify us of its determination to delist our Class A common stock, at which point\nwe would have an opportunity to appeal the delisting determination to a hearings panel. We would remain listed on Nasdaq pending the hearings panel’s decision. There can be\nno assurance that, if we do appeal the delisting determination by Nasdaq to the hearings panel, that such appeal would be successful.\nOn January 24, 2024, Gina Collins gave notice of her resignation from our Board of Directors and from each committee of the Board, effective immediately. Ms.\nCollins was an independent director, and as a result of her resignation, we no longer comply with the majority independent board requirement of Nasdaq as set forth in Nasdaq\nListing Rule 5605(b)(1) because independent directors do not comprise a majority of the Board of Directors, and Nasdaq’s audit committee requirements as set forth in Nasdaq\nListing Rule 5605(c)(2)(A) because the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors is not comprised of at least three independent directors.\nOn January 29, 2024, in accordance with Nasdaq Listing Rules, we notified Nasdaq of Ms. Collins’ resignation and the resulting non-compliance. On January 30,\n2024, we received a notice from Nasdaq acknowledging the fact that we do not meet the requirements of such rules. In accordance with Nasdaq Listing Rules 5605(b)(1)(A)\nand 5605(c)(4), to regain compliance with the Nasdaq Listing Rules, we have until the earlier of our next annual stockholders meeting or January 24, 2025.\nOn April 18, 2024, we received a notice from Nasdaq stating that because we had not yet filed our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December\n31, 2023, we were no longer in compliance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5250(c)(1). Nasdaq Listing Rule 5250(c)(1) requires listed companies to timely file all required periodic\nfinancial reports with the Securities and Exchange Commission.\nOn May 21, 2024, we received a notice from Nasdaq stating that because we had not yet filed our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended March\n31, 2024, we were no longer in compliance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5250(c)(1).\nThe Company had 60 calendar days from April 18, 2024, or until June 17, 2024, to regain compliance by filing the Form 10-K and the Form 10-Q or to submit to\nNasdaq a plan to regain compliance with the Nasdaq Listing Rules. We timely submitted the plan to regain compliance to Nasdaq and Nasdaq granted us additional time to file\nthe Form 10K and 10Q.\n14\nOur narrow margins may magnify the impact of variations in operating costs and of adverse or unforeseen events on operating results.\nWe are subject to intense price competition. As a result of this and other factors, our gross and operating margins have historically been narrow. Narrow margins\nmagnify the impact of variations in operating costs and of gross margin and of unforeseen adverse events on operating results. Continued increases in costs, such as the cost of\nmerchandise, wage levels, shipping rates, import duties and fuel costs, may negatively impact our margins and profitability. We are not always able to raise the sales price to\noffset cost increases or to effect increased operating efficiencies in response to increasing costs. If we are unable to maintain our margins in the future, it could have a material\nadverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. If we become subject to increased price competition in the future, we cannot assure you that we\nwill not lose market share, that we will not be forced to reduce our prices and further reduce our margins, or that we will be able to compete effectively.\nAdditionally, promotional activities can significantly increase net sales in the periods in which they are initiated and net sales can be adversely impacted in the periods\nafter a promotion. Accordingly, based upon the timing of our marketing and promotional initiatives, we have and may continue to experience significant variability in our\nmonth-to-month results, which could affect our ability to formulate strategies that allow us to maintain our market presence across volatile months. If our monthly sales\nfluctuations obscure our ability to track important trends in our key markets, it may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nIf we fail to manage our business and growth effectively, we may be unable to execute our business plan, maintain high levels of service or address competitive challenges\nadequately.\nOur success will depend, in part, on our ability to manage our business and its growth, both domestically and internationally. Any growth in, expansion of, or shift in\nthe focus of our business, is likely to continue to place a strain on our management and administrative resources, infrastructure and systems. As with other businesses, we\nexpect that we will need to further refine and expand our business development capabilities, our systems and processes and our access to financing sources. We will also need to\nhire, train, supervise, and manage new employees. These processes are time consuming and expensive and will increase management responsibilities and divert management\nattention. We cannot assure that we will be able to:\n● optimize our product offerings effectively or efficiently or in a timely manner, if at all;\n● achieve expected synergies or other anticipated benefits;\n● allocate our human resources optimally;\n● meet our capital needs;\n● identify and hire qualified employees or retain valued employees;\n● effectively incorporate the components of any business or product line that we may acquire in our effort to achieve growth; or\n● continue to grow our business.\nOur inability or failure to manage our business and its growth effectively could harm our business and materially adversely affect our operating results and financial\ncondition. In addition, we believe that an important contributor to our success has been and will continue to be our corporate culture, which we believe fosters innovation,\nteamwork and a passion for our products and customers. As a result of our rapid growth, we may find it difficult to build and maintain our strong corporate culture, which could\nlimit our ability to innovate and operate effectively. Any failure to preserve our culture could also negatively affect our ability to retain current and recruit new personnel,\ncontinue to perform at current levels or execute on our business strategy.\nManagement and employee turnover creates uncertainties and could harm our business.\nWe have experienced significant turnover in our executive leadership in recent years. Changes to strategic or operating goals, which oftentimes occur with the\nappointment of new executives and board members, can create uncertainty, may negatively impact our ability to execute quickly and effectively, and may ultimately be\nunsuccessful. In addition, executive leadership transition periods are often difficult as the new executives gain detailed knowledge of our operations, and friction can result from\nchanges in strategy and management style. Management turnover inherently causes some loss of institutional knowledge, which can negatively affect strategy and execution.\nUntil we integrate new personnel, and unless they are able to succeed in their positions, we may be unable to successfully manage and grow our business, and our financial\ncondition and profitability may suffer.\nFurther, to the extent we experience additional management turnover, competition for top management is high and it may take months to find a candidate that meets\nour requirements. If we are unable to attract and retain qualified management personnel, our business could suffer. Our future success will also depend on our ability to identify,\nrecruit and retain additional qualified technical and managerial personnel. We operate in several geographic locations where labor markets are particularly competitive, where\ndemand for personnel with these skills is extremely high and is likely to remain high. As a result, competition for qualified personnel is intense, particularly in the areas of\ngeneral management, finance, engineering and science, and the process of hiring suitably qualified personnel is often lengthy and expensive and may become more expensive\nin the future. If we are unable to hire and retain a sufficient number of qualified employees, our ability to conduct and expand our business could be seriously reduced.\n15\nThe market for vaporizer products and related items is a niche market, subject to a great deal of uncertainty and is still evolving.\nVaporizer products comprise a significant portion of our product portfolio. Many of these products have only recently been introduced to the market and are at an early\nstage of development. These products represent core components of a niche market that is evolving rapidly, is characterized by a number of market participants and is subject to\nregulatory oversight and a potentially fluctuating regulatory framework. Rapid growth in the use of, and interest in, vaporizer products is recent, and may not continue on a\nlasting basis. The demand and market acceptance for these products is subject to a high level of uncertainty, including, but not limited to, changes in governmental regulation,\ndevelopments in product technology, perceived safety and efficacy of our products, perceived advantages of competing products and sale and use of materials that can be\nvaporized, including in the expanding legal state cannabis markets. Therefore, we are subject to many of the business risks associated with a new enterprise in a niche market.\nContinued technical evolution, market uncertainty, evolving regulation and the resulting risk of failure of our new and existing product offerings in this market could have a\nmaterial adverse effect on our ability to build and maintain market share and on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Further, there can be no assurance\nthat we will be able to continue to compete effectively in this marketplace.\nWe depend on third-party suppliers for our products and may experience supply shortages which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe depend on third-party suppliers for our vaporization products and consumption accessories product offerings. Our customers associate certain characteristics of our\nproducts, including the weight, feel, draw, flavor, packaging and other unique attributes, to the brands we market, distribute and sell. In the future, we may have difficulty\nobtaining the products we need from our suppliers as a result of unexpected demand or production difficulties that might extended lead times, as well as due to constraints\nrelating to our low cash position. Also, products may not be available to us in quantities sufficient to meet our customer demand. Any interruption in supply and/or consistency\nof these products may adversely impact our ability to deliver products to our customers, may harm our relationships and reputation with our customers, and may have a material\nadverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Interruptions in supply or consistency of products could arise for a number of reasons, including\nbut not limited to economic and civil unrest, public health crises, embargoes, and sanctions.\nWe may enter into new markets or lines of business that offer new products and services, or may expand existing lines of business, which may subject us to additional risks.\nFrom time to time, we may enter into new markets or lines of business that entail offering new products and services, or may expand existing lines of business. For\nexample, our merger with KushCo significantly expanded our exposure to the leading MSOs and LPs, as well as a presence on the west coast. Our historical experience in these\nmarkets does not ensure that we will be able to successfully operate expended lines of business or will be successful in launching new products or entering new markets. In\naddition, external factors, such as competitive alternatives, potential conflicts of interest, either real or perceived, and shifting market preferences, in addition to our lack of\nexperience with or knowledge of new lines of business or markets may impact our implementation, expansion and operation of new and existing lines of business. Other related\nrisks include:\n● the potential diversion of management’s attention, available cash, and other resources from our existing businesses;\n● unanticipated liabilities or contingencies;\n● compliance with additional regulatory burdens;\n● potential damage to existing customer relationships, lack of customer acceptance or an inability to attract new customers; and\n● the inability to compete effectively in the new line or expanded line of business or in a new market.\nFailure to successfully manage these risks in the implementation, expansion or operation of new and existing lines of business and markets or the offering of new\nproducts or services could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, business, results of operations and financial condition.\n16\nA significant percentage of our revenue is dependent on sales of products from a relatively small number of key suppliers, and a decline in sales of products from these\nsuppliers could materially harm our business.\nA significant percentage of our revenue is dependent on sales of products, primarily vaporizers and related components, that we purchase from a small number of key\nsuppliers, including CCELL, Storz & Bickel, Grenco Science and Davinci. For example, products manufactured by CCELL represented approximately 41.5% and 39.1% of our\nnet sales in the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, and products manufactured by Storz & Bickel represented approximately 5.5% of our net sales in both\nyears ended December 31, 2023 and 2022. Products manufactured by PAX represented approximately 3.6% and 3.3% of our net sales in the years ended December 31, 2023\nand 2022, respectively, and products manufactured by Davinci represented approximately 7.5% and 4.0% of our net sales in the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022,\nrespectively. A decline in sales of any of our key suppliers’ products, whether due to decreases in supply of, or demand for, their products, termination of our agreements with\nthem, regulatory actions or otherwise, could have a material adverse impact on our sales and earnings and adversely affect our business.\nThere is uncertainty related to the regulation of vaporization products and certain other consumption accessories. Increased regulatory compliance burdens, no matter\nhow they arise, could have a material adverse impact on our business development efforts and our operations.\nUnited States\nThere is uncertainty regarding whether, in what circumstances, how and when the FDA will seek to enforce the tobacco-related provisions of the Federal Food, Drug,\nand Cosmetic Act (“FFDCA”) relative to vaporizer hardware and accessories that can be used to vaporize cannabis and other material, including electronic cigarettes, rolling\npapers and glassware, in light of the potential for dual use with tobacco.\nThrough amendments to the FFDCA, the Tobacco Control Act established, by statute, that the FDA has oversight over specific types of tobacco products (cigarettes,\ncigarette tobacco, roll-your-own (“RYO”) tobacco, and smokeless tobacco) and granted the FDA the authority to “deem” other types of tobacco products as subject to the\nstatutory requirements. In addition to establishing authority, defining key terminology, and setting adulteration and misbranding standards, the Tobacco Control Act established\nFDA’s authority over tobacco products in a number of areas such as: submission of health information to the FDA; registration with the FDA; premarket authorization\nrequirements; good manufacturing practice requirements; tobacco product standards; notification, recall, corrections, and removals; records and reports; marketing\nconsiderations and restrictions; post-market surveillance and studies; labeling and warnings; and recordkeeping and tracking. Although the vast majority of our vaporizer\nproducts are not subject to these regulations because they are not intended for use with tobacco or nicotine, changes in law, regulation, or policy that subject a greater portion of\nour products to these regulations could occur.\nIn a final rule effective August 8, 2016 (“Deeming Rule”), the FDA deemed all products that meet the Tobacco Control Act’s definition of “tobacco product,” including\ncomponents and parts but excluding accessories, to be subject to the tobacco control requirements of the FFDCA and the FDA’s implementing regulations. Accordingly, as of\nthe Deeming Rule’s effective date, deemed tobacco products that are “new” (i.e., those that were not commercially marketed in the United States as of February 15, 2007) are\nsubject to the premarket authorization requirements. Deemed new tobacco products that remain on the market without authorization are marketed unlawfully.\nDeemed new tobacco products include, among other things: products such as electronic cigarettes, electronic cigars, electronic hookahs, vape pens, certain vaporizers\nand e-liquids and their components or parts (such as tanks, coils and batteries) (“ENDS”). The FDA’s interpretation of components and parts of a tobacco product includes any\nassembly of materials intended or reasonably expected to be used with or for the human consumption of a tobacco product. In a 2017 decision of the D.C. Circuit court, the\ncourt upheld the FDA’s authority to regulate ENDS even though they do not actually contain tobacco, and even if the products could be used with nicotine-free e-liquids.\nThe Tobacco Control Act and FDA’s implementation of regulations require regulatory approvals before certain products may be sold and restrict the way tobacco\nproduct manufacturers, retailers, and distributors can advertise and promote tobacco products, including a prohibition against free samples or the use of vending machines,\nrequirements for presentation of warning information, and age verification of purchasers.\nNewly-deemed tobacco products are also subject to the other requirements of the Tobacco Control Act, such as that they not be adulterated or misbranded. The FDA\nhas been directed under the Tobacco Control Act to establish specific good manufacturing practice (“GMP”) regulations for tobacco products, and could do so in the future,\nwhich could have a material adverse impact on the ability of some of our suppliers to manufacture, and the cost to manufacture, certain of our products. Even in the absence of\nspecific GMP regulations, a facility’s failure to maintain sanitary conditions or to prevent contamination of products could result in the FDA deeming the products produced\nthere adulterated.\nThe FDA has announced its intention to take enforcement measures related to ENDS products offered for sale after September 9, 2020, for which the manufacturers\nhad not submitted a PMTA. Following that date, the FDA did in fact take actions against certain manufacturers of ENDS products for which a PMTA had not been submitted.\nAccordingly, and in light of the laws noted above, premarket authorizations will be necessary for us to continue our distribution of any vaporizer hardware and accessories that\nmeet the FDA’s definition of ENDS. While we do not believe vaporizers intended for use with non-tobacco substances meet the FDA’s definition of ENDS, it is possible that\nthe FDA could require premarket authorization for such products.\n17\nOur suppliers who make vaporizers that are currently, or in the future become, subject to FDA regulation must timely file applications for the appropriate\nauthorizations so that we may continue selling their products in the United States. We have no control over the content of those applications, and we have no assurances that the\noutcome of the FDA’s review will result in authorization of the marketing of these products. If the FDA establishes or applies review standards or processes that our suppliers\nare unable or unwilling to comply with, our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects would be adversely affected.\nThe anticipated costs to our suppliers of complying with future FDA regulations will be dependent on the rules issued by the FDA, the timing and clarity of any new\nrules or guidance documents accompanying these rules, the reliability and simplicity (or complexity) of the electronic systems utilized by the FDA for information and reports\nto be submitted, and the details required by the FDA for such information and reports with respect to each regulated product. Any failure to comply with existing or new FDA\nregulatory requirements could result in significant financial penalties to us or our suppliers, which could ultimately have a material adverse effect on our business, results of\noperations, financial condition and ability to market and sell our products. Compliance and related costs could be substantial and could significantly increase the costs of\noperating in the vaporization products and certain other consumption accessories markets.\nIn addition, failure to comply with the Tobacco Control Act and with FDA regulatory requirements could result in litigation, criminal convictions or significant\nfinancial penalties and could impair our ability to market and sell some of our vaporizer products. At present, we are not able to predict whether the Tobacco Control Act will\nimpact our business to a greater degree than competitors in the industry, thus affecting our competitive position.\nAs discussed elsewhere in these Risk Factors and under the heading Regulatory Developments, a number of states and cities have implemented bans or restrictions on\nthe sale of vaporizers and accessories, as well as flavored tobacco products, including vaping liquids and menthol cigarettes. There may, in the future, also be increased\nregulation of additives in smokeless products and internet sales of vaporization products and certain other consumption accessories. The application of either or both of current\nfederal, state, and local, laws, and of any new laws or regulations which may be adopted in the future at the federal, state, or local level, to vaporization products, consumption\naccessories or such additives could result in additional expenses and require us to change our advertising and labeling, and methods of marketing and distribution of our\nproducts, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nCanada\nOn May 23, 2018, the Tobacco and Vaping Products Act (“TVPA”) became effective, and now governs the manufacture, sale, labeling and promotion of vaping\nproducts sold in Canada. The TVPA replaced the former Tobacco Act (Canada) and established a legislative framework that applies to vaping products, whether or not they\ncontain nicotine. The TVPA prescribes high-level requirements in relation to vaping products, with regulations governing specific topics such as nicotine concentration and the\npromotion of vaping products. Other regulations remain forthcoming and there remains a high degree of uncertainty with respect to the compliance landscape for vaping\nproducts. As such, there can be no assurance that we will initially be in total compliance, remain competitive, or financially able to meet future requirements administered\npursuant to the TVPA. Prior to the TVPA becoming effective, Health Canada had taken the position that electronic smoking products (i.e., electronic products for the\nvaporization and administration of inhaled doses of nicotine, including electronic cigarettes, cigars, cigarillos and pipes, as well as cartridges of nicotine solutions and related\nproducts) fell within the scope of the Food and Drugs Act (Canada) (“Food and Drugs Act”). Vaping products with therapeutic or health-related claims are subject to the Food\nand Drugs Act and related regulations. Finally, the TVPA provides the authority to make regulations to collect information from industry about vaping products, their emissions\nand any research and development (e.g., sales data and information on market research, product composition, ingredients, materials, health effects, hazardous properties and\nbrand elements). Health Canada is currently developing proposed regulations in this area.\nOn December 21, 2019, Health Canada issued a Regulatory Impact Analysis Statement titled “Vaping Products Promotion Regulations.” The Impact Analysis\naddressed two proposed new regulations that would place stricter limits on the advertising and promotion of nicotine vaping products and make health warnings on nicotine\nvaping products mandatory (the “Proposed Regulations”). The Proposed Regulations would: (1) prohibit the promotion of nicotine vaping products and nicotine vaping\nproduct-related brand elements by means of advertising that is done in a manner that can be seen or heard by youth, including the display of nicotine vaping products a points\nof sale where can be seen by youth; and (2) require that all nicotine vaping advertising convey a health warning about the health hazards of nicotine vaping product use.\nOn July 1, 2020, Health Canada’s “Vaping Products Labeling and Packaging Regulations” (the “VPLPR”) came into effect; requiring (1) all vaping products\ncontaining nicotine to display a standardized nicotine concentration statement and health warning about the addictiveness of nicotine; (2) products containing nicotine to be\npackaged in child-resistant containers and display a toxicity warning and first aid treatment statement; and (3) the display of a list of ingredients contained in the vaping\nsubstances, regardless of nicotine content. On July 14, 2020, Health Canada issued a guidance document on vaping products titled, “Industry Guide to vaping products subject\nto the Canada Consumer Product Safety Act” (the “CCPA Guidance”). The CCPA Guidance provided clarity on requirements under the Canada Consumer Product Safety Act\n(“CCPSA”) for vaping products that are manufactured, imported, advertised, or sold in Canada. The CCPA Guidance provided clarity on the requirements of the VPLPR and\nthe authority of the CCPSA to address safety issues posed by a vaping product not marketed for therapeutic use or by a cannabis accessory (such as a vaporizer represented to\nbe used in the consumption of cannabis) not marketed for a therapeutic use.\n18\nIn addition to federal regulations, several provinces, including Alberta, British Columbia, Nova Scotia, Ontario, Prince Edward Island (“PEI”), Quebec, and\nSaskatchewan, have passed regulations fully restricting or limiting the advertising and sales of certain types of nicotine vaping products. Many provinces have focused their\ntobacco and vaping control efforts on retail access and have taken action to go beyond the minimum requirements in the TVPA. For example, Nova Scotia, Newfoundland and\nLabrador, and the Northwest Territories, have increased the minimum age of sale to 19. Notably, in Prince Edward Island, as of March 1, 2020, the minimum age for purchasing\nnicotine products increased to age 21. In 2019. British Columbia, Saskatchewan, and Ontario limited the sales of flavored vaping products with exceptions for some flavors to\nspecialty stores, whereas some provinces have banned flavored vaping products, with the exception of tobacco flavor (Nova Scotia and Prince Edward Island). By way of\nexample, on August 11, 2020, PEI adopted a regulation to ban the sale of all flavored vaping products, effective March 1, 2021. Quebec is currently considering a ban on\nflavored products and effective as of March 25, 2022, the sale of flavored vapor products was banned in the Northwest Territories.\nMoreover, certain provinces (British Columbia, Newfoundland and Labrador, Saskatchewan, Quebec, Nova Scotia) have implemented an e-cigarette retail licensing\nsystem or have guidelines for retailers in order to prevent sales to minors (Alberta, British Columbia, Newfoundland and Labrador, Prince Edward Island, Saskatchewan).\nFinally, with respect to the taxation of vaping products, the Canadian government introduced amendments to the Excise Act, 2001 to implement a new excise duty\nframework on vaping products. These amendments became law on June 23, 2022. The new framework applies to vaping products that are manufactured in Canada or imported,\nand that are intended for use in a vaping device in Canada. Manufacturers of vaping products are required to get a vaping product license from the Canada Revenue Agency\n(“CRA”). Importers are required to apply for registration from the CRA. Manufacturers and importers are also required to register for the vaping stamping regime. All vaping\nproducts entering the Canadian duty-paid market are required to be packaged with an excise stamp affixed to the product. The excise stamps shows that duties have been paid.\nThese developments, together with the passed and proposed federal and provincial regulations may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of\noperations, and financial condition.\nEurope\nThroughout Europe, several countries’ laws implementing the European Union Tobacco Products Directive (“TPD”) impose strict regulations on the approval, sale,\nand advertising of e-cigarettes. While we do not sell or market any material amount of products that we believe fall within the definition of e-cigarettes in Europe, if\nvaporization products we sell are found to fall within the scope of laws implementing the TPD, we would be unable to continue selling those products in certain countries,\nwhich may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nWe may be unable to identify or contract with new suppliers in the event of a disruption to our supply.\nIn the event of a disruption to our supply of products, we would have to identify new suppliers that can meet our needs. Only a limited number of suppliers may have\nthe ability to produce certain products we sell at the volumes we need, and it could be costly or time-consuming to locate and approve such alternative sources. Moreover, it\nmay be difficult or costly to find suppliers to produce small volumes of products in the event we are looking only to supplement our current supply as suppliers may impose\nminimum order requirements. In addition, we may be unable to negotiate pricing or other terms with our existing or new suppliers as favorable as those we currently enjoy. We\ncannot guarantee that a failure to adequately replace or supplement our existing suppliers would not have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and\nfinancial condition.\nDemand for the products we distribute could decrease if the trend of our suppliers selling products directly to consumers or retailers continues or accelerates.\nRetailers and consumers of vaporization products and consumption accessories have historically purchased certain amounts of these products directly from suppliers.\nRecently, direct to consumer sales of vaporization products and consumption accessories have accelerated, consistent with broader sales trends. If our customers were to\nincrease their purchases of products directly from suppliers, or if suppliers further increase their efforts to sell such products directly to consumers or retailers, we could\nexperience a significant decrease in our business, results of operations and financial condition. These, or other developments that remove us from, or limit our role in, the\ndistribution chain, may harm our competitive position in the marketplace and reduce our sales and earnings and adversely affect our business.\n19\nWe are vulnerable to third-party transportation risks, including governmental laws and common carriers’ policies that prevent the shipment of the types of products we sell.\nWe depend on fast and efficient shipping services to distribute our products. Any prolonged disruption of these services may have a material adverse effect on our\nbusiness, financial condition and results of operations. Rising costs associated with transportation services used by us to receive or deliver our products, including tariffs, as\nwell as delays as a results of factors outside of our control have had and may continue to have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of\noperations.\nThe Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021, which was signed into law on December 27, 2020, contains provisions that prohibit the mailing of ENDS through the\nUnited States Postal Service (“USPS”) and place certain regulatory requirements on shipment of ENDS through other carriers. Certain private carriers, including UPS and\nFedEx, also have policies restricting or prohibiting the shipment of certain vaporization products we sell, requiring us to occasionally rely upon smaller carriers that are more\nexpensive and serve fewer geographic areas. Although we received USPS approval in December 2021 for a business and regulatory exception to the PACT Act (the “PACT Act\nException”) permitting us to ship ENDS to other PACT Act compliant businesses, there can be no assurances that we will be able to maintain the PACT Act Exception or that\nthe USPS will not elect to rescind the PACT Act Exception. Additional legal or policy changes concerning the shipment of vaporizers could increase our costs materially and\ndeprive us of our ability to timely deliver certain products to certain types of customers. Additionally, rising costs associated with transportation services used by us to receive\nor deliver our products (including tariffs) and prohibitions on the use of certain shipping services for specified products, may have a material adverse effect on our business,\nfinancial condition and results of operations.\nWe do not have long-term agreements or guaranteed price or delivery arrangements with most of our suppliers. The loss of a significant supplier would require us to rely\nmore heavily on our other existing suppliers or to develop relationships with new suppliers. Such a loss may have an adverse effect on our product offerings and our\nbusiness.\nWhile we have long-term distribution agreements with certain of our suppliers, consistent with industry practice, we do not have guaranteed price or delivery\narrangements with most of our suppliers. We generally make our purchases through purchase orders. As a result, we have experienced and may in the future experience\ninventory shortages or price increases on certain products. Furthermore, our industry occasionally experiences significant product supply shortages, and we sometimes\nexperience customer order backlogs due to the inability of certain suppliers to make available to us certain products as needed. We cannot provide assurances that suppliers will\nmaintain an adequate inventory of products to fulfill our orders on a timely basis, or at all, or that we will be able to obtain particular products on favorable terms, or at all.\nAdditionally, we cannot provide assurances that product lines currently offered by suppliers will continue to be available to us. A decline in the supply or continued availability\nof the products of our suppliers, or a significant increase in the price of those products, could reduce our sales and negatively affect our operating results.\nIn addition, some of our suppliers have the ability to terminate their relationships with us at any time, or to decide to sell, or increase their sales of, their products\nthrough other resellers or channels. Although we believe there are numerous suppliers with the capacity to supply the products we distribute, the loss of one or more of our\nmajor suppliers could have an adverse effect on our product offerings and our business. Such a loss would require us to rely more heavily on our other existing suppliers,\ndevelop relationships with new suppliers or undertake our own manufacturing, which may cause us to pay higher prices for products due to, among other things, a loss of\nvolume discount benefits currently obtained from our major suppliers. Any termination, interruption or adverse modification of our relationship with a key supplier or a\nsignificant number of other suppliers would likely adversely affect our operating income, cash flow and future prospects.\nIf we fail to maintain proper inventory levels, our business could be harmed.\nWe often purchase key products from suppliers prior to the time we receive purchase orders from customers. We do this to minimize purchasing costs, the time\nnecessary to fill customer orders, and the risk of non-delivery. However, we may be unable to sell the products we have purchased in advance. Inventory levels in excess of\ncustomer demand have previously and may in the future, result in inventory write-downs, and the sale of excess inventory at discounted prices could significantly impair our\nbrand image and have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Conversely, if we underestimate demand for our products or if we\nfail to acquire the products that we require at the time we need them, we may experience inventory shortages. Inventory shortages might delay shipments to customers, reduce\nrevenue, negatively impact customer relationships and diminish brand loyalty, which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and\nfinancial condition.\n20\nOur success is dependent in part upon our ability to distribute popular products from new suppliers, as well as the ability of our existing suppliers to develop and market\nproducts that meet changes in market demand or regulatory requirements.\nMany of the products we sell are generally subject to rapid changes in marketplace demand and regulatory requirements. For example, recent laws and regulations\nhave prohibited the sale of certain types of ENDS products that we previously sold. Our success is dependent, in part, upon the ability of our suppliers to develop and market\nproducts that meet these changes. Our success is also dependent on our ability to develop relationships with and sell products from new suppliers that address these changes in\nmarket demand or regulatory requirements. To the extent products that address recent changes are not available to us, or are not available to us in sufficient quantities or on\nacceptable terms, we could encounter increased competition, which would likely adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe do not have long-term contracts with many of our customers. The agreements that we do have generally do not commit our customers to any minimum purchase\nvolume. The loss of a significant customer may have a material adverse effect on us.\nOur customers generally place orders on an as-needed basis. Consistent with industry practice, we do not have long-term contracts with most of our customers, other\nthan certain retail chains or distributors in Canada and abroad and certain state-licensed cannabis businesses in the United States. In addition, our agreements generally do not\ncommit our customers to any minimum purchase volume. Accordingly, we are exposed to risks from potential adverse financial conditions in the vaporization products and\nconsumption accessories industry, a potentially shifting legal landscape, the general economy, a competitive landscape, a changing technological landscape or changing\ncustomer needs or any other change that may affect the demand for our products. We cannot assure you that our customers will continue to place orders with us in similar\nvolumes, on the same terms, or at all. Our customers may terminate their relationships with us or reduce their purchasing volume at any time. Our ten largest customers, in the\naggregate, represented approximately 39.0% and 40.7% of our net sales for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The loss of a significant number of\ncustomers, or a substantial decrease in a significant customer’s orders, may have an adverse effect on our revenue.\nChanges in our customer, product or competition mix could cause our product margin and results of operations to fluctuate.\nFrom time to time, we may experience changes in our customer mix, our product mix or our competition mix. Changes in our customer mix may result from\ngeographic expansion or contractions, mergers and acquisitions among our customer base, legislative, regulatory or enforcement priority changes affecting the products we\ndistribute, selling activities within current geographic markets and targeted selling activities to new customer sectors. For example, our merger with Kushco has shifted our\ncustomer mix to include a greater concentration of customers who engage in the cultivation, processing, and/or sale of cannabis. Changes in our product mix may result from\nmarketing activities to existing customers, the needs of existing and prospective customers and from regulatory and legislative changes. Changes in our competition mix may\nresult from new competitors entering into our business segment or existing competitors growing their operations. If customer demand for lower-margin products increases and\ndemand for higher-margin products decreases, our business, results of operations and financial condition may suffer.\n21\nBecause a material portion of our revenues are derived from sales to consumers indirectly through third-party retailers who operate traditional brick-and-mortar locations,\nthe shift of sales to more online retail business could harm our market share and our revenues in certain sectors.\nOur current model for consumer goods includes selling our products through third-party retailers. These third-party retailers operate physical brick-and-mortar\nlocations to sell our product to consumers. The current shift in purchasing demographics due to many factors and the changing preferences of consumers who are moving from\nin-store purchases to online purchases creates the additional risks of our current revenue streams being impacted negatively and an overall decrease of market share.\nWe have experienced and may continue to experience difficulty collecting receivables.\nIf our customers begin or continue to experience financial challenges, they may not have sufficient funds to pay all amounts owed to us. Additionally, laws in some\njurisdictions in which we operate make collection of receivables difficult, time consuming or expensive. We generally do not require collateral in support of our trade\nreceivables. While we maintain reserves for expected credit losses, we cannot assure these reserves will be sufficient to meet write-offs of uncollectible receivables or that our\nlosses from such receivables will be consistent with our historical performance. Significant write-offs may affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. As\nwe begin selling our products indirectly through large retailers, customer credit risks will expand.\nOur ability to distribute certain licensed brands and to use or license certain trademarks may be terminated or not renewed.\nWe are reliant upon brand recognition in the markets in which we compete, as the industry is characterized by a high degree of brand loyalty and a reluctance of\nconsumers to switch to substitute or unrecognizable brands. Some of the brands we distribute and the trademarks under which products are sold are licensed for a fixed period\nof time with regard to specified markets.\nIn the event that the licenses to use the brand names and trademarks for the products we distribute are terminated or are not renewed after the end of the term, there is\nno guarantee we or our suppliers will be able to find suitable replacement brands or trademarks, or that if a replacement is found, that it will be on favorable terms. Any loss in\nbrand-name appeal to our existing customers as a result of the lapse or termination of our licenses or the licenses of our suppliers could have a material adverse effect on our\nbusiness, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe may not be successful in maintaining the consumer brand recognition and loyalty of our products.\nWe compete in a market that relies on innovation and the ability to react to evolving consumer preferences. The vaporization products and consumption accessories\nindustry is subject to changing consumer trends, demands and preferences. Therefore, products once favored may, over time, become disfavored by consumers or no longer\nperceived as the best option. Consumers in the vaporizer market have demonstrated a degree of brand loyalty, but suppliers must continue to adapt their products in order to\nmaintain their status among customers as the market evolves. Our continued success depends in part on our ability and our supplier’s ability to continue to differentiate the\nbrand names we represent, own or license and maintain similarly high levels of recognition with target consumers. Trends within the vaporization products and consumption\naccessories industry change often and our failure to anticipate, identify or react to changes in these trends could, among other things, lead to reduced demand for our products.\nFactors that have previously and may continue to affect consumer perception of our products include health trends and attention to health concerns associated with herbs, oils,\ncannabis or other materials used with vaporizers, price-sensitivity in the presence of competitors’ products or substitute products and trends in favor of new vaporization\nproducts or technology consumption accessories products that are currently being researched and produced by participants in our industry. For example, in recent years, we\nhave witnessed a shift in consumer purchases from vaporizers designed for dry herbs to those designed for liquids or wax type concentrates. A failure to react to similar trends\nin the future could enable our competitors to grow or establish their brands’ market share in these categories before we have a chance to respond.\nRegulations have recently been and are likely to continue to be enacted in the future that would make it more difficult to appeal to consumers or to leverage the brands\nthat we distribute, own or license. Furthermore, even if we are able to continue to distinguish our products, there can be no assurance that the sales, marketing and distribution\nefforts of our competitors will not be successful in persuading consumers of our products to switch to their products. Some of our competitors have greater access to resources\nthan we do, which better positions them to conduct market research in relation to branding strategies or costly marketing campaigns. Any loss of consumer brand loyalty to our\nproducts or in our ability to effectively brand our products in a recognizable way will have a material effect on our ability to continue to sell our products and maintain our\nmarket share, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\n22\nWe may not be able to establish sustainable relationships with large retailers or regional or national chains.\nIn connection with efforts to enter new sales channels, including large retailers and chains, we may not be able to develop these relationships or continue to maintain\nrelationships with these large retailers or national chains. Our inability to develop and sustain relationships with large retailers and chains may impede our ability to develop\nbrand and product recognition and increase sales volume and, ultimately, require us to continue to rely on local and more fragmented sales channels, which may have a material\nadverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. In addition, if we are unable to develop or maintain relationships with large retailers and national\nchains and such large retailers or chains take market share from the smaller local and more fragmented sales channels, our business, results of operations and financial condition\nwill be adversely impacted.\nNew products face intense media attention and public pressure.\nMany of our vaporizers and other products are new to the marketplace. Since their introduction, certain members of the media, politicians, government regulators and\nadvocacy groups, including independent doctors, have called for and driven the adoption of stringent regulation of the sale of certain products and in some cases, an outright\nban of such products pending increased regulatory review and a further demonstration of safety. For example, local and state governments have banned certain types of\nvaporization products, such as those containing flavored liquid nicotine and flavored hemp-derived CBD. Additional bans of this type would likely have the effect of\nterminating our sales and marketing efforts of certain products in jurisdictions in which we may currently market or have plans to market such products. Such bans would also\nlikely cause public confusion as to which products are the subject of bans, which confusion could also have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and\nfinancial condition.\nOur success depends, in part, on the quality and safety of our products, as well as the perception of quality and safety in the vaporization products and consumption\naccessories industry generally.\nOur success depends, in part, on the quality and safety of the products we sell, including manufacturing issues, health concerns about the substances consumed using\nthe products we sell, and unforeseen product misuse. Even a single incident of product defect or misuse, whether relating to products sold by us or just to our industry generally,\ncould result in significant harm to our reputation. For example, incidents of EVALI have, by some metrics, negatively impacted demand for vaporizers. If any of our products\nare found to be, or are perceived to be, defective or unsafe, or if they otherwise fail to meet our customers’ standards, our relationship with our customers could suffer, our\nreputation or the appeal of our brands could be diminished, and we could lose market share and/or become subject to liability claims, any of which could result in a material\nadverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nDamage to our reputation, or that of any of our key suppliers or their brands, could affect our business performance.\nThe success of our business depends in part upon the positive image that consumers have of the third-party brands we distribute. Incidents, publicity or events arising\naccidentally or through deliberate third-party action that harm the integrity or consumer support of the products we sell could affect the demand for those products. Unfavorable\nmedia, whether accurate or not, related to our industry, to us, to our customers, or to the products we sell could negatively affect our corporate reputation, stock price, ability to\nattract high-quality talent, or the performance of our business. Additional negative publicity or commentary on social media outlets also could cause consumers to react rapidly\nby avoiding our products and brands or by choosing brands offered by our competitors, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and\nfinancial condition.\nWe are subject to substantial and increasing regulation regarding the vaporization industry.\nIn addition to the FDA regulations concerning vaporizer products discussed elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we are subject to regulation by numerous\nother federal agencies, including the Federal Trade Commission, the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau, the Federal Communications Commission, the U.S.\nEnvironmental Protection Agency, the U.S. Department of Agriculture, U.S. Customs and Border Protection and the U.S. Center for Disease Control and Prevention’s Office on\nSmoking and Health. There have also been adverse legislative and political decisions and other unfavorable developments concerning cigarette smoking and the tobacco\nindustry, which have received widespread public attention. There can be no assurance as to the ultimate content, timing or effect of any regulation of vaporizer products by\ngovernmental bodies, nor can there be any assurance that potential corresponding declines in demand resulting from negative media attention would not have a material adverse\neffect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\n23\nSignificant increases in state and local regulation of our vaporizer products have been proposed and enacted, and are likely to continue to be proposed and enacted in\nnumerous jurisdictions.\nAs discussed under the heading “Regulatory Developments” above, there has been increasing activity on the state, provincial and local levels with respect to scrutiny\nof vaporizer products. State and local governmental bodies across the United States have indicated that vaporization products and certain other consumption accessories may\nbecome subject to new laws and regulations at the state and local levels. For example, in January 2015, the California Department of Health declared electronic cigarettes and\ncertain other vaporizer products a health threat that should be strictly regulated like tobacco products. Further, many states and cities have enacted regulations that require\nretailers to obtain a tobacco retail license in order to sell electronic cigarettes and vaporizer products. Many states, provinces and some cities have passed laws restricting the\nsale of electronic cigarettes and certain other vaporizer products. In March 2023, new federal legislation granted the FDA regulatory authority over synthetic nicotine, making\nall synthetic nicotine products without a marketing order from the FDA illegal as of July 13th, 2022. If one or more states or provinces from which we generate or anticipate\ngenerating significant sales of vaporizer products bring actions that prevent us from selling certain or all of our vaporizer products, we would be required to cease sales and\ndistribution of certain products to those states, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Additionally, if one or\nmore states or provinces from which we generate or anticipate generating significant sales of vaporizer products bring actions that require us to obtain certain licenses,\napprovals or permits, and if we are not able to obtain the necessary licenses, approvals or permits for financial reasons or otherwise and/or any such license, approval or permit\nis determined to be overly burdensome to us, then we may be required to cease sales and distribution of our products to those states, which could have a material adverse effect\non our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nCertain states, provinces and cities have already restricted the use of electronic cigarettes and vaporizer products in smoke free venues. Additional city, state, provincial\nor federal regulators, municipalities, local governments and private industry may enact rules and regulations restricting the use of electronic cigarettes and vaporizer products in\nthose same places where cigarettes cannot be smoked. Because of these restrictions, our customers may reduce or otherwise cease using our vaporization products or certain\nother consumption accessories, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe Canadian federal government, as well as certain provincial governments have passed or propose to pass legislation which will restrict the extent to which e-\ncigarettes, e-liquid and other vaping products may be displayed or sold. Additionally, Canadian laws require health warnings to be placed on certain vaporizer products, which\ncould reduce the appeal of these products. These regulations and future regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial\ncondition.\nBased on regulations surrounding health-related concerns related to the use of some of our vaporizer products, possible new or increased taxes by government entities\nintended to reduce use of our products or to raise revenue, additional governmental regulations concerning the marketing, labeling, packaging or sale of some of our products,\nnegative publicity resulting from actual or threatened legal actions against us or other companies in our industry, all may reduce demand for, or increase the cost of, certain of\nour products, which could adversely affect our profitability and ultimate success.\nOur business depends partly on continued purchases by businesses and individuals selling or using cannabis pursuant to state laws in the United States or Canadian and\nprovincial laws.\nBecause some of our B2C customers use some of the items that we sell to consume cannabis and some of our B2B customers operate in the legal national and state\ncannabis industry, our business depends partly on federal, state, provincial and local laws, regulations, guidelines and enforcement pertaining to cannabis. In both the United\nStates and Canada, those factors are in flux.\nUnited States\nCurrently, in the United States, 47 states and the District of Columbia permit some form of cannabis cultivation, sales, and use for certain medical purposes (“medical\nstates”). Twenty-four of those states and the District of Columbia have also legalized cannabis for adults for non-medical purposes (sometime referred to as recreational use).\nSeveral medical states may extend legalization to adult use.\nStates’ cannabis programs have proliferated and grown even though the cultivation, sale and possession of cannabis is considered illegal under U.S. federal law. Under\nthe CSA, cannabis is a Schedule I drug, meaning that the Drug Enforcement Administration recognizes no accepted medical use for cannabis, and the substance is considered\nillegal under federal law.\nIn an effort to provide guidance to U.S. Attorneys’ offices regarding the enforcement priorities associated with cannabis in the United States, the U.S. Department of\nJustice (the “DOJ”) has issued a series of memoranda detailing its suggested enforcement approach. During the administration of former President Obama, each memorandum\nacknowledged the DOJ’s authority to enforce the CSA in the face of state laws, but noted that the DOJ was more committed to using its limited investigative and prosecutorial\nresources to address the most significant threats associated with cannabis in the most effective, consistent, and rational way.\n24\nOn August 29, 2013, the DOJ issued what came to be called the “Cole Memorandum,” which gave U.S. Attorneys the discretion not to prosecute federal cannabis\ncases that were otherwise compliant with applicable state law that had legalized medical or adult-use cannabis and that have implemented strong regulatory systems to control\nthe cultivation, production, and distribution of cannabis. The eight federal priorities were preventing:\n● The distribution of cannabis to minors;\n● Revenue from the sale of cannabis from going to criminal enterprises, gangs, and cartels;\n● The diversion of cannabis from states where it is legal under state law in some form to other states;\n● State-authorized cannabis activities from being used as a cover or pretext for the trafficking of other illegal drugs or other illegal activity;\n● Violence and the use of firearms in the cultivation and distribution of cannabis;\n● Drugged driving and exacerbation of other adverse public health consequences associated with cannabis use;\n● Growing cannabis on public lands and the attendant public safety and environmental dangers posed by cannabis production on public lands; and\n● Cannabis possession or use on federal property.\nAccordingly, the Cole Memorandum provided lawful cannabis-related enterprises a tacit federal go-ahead in states with legal cannabis programs, provided that the\nstate had adopted and was enforcing strict regulations and oversight of the medical or adult-use cannabis program in accordance with the specific directives of the Cole\nMemorandum.\nOn January 4, 2018, Attorney General Jeff Sessions issued a memorandum that rescinded previous DOJ guidance on the state legal cannabis industry, including the\nCole Memorandum. Attorney General Sessions wrote that the previous guidance on cannabis law enforcement was unnecessary, given the well-established principles governing\nfederal prosecution that are already in place. As a result, federal prosecutors could and still can use their prosecutorial discretion to decide whether to prosecute even state-legal\ncannabis activities.\nSince the Cole Memorandum was rescinded, however, U.S. Attorneys have generally refrained from prosecuting state law compliant marijuana businesses. Current\nAttorney General Merrick Garland during his confirmation hearings expressed that “It does not seem to me useful the use of limited resources that we have to be pursuing\nprosecutions in states that have legalized and are regulating the use of marijuana, either medically or otherwise.”\nSince December 2014, companies that are strictly complying with state medical cannabis laws have been protected against enforcement for that activity by an\namendment (originally called the Rohrabacher-Blumenauer Amendment, now called the Joyce Amendment) to the Omnibus Spending Bill, which prevents federal prosecutors\nfrom using federal funds to impede the implementation of medical cannabis laws enacted at the state level. Federal courts have interpreted the provision to bar the DOJ from\nprosecuting any person or entity in strict compliance with state medical cannabis laws.\nWhile the protection of the Joyce Amendment prevents prosecutions of state law compliant medical cannabis activities, it does not make cannabis legal. The protection\nof the Joyce Amendment depends on its continued inclusion in the federal omnibus spending bill, or in some other legislation, and entities’ strict compliance with the state\nmedical cannabis laws. While industry observers expect Congress to extend the protection in future Omnibus Spending Bills, there can be no assurance that it will do so.\nAlthough several cannabis law reform bills are pending in the U.S. Congress, passage of any of them and ultimately the Biden Administration’s support and approval\nremain uncertain. Unless and until the U.S. Government changes the law with respect to cannabis, and particularly if Congress does not extend the protection of state medical\ncannabis programs, there is a risk that federal authorities could enforce current federal cannabis law. An increase in federal enforcement against companies licensed under state\ncannabis laws would negatively impact the state cannabis industries and, in turn, our revenues, profits, financial condition, and business model.\nCanada\nOn April 13, 2017, the Government of Canada introduced Bill C-45, which proposed the enactment of the Cannabis Act to legalize and regulate access to cannabis.\nThe Cannabis Act proposed a strict legal framework for controlling the production, distribution, sale and possession of medical and recreational adult-use cannabis in Canada.\nOn June 21, 2018, the Government of Canada announced that Bill C-45, received Royal Assent. On July 11, 2018, the Government of Canada published the Cannabis\nRegulations under the Cannabis Act. The Cannabis Regulations provide more detail on the medical and recreational regulatory regimes for cannabis, including regarding\nlicensing, physical security requirements, product practices, outdoor growing, security, packaging and labelling (including for cannabis accessories), cannabis-containing drugs,\ndocument retention requirements, reporting and disclosure requirements, the new access to cannabis for medical purposes regime and industrial hemp. The majority of the\nCannabis Act and the Cannabis Regulations came into force on October 17, 2018; additional Cannabis Regulations took effect on October 17, 2019.\n25\nAs of December 2022, the Minister of Health and the Minister of Mental Health and Addictions has launched the legislative review of the Cannabis Act. The review is\nbeing conducted by a five-member independent, expert panel, who will report their final conclusions and advice to the Ministers by Spring 2024. In addition, Health Canada\nannounced that amendments to the Cannabis Act and its regulations concerning cannabis research and testing. Notably, these amendments increase the public possession limit\nfor cannabis beverages to a level that is similar to other forms of cannabis, such as solid edible cannabis products (i.e. gummies or chocolate) and the amendments change how\nHealth Canada regulates non-therapeutic cannabis research with human participants. As for proposed amendments, Health Canada is proposing amendments to the Cannabis\nRegulations to protect public health and safety, in particular by protecting young persons and others from inducements to use inhaled cannabis extracts. The proposed\namendments would restrict the production, sale, promotion, packaging, or labelling of inhaled cannabis extracts with certain flavors, other than the flavor of cannabis.\nWhile the Cannabis Act provides for the regulation by the federal government of, among other things, the commercial cultivation and processing of cannabis for\nrecreational purposes, it provides the provinces and territories of Canada with the authority to regulate with respect to the other aspects of recreational cannabis, such as\ndistribution, sale, minimum age requirements, places where cannabis can be consumed, and a range of other matters.\nThe governments of every Canadian province and territory have implemented regulatory regimes for the distribution and sale of cannabis for recreational purposes. In\nmost provinces and territories, the minimum age is 19 years old, except for Québec, where the minimum age is 18. Certain provinces, such as Ontario, have legislation in place\nthat restricts the packaging of vapor products and the manner in which vapor products are displayed or promoted in stores.\nThe Cannabis Act is a relatively new regime that has no close precedent in Canadian law. The effect of relevant governmental authorities’ administration, application\nand enforcement of their respective regulatory regimes and delays in obtaining, or failure to obtain, applicable regulatory approvals which may be required may significantly\ndelay or impact the development of markets, products and sales initiatives and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of\noperations.\nThe federal and state regulatory landscape regarding products containing hemp-derived CBD and other cannabinoids is uncertain and evolving, and new or changing laws\nor regulations relating to hemp and hemp-derived products could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn December 2018, the U.S. government changed the legal status of hemp and its derivatives, including hemp-derived CBD and other cannabinoids. The 2018 Farm\nBill, which was signed into law by former President Trump on December 20, 2018 (Pub.L. 115-334), established a new framework for the regulation of hemp production\n(defined in the Farm Bill as Cannabis sativa L. with a THC concentration of not more than 0.3 percent on a dry weight basis) and extracts of hemp, including CBD. The law\nalso removed hemp and extracts of hemp from the federal controlled substances schedules. The section of the Farm Bill establishing a framework for hemp production,\nhowever, makes clear explicitly that it does not affect or modify the United States Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the “FDCA”), section 351 of the Public Health\nService Act (addressing the regulation of biological products), the authority of the Commissioner of the FDA under those laws, or the Commissioner’s authority to regulate\nhemp production and sale under those laws.\nSince passage of the Farm Bill, the FDA has expressed multiple times its position that any cannabis product, whether derived from hemp or otherwise, marketed with a\ndisease claim (e.g., a claim of therapeutic benefit or disease prevention) must be approved by the FDA for its intended use through one of the drug approval pathways prior to it\nbeing introduced into interstate commerce. The FDA has also repeatedly stated its position that introducing food or dietary supplements with added CBD (or THC), regardless\nof source, into interstate commerce is illegal under the FDCA. Although enforcement under the FDCA may be civil or criminal in nature, the FDA has thus far limited its recent\nenforcement against companies selling CBD products to warning letters alleging various violations of the FDCA, including that the products bear claims that render the\nproducts unapproved and misbranded new drugs, that CBD is excluded from the FDCA’s definition of “dietary supplement,” and that the FDCA prohibits the addition of CBD\nto food. The FDA also tested some of the products, and found that many did not contain the levels of CBD they claimed to contain, which could be the basis for a separate\nviolation of the FDCA. In addition, some states have taken actions to restrict or prohibit the sale of CBD products under state law. On January 26, 2023, the FDA issued a\nstatement that after careful review, the FDA concluded that a new regulatory pathway for CBD is needed that balances individuals’ desire for access to CBD products with the\nregulatory oversight needed to manage risks. The agency is prepared to work with Congress on this matter.\n26\nWe currently distribute very limited products containing hemp-derived CBD and other cannabinoids. Although the Farm Bill removed hemp and its derivatives from\nthe definition of “marijuana” under the CSA, uncertainties remain regarding the cultivation, sourcing, production and distribution of hemp and products containing hemp\nderivatives. Certain states prohibit the sale of all or certain types of products containing hemp. The laws and regulations of states that permit the sale of products containing\nhemp derivatives, such as CBD, impose various requirements, including requirements to obtain certain permits or licenses, related to the marketing, packaging, safety, and sale\nof products containing hemp derivatives. These laws and regulations are rapidly developing. We may have to quickly adapt our operations to comply with forthcoming and\nrapidly-shifting federal and state regulations. These regulations could require significant changes to our business, plans or operations concerning hemp-derived products, and\ncould adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. Additionally, while we believe our current operations with respect to hemp derived products\nsuch as CBD comply with existing federal and state laws relating to hemp and hemp-derived products in all material respects, legal proceedings alleging violations of such laws\ncould have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are subject to legislative uncertainty that could slow or halt the legalization and use of cannabis, which could materially and adversely affect our business.\nContinued development of the cannabis industry is dependent upon continued legislative authorization of cannabis at the state level, as well as the U.S. government’s\ncontinued non-enforcement of federal cannabis laws against state-law-compliant cannabis businesses. Any number of factors could slow or halt progress in this area. Further,\nprogress, while generally expected, is not assured. Well-funded interests, including businesses in the tobacco, alcohol beverage and the pharmaceutical industries, may have a\nstrong economic opposition to the continued legalization of cannabis. The pharmaceutical industry, for example, is well funded with a strong and experienced lobby that\neclipses the funding of the cannabis movement. Any inroads legalization opponents could make in halting the impending cannabis industry could have a detrimental impact on\nour business. While there may be ample public support for legislative action, numerous factors impact the legislative process. Any one of those factors could slow or halt the\ncontinued legalization and use of cannabis, which would negatively impact our business.\nWhile we believe that our business and sales do not violate the Federal Paraphernalia Law, legal proceedings alleging violations of such law or changes in such law or\ninterpretations thereof could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nUnder U.S. Code Title 21 Section 863 (the “Federal Paraphernalia Law”), the term “drug paraphernalia” means “any equipment, product or material of any kind which\nis primarily intended or designed for use in manufacturing, compounding, converting, concealing, producing, processing, preparing, injecting, ingesting, inhaling, or otherwise\nintroducing into the human body a controlled substance.” That law exempts “(1) any person authorized by local, State, or Federal law to manufacture, possess, or distribute\nsuch items” and “(2) any item that, in the normal lawful course of business, is imported, exported, transported, or sold through the mail or by any other means, and traditionally\nintended for use with tobacco products, including any pipe, paper, or accessory.” Any nonexempt drug paraphernalia offered or sold by any person in violation of the Federal\nParaphernalia Law can be subject to seizure and forfeiture upon the conviction of such person for such violation, and a convicted person can be subject to fines under the\nFederal Paraphernalia Law and even imprisonment.\nWe believe our sales do not violate the Federal Paraphernalia Law in any material respect. First, we understand that a substantial majority of the products we offer and\nsell were and are not primarily intended or designed for any purpose not permitted by the Federal Paraphernalia Law. Indeed, many of the manufacturers whose products we\nsell disclaim that the products are for use with cannabis. Second, we restrict the sale of certain products — those that may have been primarily intended or designed for use with\ncannabis — to comply with the Federal Paraphernalia Law’s exemption for sales authorized by state law. In particular, we (a) do not sell those products at all into the states that\nhave maintained complete or near complete cannabis prohibition and (b) limit the sale of those products to licensed cannabis businesses, such as dispensaries, cultivators, and\nmanufacturers, in the states that authorize sales of cannabis paraphernalia only through state-licensed cannabis businesses. Third, we have been in business for many years\nwithout facing even threatened legal action under the Federal Paraphernalia Law.\nWhile we believe that our business and sales are legally compliant with the Federal Paraphernalia Law in all material respects, any legal action commenced against us\nunder such law could result in substantial costs and could have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations. In addition, changes in cannabis\nlaws or interpretations of such laws are difficult to predict, and could materially and adversely affect our business.\n27\nOfficials of the U.S. Customs and Border Protection agency (“CBP”) have broad discretion regarding products imported into the United States, and the CBP has on\noccasion seized imported products on the basis that such products violate the Federal Paraphernalia Law. While we believe the products that we import do not violate such\nlaw, any such seizure of the products we sell could have a material adverse effect on our business operations or our results of operations.\nOfficials of the CBP have broad discretion regarding products imported into the United States. Individual shipments of imported products we distribute, as well as\nsimilar products, have been detained or seized by the CBP for a variety of reasons, including because the CBP officials inspecting the goods believed such goods were marketed\nas drug paraphernalia and therefore violated the Federal Paraphernalia Law. Although we and other suppliers or distributors of such products have at times successfully\ncontested such actions of the CBP, such challenges are costly and time consuming. While we would disagree with any conclusion of the CBP that our product sales violate the\nFederal Paraphernalia Law, we cannot give any assurance that the CBP will not make additional seizures of our imports, or that if the CBP seizes any of our goods that the CBP\nwould not seek to impose penalties related to such imports. Should we elect to contest any such seizure, the costs of doing so could be substantial and there are no assurances\nwe would prevail in a contested proceeding. Additionally, the cost and/or results of any such contest could adversely impact our business, financial condition or results of\noperations. Additionally, if the CBP fails to release seized products, we may no longer be able to ensure a sellable supply of some of our products, which could have a material\nadverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nBecause our business is dependent, in part, upon continued market acceptance of cannabis by consumers, any negative trends could materially and adversely affect our\nbusiness, financial conditions or results of operations.\nWe are dependent on public support, continued market acceptance and the proliferation of consumers in the legal cannabis markets. While we believe that the market\nand opportunity in the space continue to grow, we cannot predict the future growth rate or size of the market. Any downturns in, or negative outlooks on, the cannabis industry\nmay materially and adversely affect our business and financial condition.\nWe and our customers may have difficulty accessing the service of banks, which may make it difficult for us and for them to sell our products.\nFinancial transactions involving proceeds generated by cannabis-related activities can form the basis for prosecution under the U.S. federal money laundering statutes,\nunlicensed money transmitter statutes and the U.S. Bank Secrecy Act. Guidance issued by the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (“FinCEN”) clarifies how financial\ninstitutions can provide services to cannabis-related businesses consistent with their obligations under the Bank Secrecy Act. Furthermore, since the rescission by former U.S.\nAttorney General Jeff Sessions on January 4, 2018 of the Cole Memorandum, U.S. federal prosecutors have had greater discretion when determining whether to charge\ninstitutions or individuals with any of the financial crimes described above based upon cannabis-related activity. As a result, given these risks and their own related disclosure\nrequirements, many banks remain hesitant to offer banking services to cannabis-related businesses. Consequently, those businesses involved in the cannabis industry continue\nto encounter difficulty establishing banking relationships. Indeed, we have been asked to close bank accounts due to our activity in the cannabis industry. We may become\nunable maintain stable banking relationships, which would create significant challenges in operating our business, increase our operating costs, pose additional operational,\nlogistical and security challenges, and result in our inability to implement our business plan. Additionally, if our more significant customers to are unable maintain their current\nbanking relationships, we might not be able to continue transacting with such customers.\nOur payments system and the payment systems of our customers depend on third-party providers and are subject to evolving laws and regulations.\nWe and our retail customers have engaged third-party service providers to perform underlying credit and debit card processing, currency exchange, identity\nverification and fraud analysis services. If these service providers do not perform adequately or if our relationships, or the relationships of our retail customers with these\nservice providers, were to terminate, our ability or the ability of such retail customers to process payments could be adversely affected and our business would be harmed.\nThe laws and regulations related to payments are complex and are potentially impacted by tensions between federal and state treatment of the vaporization, tobacco,\nnicotine and cannabis industries. These laws and regulations also vary across different jurisdictions in the United States, Canada and globally. As a result, we are required to\nspend significant time and effort to comply with those laws and regulations. Any failure or claim of our failure to comply, or any failure by our third-party service providers to\ncomply, could cost us substantial resources, could result in liabilities, or could force us to stop offering our customers the ability to pay with credit cards, debit cards and bank\ntransfers. As we expand the availability of these payment methods or offer new payment methods to our customers in the future, we may become subject to additional\nregulations and compliance requirements.\nFurther, through our agreement with our third-party credit card processors, we are indirectly subject to payment card association operating rules and certification\nrequirements, including restrictions on product mix and the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard, 02 PCIDSS. We also are subject to rules governing electronic funds\ntransfers. Any change in these rules and requirements could make it difficult or impossible for us to comply.\nDue to our acceptance of credit cards in our e-commerce business, we are subject to the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard, designed to protect the\ninformation of credit card users. We have had a security incident in the past, which we do not believe reached the level of a breach, that would be reportable under state laws or\nour other obligations; however there can be no assurance that our determination was correct. In the event our determination is challenged and found to have been incorrect, we\nmay be subject to claims by one or more state attorney generals, federal regulators, or private plaintiffs and we may additionally be subject to claims or fines from credit\nassociations.\n28\nWe are subject to certain U.S. federal regulations relating to cash reporting.\nThe U.S. Bank Secrecy Act, enforced by FinCEN, a division of the U.S. Department of the Treasury, requires a party in trade or business to file with the U.S. Internal\nRevenue Service (the “IRS”) a Form 8300 report within 15 days of receiving a cash payment of over $10,000. While we receive very few cash payments for the products we\nsell, if we fail to comply with these laws and regulations, the imposition of a substantial penalty could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and\nfinancial condition.\nIf countries, states, and provinces continue the trend of imposing, expanding, and increasing taxes on vaporizer products, it could materially and adversely affect our\nbusiness.\nSupply to our customers is sensitive to increased sales taxes and economic conditions affecting their disposable income. Discretionary consumer purchases, such as of\nvaporization products and consumption accessories, may decline during recessionary periods or at other times when disposable income is lower and taxes may be higher.\nAs discussed under “Regulatory Developments” above, the sale of vaporization products and certain other consumption accessories is, in certain jurisdictions, subject\nto federal, state, provincial and local excise taxes like the sale of conventional cigarettes or other tobacco products, all of which generally have high tax rates and have faced\nsignificant increases in the amount of taxes collected on their sales. Other jurisdictions are contemplating similar legislation and other restrictions on electronic cigarettes and\ncertain other vaporizer products. Should federal, state, provincial and local governments and/or other taxing authorities continue to impose excise taxes similar to those levied\nagainst conventional cigarettes and tobacco products on vaporization products or consumption accessories, it may have a material adverse effect on the demand for those\nproducts, as consumers may be unwilling to pay the increased costs, which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial\ncondition.\nWe could be required to collect additional sales taxes or be subject to other tax liabilities that may increase the costs our B2C customers would have to pay for our product\noffering, which could materially and adversely affect our operating results.\nAn increasing number of states have considered or adopted laws that attempt to impose tax collection obligations on out-of-state companies. Additionally, the Supreme\nCourt of the United States ruled in South Dakota v. Wayfair, Inc. et al, or Wayfair, that online sellers can be required to collect sales and use tax despite not having a physical\npresence in the buyer’s state. In response to Wayfair, or otherwise, states or local governments may adopt, or begin to enforce, laws requiring us to calculate, collect, and remit\ntaxes on sales in their jurisdictions. A successful assertion by one or more states requiring us to collect taxes where we presently do not do so, or to collect more taxes in a\njurisdiction in which we currently do collect some taxes, could result in substantial tax liabilities, including taxes on past sales, as well as penalties and interest. The imposition\nby state governments or local governments of sales tax collection obligations on out-of-state sellers could also create additional administrative burdens for us, put us at a\ncompetitive disadvantage if they do not impose similar obligations on our competitors and decrease our future sales, which could have a material adverse impact on our\nbusiness, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may become involved in regulatory or agency proceedings, investigations, prosecutions, and audits.\nOur business, and the businesses of the suppliers from which we acquire products we sell, requires compliance with many laws and regulations in many jurisdictions\nglobally across multiple product categories and regulatory regimes. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations could subject us or such suppliers to regulatory or agency\nproceedings, investigations, or prosecutions, and could also lead to damage awards, fines and penalties. We or such suppliers may become involved in a number of government\nproceedings, investigations and audits. The outcome of any government proceedings, investigations, prosecutions, audits, and other contingencies could harm our reputation or\nthe reputations of the brands that we sell, require us to take, or refrain from taking, actions that could harm our operations or require us to pay substantial amounts of money,\nharming our financial condition. There can be no assurance that any pending or future regulatory or agency proceedings, investigations and audits will not result in substantial\ncosts or a diversion of management’s attention and resources or have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are subject to increasing international control and regulation.\nThe World Health Organization’s Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (“FCTC”) is the first international public health treaty that establishes a global agenda to\nreduce initiation of tobacco use and regulate tobacco in an effort to encourage tobacco cessation. Over 180 governments worldwide have ratified the FCTC, including Canada.\nThe FCTC has led to increased efforts to reduce the supply of and demand for tobacco products and to encourage governments to further regulate the tobacco industry. The\ntobacco industry and others expect significant regulatory developments to take place over the next few years, driven principally by the FCTC.\n29\nIf the United States ratifies the FCTC and/or national laws are enacted in the United States that reflect the major elements of the FCTC, our business, results of\noperations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected. In addition, if any of our vaporization products or consumption accessories become subject to one\nor more of the significant regulatory initiatives proposed under the FCTC or any other international treaty, our business, results of operations and financial condition may also\nbe materially adversely affected.\nCountries’ laws implementing the European Union Tobacco Products Directive (“TPD”) impose strict regulations on the approval, sale, and advertising of e-cigarettes.\nAlthough we do not sell or market any material quantities of products classified as e-cigarettes in Europe, countries could enact new laws implementing the TPD or other laws\nor regulations that re-classify and/or restrict the products we may sell or market in Europe. Any future measures that limit our ability to market or sell vaporization products or\nother consumption accessories in Europe may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nTo the extent our existing or future products become subject to international regulatory regimes that we are unable to comply with or fail to comply with, they may\nhave a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nChanges in our credit profile may affect our relationship with our suppliers, which could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity.\nChanges in our credit profile may affect the way our suppliers view our ability to make payments and may induce them to shorten the payment terms of their invoices.\nGiven the large dollar amounts and volume of our purchases from suppliers, a change in payment terms may have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and our ability to\nmake payments to our suppliers and, consequently, may have a material adverse effect on us.\nWe face intense competition and may fail to compete effectively.\nThe vaporization products and consumption accessories industry is characterized by brand recognition and loyalty, with product quality features, price, marketing and\npackaging constituting the primary methods of competition. Substantial marketing support, merchandising display, competitive pricing and other financial incentives generally\nare required to introduce a new brand or to improve or maintain a brand’s market position. Our principal competitors may be significantly larger than us and aggressively seek\nto limit the distribution or sale of our products.\nCompetition in the vaporization products and consumption accessories industry is particularly intense, and the market is highly fragmented.\nWe experience variability in our net sales and net income on a quarterly basis as a result of many factors.\nWe experience variability in our net sales and net income on a quarterly basis as a result of many factors. These factors include:\n● the relative mix of vaporization products and consumption accessories sold during the period;\n● the general economic environment and competitive conditions, such as pricing;\n● the timing of procurement cycles by our customers;\n● seasonality in customer spending and demand for products we provide;\n30\n● variability in supplier programs;\n● the introduction of new and upgraded products;\n● changes in prices from our suppliers;\n● changes to our strategy;\n● trade show attendance;\n● promotions;\n● the loss or consolidation of significant suppliers or customers;\n● our ability to control costs;\n● the timing of our capital expenditures;\n● the condition of our industry in general and our customers specifically;\n● regulatory developments that limit or expand the products we may sell, or the manner in which those products may be transported;\n● any inability on our part to obtain adequate quantities of products;\n● delays in the release by suppliers of new products and inventory adjustments;\n● delays in the release of imported products by customs authorities;\n● our expenditures on new business ventures and acquisitions;\n● performance of acquired businesses;\n● adverse weather conditions, natural disasters, pandemics, or other events that affect supply or customer response;\n● distribution or shipping to our customers; and\n● geopolitical events.\nOur planned operating expenditures each quarter are based on sales forecasts for the quarter. If our sales do not meet expectations in any given quarter, our operating\nresults for that quarter may be materially adversely affected. We believe that period-to-period comparisons of our operating results are not necessarily a good indication of our\nfuture performance. In addition, our results in any quarterly period are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected for a full fiscal year. In future quarters, our operating\nresults may be below the expectations of public market analysts or investors and, as a result, the market price of our Class A common stock could be materially adversely\naffected.\nProduct defects could increase our expenses, damage our reputation or expose us to liability.\nWe may not be able to adequately address product defects. Product defects in vaporizers and other accessories may harm the health or safety of our end-consumers. In\naddition, remedial efforts could be particularly time-consuming and expensive if product defects are only found after we have sold the defective product in volume. Any actual\nor perceived defects in our products could result in unsold inventory, product recalls, repairs or replacements, damage to our reputation, increased customer service costs and\nother expenses, as well as divert management attention and expose us to liabilities. Furthermore, a product liability claim brought against us by our customers or end-consumers\ncould be time-consuming and costly to defend and, if successful, could require us to make significant payments.\nContamination of, or damage to, our products could adversely impact sales volume, market share and profitability.\nOur market position may be affected through the contamination of our products, as well as the material used during the manufacturing processes of the products we\nsell, or at different points in the entire supply chain. For example, we have previously detected low levels of contaminants in certain extraction gasses sold by us. We keep\nsignificant amounts of inventory of our products in warehouses and it is possible that this inventory could become contaminated prior to arrival at our premises or during the\nstorage period. If contamination of our inventory or packaged products occurs, whether as a result of a failure in quality control by us or by one of our suppliers, we may incur\nsignificant costs in replacing the inventory and recalling products. We may be unable to meet customer demand and may lose customers who purchase alternative brands or\nproducts. In addition, consumers may lose confidence in the affected product.\nUnder the terms of our contracts, we generally impose requirements on our suppliers to maintain quality and comply with product specifications and requirements, and\nwith all federal, state and local laws. Our suppliers, however, may not continue to produce products that are consistent with our standards or that are in compliance with\napplicable laws, and we cannot guarantee that we will be able to identify instances in which our suppliers fail to comply with our standards or applicable laws. A loss of sales\nvolume from a contamination event may occur, and such a loss may affect our ability to supply our current customers and to recapture their business in the event they are forced\nto switch products or brands, even if on a temporary basis. We may also be subject to legal action as a result of a contamination, which could result in negative publicity and\naffect our sales. During this time, our competitors may benefit from an increased market share that could be difficult and costly to regain. Such a contamination event could\nhave a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\n31\nWe may not have adequate insurance for potential liabilities, including liabilities arising from litigation.\nIn the ordinary course of business, we have and in the future may become the subject of various claims, lawsuits and governmental proceedings seeking damages or\nother remedies concerning our commercial operations, the products we distribute, our employees and other matters, including potential claims by individuals alleging injury or\nother harm caused by the products we distribute. Some of these claims may relate to the activities of businesses that we have acquired, even though these activities may have\noccurred prior to our acquisition of the businesses. The products we distribute may contain lithium ion or similar type batteries that can explode or release hazardous\nsubstances. In addition, defects in the products we distribute could result in death, personal injury, property damage, pollution, release of hazardous substances or damage to\nequipment and facilities. Actual or claimed defects in the products we distribute may give rise to claims against us for losses and expose us to claims for damages.\nWe maintain insurance to cover certain of our potential losses, and we are subject to various self-retentions, deductibles and caps under our insurance. We face the\nfollowing risks with respect to our insurance coverage:\n● we may not be able to continue to obtain insurance on commercially reasonable terms;\n● we may incur losses from interruption of our business that exceed our insurance coverage;\n● we may be faced with types of liabilities that will not be covered adequately or at all by our insurance;\n● our insurance carriers may not be able to meet their obligations under the policies; or\n● the dollar amount of any liabilities may exceed our policy limits.\nEven a partially uninsured claim, if successful and of significant size, could have a material adverse effect on us. Finally, even in cases where we maintain insurance\ncoverage, our insurers may raise various objections and exceptions to coverage that could make uncertain the timing and amount of any possible insurance recovery.\nDue to our position in the supply chain of vaporization products and consumption accessories, we are subject to personal injury, product liability and environmental claims\ninvolving allegedly defective products.\nOur customers use certain products we distribute in potentially hazardous applications that can result in personal injury, product liability and environmental claims. A\ncatastrophic occurrence at a location at which consumers use the products we distribute may result in our company being named as a defendant in lawsuits asserting potentially\nlarge claims, even though we did not manufacture such products or even if such products were not used in the manner recommended by the manufacturer. Applicable law may\nrender us liable for damages without regard to negligence or fault. Certain of these risks are reduced by the fact that we are, in many instances, a distributor of products that\nthird-party manufacturers produce, and, thus, in certain circumstances, we may have third-party warranty or other claims against the manufacturer of products alleged to have\nbeen defective. However, there is no assurance that these claims could fully protect us or that the manufacturer would be financially able to provide protection. There is no\nassurance that our insurance coverage will be adequate to cover the underlying claims. Our insurance does not provide coverage for all liabilities (including liability for certain\nevents involving pollution or other environmental claims).\nWe may become subject to significant product liability litigation.\nThe tobacco and e-cigarette industries have experienced and continue to experience significant product liability litigation and other claims, such as those related to\nmarketing of tobacco and e-cigarettes to minors. As a result of their relative novelty, electronic cigarette, vaporizer product and other consumption product manufacturers,\nsuppliers, distributors and sellers have only recently become subject to litigation. While we have not been a party to any product liability litigation, several lawsuits have been\nbrought against other manufacturers and sellers of smokeless products for injuries to health allegedly caused by use of smokeless products. We may be subject to similar claims\nin the future relating to our vaporizer products. We may also be named as a defendant in product liability litigation against one of our suppliers by association, including in class\naction lawsuits. In addition, we may see increasing litigation over our vaporizer products or the regulation of our products as the regulatory regimes surrounding these products\ndevelop. For example, California’s Proposition 65 (“Prop 65”) requires the State of California to identify chemicals that could cause cancer, birth defects, or reproductive harm,\nand businesses selling products in California are then required to warn consumers of any possible exposure to the chemicals on the list. The State of California and private\nplaintiffs have been active in enforcing Prop 65 against companies in the tobacco, nicotine, cannabis, and vaporization industries. We may face substantial costs due to\nincreased product liability litigation relating to new regulations or other potential defects associated with our vaporizer and other consumption products, including litigation\narising out of faulty devices or improper usage, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThere can be no assurances that we will be able to obtain or maintain product liability insurance on acceptable terms or with adequate coverage against potential\nliabilities. Such insurance is expensive and may not be available in the future on acceptable terms, or at all. The inability to obtain sufficient insurance coverage on reasonable\nterms or to otherwise protect against potential product liability claims could prevent or inhibit the commercialization of products.\n32\nThe scientific community has not yet extensively studied the long-term health effects of the use of vaporizers, electronic cigarettes or e-liquids products.\nVaporizers, electronic cigarettes and related products were recently developed and therefore the scientific community has not had a sufficient period of time to study\nthe long-term health effects of their use. Currently, there is no way of knowing whether these products are safe for their intended use. If the scientific community were to\ndetermine conclusively that use of any or all of these products poses long-term health risks, market demand for these products and their use could materially decline. Such a\ndetermination could also lead to litigation and significant regulation. Loss of demand for our product, product liability claims and increased regulation stemming from\nunfavorable scientific studies on these products could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nReliance on information technology means a significant disruption could affect our communications and operations.\nWe increasingly rely on information technology systems for our internal communications, controls, reporting and relations with customers, vendors and suppliers, and\ninformation technology is becoming a significantly important tool for our sales staff. Our marketing and distribution strategy is dependent upon our ability to closely monitor\nconsumer and market trends on a highly specified level, for which we are reliant on our sophisticated data tracking systems, which are susceptible to disruption or failure. In\naddition, our reliance on information technology exposes us to cyber-security risks, which could have a material adverse effect on our ability to compete. Security and privacy\nbreaches may expose us to liability and cause us to lose customers, or may disrupt our relationships and ongoing transactions with other entities with whom we contract\nthroughout our supply chain. The failure of our information systems to function as intended, or the penetration by outside parties intent on disrupting business processes, could\nresult in significant costs, loss of revenue, assets or personal or other sensitive data and reputational harm.\nInternet security poses a risk to our e-commerce sales.\nAt present, we generate a portion of our sales through e-commerce sales on our own websites. We manage our websites and e-commerce platform internally and, as a\nresult, any compromise of our security or misappropriation of proprietary information could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial\ncondition. We rely on encryption and authentication technology licensed from third parties to provide the security and authentication necessary to effect secure Internet\ntransmission of confidential information, such as credit and other proprietary information. Advances in computer capabilities, new discoveries in the field of cryptography or\nother events or developments may result in a compromise or breach of the technology used by us to protect client transaction data. Anyone who is able to circumvent our\nsecurity measures could misappropriate proprietary information or cause material interruptions in our operations. We may be required to expend significant capital and other\nresources to protect against security breaches or to minimize problems caused by security breaches. To the extent that our activities or the activities of others involve the storage\nand transmission of proprietary information, security breaches could damage our reputation and expose us to a risk of loss and/or litigation. Our security measures may not\nprevent security breaches. Our failure to prevent these security breaches may result in consumer distrust and may adversely affect our business, results of operations and\nfinancial condition.\nSecurity and privacy breaches may expose us to liability and cause us to lose customers.\nFederal, provincial and state laws require us to safeguard our customers’ financial information, including credit information, as well as our employees’ information.\nAlthough we have established security procedures to protect against identity theft and the theft of information of our customers, distributors, consumers, and employees, our\nsecurity and testing measures may not prevent security breaches and breaches of privacy may occur, which would harm our business. Typically, we rely on encryption and\nauthentication technology licensed from third parties to enhance transmission security of confidential information in relation to financial and other sensitive information that we\nhave on file. Advances in computer capabilities, new discoveries in the field of cryptography, inadequate facility security or other developments may result in a compromise or\nbreach of the technology used by us to protect customer data. Any compromise of our security could harm our reputation or financial condition and therefore, our business. In\naddition, a party who is able to circumvent our security measures or exploit inadequacies in our security measures, could, among other effects, misappropriate proprietary\ninformation, cause interruptions in our operations or expose customers and other entities with which we interact to computer viruses or other disruptions. Actual or perceived\nvulnerabilities may lead to claims against us. To the extent the measures we have taken prove to be insufficient or inadequate, we may become subject to litigation or\nadministrative sanctions, which could result in significant fines, penalties or damages and harm to our reputation.\n33\nIf the methodologies of internet search engines are modified, traffic to our websites and corresponding consumer origination volumes could decline.\nWe depend in part on various internet search engines, including Google® and others to direct a significant amount of traffic to our websites. Our ability to maintain the\nnumber of visitors directed to our websites by search engines through which we distribute our content is not entirely within our control. Our competitors’ search engine\noptimization (“SEO”) efforts may result in their websites receiving a higher search result page ranking than ours, or Internet search engines could revise their methodologies,\nwhich could adversely affect the placement of our search result page ranking. If search engine companies modify their search algorithms in ways that are detrimental to our\nconsumer growth or in ways that make it harder for our customers to access or use our websites, or if our competitors’ SEO efforts are more successful than ours, our consumer\nengagement and number of consumers could decline. Any reduction in the number of consumers directed to our websites could negatively affect our ability to earn revenue. If\ntraffic on our websites declines, we may need to employ more costly resources to replace lost traffic, and such increased expense could adversely affect our business, results of\noperations and financial condition.\nWe are a holding company and depend upon our subsidiaries for our cash flow.\nWe are a holding company. Our subsidiaries conduct all of our operations and own substantially all of our tangible assets. Consequently, our cash flow and our ability\nto meet our obligations or to make other distributions in the future will depend upon the cash flow of our subsidiaries and our subsidiaries’ payment of funds to us in the form of\ndistributions, dividends, tax sharing payments or otherwise.\nThe ability of our subsidiaries to make any payments to us will depend on their earnings and cash flow, the terms of their current and future indebtedness, tax\nconsiderations and legal and contractual restrictions on their ability to make distributions.\nOur subsidiaries are separate and distinct legal entities. Any right that we have to receive any assets of or distributions from any of our subsidiaries upon the\nbankruptcy, dissolution, liquidation or reorganization, or to realize proceeds from the sale of their assets, will be junior to the claims of that subsidiary’s creditors, including\ntrade creditors and holders of debt that the subsidiary issued.\nOur intellectual property may be infringed and we may be unable to secure or maintain all the intellectual property required to sell all of our offerings.\nWe currently rely on trademark and other intellectual property rights to establish and protect the brand names and logos we own or license on the products we\ndistribute. Third parties have in the past infringed, and may in the future infringe, on these trademarks and our other intellectual property rights. Our ability to maintain and\nfurther build brand recognition is dependent on the continued use of these trademarks, service marks and other proprietary intellectual property, including the names and logos\nwe own or license. Despite our attempts to ensure these intellectual property rights are protected, third parties may take actions that could materially and adversely affect our\nrights or the value of this intellectual property. Any litigation concerning our intellectual property rights or the intellectual property rights of our suppliers, whether successful or\nunsuccessful, could result in substantial costs to us and diversions of our resources. Expenses related to protecting our intellectual property rights or the intellectual property\nrights of our suppliers, the loss or compromise of any of these rights or the loss of revenues as a result of infringement could have a material adverse effect on our business,\nresults of operations and financial condition, and may prevent the brands we own or license, or are owned or licensed by our suppliers, from growing or maintaining market\nshare. There can be no assurance that any trademarks or common marks that we own or license, or are owned or licensed by our suppliers, will not be challenged in the future,\ninvalidated or circumvented or that the rights granted thereunder or under licensing agreements will provide us or our suppliers competitive advantages. We are dependent on\nthe validity, integrity and intellectual property of our suppliers and their efforts to appropriately register, maintain and enforce intellectual property in all jurisdictions in which\ntheir products are sold.\nWe devote significant resources to the registration and protection of our trademarks and to anti-counterfeiting efforts. Despite these efforts, we regularly discover\nproducts that infringe on our proprietary rights or that otherwise seek to mimic or leverage our intellectual property or the intellectual property of our suppliers. Counterfeiting\nand other infringing activities typically increase as brand recognition increases, especially in markets outside the United States and Canada. Counterfeiting and other\ninfringement of our intellectual property could divert away sales, and association of our brands with inferior counterfeit reproductions or third party labels could adversely\naffect the integrity and reputation of our brands.\nAlthough we currently hold a number of patents on our products, we generally rely on patents on the products of our suppliers as well as their efforts in successfully\ndefending third-party challenges to such products. Third parties have in the past infringed, and may in the future infringe, on our patents and our suppliers’ patents. Our ability\nto maintain and enforce our patent rights, and the ability of our suppliers, licensors, collaborators and manufacturers to maintain and enforce their patent rights, against third-\nparty challenges to their validity, scope or enforceability plays an important role in determining our future. There can be no assurances that we will ever successfully file or\nreceive any patents in the future, and changes in either the patent laws or in interpretations of patent laws in the United States or other countries may diminish the value of the\nintellectual property rights of the products we distribute, license or own. Accordingly, we cannot predict with any certainty the range of claims that may be allowed or enforced\nconcerning the products that we sell.\n34\nIn addition, there can be no assurance that standard intellectual property confidentiality and assignment agreements with employees, consultants and other advisors\nwill not be breached, that we will have adequate remedies for any breach, or that our trade secrets will not otherwise become known to or independently developed by\ncompetitors. Furthermore, there can be no assurance that our efforts to protect our intellectual property will prevent others from unlawfully using our trademarks, trade secrets,\ncopyrights and other intellectual property. Our success depends in part, on our continued ability to maintain our intellectual property and those of our suppliers, and to protect\nour trade secrets. An inability to continue to preserve and protect our intellectual property would likely have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and\nfinancial condition.\nWe are subject to the risks of exchange rate fluctuations.\nCurrency movements and suppliers’ price increases relating to currency exchange rates are significant factors affecting our cost of sales. Many of our products are\npurchased from suppliers located in foreign countries and we make payments for our products in numerous currencies. Thus, we bear certain foreign exchange rate risk for\ncertain of our inventory purchases. In addition, we recently expanded our footprint in Canada and Europe, and as part of our strategy, we may undertake further international\nexpansion. As a result, in the future, we may be more sensitive to the risks of exchange rate fluctuations, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of\noperations and financial condition.\nThere are conflicts of interest among certain of our executive officers and our stockholders.\nCertain of our executive officers are engaged in other activities and have interests in other entities on their own behalf or on behalf of other persons. Neither we, nor\nour stockholders will have any rights in these ventures or their income or profits. Specifically, we sold $0.0 million and $0.4 million in products and supplies to Blum Holdings,\nInc. (“Blum”) in the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Total gross accounts receivable due from Blum were approximately $0.4 million and $0.4 million\nas of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Nicholas Kovacevich, our former Chief Corporate Development Officer, and a member of our Board until January 6, 2023 is\nan investor in Blum and a member of its board of directors.\nWhile we are not aware of any conflict that has arisen or any transaction that has not been conducted on an arm’s length basis to date, during the year, Mr. Kovacevich\nmay have had conflicting fiduciary duties between us, Blum and his own personal financial interests, for which he must recuse himself from certain of our decision-making\nprocesses.\nWe do not allow a conflicted shareholder, director or executive officer to vote on matters wherein a conflict may be perceived. The conflicted person or entity is not\nallowed to nominate an alternate person to vote for them either. Other than this safeguard, we do not current have any policy in place, should such a conflict arise.\nIn particular:\n● our executive officers or directors or their affiliates may have an economic interest in, or other business relationship with, entities that compete in the same businesses\nas us; and\n● our executive officers or directors or their affiliates have interests in entities that we sell products or services to.\nIn any of these cases:\n● our executive officers or directors may have a conflict between our current interests and their personal financial and other interests in another business venture;\n● our executive officers or directors may have conflicting fiduciary duties to us and the other entity; and\n● the terms of transactions with the other entity may not be subject to arm’s length negotiations and therefore may be on terms less favorable to us than those that could\nbe procured through arm’s length negotiations.\nWe are required to comply with laws and regulations in other countries and are exposed to business risks associated with our international operations.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, we derived 7.1% and 7.8%, respectively, of our net sales from outside the United States, primarily in Canada and\ncertain European countries. As a result, we are subject to numerous evolving and complex laws and regulations which apply, among other things, to financial reporting\nstandards, corporate governance, data privacy, tax, trade regulations, export controls, competitive practices, labor, health and safety laws, laws regarding controlled substances,\nlaws regarding drug paraphernalia, and regulations in each jurisdiction in which we operate. We are also required to obtain permits and other authorizations or licenses from\ngovernmental authorities for certain of our operations and we or our suppliers’ must protect our intellectual property worldwide. In the jurisdictions in which we operate, we\nneed to comply with various standards and practices of different regulatory, tax, judicial and administrative bodies.\n35\nThere are a number of risks associated with international business operations, including political instability (e.g., the threat of war, terrorist attacks or civil unrest),\ninconsistent regulations across jurisdictions, unanticipated changes in the regulatory environment, and import and export restrictions. Any of these events may affect our\nemployees, reputation, business or financial results as well as our ability to meet our objectives, including the following international business risks:\n● negative economic developments in economies around the world and the instability of governments, or the downgrades in the debt ratings of certain major economies;\n● social and political instability;\n● complex regulations governing certain of our products;\n● potential terrorist attacks;\n● adverse changes in governmental policies, especially those affecting trade, tariffs and investment;\n● foreign currency exchange, particularly with respect to the Canadian Dollar, Euro, British Pound Sterling and Australian Dollar; and\n● threats that our operations or property could be subject to nationalization and expropriation.\nWe may not be in full compliance at all times with the laws and regulations to which we are subject. Likewise, we may not have obtained or may not be able to obtain\nthe permits and other authorizations or licenses that we need. If we violate or fail to comply with laws, regulations, permits, labor, health and safety regulations or other\nauthorizations or licenses, we could be fined or otherwise sanctioned by regulators. In such a case, or if any of these international business risks were to materialize, our\nbusiness, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.\nNew tariffs and the evolving trade policy dispute between the United States and China may adversely affect our business.\nIn 2018, the United States imposed significant tariffs on steel and aluminum imports from a number of countries, including China. These tariffs and the evolving trade\npolicy dispute between the United States and China may have a significant impact on the industries in which we participate. Many of the products we sell, including without\nlimitation, certain vaporizer products, aluminum grinders, paper products and plastic products, are subject to the 25 percent tariff and such tariff, along with resultant price\nincreases, may negatively impact our pricing and customer demand for these products. A “trade war” between the United States and China or other governmental action related\nto tariffs or international trade agreements or policies has the potential to adversely impact demand for our products, our costs, customers, suppliers and/or the United States\neconomy or certain sectors thereof and, thus, to adversely impact our businesses and results of operations.\nOur failure to comply with certain environmental, health and safety regulations could materially and adversely affect our business.\nThe storage, distribution and transportation of some of the products that we sell are subject to a variety of federal, state, provincial and local environmental regulations.\nWe are also subject to operational, health and safety laws and regulations. Our failure to comply with these laws and regulations could cause a disruption in our business, an\ninability to maintain our warehousing resources, additional and potentially significant remedial costs and damages, fines, sanctions or other legal consequences that could have\na material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. In addition, changes in environmental, employee health and safety or other laws, more\nvigorous enforcement thereof or other unanticipated events could require extensive changes to our operations or give rise to material liabilities, which could have a material\nadverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n36\nWe are transitioning our business and have engaged, and may continue in engage in, dispositions via sales of our assets or other exit activities and other strategic\ninitiatives and we may face risks related to such transactions.\nWe have engaged in, and expect to continue to pursue, strategic dispositions and initiatives, as we transition our business. Dispositions present significant challenges\nand risks relating the separation of disposed businesses. Such risks include: (i) we may incur unanticipated costs or expenses, (ii) we may not be able to successfully separate\ndivested businesses and related obligations from our operations as planned, and (iii) we may not be able to realize anticipated reductions in costs attributable to divested\nbusinesses or assets. Divestitures may also involve continued financial involvement in, or liability with respect to, the divested businesses. As a result of divestiture\ntransactions, we could incur severance charges for personnel and payments for lease and other commitments, charges from the impairment or write-off of assets, and other\nfinancial loss due to the transaction. Furthermore, there is the risk that we might lose customers. In addition, we may not realize the degree or timing of benefits we anticipate\nwhen we first enter into a transaction. There can be no assurances that we will manage dispositions or other strategic initiatives successfully, that strategic opportunities will be\navailable to us on acceptable terms or at all, or that we will be able to consummate desired transactions. Any of the foregoing could materially adversely affect our competitive\nposition, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. For more information on the disposition activities we have undertaken to date, please see “Item 7 —\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations”.\nOur operations are subject to natural disasters, adverse weather conditions, operating hazards, environmental incidents and labor disputes.\nWe may experience earthquakes, floods, typhoons, power outages, labor and trade disputes or similar events beyond our control that would affect our warehousing and\ndistribution operations. The occurrences of such events could result in shutdowns or periods of reduced operations, which could significantly disrupt our business operations,\ncause us to incur additional costs and affect our ability to deliver our products to our customers as scheduled, which may adversely affect our business, results of operations and\nfinancial condition. Moreover, such events could result in severe damage to property, personal injuries, fatalities, regulatory enforcement proceedings or in us being named as a\ndefendant in lawsuits asserting claims for large amounts of damages, which in turn could lead to significant liabilities.\n37\nWe are subject to risks associated with public health crises, such as pandemics and epidemics, , which may have a material adverse effect on our business. The nature and\nextent of future impacts are highly uncertain and unpredictable.\nWe are subject to risks associated with public health crises, such as pandemics and epidemics and the emergence of new viruses may result in new governmental\nlockdowns, quarantine requirements or other restrictions to slow the spread of the virus. In addition, any such measures could also impact the global economy more broadly, for\nexample by leading to further economic slowdowns. If we or any of the third parties with whom we engage, including the suppliers, manufacturers and other third parties in our\nglobal supply chain, were to experience shutdowns or other significant business disruptions, our ability to conduct our business in the manner presently planned could be\nmaterially and negatively impacted.\nThe scope and duration of any future public health crisis, the pace at which government restrictions are imposed and lifted, the scope of additional actions taken to\nmitigate the spread of disease, global vaccination and booster rates, the speed and extent to which global markets and utilization rates for our products fully recover from the\ndisruptions caused by such a public health crisis, and the impact of these factors on our business, financial condition and results of operations, will depend on future\ndevelopments that are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted with confidence.\nTo the extent a new pandemic or other public health crises adversely affect our operations and global economic conditions more generally, it may also have the effect\nof heightening many of the other risks described herein.\nRisks Related to Our Organizational Structure\nOur principal asset is our interest in the Operating Company, and, accordingly, we depend on distributions from the Operating Company to pay our taxes and expenses.\nThe Operating Company’s ability to make such distributions may be subject to various limitations and restrictions.\nWe are a holding company and have no material assets other than our ownership of all of the Common Units of the Operating Company. As such, we have no\nindependent means of generating revenue or cash flow. Our ability to pay our operating expenses or declare and pay dividends in the future, if any, will be dependent upon the\nfinancial results and cash flows of the Operating Company and its subsidiaries and distributions we receive from the Operating Company. There can be no assurance that the\nOperating Company and its subsidiaries will generate sufficient cash flow to distribute funds to us or that applicable state law and contractual restrictions, including negative\ncovenants, in any future debt instruments, will permit such distributions. In addition, because we are a holding company, our stockholders’ claims as a stockholder will be\nstructurally subordinated to all existing and future liabilities and obligations of the Operating Company. Therefore, in the event of our bankruptcy, liquidation or reorganization,\nour assets and those of the Operating Company and its subsidiaries will be available to satisfy the claims of our stockholders only after all of our and Greenlane Holdings,\nLLC’s and its subsidiaries’ liabilities and obligations have been paid in full.\nThe Operating Company is treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes and, as such, is not subject to any entity-level U.S. federal income tax.\nInstead, taxable income is allocated to holders of Common Units. As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, we hold all of the outstanding Common Units. Accordingly, we will incur\nincome taxes on any net taxable income of the Operating Company. Under the terms of the Fourth Amended and Restated Agreement of the Operating Company (the\n“Operating Agreement”), the Operating Company is obligated to make tax distributions to holders of Common Units. In addition to tax expenses, we will also incur expenses\nrelated to our operations which we expect could be significant. We intend, as its manager and sole member, to cause the Operating Company to make cash distributions to us in\nan amount sufficient to (i) fund our tax obligations in respect of taxable income allocated to us and (ii) cover our operating expenses. However, the Operating Company’s\nability to make such distributions may be subject to various limitations and restrictions, such as restrictions on distributions that would either violate any contract or agreement\nto which the Operating Company is then a party, including debt agreements, or any applicable law, or that would have the effect of rendering the Operating Company insolvent.\nIf we do not have sufficient funds to pay tax or other liabilities or to fund our operations, we may have to borrow funds, which could materially adversely affect our liquidity\nand financial condition and subject us to various restrictions imposed by any such lenders.\n38\nThe Tax Receivable Agreement (the “TRA”) may require us to make cash payments to the members of the Operating Company in respect of certain tax benefits to which\nwe may become entitled.\nUnder the TRA we entered into with the Operating Company and its members, we are required to make cash payments to the members of the Operating Partnership\nequal to 85% of the tax benefits, if any, that we actually realize, or in certain circumstances are deemed to realize, as a result of (i) the increases in the tax basis of assets of the\nOperating Company resulting from any redemptions or exchanges of Common Units from the members and (ii) certain other tax benefits related to our making payments under\nthe TRA. Although we held all of the outstanding Common Units as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, payments under the TRA are not conditioned on any member’s continued\nownership of Common Units or our Class A common stock.\nThe actual amount and timing of any payments under the TRA will vary depending upon a number of factors, including the amount of gain recognized by prior holders\nof Common Units, the amount and timing of the taxable income we generate in the future, and the federal tax rates then applicable.\nFluctuations in our tax obligations and effective tax rate and realization of our deferred tax assets may result in volatility of our operating results.\nWe are subject to taxes by the U.S. federal, state, local and foreign tax authorities, and our tax liabilities will be affected by the allocation of expenses to differing\njurisdictions. We record tax expense based on our estimates of future earnings, which may include reserves for uncertain tax positions in multiple tax jurisdictions, and\nvaluation allowances related to certain net deferred tax assets. At any one time, many tax years may be subject to audit by various taxing jurisdictions. The results of these\naudits and negotiations with taxing authorities may affect the ultimate settlement of these matters. We expect that throughout the year there could be ongoing variability in our\nquarterly tax rates as events occur and exposures are evaluated. Our future effective tax rates could be subject to volatility or adversely affected by a number of factors,\nincluding:\n● changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities;\n● expected timing and amount of the release of any tax valuation allowances;\n● tax effects of stock-based compensation;\n● changes in tax laws, regulations or interpretations thereof; or\n● future earnings being lower than anticipated in countries where we have lower statutory tax rates and higher than anticipated earnings in countries where we have\nhigher statutory tax rates.\nIn addition, our effective tax rate in a given financial statement period may be materially impacted by a variety of factors including but not limited to changes in the\nmix and level of earnings, varying tax rates in the different jurisdictions in which we operate, fluctuations in valuation allowances, deductibility of certain items, or by changes\nto existing accounting rules or regulations. Further, tax legislation may be enacted in the future which could negatively impact our current or future tax structure and effective\ntax rates. We may be subject to audits of our income, sales, and other transaction taxes by U.S. federal, state, local, and foreign taxing authorities. Outcomes from these audits\ncould have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition.\nIf we were deemed to be an investment company under the U.S. Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the “1940 Act”), as a result of our ownership of the\nOperating Company, applicable restrictions could make it impractical for us to continue our business as contemplated and could have a material adverse effect on our\nbusiness.\nUnder Sections 3(a)(1)(A) and (C) of the 1940 Act, a company generally will be deemed to be an “investment company” for purposes of the 1940 Act if (i) it is, or\nholds itself out as being, engaged primarily, or proposes to engage primarily, in the business of investing, reinvesting or trading in securities or (ii) it engages, or proposes to\nengage, in the business of investing, reinvesting, owning, holding or trading in securities and it owns or proposes to acquire investment securities having a value exceeding 40%\nof the value of its total assets (exclusive of U.S. government securities and cash items) on an unconsolidated basis. We do not believe that we are an “investment company,” as\nsuch term is defined in either of those sections of the 1940 Act.\nAs the sole manager of the Operating Company, we control and operate the Operating Company. On that basis, we believe that our interest in the Operating Company\nis not an “investment security” as that term is used in the 1940 Act. However, if we were to cease participation in the management of the Operating Company, our interest in\nThe Operating Company could be deemed an “investment security” for purposes of the 1940 Act.\n39\nWe and the Operating Company intend to continue to conduct our operations so that we will not be deemed an investment company. However, if we were to be\ndeemed an investment company, restrictions imposed by the 1940 Act, including limitations on our capital structure and our ability to transact with affiliates, could make it\nimpractical for us to continue our business as contemplated and could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nRisks Related to Ownership of Our Class A Common Stock\nThe market price of our Class A common stock has been volatile and has declined significantly since our initial public offering and may face more volatility and price\ndeclines in the future. As a result, you may not be able to resell your shares at or above the price at which you have acquired or will acquire shares of our Class A common\nstock.\nThe market price of our Class A common stock has been volatile and has declined significantly since our initial public offering and could face more volatility and price\ndeclines in the future as a result of a number of factors, many of which are beyond our control. Furthermore, volatility in our stock price may occur regardless of our operating\nperformance. As a result, you may not be able to sell your shares at or above the price you paid and you could lose a substantial part or all of your investment in our Class A\ncommon stock. The following factors could affect our stock price:\n● general market conditions, including conditions that are outside of our control, such as actions or proposed actions of the current U.S. Presidential administration and\nthe Federal Reserve to curb inflation or the impact of future public health crises; novel and unforeseen market volatility and trading strategies, such as the short\nsqueeze rallies caused by retail investors on retail trading platforms;\n● our financing activities, including the issuance of additional securities;\n● our operating and financial performance and the performance of other similar companies;\n● the market perception of our industry;\n● management turnover;\n● the impact, or perceived impact, of new regulations applicable to us, our suppliers or our customers;\n● quarterly variations in the rate of growth of our financial indicators, such as net income, net income per share, net sales and adjusted EBITDA;\n● our ability to successfully execute our merger and acquisition strategy;\n● significant acquisitions or business combinations, strategic partnerships, joint ventures or capital commitments by or involving us or our competitors;\n● strategic actions by our competitors or our suppliers;\n● product recalls or product liability claims;\n● changes in revenue or earnings estimates, or changes in recommendations or withdrawal of research coverage, by equity research analysts;\n● liquidity and activity in the market for our Class A common stock;\n● speculation in the press or investment community;\n● sales of our Class A common stock by us or other stockholders, or the perception that such sales may occur;\n● the future incurrence of debt;\n● changes in accounting principles;\n● additions or departures of key management personnel;\n● the de-listing of our Class A common stock from the Nasdaq Capital Market;\n● news reports relating to trends, concerns or competitive developments, regulatory changes and other related issues in our industry or target markets;\n● investors’ general perception of us and the public’s reaction to our press releases, our other public announcements and our filings with the SEC;\n● actions by our stockholders; and\n● domestic and international economic, legal and regulatory factors.\nThe stock markets in general have experienced extreme volatility, particularly recently, that has often been unrelated to the operating performance of particular\ncompanies. These broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the trading price of our Class A common stock.\nYour percentage ownership will be diluted in the future.\nYour percentage ownership will be diluted in the future as a result of equity awards that we expect will be granted to our directors, officers and employees, as well as\nany shares of our Class A common stock, or securities convertible into shares of our Class A common stock, we issue in connection with future capital raising or strategic\ntransactions at prices that are dilutive to shareholders. Our Second Amended and Restated 2019 Equity Incentive Plan provides for the grant of equity-based awards to our\ndirectors, officers and employees. The issuance of any shares of Class A common stock will dilute the proportionate ownership and voting power of existing security holders.\n40\nSubstantial sales and issuances of our Class A common stock have and may continue to occur, or may be anticipated, which have and could continue to cause our stock\nprice to decline.\nThe market price of shares of our Class A common stock could decline further as a result of substantial sales of our Class A common stock, issuances of Class A\ncommon stock at prices that are dilutive to stockholders, a large number of shares of our Class A common stock becoming available for sale or the perception in the market that\nholders of a large number of shares intend to sell their shares. Additionally, we expect that we will seek to raise additional capital from time to time in the future, which may\ninvolve the issuance of additional shares of our Class A common stock, or securities convertible into shares of our Class A common stock in subsequent public or private\nofferings at dilutive prices if debt is not available to us to fund our working capital needs.\nWe cannot predict the effect, if any, that these sales, or anticipation of such sales, will have on the market price of our common stock or the timing of any redemption\nof Common Units. Sales or issuances of substantial amounts of our Class A common stock (including shares issued in connection with an acquisition), or the perception that\nsuch sales could occur, may adversely affect prevailing market price of our Class A common stock.\nThe requirements of being a public company may strain our resources and distract our management, which could make it difficult to manage our business, particularly\nafter we are no longer an “emerging growth company.”\nAs a public company, we are required to comply with various regulatory and reporting requirements, including those required by the SEC. Complying with these\nreporting and other regulatory requirements is time-consuming and expensive and could have a negative effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. As\na public company, we are subject to the reporting requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), and the requirements of the\nSarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (“SOX”). The cost of complying with these requirements may place a strain on our systems and resources. The Exchange Act requires that we file\nannual, quarterly and current reports with respect to our business and financial condition. SOX requires that we maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures and\ninternal controls over financial reporting. To maintain and improve the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures, we must commit significant resources, may be\nrequired to hire additional staff and need to continue to provide effective management oversight. Sustaining our growth also will require us to commit additional management,\noperational and financial resources to identify new professionals to join our company and to maintain appropriate operational and financial systems to adequately support\nexpansion. These activities may divert management’s attention from other business concerns, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations,\nfinancial condition and cash flows.\nIn connection with becoming a public company, we obtained Side A directors’ and officers’ insurance coverage, which increased our annual insurance costs. In the\nfuture, it may be more expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance, and we may be required to accept reduced coverage or incur substantially higher costs\nto obtain coverage. These factors could also make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified members to our Board in the future, particularly to serve on our audit\ncommittee, and qualified executive officers.\nAs an “emerging growth company” as defined in the JOBS Act, we may take advantage of certain temporary exemptions from various reporting requirements,\nincluding, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404(b) of SOX and reduced disclosure obligations regarding\nexecutive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements.\nWhen these exemptions cease to apply, we expect to incur additional expenses and devote increased management effort toward ensuring compliance with them. We\nwill remain an “emerging growth company” for up to five years, although we may cease to be an “emerging growth company” earlier under certain circumstances. We cannot\npredict or estimate the amount of additional costs we may incur as a result of becoming a public company or the timing of such costs.\n41\nAs a public reporting company, we are subject to rules and regulations established from time to time by the SEC regarding our internal control over financial reporting. In\nconnection with our assessment of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures, we identified certain material weaknesses in our internal control over\nfinancial reporting, which caused our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer to determine that our internal control over financial reporting, as well as our\ndisclosure controls and procedures, were not effective as of December 31, 2020 and these material weaknesses have not yet been fully remediated as of December 31, 2023.\nAs a public reporting company, we are subject to the rules and regulations established from time to time by the SEC. These rules and regulations require that, among\nother things, we establish and periodically evaluate procedures with respect to our internal control over financial reporting. Reporting obligations as a public company are likely\nto place a considerable strain on our financial and management systems, processes and controls, as well as on our personnel.\nOur management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial and Legal Officer, is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal\ncontrol over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act). Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide\nreasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Our\ninternal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that: (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly\nreflect the transactions and dispositions of our assets; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements\nin accordance with U.S. GAAP, and that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of our management and directors; and (iii)\nprovide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on the\nfinancial statements.\nUnder the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we conducted an evaluation of\nthe effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020. Based on this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer\nconcluded that as of December 31, 2020, the Company had not maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as a result of the existence of material weaknesses.\nConsequently, management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, also concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were\nnot effective as of December 31, 2020 to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports filed or submitted by it under the\nExchange Act were recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms, and to provide reasonable assurance that\ninformation required to be disclosed by the Company in such reports was accumulated and communicated to the Company’s management, including, our Chief Executive\nOfficer and our Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.\nA “material weakness” is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a\nmaterial misstatement of our financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Although we are implementing measures to remediate the material\nweaknesses, we cannot give any assurances that the identified material weaknesses will be remediated on a timely basis or at all or that additional material weaknesses will not\nbe identified in the future in connection with our compliance with the provisions of Section 404 of SOX. Our management may be required to devote significant time and\nexpense to remediate these material weaknesses and any other material weaknesses that may be discovered in the future and may not be able to remediate such material\nweaknesses in a timely manner. The existence of any future material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting could also result in errors in our financial\nstatements that could require us to restate our financial statements, cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations, and cause investors to lose confidence in our reported\nfinancial information, any of which could lead to a decline in the per share trading price of our common stock.\nAs described in Item 9A of Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we are continuing to implement our remediation plan to address the identified material\nweaknesses, and our management continues to be actively engaged in the remediation efforts. The material weaknesses will not be considered remediated until the applicable\ncontrols operate for a sufficient period of time and management has concluded, through testing, that these controls are operating effectively.\nAs previously disclosed, in 2020, we began a multi-year implementation of a new ERP system, which we completed in 2023. The ERP system serves as our existing\ncore financial system. Concurrently, in 2023, the re-design of the user access roles and permissions in the new ERP system were completed, and new controls were put into\nplace. Therefore we expect that the previously reported material weaknesses related to ineffective user access controls will be considered remediated in 2024.\nBecause we are an “emerging growth company” under the JOBS Act, our independent registered public accounting firm is not be required to attest to the effectiveness\nof our internal control over financial reporting for so long as we are an emerging growth company. Our independent registered public accounting firm will be engaged to\nprovide an attestation report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting at such time as we cease to be an ‘‘emerging growth company,’’ as defined in\nthe JOBS Act.\n42\nWe have not paid dividends in the past and have no current plans to pay dividends in the future, and any return on investment may be limited to the value of our common\nstock.\nWe do not anticipate paying cash dividends in the foreseeable future. The payment of dividends will depend on our earnings, capital requirements, financial condition,\nprospects and other factors our Board may deem relevant. If we do not pay dividends, our stock may be less valuable because a return on your investment will only occur if you\nsell our Class A common stock after our stock price appreciates above the price at which you acquired such shares.\nIf securities analysts do not publish research or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, our stock price and trading volume could decline.\nThe trading market for our stock depends in part on the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us or our industry. While there are\ncurrently securities analysts covering us, we can provide no assurances that the analysts will continue to publish report or that other securities analysts will initiate coverage. If\nno securities analysts cover our company, the trading price for our stock could be negatively impacted. In addition, if one or more of the analysts who cover us downgrade our\nstock or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, our stock price could decline as a result. If one or more of these analysts cease coverage of our company\nor fail to publish reports on us regularly, demand for our Class A stock could decrease, which might cause the market price and trading volume of our Class A common stock to\ndecline.\nWe have a large number of authorized but unissued shares of stock, which could negatively impact a potential investor if they purchase our Class A common stock.\nOn August 9, 2022 and June 5, 2023, we effected reverse stock splits. The reverse stock splits did not change the par value of our Class A common stock or the number\nof shares of Class A common stock or preferred shares authorized by our amended and restated certificate of incorporation. Because the number of authorized shares of our\nClass A common stock was not reduced proportionally, the reverse stock splits increased our Board’s ability to issue authorized and unissued shares without further stockholder\naction. As of December 31, 2023, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides for 600,000,000 shares of authorized Class A common stock, 30,000,000\nshares of authorized Class B common stock and 10,000,000 shares of authorized preferred stock and we have approximately 3,726,926 shares of Class A common stock\noutstanding, 11,860,201 shares reserved for exercise or vesting of outstanding warrants and options to purchase shares of Class A common stock and 203,022 shares of Class A\ncommon stock reserved for future grant under the Company’s equity incentive plan. No shares of Class B common stock or preferred stock are outstanding.\nWith respect to authorized but unissued and unreserved shares, we could also use such shares to oppose a hostile takeover attempt or delay or prevent changes in\ncontrol or changes in or removal of management. The issuance of additional shares of Class A common stock or securities convertible into Class A common stock may have a\ndilutive effect on earnings per share and relative voting power and may cause a decline in the trading price of our Class A common stock. We could use the shares that are\navailable for future issuance in dilutive equity financing transactions, or to oppose a hostile takeover attempt or delay or prevent changes in control or changes in or removal of\nmanagement, including transactions that are favored by a majority of the stockholders or in which the stockholders might otherwise receive a premium for their shares over\nthen-current market prices or benefit in some other manner.\nAnti-takeover provisions in our certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws and Delaware law could discourage a takeover.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation and our amended and restated bylaws contain provisions that might enable our management to resist a takeover.\nThese provisions include:\n● authorizing the issuance of “blank check” preferred stock that could be issued by our Board to increase the number of outstanding shares and thwart a takeover\nattempt;\n● advance notice requirements applicable to stockholders for matters to be brought before a meeting of stockholders and requirements as to the form and content of a\nstockholder’s notice;\n● restrictions on the transfer of our outstanding shares of Class B common stock;\n● a supermajority stockholder vote requirement for amending certain provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated\nbylaws;\n● the inability of our stockholders to act by written consent;\n● a requirement that the authorized number of directors may be changed only by resolution of the Board;\n● allowing all vacancies, including newly created directorships, to be filled by the affirmative vote of a majority of directors then in office, even if less than a quorum,\nexcept as otherwise required by law;\n● limiting the forum for certain litigation against us to Delaware; and\n● limiting the persons that can call special meetings of our stockholders to our Board or the chairperson of our Board.\nThese provisions might discourage, delay or prevent a change in control of our company or a change in our Board. The existence of these provisions could adversely\naffect the voting power of holders of Class A common stock and limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our Class A common stock. In\naddition, because we are incorporated in Delaware, we are governed by the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which generally prohibits a\nDelaware corporation from engaging in any of a broad range of business combinations with any “interested” stockholder for a period of three years following the date on which\nthe stockholder became an “interested” stockholder.\nWe may issue shares of preferred stock in the future, which could make it difficult for another company to acquire us or could otherwise adversely affect holders of our\nClass A common stock, which could depress the market price of our Class A common stock.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation authorizes us to issue one or more series of preferred stock. Our Board has the authority to determine the\npreferences, limitations and relative rights of the shares of preferred stock and to fix the number of shares constituting any series and the designation of such series, without any\nfurther vote or action by our stockholders. Our preferred stock can be issued with voting, liquidation, dividend and other rights superior to the rights of our Class A common\nstock. The potential issuance of preferred stock may delay or prevent a change in control of us, discourage bids for our Class A common stock at a premium to the market price,\nand materially and adversely affect the market price and the voting and other rights of the holders of our Class A common stock.\n43\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws provide that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware is the sole and exclusive forum for\nsubstantially all disputes between us and our stockholders, which could limit our stockholders’ ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our\ndirectors, officers or employees.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation and our amended and restated bylaws provide that, unless we consent to the selection of an alternative forum, the\nCourt of Chancery of the State of Delaware is the sole and exclusive forum for (i) any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf, other than any action or\nproceeding that, under applicable law, may only be commenced or prosecuted in another forum, (ii) any action asserting a claim of breach of fiduciary duty owed by any of our\ndirectors, officers or other employees to us or to our stockholders, (iii) any action asserting a claim arising pursuant to the Delaware General Corporation Law or our amended\nand restated certificate of incorporation or bylaws (iv) any action to interpret, apply, enforce or determine the validity of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation.\nWe are a “smaller reporting company” under federal securities laws and we cannot be certain whether the reduced reporting requirements applicable to such companies\nwill make our Class A common stock less attractive to investors.\nWe are a “smaller reporting company” under federal securities laws. For as long as we continue to be a smaller reporting company, we may take advantage of\nexemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies, including reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in\nour periodic reports and proxy statements. Generally, we will remain a smaller reporting company so long as our public float remains less than $250 million as of the last\nbusiness day of our most recently completed second fiscal quarter. We cannot predict if investors will find our Class A common stock less attractive because we may rely on\nthese exemptions. If some investors find our Class A common stock less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our Class A common stock and our\nstock price may decline or be more volatile.\nITEM 1B.

MARKET FOR REGISTRANT’S COMMON EQUITY, RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS AND ISSUER PURCHASES OF EQUITY\nSECURITIES\nMarket Information\nOur Class A common stock is listed on the Nasdaq Captial Market under the symbol “GNLN”.\nHolders\nAs of July 18, 2024, there were approximately 78 stockholders of record of our Class A common stock. Since certain of our shares of Class A common stock are held\nby brokers and other institutions on behalf of stockholders, we are unable to estimate the total number of stockholders represented by these record holders.\nDividends\nWe have never declared or paid any cash dividends on our Class A common stock. We intend to retain any future earnings and do not expect to pay cash dividends in\nthe foreseeable future.\nUnregistered Sales of Equity Securities\nThere were no unregistered sales of equity securities during the year ended December 31, 2023.\nOn June 29, 2023, we entered into securities purchase agreements with certain investors, pursuant to which we agreed to issue and sell an aggregate of 560,476 shares of our\nClass A common stock, pre-funded warrants to purchase up to 3,487,143 shares of our Class A common stock (the “July 2023 Pre-Funded Warrants”) and warrants to purchase\nup to 8,095,238 shares of our Class A common stock (the “July 2023 Standard Warrants”). The July 2023 units each consisted of one share of Class A common stock or a July\n2023 Pre-Funded Warrant and two July 2023 Standard Warrants to purchase one share of our Class A common stock. The July 2023 units were offered pursuant to an effective\nRegistration Statement on Form S-1. The July 2023 Standard Warrants are exercisable immediately at an exercise price equal to $1.05 per share of Class A common stock for a\nperiod of five years. Each July 2023 Pre-Funded Warrant is exercisable immediately with no expiration date for one share of Class A common stock at an exercise price of\n$0.0001. The July 2023 Offering generated gross proceeds of approximately $4.3 million and net proceeds to the Company of approximately $3.9 million.\nAs of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, all July 2023 Pre-Funded Warrants have been exercised, based upon which we issued an additional 1,911,000 shares of our\nClass A common stock subsequent to year end, for de minimis net proceeds.\nIn connection with the July 2023 Offering, we entered into privately negotiated agreements with holders participating in the offering to amend existing outstanding warrants to\npurchase up to 1,344,367 shares of Class A common stock that were previously issued in connection with the June 2022 and October 2022 Offerings at exercise prices per share\nof $50.00 and $9.00, respectively, and expire on December 29, 2027 and November 1, 2029, respectively (collectively, the “Prior Warrants”), effective upon the closing of the\nJuly 2023 Offering to reduce the exercise price of the Prior Warrants to $1.05, the exercise price of the warrants to purchase shares of Class A common stock offered in the July\n2023 Offering. All other terms of the Prior Warrants remained unchanged.\nITEM 6. [Reserved]\nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nOverview\nFounded in 2005, Greenlane is the premier global platform for the development and distribution of premium cannabis accessories, vape devices, and lifestyle products.\nIn 2021, we completed several acquisitions along with a transformative merger with KushCo Holdings, adding a significant industrial line of business to the Greenlane\nplatform. These acquisitions strengthened our leading position as a consumer ancillary products business and significantly expanded our customer network, bringing strategic\nrelationships with leading cannabis multi-state-operators (“MSOs”), cannabis single-state operators (“SSOs”), and Canadian licensed-producers (“LPs”). Greenlane is a leading\nancillary cannabis company, providing a wide array of consumer ancillary products and industrial ancillary products to thousands of cannabis producers, processors, brands,\nand retailers (“Cannabis Operators”), in addition to specialty retailers, smoke shops and head shops, convenience stores, and consumers directly through our own proprietary\nweb stores and large online marketplaces such as Amazon.\n45\nWe have been developing a world-class portfolio of our own proprietary brands (the “Greenlane Brands”) and carefully curated third-party products that we believe\nwill, over time, deliver higher margins and create long-term value for our customers and shareholders. Our wholly-owned Greenlane Brands includes our recently launched\nmore affordable product line – Groove, innovative silicone pipes and accessories and premium ancillary product brand – Higher Standards. We also have category exclusive\nlicenses for the premium Marley Natural branded products, as well as the K.Haring Glass Collection.\nSince the end of 2021, the Company has invested significantly in technology, including its e-commerce platforms, internal ERP systems, and B2B capabilities. Our\nworld-class product portfolio is offered to customers through our proprietary, owned and operated e-commerce platforms which include Vapor.com, PuffItUp.com,\nHigherStandards.com, MarleyNaturalShop.com and Wholesale.Greenlane.com. These platforms allow us to reach customers directly with helpful resources and a seamless\npurchasing experience.\nWe merchandise vaporizers, packaging, and other ancillary products in the United States, Canada, Europe and Latin America. We distribute products to retailers\nthrough wholesale operations and distribute products to consumers through our e-commerce platforms We operate our own distribution centers in the United States, while also\nutilizing third-party logistics (“3PL”) locations in Canada. We have made tremendous progress consolidating and streamlining our warehouse and distribution operations over\nthe last two years.\nWe manage our business in two different, but complementary, business segments. The first is the Consumer Goods segment, which focuses on serving consumers\nacross wholesale, retail, and e-commerce operations—offering both our Greenlane Brands as well as ancillary products and accessories from select leading third-party brands,\nsuch as Storz and Bickel, Grenco Science, PAX, Arizer and more. The Consumer Goods segment forms a central part of our growth strategy, especially as it relates to scaling\nour own portfolio of higher-margin proprietary owned brands. In addition to our Consumer Goods segment, we have our Industrial Goods segment, which focuses on serving\nCannabis Operators by providing ancillary products essential to their daily operations and growth, such as packaging and vaporization solutions, including our Greenlane Brand\nPollen Gear. Refer to “Note 12— Segment Reporting” within Item 8 to this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information on our reportable segments.\nPlan to Accelerate Path to Profitability and Capitalize the Business\nIn today’s economic landscape, particularly within the cannabis industry, achieving profitability and preserving working capital are paramount. At Greenlane, we are\nintensely focused on making our business profitable and well-capitalized for long-term sustainability. Our key initiatives include:\n1. Technology Enhancements: We remain fully committed to improving our technology, particularly our B2B and e-commerce platforms, to provide a seamless shopping\nexperience for our wholesale and retail customers.\n2. Facility Footprint Rationalization: In 2023, we optimized our facilities footprint by reducing warehouse and office space while increasing operational efficiency and\nimproving fulfillment practices. The full benefit of those efforts are expected to be realized in 2024.\n3. Headcount Reduction: We have significantly reduced our headcount and associated salary expenses, focusing on maintaining a core group of key employees as we\ncollectively right-size the business.\n4. Cost Structure Optimization: We continue to reduce our overall cost structure while improving margins. In April 2023, we formed two strategic partnerships (described\nbelow in greater detail) to increase margins and significantly reduce working capital requirements in our Industrial Goods segment. Similarly, our Consumer Goods\nsegment restructured arrangements with several third-party brands in 2022 and 2023 to reduce our working capital needs.\n5. Inventory Management: In 2023, we implemented a new inventory management and lifecycle strategy that is focused on a quarterly turn and a regular review of\ninventory to avoid future write-offs.\n6. Sales Force Upgrade: We have upgraded and will continue to upgrade our sales force from a solely account management centric team to a skilled and driven sales team\nto acquire new customers while maintaining excellent service with our existing customers\n7. Product Innovation: In 2023, we launched Groove, an innovative new product line with a value-based price point and in 2024 we have begun to expand our product\noffering to further enhance our assortment available to our customers.\n8. Capital Investment: We continue to seek opportunities for securing investment capital to leverage our platform, increase availability and reduce stockouts of our high\ndemand third-party brands, invest in marketing and sales, and improve our product offerings.\nManagement believes that these initiatives will significantly reduce costs, help accelerate the Company’s path to profitability, support business growth, and allow the\nCompany to reinvest capital into its highest demand and highest potential product lines.\nDuring 2022 and 2023, the Company received capital from various sources permitting it to right-size the business and position the company for growth. Such sources\nare described in greater detail in the Liquidity and Capital Resources Section of this report. During 2022, the Company also monetized several non-core assets to provide\nnecessary working capital including the sale and lease-back of its headquarters building and the sale of its interest in the Vibes brand.\n46\nDuring 2023 and 2024, the Company also entered into certain arrangements to reduce working capital requirements and improve its balance sheet.\nIn April 2023, we successfully entered into two strategic partnerships which management believes will help significantly reduce our overall cost structure, enhance our\nmargins and further support our facilities consolidation initiatives while also servicing and providing solutions to our customers. First, we entered into a strategic partnership\n(the “MJ Packaging Partnership”) with A&A Global Imports d/b/a MarijuanaPackaging.com (“MJ Pack”), a leading provider of packaging solutions to the cannabis industry.\nAs part of the MJ Packaging Partnership, we will no longer purchase additional packaging inventory and MJ Pack will become our strategic partner to continue providing and\nenhancing packaging solutions for our customers. As a result of the MJ Packaging Partnership, we are no longer seeking a purchaser for our packaging division. Second, we\nentered into a strategic partnership with an affiliate of one of our existing vape suppliers (“Vape Partner”) to service certain key customers with vaporizer goods and services\n(the “Vape Partnership”). As part of the Vape Partnership, we will introduce our Vape Partner to certain key customers, assist with the promotion and the sale of certain\nvaporizer goods and services, and help coordinate the logistics, storage and distribution of such vaporizer products. If our Vape Partner and key customer(s) enter into a direct\nrelationship, the customers would directly purchase vaporizer goods and services, which we currently sell them, directly from our Vape Partner and we would no longer need to\npurchase such vape inventory on behalf of such key customer(s). In exchange we would earn quarterly and annual commission payments from our strategic partners. While the\nstrategic partnerships may result in a decrease in top line revenue for these packaging and vape products, these partnerships combined with some of our other restructuring\ninitiatives should allow us to reduce our overall cost-structure and enhance our margins and convert millions of dollars of existing inventory back into cash, thereby improving\nour balance sheet.\nOn May 6, 2024, the Company, Warehouse Goods and Synergy Imports LLC (“Synergy”) entered into an asset purchase agreement, dated May 1, 2024 (the “Asset\nPurchase Agreement”) pursuant to which Synergy purchased all of the intellectual property, a specified amount of inventory, and other assets related to the Eyce and DaVinci\nbrands. In consideration for the acquisition, all parties entered into a loan modification agreement, effective May 1, 2024 (the “Loan Modification Agreement”) and an amended\nand restated secured promissory note, effective May 1, 2024 (the Amended and Restated Secured Promissory Note”), an amendment to the original Eyce and Davinci Asset\nPurchase Agreements, a distribution agreement, the termination of a license granted by Eyce, and the termination of certain consulting and employment agreements.\nUSPS PACT Act Exemption\nOn January 11, 2022, we announced via press release that the United States Postal Service (the “USPS”) had approved our application for a business and regulatory\nexemption to the PACT Act (with respect to the business and regulatory exemption granted by the USPS, the “PACT Act Exemption”), allowing us to ship vaporizers and\naccessories classified as electronic nicotine delivery systems (“ENDS”) products to other compliant businesses. With this approval, over 97% of our total annual sales became\neligible for shipment by freight, USPS and other major parcel carriers. The PACT Act Exemption also enables us to partner with other businesses that ship ENDS products and\nhad their supply chains disrupted by PACT Act compliance.\nOn June 24, 2022, we provided via press release an update on the progress of the PACT Act Exemption, following our successful implementation of the controls,\nprocesses and systems required by the USPS in connection with the shipment of ENDS products. We expect the ability to fulfill ENDS orders with the USPS to allow us to\nreduce shipping costs, decrease fulfillment times and enhance the overall customer experience for approved wholesale customers.\nReverse Stock Split\nOn June 2, 2023, we filed a Certificate of Amendment to the A&R Charter with the SSSD, which effected a one-for-10 reverse stock split (the “2023 Reverse Stock\nSplit” and together with the 2022 Reverse Stock Split, the “Reverse Stock Splits”) of our issued and outstanding shares of Common Stock at 5:01 PM Eastern Time on June 5,\n2023. As a result of the 2023 Reverse Stock Split, every 10 shares of common stock issued and outstanding were converted into one share of common stock. We paid cash in\nlieu of fractional shares, and accordingly, no fractional shares were issued in connection with the 2023 Reverse Stock Split.\nThe Reverse Stock Split did not change the par value of the Common Stock or the authorized number of shares of Common Stock. All outstanding options, restricted\nstock awards, warrants and other securities entitling their holders to purchase or otherwise receive shares of our Common Stock have been adjusted as a result of the Reverse\nStock Split, as required by the terms of each security. The number of shares available to be awarded under our Second Amended and Restated 2019 Equity Incentive Plan have\nalso been appropriately adjusted. See “Note 10 — Compensation Plans” for more information.\n47\nAll share and per share amounts in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 have been retroactively adjusted for all periods\npresented to give effect to the Reverse Stock Split.\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nWe prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”). The\npreparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent\nassets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. We evaluate our estimates and\nassumptions on an ongoing basis. We base our estimates on historical experience, outside advice from parties believed to be experts in such matters, and on various other\nassumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and\nliabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Judgments and uncertainties affecting the application of those policies may result in materially different amounts\nbeing reported under different conditions or using different assumptions. See “Note 2—Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial\nStatements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K for a description the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of our consolidated financial\nstatements.\nInventories\nInventories, consisting of finished products, are primarily accounted for using the weighted-average method, and are valued at the lower of cost and net realizable\nvalue. This valuation requires us to make judgments, based on currently available information, about the likely method of disposition, such as through sales to customers or\nliquidations. Assumptions about the future disposition of inventory are inherently uncertain and changes in our estimates and assumptions may cause us to realize material\nwrite-downs in the future.\nIncome Taxes and TRA Liability\nWe are a corporation subject to income taxes in the United States. Certain subsidiaries of the Operating Company are taxable separately from us. Our proportional\nshare of the Operating Company’s subsidiaries’ provisions are included in our consolidated financial statements.\nAs of December 31, 2022, we held all the outstanding Common Units in the Operating Company and are the sole member. As a result, in 2023, 100% of the Operating\nCompany’s US and state income and expenses are now included in our US and state tax returns.\nOur deferred income tax assets and liabilities are computed for differences between the tax basis and financial statement amounts that will result in taxable or\ndeductible amounts in the future. We compute deferred balances based on enacted tax laws and applicable rates for the periods in which the differences are expected to affect\ntaxable income. A valuation allowance is recognized for deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the net deferred tax assets will not be realized.\nIn making such a determination, we consider all available positive and negative evidence, including future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, projected future\ntaxable income, tax-planning strategies, and results of recent operations. If we determine we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets for which a valuation allowance\nhad been recorded, then we would adjust the deferred tax asset valuation allowance, which would reduce our provision for income taxes.\nWe evaluate the tax positions taken on income tax returns that remain open and positions expected to be taken on the current year tax returns to identify uncertain tax\npositions. Unrecognized tax benefits on uncertain tax positions are recorded on the basis of a two-step process in which (1) we determine whether it is more likely than not that\nthe tax positions will be sustained on the basis of the technical merits of the position and (2) for those tax positions that meet the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold, the\nlargest amount of tax benefit that is more than 50 percent likely to be realized is recognized. Interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits are recorded in income\ntax benefit. We have no uncertain tax positions that qualify for inclusion in our consolidated financial statements.\n48\nIn addition to tax expenses, we may incur expenses related to our operations and may be required to make payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement (the\n“TRA”), which could be significant. Pursuant to the Greenlane Operating Agreement, Greenlane Holdings, LLC will generally make pro rata tax distributions to its members in\nan amount sufficient to fund all or part of their tax obligations with respect to the taxable income of Greenlane Holdings, LLC that is allocated to them and possibly in excess of\nsuch amount.\nLegal Contingencies\nIn the ordinary course of business, we are involved in legal proceedings involving a variety of matters. Certain of these matters include speculative claims for\nsubstantial or indeterminate amounts of damages. We evaluate the associated developments on a regular basis and accrue a liability when we believe that it is both probable that\na loss has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated. If we determine there is a reasonable possibility that we may incur a loss and the loss or range of loss can\nbe estimated, we disclose the possible loss in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements to the extent material.\nWe review the developments in our contingencies that could affect the amount of the provisions that have been previously recorded, and the matters and related\nreasonably possible losses disclosed. We make adjustments to our provisions and changes to our disclosures accordingly to reflect the impact of negotiations, settlements,\nrulings, advice of legal counsel, and updated information. Significant judgment is required to determine both the probability of loss and the estimated amount of loss.\nThe outcome of these matters is inherently uncertain. Therefore, if one or more legal proceedings were resolved against us for amounts in excess of management’s\nexpectations, our results of operations and financial condition, including in a particular reporting period in which any such outcome becomes probable and estimable, could be\nmaterially adversely affected. See “Note 7—Commitments and Contingencies” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K\nfor additional information regarding these contingencies.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nSee “Note 2—Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K.\n49\nResults of Operations\nThe following table presents operating results for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022:\nFor the Year Ended December 31,\n(in thousands) % of Net sales Change\n2023 2022 2023 2022 $ %\nNet sales $ 65,373 $ 137,085 100.0% 100.0% (71.6) (52.3)%\nCost of sales 47,547 112,102 72.7% 81.8% (64.6) (57.6)%\nGross profit 17,826 24,983 27.3% 22.3% (7.2) (28.6)%\nOperating expenses:\nSalaries, benefits and payroll\ntaxes 17,454 31,290 26.7% 22.8% (13.8) (44.2)%\nGeneral and administrative 24,213 41,000 37.0% 29.9% (16.8) (40.9)%\nGoodwill and indefinite-lived\nintangibles impairment charge — 71,360 —% 52.1% (71.4) (100.0)%\nDefinite-lived intangibles\nimpairment charge — 50,694 —% 37.0% (50.7) (100.0)%\nPP&E impairment charge — 7,336 —% 5.4% (7.3) (100.0)%\nDepreciation and amortization 2,243 7,405 3.4% 5.4% (5.2) (69.7)%\nTotal operating expenses 43,910 209,085 67.2% 152.5% (165.2) (79.0)%\nLoss from operations (26,084) (184,102) (39.9)% (134.3)% 158.0 (85.8)%\nOther income(expense), net:\nInterest expense (5,450) (2,450) (8.3)% (1.8)% (3.0) 122.4%\nEmployee retention credits — 4,854 —% 3.5% (4.9) (100.0)%\nOther expense, net (791) (541) (1.2)% (0.4)% 0.3 (46.3)%\nTotal other (expense) income, net (6,241) 1,863 (9.5)% 1.4% (8.1) (435.0)%\nLoss before income taxes (32,325) (182,239) (49.4)% (132.9)% 149.9 (82.3)%\n(Benefit from) provision for\nincome taxes — (13) —% —% — (100.0)%\nNet loss (32,325) (182,226) (49.4)% (132.9)% 149.9 (81.8)%\nNet (loss) income attributable to\nnon-control interest (150) (12,717) (0.2)% (9.3)% 12.6 (98.8)%\nNet loss attributable to Greenlane\nHoldings, Inc. $ (32,175) $ (169,509) (49.2)% (123.7)% 137.3 (81.0)%\nConsolidated Results of Operations\nNet Sales\nFor the year ended December 31, 2023, total net sales were approximately $65.4 million, compared to approximately $137.1 million for the year ended December 31,\n2022, representing a decrease of $71.7 million, or 52.3%. The year-over-year decrease was a result of the Industrial segment transitioning to a commission revenue model\nversus gross revenue previously recorded for the largest vaporizer product customers and discontinuing the packaging products business. The Consumer segment sales\ndecreased due to declining business globally, reduction in sales staff and marketing spend and the company was out of stock for high demand inventory items due to capital\nrestrictions to invest in inventory purchases.\n50\nCost of Sales and Gross Margin\nFor the year ended December 31, 2023, cost of sales decreased by $64.6 million, or 57.6%, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2022. The decrease in cost of\nsales is aligned with the decrease in revenue of 52.3%.\nGross margin increased by 5% to 27.3% for the year ended December 31, 2023, compared to gross margin of 22.3% for the same period in 2022. The increase in gross\nmargins is related to transitioning to a commission revenue model for the majority of the vaporizer sales with 100% margin versus gross revenue with lower margins. Also\ncontributing to the increase in margin is the Company’s continued focus on consumer in-house brands with higher margins and moving away from third-party brands with\nlower margins.\nSalaries, Benefits and Payroll Taxes\nSalaries, benefits and payroll taxes expenses decreased by approximately $13.8 million, or 44.2% , to $17.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, compared\nto $31.3 million for the same period in 2022. The decrease is related to a major restructuring effort by the company to reduce headcount and cost to align with revenue.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nGeneral and administrative expenses decreased by approximately $16.8 million, or 40.9%, for the year ended December 31, 2023, compared to the same period in\n2022. The decrease is related to a major reduction in expenses across to align with revenue\nGoodwill and Indefinite-Lived Intangibles Impairment Charge\nWe incurred a goodwill and indefinite-lived intangibles impairment charge of approximately $71.4 million and a definite-lived intangibles impairment charge of\napproximately $50.7 million during the twelve months ended December 31, 2022, compared to no such impairment charge for the comparable period in 2023. We incurred a\nimpairment charge of approximately $7.3 million to fixed assets related to the ERP system during the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to no such impairment charge\nfore the comparable year in 2023. This impairment charges were due to declining business and declining enterprise value.\nDepreciation and Amortization Expense\nDepreciation and amortization expense decreased $5.2 million, or 69.7%, for the year ended December 31, 2023, compared to the same period in 2022. The decrease is\nprimarily related to the intangible and fixed asset impairments recorded as of December 31, 2023, reducing amortization expense.\nOther Income (Expense), Net\nInterest expense.\nInterest expense increased approximately $3.0 million during the fiscal year 2023 versus fiscal year 2022. The increase is primarily related to the exiting ABL facility\nwhich accelerated deferred interest expense as well as the promissory notes for the Eyce and DaVinci acquisition.\nOther expense, net.\nOther expense, net, increased by approximately $0.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, for slight changes to non-recurring costs during the year ended\nDecember 31, 2023.\nSegment Operating Performance\nFollowing the completion of the KushCo merger in late August 2021, we reassessed our operating segments based on our new organizational structure. Based on this\nassessment, we determined we had two operating segments as of December 31, 2021, which are the same as our reportable segments: (1) Consumer Goods, which largely\ncomprises Greenlane’s legacy operations across the United States, Canada, and Europe, and (2) Industrial Goods, which largely comprises KushCo’s legacy operations. These\nchanges in operating segments align with how we manage our business as of the fourth quarter of 2023.\nThe Consumer Goods segment focuses on serving consumers across wholesale, retail and e-commerce operations—through both our proprietary brands, including\nEyce, DaVinci, Marley Natural, Keith Haring, and Higher Standards, as well as lifestyle products and accessories from leading brands, like Storz and Bickel, Grenco Science,\nand many more. The Consumer Goods segment forms a central part of our growth strategy, especially as it relates to scaling our own portfolio of higher-margin proprietary\nowned brands.\n51\nThe Industrial Goods segment focuses on serving the premier cannabis brands, operators, and retailers through our wholesale operations by providing ancillary\nproducts essential to their growth, such as customizable packaging and supply products, which includes our Greenlane Brand Pollen Gear and vaporization solutions offering\nwhich includes CCELL branded products.\nOur “Chief Operations Decision Marker (“CODM”) allocates resources to and assesses the performance of our two operating segments based on the operating\nsegments’ net sales and gross profit. The following table sets forth information by reportable segment for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022:\n% of Total Net sales Change\n2023 2022 2023 2022 $ %\nNet sales:\nConsumer Goods $ 28,737 $ 48,134 43.9% 35.1% $ (19,397) (40.3)%\nIndustrial Goods 36,636 88,951 56.0% 64.9% (52,315) (58.8)%\nTotal net sales $ 65,373 $ 137,085\n% of Segment Net sales Change\nCost of sales: 2023 2022 2023 2022 $ %\nConsumer Goods $ 18,754 $ 38,531 65.3% 80.0% $ (19,777) (51.3)%\nIndustrial Goods 28,793 73,571 78.6% 82.7% (44,778) (60.9)%\nTotal cost of sales $ 47,547 $ 112,102\nGross profit:\nConsumer Goods $ 9,983 $ 9,603 34.7% 20.0% $ 380 13.2%\nIndustrial Goods 7,843 15,380 21.4% 17.3% (7,537) (20.6)%\nTotal gross profit $ 17,826 $ 24,983\nConsumer Goods\nFor the year ended December 31, 2023, our Consumer Goods operating segment reported net sales of approximately $28.7 million compared to approximately $48.1\nmillion for the same period in 2022, representing a decrease of $19.4 million or 40.3%. The 2023 decline in the Consumer Goods segment is due to a major restructuring effort\nby the Company during fiscal year 2023 to reduce sales and marketing cost to align with revenue, sale of the Company’s minority interest in Vibes brand and a shift in strategy\nto focus on in-house brands that have a higher margin profile and rationalized third-party brand offering generating top line revenue with lower margins.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2023, cost of sales decreased by $19.8 million, or 51.3%, as compared to the same period in 2022. The decrease in cost of sales was\nprimarily due to the 40.3% decrease in Consumer Goods net sales.\nGross margin increased to approximately 34.7% for the year ended December 31, 2023, compared to gross margin of approximately 20.0% for the same period in\n2022, as the Company has shifted focus on margins versus overall topline revenues in an effort to move to a net positive operating cash flow.\nIndustrial Goods\nFor the year ended December 31, 2023, our Industrial Goods operating segment reported net sales of approximately $36.6 million compared to approximately $89.0\nmillion for the same period in 2022, representing an decrease of $52.3 million or (58.8%). The year-over-year decrease was a result of the Industrial segment transitioning to a\ncommission revenue model versus gross revenue previously recorded for the largest vaporizer product customers and discontinuing the packaging products business.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2023, cost of sales decreased by $44.8 million, or 60.9%, as compared to the same period in 2022. The decrease is consistent with\nour overall decrease in revenues.\nGross margin was approximately 21.4% for the year ended December 31, 2023, compared to gross margin of approximately 17.3% for the same period in 2022,\nrepresenting 4.1% year over year increase.\n52\nNet Sales by Geographic Regions\nYear Ended December 31,\n% of Net sales Change\n2023 2022 2023 2022 $ %\nNet sales:\nUnited States $ 58,539 $ 126,333 89.5% 92.2% $ (67,794) (53.7)%\nCanada 1,291 5,810 1.9% 4.2% (4,519) (77.8)%\nEurope 5,072 4,942 7.8% 3.6% 130 2.6%\nTotal net sales $ 65,373 $ 137,085 100.0% 100.0% $ (71,712) (52.3)%\nFor the year ended December 31, 2023, our United States net sales to customers in the United States were approximately $58.5 million, compared to approximately\n$126.3 million for the same period in 2022, representing a decrease of $67.8 million, or 53.7%. The year-over-year decrease was primarily due to an overall business decline in\nthe Industrial and Consumer Goods segments as described above.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2023, our Canadian net sales were approximately $1.3 million, compared to approximately $5.8 million for the same period in 2022,\nrepresenting a decrease of $4.5 million, or 77.8%. The year-over-year decrease was primarily due to an overall business decline in the Industrial and Consumer Goods segments\nas described above.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2023, our European net sales were approximately $5.1 million, compared to approximately $4.9 million for the same period in 2022,\nrepresenting an increase of $0.11 million, or 2.6%.\nLiquidity, Capital Resources and Going Concern\nOur primary requirements for liquidity and capital are working capital, debt service related to recent acquisitions and general corporate needs. Our primary sources of\nliquidity are our cash on hand and the cash flow that we generate from our operations, as well as proceeds other equity issuances. As of December 31, 2023, we had\napproximately $0.5 million of cash, of which none was restricted and $0.1 million was held in foreign bank accounts, and approximately $3.7 million of working capital, which\nis calculated as total current assets minus total current liabilities, as compared to approximately $6.5 million of cash, of which $0.8 million was held in foreign bank accounts,\nand approximately $41.0 million of working capital as of December 31, 2022. The repatriation of cash balances from our foreign subsidiaries could have adverse tax impacts or\nbe subject to capital controls; however, these balances are generally available to fund the ordinary business operations of our foreign subsidiaries without legal or other\nrestrictions.\nWe believe that our cash on hand and the cash flow that we generate from our operations will not be sufficient to fund our working capital and capital expenditure\nrequirements, as well as our debt repayments and other liquidity requirements associated with our existing operations, for the next 12 months. Based on our cash on hand and\nworking capital at December 31, 2023, we may have insufficient cash to fund planned operations into the third quarter of 2024. This is evident from our continued efforts to\nraise capital and leverage external funding to fulfill our capital needs as highlighted below.\nOur primary requirements for liquidity and capital are working capital, debt service related to recent acquisitions and general corporate needs. Our primary sources of\nliquidity are our cash on hand and the cash flow that we generate from our operations, as well as proceeds from equity issuances, such as our June 2022, October 2022 and July\n2023 Offerings, each as described and defined below.\nATM Program and Shelf Registration Statement\nWe formerly used a shelf registration statement on Form S-3 (the “Shelf Registration Statement”) to conduct securities offerings. In August 2021, we filed a prospectus\nsupplement and established an “at-the-market” equity offering program (the “ATM Program”) that provided for the sale of shares of our Class A common stock having an\naggregate offering price of up to $50 million, from time to time. H\nSince the launch of the ATM program in August 2021 and through December 31, 2022, we sold shares of our Class A common stock which generated gross proceeds\nof approximately $12.7 million and we paid fees to the sales agent of approximately $0.4 million. Due to the untimely filing of certain of our Quarterly and Annual Reports, we\nare unable to issue additional shares of Class A common stock pursuant to the ATM Program or otherwise use the Shelf Registration Statement.\n53\nCommon Stock and Warrant Offerings\nOn June 27, 2022, we entered into a securities purchase agreement with an accredited investor, pursuant to which we agreed to issue and sell an aggregate of 58,500\nshares of our Class A common stock, pre-funded warrants to purchase up to 49,500 shares of our Class A common stock (the “June 2022 Pre-Funded Warrants”) and warrants to\npurchase up to 108,000 shares of our Class A common stock (the “June 2022 Standard Warrants” and, together with the June 2022 Pre-Funded Warrants, the “June 2022\nWarrants”), in a registered direct offering (the “June 2022 Offering”). The June 2022 Offering generated gross proceeds of approximately $5.4 million and net proceeds to the\nCompany of approximately $5.0 million. All June 2022 Pre-Funded Warrants were exercised in July 2022, for de minimis net proceeds.\nOn October 27, 2022, we entered into securities purchase agreements with certain investors, pursuant to which we agreed to issue and sell an aggregate of 695,555\nshares of our Class A common stock, pre-funded warrants to purchase up to 137,778 shares of our Class A Common Stock (the “October 2022 Pre-Funded Warrants”) and\nwarrants to purchase up to 1,666,667 shares of our Class A common stock (the “October 2022 Standard Warrants”). The October 2022 units were offered pursuant to a\nRegistration Statement on Form S-1 (the “October 2022 Offering”). The October 2022 Offering generated gross proceeds of approximately $7.5 million and net proceeds to the\nCompany of approximately $6.8 million.\nOn June 29, 2023, we entered into securities purchase agreements with certain investors, pursuant to which we agreed to issue and sell an aggregate of 560,476 shares\nof our Class A common stock, pre-funded warrants to purchase up to 3,487,143 shares of our Class A Common Stock (the “July 2023 Pre-Funded Warrants”) and warrants to\npurchase up to 8,095,238 shares of our Class A common stock (the “July 2023 Standard Warrants”). The July 2023 units were offered pursuant to a Registration Statement on\nForm S-1 (the “July 2023 Offering”). The July 2023 Offering generated gross proceeds of approximately $4.3 million and net proceeds to the Company of approximately $3.8\nmillion and closed on July 3, 2023.\nAsset-Based Loan\nOn August 9, 2022, we entered into an asset-based loan agreement dated as of August 8, 2022 (the “Loan Agreement”), which made available to the Company a term\nloan of up to $15.0 million. On February 9, 2023, we entered into Amendment No. 2 to the Loan Agreement, in which we agreed to, among other things, voluntarily prepay\napproximately $6.6 million (inclusive of early termination fees and expenses) under the terms provided for under the Loan Agreement and the lenders under the Loan\nAgreement agreed to release $5.7 million in funds held in a blocked account pursuant to the terms of the Loan Agreement.\nOn August 7, 2023, we repaid the approximately $4.3 million in aggregate principal amount (the “Loan Repayment”) which remained outstanding under the terms of\nthe Loan Agreement. As a result of the Loan Repayment, the Company has been released from its obligations under the Loan Agreement, in accordance with the terms of the\nLoan Agreement. See “Note 6 - Long Term Debt” for more information.\nERC Sale\nOn February 16, 2023, two of our wholly owned subsidiaries, Warehouse Goods LLC and KIM International LLC, entered into an agreement with a third-party\ninstitutional investor pursuant to which the investor purchased, for approximately $4.85 million in cash, an economic participation interest, at a discount, in our rights to\npayment from the United States Internal Revenue Service for certain periods with respect to the employee retention credits filed by us under the Employee Retention Credit\nprogram.\nFuture Receivables Financings\nIn July, August, October, and November 2023, the Company received an aggregate of approximately $3.9 million in cash pursuant to the terms of future receivables\nfinancings (collectively, the “Future Receivables Financings”) entered into with two private lenders. See “Note 6 - Long Term Debt” for more information.\n54\nManagement Initiatives\nWe have completed several initiatives to optimize our working capital requirements. We launched Groove, a new, innovative Greenlane Brands product line, and we\nalso rationalized our third-party brands product offering, which enables us to reduce inventory carrying costs and working capital requirements.\nIn April 2023, we entered into two strategic. First, we entered into a strategic partnership (the “MJ Packaging Partnership”) with A&A Global Imports d/b/a\nMarijuanaPackaging.com (“MJ Pack”), a provider of packaging solutions to the cannabis industry. Second, we entered into a strategic partnership with an affiliate of one of our\nexisting vape suppliers (“Vape Partner”) to service certain key customers with vaporizer goods and services (the “Vape Partnership”). As part of the Vape Partnership, we will\nintroduce our Vape Partner to certain key customers, assist with the promotion and the sale of certain vaporizer goods and services, and help coordinate the logistics, storage\nand distribution of such vaporizer products. If our Vape Partner and key customer(s) enter into a direct relationship, the customers would directly purchase vaporizer goods and\nservices, which we currently sell them, directly from our Vape Partner and we would no longer need to purchase such vape inventory on behalf of such key customer(s). In\nexchange we would earn quarterly and annual commission payments from our strategic partners. While the strategic partnerships may result in a decrease in top line revenue for\nthese packaging and vape products, these partnerships combined with some of our other restructuring initiatives should allow us to reduce our overall cost-structure and\nenhance our margins, thereby improving our balance sheet.\nWe have successfully renegotiated supplier partnership terms and are continuing to improve working capital arrangements with suppliers. We have made progress\nconsolidating and streamlining our office, warehouse, and distribution operations footprint. We have reduced our workforce by approximately 49% throughout fiscal year 2023\nto reduce costs and align with our revenue projections.\nWe have incurred net losses of $32.3 million and $182.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. For the year ended December 31,\n2023, cash used in operating activities was $1.8 million and cash used in operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2022 was $26.4 million. The recent\nmacroeconomic environment has caused weaker demand than contemplated under our business plan, resulting in a reduction in projected revenue and cash flows for the\ntwelve-month period included in the going concern evaluation.\nAs a result of our losses and our projected cash needs, combined with our current liquidity level, substantial doubt exists about the Company’s ability to continue as a\ngoing concern. The Company’s ability to continue as a going concern is contingent upon successful execution of management’s intended plan over the next twelve months to\nimprove the Company’s liquidity and profitability, which includes, without limitation:\n■ Further reducing operating costs expense by taking additional restructuring actions to align cost with revenue to achieve profitability.\n■ Increasing revenue by introducing new products and acquiring new customers.\n■ Execute on strategic partnerships accretive to margins and operating cash\n■ Seeking additional capital through the issuance of debt or equity securities.\nOur opinions concerning liquidity are based on currently available information. To the extent this information proves to be inaccurate, or if circumstances change,\nfuture availability of trade credit or other sources of financing may be reduced and our liquidity could be adversely affected. Our future capital requirements and the adequacy\nof available funds will depend on many factors, including those described in the section titled “Risk Factors” in Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2023. Depending on the severity and direct impact of these factors on us, we may be unable to secure additional financing to meet our operating requirements on\nterms favorable to us, or at all.\nAs of December 31, 2023, we did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that are reasonably likely to have a material current or future effect on our financial\ncondition, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures, or capital resources.\n55\nCash Flows\nThe following summary of cash flows for the periods indicated has been derived from our consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-\nK:\nYear Ended December 31,\n(in thousands) 2023 2022\nNet cash provided by (used in) operating activities $ (1,793) $ (26,426)\nNet cash provided by (used in) investing activities 30 12,025\nNet cash (used in) provided by financing activities (10,140) 13,930\nNet Cash Used in Operating Activities\nDuring 2023, net cash used in operating activities of approximately $1.8 million was a result of a net loss of $32.3 million offset by non-cash adjustments to net loss of\n$6.5 million, including a $24.0 million increase in cash provided by working capital primarily driven by decreases in our accrued expenses and accounts payable, and decreases\nin inventories offset by higher other current assets.\nDuring 2022, net cash used in operating activities of approximately $26.4 million was a result of a net loss of $182.2 million offset by non-cash adjustments to net loss\nof $140.6 million, including an impairment charge related to goodwill and indefinite-lived intangibles of $71.4 million, and a $15.2 million increase in cash provided by\nworking capital primarily driven by decreases in our accrued expenses and accounts payable, and decreases in inventories offset by higher other current assets..\nNet Cash Provided by Investing Activities\nDuring 2023, net cash provided by investing activities of (i) approximately $0.1 million from $1.1 million of cash proceeds from the sale of certain equity securities\ninvestments, offset by approximately $1.0 million of cash used for capital expenditures, including development costs for our new enterprise resource planning system.\nDuring 2022, net cash provided by investing activities of (i) approximately $12.0 million of cash proceeds from the sale of our assets held for sale, (ii) approximately\n$4.6 million of cash proceeds from the disposition of our interests in VIBES, and (iii) approximately $0.6 million of cash proceeds from the sale of certain equity securities\ninvestments, offset by approximately $2.8 million of cash used for capital expenditures, including development costs for our new enterprise resource planning system.\nNet Cash (Used in) Provided by Financing Activities\nDuring 2023, net cash used in financing activities primarily consisted of (i) approximately $3.9 million of cash proceeds from the issuance of Class A common stock\nrelated to our July 2023 Offering, (ii) approximately $3.9 million of cash proceeds from our future receivables financing, (iii) $2.1 million of cash proceeds from a secured\nbridge loan, offset by (iv) approximately $0.3 million of cash used for contingent consideration payments, (v) and approximately $2.1 million of cash used for repayments\nrelated to the Eyce and DaVinci promissory notes, and (vi) the $15.0 million payoff of asset based lending loans.\nDuring 2022, net cash provided by financing activities primarily consisted of (i) approximately $21.1 million of cash proceeds from the issuance of Class A common\nstock related to our ATM Program, the June 2022 Offering and the October 2022 Offering, (2) approximately $14.6 million of cash proceeds from our Asset-Based Loan, offset\nby debt issuance costs of $1.5 million, and (iii) approximately $0.9 million of cash used for contingent consideration payments, (iv) and approximately $19.4 million of cash\nused for repayments related to the Eyce and DaVinci promissory notes, the payoff of the Real Estate Note, and repayment of our bridge loan.\nITEM 7A.

(the “Company”) as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the related consolidated\nstatements of operations and comprehensive loss, stockholders’ equity and cash flows for each of the two years in the period ended December 31, 2023, and the related notes\n(collectively referred to as the “financial statements”). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of\nDecember 31, 2023 and 2022, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the two years in the period ended December 31, 2023, in conformity with\naccounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\nGoing Concern\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As more fully described in Note 1, the\nCompany has incurred significant losses and needs to raise additional funds to meet its obligations and sustain its operations. These conditions raise substantial doubt about the\nCompany’s ability to continue as a going concern. Management’s plans in regard to these matters are also described in Note 2. The consolidated financial statements do not\ninclude any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s financial statements based on our\naudits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (“PCAOB”) and are required to be independent with\nrespect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the\nPCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about\nwhether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an\naudit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the\npurpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.\nOur audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures\nthat respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also\nincluded evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We\nbelieve that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\n/s/ Marcum LLP\nMarcum LLP\nWe have served as the Company’s auditor since 2021.\nCosta Mesa, CA\nJuly 18, 2024\nF-1\nGREENLANE HOLDINGS, INC.\nCONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS\n(in thousands, except par value per share amounts)\nDecember 31, 2023 December 31, 2022\nASSETS\nCurrent assets\nCash $ 463 $ 6,458\nRestricted cash — 5,718\nAccounts receivable, net of allowance of $2,209 and $4,826 at December 31, 2023 and 2022,\nrespectively 1,693 6,468\nInventories, net 20,529 40,643\nVendor deposits 3,765 6,296\nOther current assets (Note 8) 3,319 11,120\nTotal current assets 29,769 76,703\nProperty and equipment, net 2,476 3,962\nOperating lease right-of-use assets 1,936 3,442\nOther assets 3,912 5,578\nTotal assets $ 38,093 $ 89,685\nLIABILITIES\nCurrent liabilities\nAccounts payable $ 12,103 $ 14,953\nAccrued expenses and other current liabilities (Note 8) 3,056 11,882\nCustomer deposits 2,775 3,983\nCurrent portion of notes payable 7,283 3,185\nCurrent portion of operating leases 866 1,528\nCurrent portion of finance leases 7 128\nTotal current liabilities 26,090 35,659\nNotes payable, less current portion and debt issuance costs, net — 13,040\nOperating leases, less current portion 1,010 1,887\nFinance leases, less current portion — 29\nOther liabilities 1 79\nTotal long-term liabilities 1,011 15,035\nTotal liabilities 27,101 50,694\nCommitments and contingencies (Note 7)\nSTOCKHOLDERS’ EQUITY*\nPreferred stock, $0.0001 par value, 10,000 shares authorized, none issued and outstanding — —\nClass A common stock, $0.01 par value per share, 600,000 shares authorized, 3,726 shares issued and\noutstanding as of December 31, 2023; 600,000 shares authorized, and 1,599 shares issued and\noutstanding as of December 31, 2022 * 36 15\nClass B common stock, $0.0001 par value per share, 30,000 shares authorized, and 0 shares issued and\noutstanding as of December 31, 2023; 30,000 shares authorized, and 0 shares issued and outstanding as\nof December 31, 2022* — —\nAdditional paid-in capital* 268,132 264,017\nAccumulated deficit (257,289) (225,114)\nAccumulated other comprehensive income 245 55\nTotal stockholders’ equity attributable to Greenlane Holdings, Inc. 11,124 38,973\nNon-controlling interest (132) 18\nTotal stockholders’ equity 10,992 38,991\nTotal liabilities and stockholders’ equity $ 38,093 $ 89,685\n*After giving effect to the Reverse Stock Splits -

BUSINESS OPERATIONS AND ORGANIZATION\nOrganization\nGreenlane Holdings, Inc. (“Greenlane” and, collectively with the Operating Company (as defined below) and its consolidated subsidiaries, the “Company”, “we”, “us”, and\n“our”) was formed as a Delaware corporation on May 2, 2018. We are a holding company that was formed for the purpose of completing an underwritten initial public offering\n(“IPO”) of shares of our Class A common stock, $0.01 par value per share (“Class A common stock”), in order to carry on the business of Greenlane Holdings, LLC (the\n“Operating Company”). The Operating Company was organized under the laws of the state of Delaware on September 1, 2015, and is based in Boca Raton, Florida. Unless the\ncontext otherwise requires, references to the “Company” refer to us, and our consolidated subsidiaries, including the Operating Company.\nWe merchandise premium cannabis accessories, child-resistant packaging, specialty vaporization solutions and lifestyle products in the United States, Canada, Europe and Latin\nAmerica, serving a diverse and expansive customer base with thousands of retail locations, licensed cannabis dispensaries, smoke shops, multi-state operators (“MSOs”),\nspecialty retailers, and retail consumers through both our e-commerce platforms and our flagship Higher Standards store in New York City’s famed Chelsea Market.\nWe have been developing a portfolio of our own proprietary brands (the “Greenlane Brands”) that we believe will, over time, deliver higher margins and create long-term value\nfor our customers and shareholders. Our wholly-owned Greenlane Brands includes Groove – our recently launched more affordable product line and Higher Standards – our\npremium smoke shop and ancillary product brand, and our award winning Vapor.com website and brand. We also have category exclusive licenses for the premium Marley\nNatural branded products, as well as the K.Haring branded products.\nWe are the sole manager of the Operating Company and our principal asset is Common Units of the Operating Company (“Common Units”). As the sole manager of the\nOperating Company, we operate and control all of the business and affairs of the Operating Company, and we conduct our business through the Operating Company and its\nsubsidiaries. We have a board of directors and executive officers, but no employees. All of our assets are held and all of the employees are employed by wholly owned\nsubsidiaries of the Operating Company.\nWe have the sole voting interest in, and control the management of, the Operating Company, and we have the obligation to absorb losses of, and receive benefits from, the\nOperating Company, that could be significant. We determined that the Operating Company is a variable interest entity (“VIE”) and that we are the primary beneficiary of the\nOperating Company. Accordingly, pursuant to the VIE accounting model, beginning in the fiscal quarter ended June 30, 2019, we consolidated the Operating Company in our\nconsolidated financial statements and reported a non-controlling interest related to the Common Units held by the members of the Operating Company (other than the Common\nUnits held by us) on our consolidated financial statements.\nOn August 31, 2021, we completed our previously announced merger with KushCo Holdings, Inc. (“KushCo”) and have included the results of operations of KushCo in our\nconsolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss from that date forward. In connection with the merger with KushCo, the Greenlane Certificate of Incorporation\nwas amended and restated (the “A&R Charter”) in order to (i) increase the number of authorized shares of Greenlane Class B common stock, $0.0001 par value per share (the\n“Class B Common stock”), from 10 million shares to 30 million shares in order to effect the conversion of each outstanding share of Class C common stock, $0.0001 par value\nper share (the “Class C common stock”), into one-third of one share of Class B common stock, (ii) increase the number of authorized shares of Class A common stock from 125\nmillion shares to 600 million shares, and (iii) eliminate references to the Class C common stock. Pursuant to the terms of an Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of March\n31, 2021 (the “Merger Agreement”) with KushCo, immediately prior to the consummation of the business combination, holders of Class C common stock received one-third of\none share of Class B common stock for each share of Class C common stock held immediately prior to the closing of the merger.\nOur corporate structure is commonly referred to as an “Up-C” structure. The Up-C structure allows the Operating Company to continue to realize tax benefits associated with\nowning interests in an entity that is treated as a partnership, or “pass-through” entity. One of these benefits is that future taxable income of the Operating Company that is\nallocated to its members will be taxed on a flow-through basis and therefore will not be subject to corporate taxes at the Operating Company entity level. Additionally, because\na member may redeem their Common Units for shares of Class A common stock on a one-for-one basis or, at our option, for cash, the Up-C structure also provides the member\nwith potential liquidity that holders of non-publicly traded limited liability companies are not typically afforded.\nF-7\nIn connection with the IPO, we entered into a Tax Receivable Agreement (the “TRA”) with the Operating Company and the Operating Company’s members and a Registration\nRights Agreement (the “Registration Rights Agreement”) with the Operating Company’s members. The TRA provides for the payment by us to the Operating Company’s\nmember(s) of 85.0% of the amount of tax benefits, if any, that we may actually realize (or in some cases, are deemed to realize) as a result of (i) the step-up in tax basis in our\nshare of the Operating Company’s assets resulting from the redemption of Common Units under the mechanism described above and (ii) certain other tax benefits attributable\nto payments made under the TRA. Pursuant to the Registration Rights Agreement, we have agreed to register the resale of shares of Class A common stock that are issuable to\nthe Operating Company’s members upon redemption or exchange of their Common Units.\nThe A&R Charter and the Fourth Amended and Restated Operating Agreement of the Operating Company (the “Operating Agreement”) require that (a) we at all times maintain\na ratio of one Common Unit owned by us for each share of our Class A common stock issued by us (subject to certain exceptions), and (b) the Operating Company at all times\nmaintains (i) a one-to-one ratio between the number of shares of our Class A common stock issued by us and the number of Common Units owned by us, and (ii) a one-to-one\nratio between the number of shares of our Class B common stock owned by the non-founder members of the Operating Company and the number of Common Units owned by\nthe non-founder members of the Operating Company.\nAs of December 31, 2022, all Common Units of the Operating Company and Class B common stock had been exchanged for Class A common stock, and we owned 100% of\nthe voting and economic interests in Greenlane through the holders’ ownership of Class A common stock. See “Note 9 - Stockholder’s Equity.”\nReverse Stock Splits\nOn August 4, 2022, we filed a Certificate of Amendment (the “Certificate of Amendment”) to the A&R Charter with the Secretary of State of the State for Delaware (the\n“SSSD”), which effected a one-for-twenty reverse stock split (the “2022 Reverse Stock Split”) of our issued and outstanding shares of Class A common stock and Class B\ncommon stock (collectively, the “Common Stock”) at 5:01 PM Eastern Time on August 9, 2022. As a result of the 2022 Reverse Stock Split, every 20 shares of Common Stock\nissued and outstanding were converted into one share of Common Stock. We paid cash in lieu of fractional shares, and accordingly, no fractional shares were issued in\nconnection with the 2022 Reverse Stock Split.\nOn June 2, 2023, we filed a Certificate of Amendment to the A&R Charter with the SSSD, which effected a one-for-ten reverse stock split (the “2023 Reverse Stock Split” and\ntogether with the 2022 Reverse Stock Split, the “Reverse Stock Splits”) of our issued and outstanding shares of Common Stock at 5:01 PM Eastern Time on June 5, 2023. As a\nresult of the 2023 Reverse Stock Split, every ten shares of common stock issued and outstanding were converted into one share of common stock. We paid cash in lieu of\nfractional shares, and accordingly, no fractional shares were issued in connection with the 2023 Reverse Stock Split.\nThe Reverse Stock Splits did not change the par value of the Common Stock or the authorized number of shares of Common Stock. All outstanding options, restricted stock\nawards, warrants and other securities entitling their holders to purchase or otherwise receive shares of our Common Stock have been adjusted as a result of the Reverse Stock\nSplits, as required by the terms of each security. The number of shares available to be awarded under our Amended and Restated 2019 Equity Incentive Plan have also been\nappropriately adjusted. See “Note 10 — Compensation Plans” for more information.\nAll share and per share amounts in these consolidated financial statements and notes thereto have been retroactively adjusted for all periods presented to give effect to the\nReverse Stock Splits, including reclassifying an amount equal to the reduction in par value of Common Stock to additional paid-in capital.\nLiquidity and Going Concern\nPursuant to ASC 205-40, Presentation of Financial Statements — Going Concern (“ASC 205-40”), management must evaluate whether there are conditions and events,\nconsidered in the aggregate, that raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern for one year after the date that these condensed consolidated\nfinancial statements are issued. In accordance with ASC 205-40, management’s analysis can only include the potential mitigating impact of management’s plans that have not\nbeen fully implemented as of the issuance date if (a) it is probable that management’s plans will be effectively implemented on a timely basis, and (b) it is probable that the\nplans, when implemented, will alleviate the relevant conditions or events that raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern.\nOur primary requirements for liquidity and capital are working capital, debt service related to recent acquisitions and general corporate needs. Our primary sources of liquidity\nare our cash on hand and the cash flow that we generate from our operations, as well as proceeds from equity issuances, such as our June 2022, October 2022, and July 2023\nofferings, each as described and defined below.\nF-8\nATM Program and Shelf Registration Statement\nWe formerly used a shelf registration statement on Form S-3 (the “Shelf Registration Statement”) to conduct securities offerings from time to time in order to meet our liquidity\nneeds. In August 2021, we filed a prospectus supplement and established an “at-the-market” equity offering program (the “ATM Program”) that provided for the sale of shares\nof our Class A common stock having an aggregate offering price of up to $50 million, from time to time.\nSince the launch of the ATM program in August 2021 and through December 31, 2022, we sold shares of our Class A common stock which generated gross proceeds of\napproximately $12.7 million and we paid fees to the sales agent of approximately $0.4 million. Due to the untimely filing of certain of our Quarterly and Annual Reports 3, we\nare unable to issue additional shares of Class A common stock pursuant to the ATM Program or otherwise use the Shelf Registration Statement, which will limit our liquidity\noptions in the capital markets\nCommon Stock and Warrant Offerings.\nOn June 27, 2022, we entered into a securities purchase agreement with an accredited investor, pursuant to which we agreed to issue and sell an aggregate of 585,000 shares of\nour Class A common stock, pre-funded warrants to purchase up to 495,000 shares of our Class A common stock (the “June 2022 Pre-Funded Warrants”) and warrants to\npurchase up to 1,080,000 shares of our Class A common stock (the “June 2022 Standard Warrants” and, together with the June 2022 Pre-Funded Warrants, the “June 2022\nWarrants”), in a registered direct offering (the “June 2022 Offering”). The June 2022 Offering generated gross proceeds of approximately $5.4 million and net proceeds to the\nCompany of approximately $5.0 million. All June 2022 Pre-Funded Warrants were exercised in July 2022, for de minimis net proceeds.\nOn October 27, 2022, we entered into securities purchase agreements with certain investors, pursuant to which we agreed to issue and sell an aggregate of 695,555 shares of our\nClass A common stock, pre-funded warrants to purchase up to 137,778 shares of our Class A Common Stock (the “October 2022 Pre-Funded Warrants”) and warrants to\npurchase up to 1,666,667 shares of our Class A common stock(the “October 2022 Standard Warrants”). The October 2022 units were offered pursuant to a Registration\nStatement on Form S-1 (the “October 2022 Offering”). The October 2022 Offering generated gross proceeds of approximately $7.5 million and net proceeds to the Company of\napproximately $6.8 million.\nOn June 29, 2023, we entered into securities purchase agreements with certain investors, pursuant to which we agreed to issue and sell an aggregate of 560,476 shares of our\nClass A common stock, pre-funded warrants to purchase up to 3,487,143 shares of our Class A Common Stock (the “July 2023 Pre-Funded Warrants”) and warrants to purchase\nup to 8,095,238 shares of our Class A common stock (the“July 2023 Standard Warrants”). The July 2023 units were offered pursuant to a Registration Statement on Form S-1\n(the “July 2023 Offering”). The July 2023 Offering generated gross proceeds of approximately $4.3 million and net proceeds to the Company of approximately $3.8 million and\nclosed on July 3, 2023.\nAsset-Based Loan\nOn August 9, 2022, we entered into an asset-based loan agreement dated as of August 8, 2022 (the “Loan Agreement”), which made available to the Company a term loan of up\nto $15.0 million. On February 9, 2023, we entered into Amendment No. 2 to the Loan Agreement, in which we agreed to, among other things, voluntarily prepay approximately\n$6.6 million (inclusive of early termination fees and expenses) under the terms provided for under the Loan Agreement and the lenders under the Loan Agreement agreed to\nrelease $5.7 million in funds held in a blocked account pursuant to the terms of the Loan Agreement.\nOn August 7, 2023, we repaid the approximately $4.3 million in aggregate principal amount (the “Loan Repayment”) which remained outstanding under the terms of the Loan\nAgreement. As a result of the Loan Repayment, the Company has been released from its obligations under the Loan Agreement, in accordance with the terms of the Loan\nAgreement. See “Note 6 - Long Term Debt” for more information.\nF-9\nERC Sale\nOn February 16, 2023, two of our wholly owned subsidiaries, Warehouse Goods LLC and Kim International LLC, entered into an agreement with a third-party institutional\ninvestor pursuant to which the investor purchased, for approximately $4.9 million in cash, an economic participation interest, at a discount, in our rights to payment from the\nUnited States Internal Revenue Service for certain periods with respect to the employee retention credits filed by us under the Employee Retention Credit program.\nFuture Receivables Financing\nIn July, August, October, and November 2023, the Company received an aggregate of approximately $3.9 million in cash pursuant to the terms of future receivables financings\n(collectively, the “Future Receivables Financings”) entered into with two private lenders. See “Note 6 - Long Term Debt” for more information.\nManagement Initiatives\nWe have completed several initiatives to optimize our working capital requirements. We launched Groove, a new, innovative Greenlane Brands product line, and we also\nrationalized and improved our third-party brands product offering, which enabled us to reduce inventory carrying costs and working capital requirements while increasing our\nofferings.\nIn April 2023, we entered into two strategic partnership. First, we entered into a strategic partnership (the “MJ Packaging Partnership”) with A&A Global Imports d/b/a\nMarijuanaPackaging.com (“MJ Pack”), a leading provider of packaging solutions to the cannabis industry. Second, we entered into a strategic partnership with an affiliate of\none of our existing vape suppliers (“Vape Partner”) to service certain key customers with vaporizer goods and services (the “Vape Partnership”). As part of the Vape\nPartnership, we will introduce our Vape Partner to certain key customers, assist with the promotion and the sale of certain vaporizer goods and services, and help coordinate the\nlogistics, storage and distribution of such vaporizer products. If our Vape Partner and key customer(s) enter into a direct relationship, the customers would directly purchase\nvaporizer goods and services, which we currently sell them, directly from our Vape Partner and we would no longer need to purchase such vape inventory on behalf of such key\ncustomer(s). In exchange we would earn quarterly and annual commission payments from our strategic partners. While the strategic partnerships may result in a decrease in top\nline revenue for these packaging and vape products, these partnerships combined with some of our other restructuring initiatives should allow us to reduce our overall cost-\nstructure and enhance our margins, thereby improving our balance sheet.\nWe have successfully renegotiated supplier partnership terms and are continuing to improve working capital arrangements with suppliers. We have made progress consolidating\nand streamlining our office, warehouse, and distribution operations footprint. We have reduced our workforce significantly to reduce costs and align with our revenue\nprojections.\nThe Company has incurred net losses of $32.3 million and $182.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. For the years ended December 31,\n2023 and 2022, cash used in operating activities were $1.8 million and $26.4 million, respectively. The recent macroeconomic environment has caused weaker demand than\ncontemplated under the Company’s business plan, resulting in a reduction in projected revenue and cash flows for the twelve-month period included in the going concern\nevaluation.\nAs a result of our losses and our projected cash needs, combined with our current liquidity level, substantial doubt exists about the Company’s ability to continue as a going\nconcern. The Company’s ability to continue as a going concern is contingent upon successful execution of management’s intended plan over the next twelve months to improve\nthe Company’s liquidity and profitability, which includes, without limitation:\n■Further reducing operating costs expense by taking additional restructuring actions to align cost with revenue to achieve profitability.\n■Increasing revenue by introducing new products and acquiring new customers.\n■Execute on strategic partnerships accretive to margins and operating cash\n■Seeking additional capital through the issuance of debt or equity securities.\nThe consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that may result from the outcome of this going concern uncertainty.\nF-10\nNOTE 2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nBasis of Presentation\nOur audited consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”)\nand with the instructions to Form 10-K and Article 8 of Regulation S-X.\nPrinciples of Consolidation\nOur consolidated financial statements include our accounts, the accounts of the Operating Company, and the accounts of the Operating Company’s consolidated subsidiaries.\nAll significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.\nUse of Estimates\nConformity with U.S. GAAP requires the use of estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes.\nThese estimates form the basis for judgments we make about the carrying values of our assets and liabilities, which are not readily apparent from other sources. We base our\nestimates and judgments on historical information and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. U.S. GAAP requires us to make\nestimates and judgments in several areas. Such areas include, but are not limited to the following: the collectability of accounts receivable; the allowance for slow-moving or\nobsolete inventory; the realizability of deferred tax assets; the fair value of contingent consideration arrangements; the useful lives property and equipment; the calculation of\nour VAT taxes receivable and VAT taxes, fines, and penalties payable; our loss contingencies, including our TRA liability; and the valuation and assumptions underlying equity-\nbased compensation. These estimates are based on management’s knowledge about current events and expectations about actions we may undertake in the future. The actual\nresults could differ materially from those estimates.\nSegment Reporting\nWe manage our global business operations through our operating and reportable business segments. As of December 31, 2023, we had two reportable operating business\nsegments: Industrial Goods and Consumer Goods. Our reportable segments have been identified based on how our chief operating decision maker (“CODM”), which is a\ncommittee comprised of our Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”) and our Chief Financial and Legal Officer (“CFO”), manages our business, makes resource allocation and\nevaluates operating decisions, and evaluate operating performance. See “Note 12—Segment Reporting.”\nBusiness Combinations\nOur business combinations are accounted for under the acquisition method of accounting in accordance with ASC Topic 805, Business Combinations (“ASC 805”). Under the\nacquisition method, we recognize 100% of the assets we acquire and liabilities we assume, regardless of the percentage we own, at their estimated fair values as of the date of\nacquisition. Any excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net assets and other identifiable intangible assets we acquire is recorded as goodwill. To the extent the\nfair value of the net assets we acquire, including other identifiable assets, exceeds the purchase price, a bargain purchase gain is recognized. The assets we acquire, and\nliabilities we assume from contingencies, are recognized at fair value if we can readily determine the fair value during the measurement period. The operating results of\nbusinesses we acquire are included in our consolidated statement of operations from the date of acquisition. Acquisition-related costs are expensed as incurred. See “Note 3—\nBusiness Acquisitions.”\nEquity-Based Compensation\nWe account for equity-based compensation grants of equity awards to employees in accordance with ASC Topic 718, Compensation — Stock Compensation. This standard\nrequires us to measure compensation expense based on the estimated fair value of share-based awards on the grant date and recognize as expense over the requisite service\nperiod, which is generally the vesting period. We estimate the fair value of stock options using the Black-Scholes model on the grant date. The Black-Scholes model requires us\nto use several variables to estimate the grant-date fair value of our equity-based compensation awards including expected term, expected volatility and risk-free interest rates.\nOur equity-based compensation costs are recognized using a graded vesting schedule. For liability-classified awards, we record fair value adjustments up to and including the\nsettlement date. Changes in the fair value of our equity-based compensation liability that occur during the requisite service period are recognized as compensation cost over the\nvesting period. Changes in the fair value of the equity-based compensation liability that occur after the end of the requisite service period but before settlement, are recognized\nas compensation cost of the period in which the change occurs. We account for forfeitures as they occur. See “Note 10—Compensation Plans.”\nF-11\nLoss Contingencies\nCertain conditions may exist which may result in a loss to us, but which will only be resolved when one or more future events occur or fail to occur. Management assesses such\ncontingent liabilities and such assessment inherently involves an exercise of judgment. In assessing loss contingencies related to legal proceedings that are pending against us,\nor unasserted claims that may result in such proceedings, we evaluate the perceived merits of any legal proceedings or unasserted claims as well as the perceived merits of the\namount of relief sought or expected to be sought therein.\nIf the assessment of a contingency indicates that it is probable that a material loss has been incurred and the amount of the liability is estimable, the liability would be accrued in\nour consolidated financial statements. If the assessment indicates that a potentially material loss contingency is not probable but is reasonably possible, or is probable but\ncannot be estimated, the nature of the contingent liability, together with an estimate of the range of possible loss, if determinable and material, would be disclosed.\nLoss contingencies considered remote are generally not disclosed. Unasserted claims that are not considered probable of being asserted and those for which an unfavorable\noutcome is not reasonably possible have not been disclosed.\nFair Value Measurements\nWe apply the provisions of ASC Topic 820, Fair Value Measurements, which defines fair value, establishes a framework for its measurement and expands disclosures about fair\nvalue measurements. Fair value is defined as the exchange price we would receive for an asset or an exit price we would pay to transfer a liability in the principal, or most\nadvantageous, market for our asset or liability in an orderly transaction with a market participant on the measurement date. We determine the fair market values of our financial\ninstruments based on the fair value hierarchy, which requires us to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair\nvalue. The following three levels of inputs may be used to measure fair value:\nLevel 1 — Observable inputs such as unadjusted, quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities at the measurement date.\nLevel 2 — Observable inputs other than Level 1 prices, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities; quoted prices in markets that are not active; or other\ninputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities.\nLevel 3 — Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities.\nThe carrying amounts of our financial instruments, including cash, accounts receivable, accounts payable, accrued expenses and short-term debt, are carried at historical cost\nbasis, which approximates their fair values because of their short-term nature. The fair value of our long-term debt is the estimated amount we would have to pay to repurchase\nthe debt, inclusive of any premium or discount attributable to the difference between the stated interest rate and market rate of interest at each balance sheet date. On a recurring\nbasis, we measure and record contingent consideration using fair value measurements in the accompanying consolidated financial statements. See “Note 4—Fair Value of\nFinancial Instruments.”\nWe also own equity securities of private entities, which do not have readily determinable fair values. We elected to measure these equity securities at cost minus impairment, if\nany. At each reporting period, we make a qualitative assessment considering impairment indicators to evaluate whether our investment is impaired. The equity securities are\nadjusted to fair value when an observable price change can be identified. See “Note 4—Fair Value of Financial Instruments.”\nCash\nFor purposes of reporting cash flows, we consider cash on hand, checking accounts, and savings accounts to be cash. We also consider all highly-liquid investments with\noriginal maturities of three months or less from the date of purchase to be cash equivalents. We place our cash with high credit quality financial institutions, which provide\ninsurance through the Federal Deposit Insurance Company. At times, the balance in our accounts may exceed federally insured limits. We perform periodic evaluations of the\nrelative credit standing of these institutions and do not expect any losses related to such concentrations. As of December 31, 2023, and 2022, approximately $0.1 million and\n$0.8 million, respectively, of our cash balances were in foreign bank accounts and uninsured. As of December 31, 2023, and 2022, we had no cash equivalents.\nRestricted Cash\nRestricted cash represents principally cash reserves that are maintained pursuant to the governing agreement of the Asset-Based Loan discussed in “Note 6 - Debt.”\nF-12\nAccounts Receivable, net\nAccounts receivable represent amounts due from customers for merchandise sales and are recorded when revenue is earned and are carried at the original invoiced amount less\nan allowance for any expected credit loss. An account is considered past due when payment has not been rendered by its due date based upon the terms of the sale. Generally,\naccounts receivable are due thirty days after the billing date. We maintain an allowance for credit losses to reserve for potentially uncollectible receivable amounts. In\nevaluating our ability to collect outstanding receivable balances, we consider various factors including the age of the balance, the creditworthiness of the customer, the\ncustomer’s current financial condition, current economic conditions, and other factors that may affect our ability to collect from customers. We write off accounts as\nuncollectible on a case-by-case basis. We pledge accounts receivable as collateral for our long-term debt, see “Note 6—Debt.”\nInventories, net\nInventories consist of finished goods that we value at the lower of cost or net realizable value on a weighted average cost basis for the majority of the inventory. We established\nan allowance for slow-moving or obsolete inventory based upon assumptions about future demands and market conditions. At December 31, 2023, and 2022, the reserve for\nobsolescence was approximately $9.5 million and $21.4 million, respectively. We pledge inventory as collateral for our long-term debt, see “Note 6— Debt.”\nVendor Deposits\nVendor deposits represent prepayments we make to vendors for inventory purchases. A significant number of vendors require us to prepay for inventory purchases.\nCustoms Bonds\nThe Company is required to obtain customs bonds to import goods into the United States to provide security for payment of duties, taxes and other fees incurred as a result of\nimporting goods. Customs bonds are included in “Other current assets” in our consolidated balance sheets, see “Note 8 - Supplemental Financial Statement Information.”\nAssets Held for Sale\nWe generally consider assets to be held for sale when (i) we commit to a plan to sell the assets, (ii) the assets are available for immediate sale in their present condition, (iii) we\nhave initiated an active program to locate a buyer and other actions required to complete the plan to sell the assets, (iv) consummation of the planned sale transaction is\nprobable, (v) the assets are being actively marketed for sale at a price that is reasonable in relation to their current fair value, (vi) the transaction is expected to qualify for\nrecognition as a completed sale, within one year, and (vii) significant changes to or withdrawal of the plan is unlikely. Following the classification of any depreciable assets\nwithin a disposal group as held for sale, we discontinue depreciating the asset and write down the asset to the lower of carrying value or fair market value less cost to sell, if\nneeded.\nProperty and Equipment, net\nWe state property and equipment at cost or, if acquired through a business combination, fair value at the date of acquisition. We calculate depreciation and amortization using\nthe straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, except for our leasehold improvements, which are depreciated over the shorter of their estimated useful\nlives or their related lease term. Upon the sale or retirement of assets, the cost and related accumulated depreciation are removed from our accounts and the resulting gain or\nloss is credited or charged to income. We expense costs for repairs and maintenance when incurred. Property and equipment includes assets recorded under finance leases, see\n“Note 5—Leases.” We pledge property and equipment as collateral for our long-term debt, see “Note 6—Long Term Debt.”\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets\nWe assess the recoverability of the carrying amount of our long lived-assets, including property and equipment and finite-lived intangibles, whenever events or changes in\ncircumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable. An impairment loss would be assessed when estimated undiscounted future\ncash flows from the operation and disposition of the asset group are less than the carrying amount of the asset group. Asset groups have identifiable cash flows and are largely\nindependent of other asset groups. Measurement of an impairment loss is based on the excess of the carrying amount of the asset group over its fair value.\nChanges in our future operations and business lines could affect the estimated undiscounted future cash flows from the operation of certain long-lived assets, such as customer\nrelationships, and may give rise to impairment losses in future periods.\nInvestments in Equity Securities\nOur investments in equity securities without readily determinable fair value consist of ownership interests in Airgraft Inc., Sun Grown Packaging, LLC (“Sun Grown”) and\nVapor Dosing Technologies, Inc. (“VIVA”). We determined that our ownership interests do not provide us with significant influence over the operations of these investments.\nAccordingly, we account for our investments in these entities as equity securities. Airgraft Inc., Sun Grown, and VIVA are private entities and their equity securities do not have\na readily determinable fair value. We elected to measure these securities under the measurement alternative election at cost minus impairment, if any, with adjustments through\nearnings for observable price changes in orderly transactions for the identical or similar investment of the same issuer. Investments in equity securities are included within\n“Other assets” in our consolidated balance sheets. See “Note 4—Fair Value of Financial Instruments.”\nF-13\nVendor Incentives and Rebates\nSales incentives we receive in the form of payments from vendors solely to reimburse us for acting as the vendors’ agent in redeeming a sales incentive that is between our\nvendor and our customers and end consumers are included in net sales in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss.\nWe also have agreements with certain vendors to receive volume rebates which are dependent upon reaching minimum purchase thresholds. When volume rebates can be\nreasonably estimated and it is probable that minimum purchase thresholds will be met, we record a portion of the rebate when or as we make progress towards the purchase\nthreshold. Amounts received from vendors relating to volume rebates are considered a reduction of the carrying value of our inventory and, therefore, such amounts are\nultimately recorded as a reduction of cost of goods sold in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss.\nForeign Currency Translation\nOur consolidated financial statements are presented in United States (U.S.) dollars. The functional currency of one of the Operating Company’s wholly-owned, Canada-based,\nsubsidiaries is the Canadian dollar. The functional currency of the Operating Company’s wholly-owned, Netherlands-based subsidiary is the Euro. The assets and liabilities of\nthese subsidiaries are translated into U.S. dollars at current exchange rate at each balance sheet date for assets and liabilities and an appropriate average exchange rate for each\napplicable period within our consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. Capital accounts are translated at their historical exchange rates when the capital\ntransactions occurred. The foreign currency translation adjustments are included in accumulated other comprehensive loss, a separate component of stockholders’ deficit in our\nconsolidated balance sheets. Other exchange gains and losses are reported within our consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss.\nComprehensive (Loss) Income\nComprehensive (loss) income includes net (loss) income as currently reported by us, adjusted for other comprehensive items. Other comprehensive items consist of foreign\ncurrency translation gains and losses and unrealized gains and losses on derivative financial instruments that qualify as hedges.\nAdvertising\nWe expense advertising costs as incurred and include them in general and administrative expenses in our consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss.\nAdvertising costs were approximately $1.2 million and $2.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2023, and 2022, respectively.\nIncome Taxes\nWe are a corporation subject to income taxes in the United States. Certain subsidiaries of the Operating Company are taxable separately from us. Our proportional share of the\nOperating Company’s subsidiaries’ provisions are included in our consolidated financial statements.\nAs of December 31, 2023 and 2022, we hold all the outstanding Common Units in the Operating Company and are the sole member. As a result, starting in 2023, 100% of the\nOperating Company’s US and state income and expenses will be included in our US and state tax returns.\nOur deferred income tax assets and liabilities are computed for differences between the tax basis and financial statement amounts that will result in taxable or deductible\namounts in the future. We compute deferred balances based on enacted tax laws and applicable rates for the periods in which the differences are expected to affect taxable\nincome. A valuation allowance is recognized for deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the net deferred tax assets will not be realized. In\nmaking such a determination, we consider all available positive and negative evidence, including future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, projected future\ntaxable income, tax-planning strategies, and results of recent\noperations. If we determine we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets for which a valuation allowance had been recorded, then we would adjust the deferred tax asset\nvaluation allowance, which would reduce our provision for income taxes.\nWe evaluate the tax positions taken on income tax returns that remain open and positions expected to be taken on the current year tax returns to identify uncertain tax positions.\nUnrecognized tax benefits on uncertain tax positions are recorded on the basis of a two-step process in which (1) we determine whether it is more likely than not that the tax\npositions will be sustained on the basis of the technical merits of the position and (2) for those tax positions that meet the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold, the largest\namount of tax benefit that is more than 50 percent likely to be realized is recognized. Interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits are recorded in income tax\nbenefit. We have no uncertain tax positions that qualify for inclusion in our consolidated financial statements. See “Note 11—Income Taxes.”\nF-14\nTax Receivable Agreement (TRA)\nWe entered into the TRA with the Operating Company and each of the members of the Operating Company that provides for the payment by the Operating Company to the\nmembers of 85% of the amount of tax benefits, if any, that we may actually realize (or in some circumstances are deemed to realize) as a result of (i) increases in tax basis\nresulting from any future redemptions that are funded by us or exchanges of Common Units as described above in “Note 1—Business Operations and Organization” and (ii)\ncertain other tax benefits attributable to payments made under the TRA.\nWe compute annual tax benefits by calculating the income taxes due, including such tax benefits, and the income taxes due without such benefits. The Operating Company\nexpects to benefit from the remaining 15% of any tax benefits that it may actually realize. The TRA payments are not conditioned upon any continued ownership interest in the\nOperating Company. The rights of each noncontrolling interest holder under the TRA are assignable to transferees of its interest in the Operating Company. The timing and\namount of aggregate payments due under the TRA may vary based on a number of factors, including the amount and timing of the taxable income the Operating Company\ngenerates each year and the applicable tax rate.\nWe periodically evaluate the realizability of the deferred tax assets resulting from the exchange of Common Units for our Class A common stock. If the deferred tax assets are\ndetermined to be realizable, we then assess whether payment of amounts under the TRA have become probable. If so, we record a TRA liability equal to 85% of such deferred\ntax assets. In subsequent periods, we assess the realizability of all of deferred tax assets subject to the TRA. If we determine that a deferred tax asset with a valuation allowance\nis realizable in a subsequent period, the related valuation allowance will be released and consideration of a corresponding TRA liability will be assessed. The realizability of\ndeferred tax assets, including those subject to the TRA, is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those deferred tax assets become\ndeductible and consideration of prudent and feasible tax-planning strategies.\nThe measurement of the TRA is accounted for as a contingent liability. Therefore, once we determine that a payment to a member of the Operating Company has become\nprobable and can be estimated, the estimated payment will be accrued. See “Note 11—Income Taxes.”\nRevenue Recognition\nRevenue is recognized when customers obtain control of goods and services promised by us. Revenue is measured based on the amount of consideration that we expect to\nreceive in exchange for those goods or services, reduced by promotional discounts and estimates for return allowances and refunds. Taxes collected from customers for\nremittance to governmental authorities are excluded from net sales.\nWe generate revenue primarily from the sale of finished products to customers, whereby each product unit represents a single performance obligation. We recognize revenue\nfrom product sales when the customer has obtained control of the products, which is either at point of sale or delivery to the customer, depending upon the specific terms and\nconditions of the arrangement, or at the point of sale for our retail store sales. We provide no warranty on products sold. Product warranty is provided by the manufacturers. For\ncertain product offerings such as child-resistant packaging, closed-system vaporization solutions and custom-branded retail products, we may receive a deposit from the\ncustomer (generally 25% - 50% of the total order cost, but the amount can vary by customer contract) when an order is placed by a customer. We typically complete these\norders within one to six months from the date of order, depending on the complexity of the customization and the size of the order, but the completion timeline can vary by\nproduct type and terms of sales with each customer. See “Note 8—Supplemental Financial Statement Information” for a summary of changes to our customer deposits liability\nbalance during the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022.\nWe estimate product returns based on historical experience and record them as a refund liability that reduces the net sales for the period. We analyze actual historical returns,\ncurrent economic trends and changes in order volume when evaluating the adequacy of our sales returns allowance in any reporting period. Our liability for returns, which is\nincluded within “Accrued expenses and other current liabilities” in our consolidated balance sheets, was approximately $0.1 million and $0.3 million as of December 31, 2023\nand 2022, respectively.\nWe elected to account for shipping and handling expenses that occur after the customer has obtained control of products as a fulfillment activity in cost of sales. Shipping and\nhandling fees charged to customers are included in net sales upon completion of our performance obligations. We apply the practical expedient provided for by the applicable\nrevenue recognition guidance by not adjusting the transaction price for significant financing components for periods less than one year. We also apply the practical expedient\nprovided by the applicable revenue recognition guidance based upon which we generally expense sales commissions when incurred because the amortization period is one year\nor less. Sales commissions are recorded within “Salaries, benefits and payroll tax expenses” in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss.\nF-15\nThe Company transitioned to a commission revenue model for the majority of the sales for the Industrial segment. The company operates as a sales agent servicing vape\ncustomers and receives a commission for these services. The company was previously working directly with these customers and recognizing gross revenue versus straight\ncommission revenue. The Company recognizes this fee on a periodic basis when the products have been shipped for the end consumer. In working with their partner, the\nCompany is not responsible for fulfilling a promise to provide the specified goods, does not establish the pricing with its partners customers, and does not have control over the\ngoods that will be shipped. As such, the Company is an agent and recognizes its revenue on a net basis for its service. The partner company pays Greenlane a negotiated\npercentage-based fee on a quarterly basis.\nOne customer represented approximately 21% and 22% of our net sales for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. As of December 31, 2023 the Company\nhas a concentration of credit risk with its accounts receivable balance as one customer represented approximately 11% of accounts receivable. As of December 31, 2022, the\nCompany had three customers who individually represented approximately 31%, 17% and 15% of accounts receivable, respectively.\nValue Added Taxes\nDuring the third quarter of 2020, as part of a global tax strategy review, we determined that our European subsidiaries based in the Netherlands, which we acquired on\nSeptember 30, 2019, had historically collected and remitted value added tax (“VAT”) payments, which related to direct-to-consumer sales to other European Union (“EU”)\nmember states, directly to the Dutch tax authorities. In connection with our subsidiaries’ payment of VAT to Dutch tax authorities rather than other EU member states, we may\nbecome subject to civil or criminal enforcement actions in certain EU jurisdictions, which could result in penalties.\nWe performed an analysis of the VAT overpayments to the Dutch tax authorities, which we expected to be refunded to us, and VAT payable to other EU member states,\nincluding potential fines and penalties. Based on this analysis, we recorded VAT payable of approximately $0.4 million and $0.4 million relating to this matter within “Accrued\nexpenses and other current liabilities” in our consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nPursuant to the purchase and sale agreement by which we acquired our European subsidiaries, the sellers are required to indemnify us against certain specified matters and\nlosses, including any and all liabilities, claims, penalties and costs incurred or sustained by us in connection with non-compliance with tax laws in relation to activities of the\nsellers. The indemnity (or indemnification receivable) is limited to an amount equal to the purchase price under the purchase and sale agreement. During the year ended\nDecember 31, 2022, we recognized a gain of approximately $2.0 million, respectively, within “general and administrative expenses” in our consolidated statements of\noperations and comprehensive loss, which represented the partial reversal of a charge previously recognized based on the difference between the VAT payable and the VAT\nreceivable and indemnification asset, as the indemnification asset became probable of recovery based on the reduction in our previously estimated VAT liability for penalties\nand interest based on our voluntary disclosure to, and ongoing settlement with, the relevant tax authorities in the EU member states.\nAs noted above, we have voluntarily disclosed VAT owed to several relevant tax authorities in the EU member states, and believe in doing so we will reduce our liability for\npenalties and interest. Nonetheless, we may incur expenses in future periods related to such matters, including litigation costs and other expenses to defend our position. The\noutcome of such matters is inherently unpredictable and subject to significant uncertainties. Refer to “Note 7—Commitments and Contingencies” for additional discussion\nregarding our contingencies.\nNet Loss Per Share\nBasic net loss per share of Class A common stock is computed by dividing net loss attributable to Greenlane by the weighted-average number of shares of Class A common\nstock outstanding during the period. Diluted net loss per share of Class A common stock is computed by dividing net loss attributable to Greenlane by the weighted-average\nnumber of shares of Class A common stock outstanding adjusted to give effect to potentially dilutive elements. See “Note 9—Stockholders’ Equity - Net Loss Per Share.”\nRecently Issued Accounting Guidance\nIn June 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses. The standard requires the use of an “expected loss” model on certain types of financial\ninstruments. The standard also amends the impairment model for available-for-sale securities and requires estimated credit losses to be recorded as allowances rather than as\nreductions to the amortized cost of the securities. This standard was effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2022 for\nfilers that are eligible to be smaller reporting companies under the SEC’s definition, with early adoption permitted. We adopted this standard beginning January 1, 2023.\nAdoption of this standard did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nIn October 2021, the FASB issued ASU 2021-08, Business Combinations (Topic 805): Accounting for Contract Assets and Contract Liabilities from Contracts with Customers,\nwhich requires that an acquirer recognize and measure contract assets and contract liabilities acquired in a business combination in accordance with Topic 606, as if it had\noriginated the contracts. Prior to this ASU, an acquirer generally recognizes contract assets acquired and contract liabilities assumed that arose from contracts with customers at\nfair value on the acquisition date. The ASU was effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022, with early adoption permitted. The ASU is to be applied\nprospectively to business combinations occurring on or after the effective date of the amendment (or if adopted early as of an interim period, as of the beginning of the fiscal\nyear that includes the interim period of early application). We adopted this new standard beginning January 1, 2023. Adoption of this standard did not impact our consolidated\nfinancial statements, as we did not complete any transactions to which this standard was applicable during the current reporting period.\nF-16\nRecently Issued Accounting Guidance Not Yet Adopted\nIn June 2022, the FASB issued ASU No. 2022-03, Fair Value Measurement of Equity Securities Subject to Contractual Sale Restrictions, which clarifies that a contractual sale\nrestriction prohibiting the sale of an equity security is a characteristic of the reporting entity holding the equity security and is not included in the equity security’s unit of\naccount. This standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, with early adoption permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of\nadopting the standard.\nIn November 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures, which improves reportable segment\ndisclosure requirements, primarily through enhanced disclosures about significant segment expenses. The amendments in this update require public companies to disclose on an\nannual and interim basis, significant segment expenses that are regularly provided to the chief operating decision maker (CODM) and require that a public entity disclose, on an\nannual and interim basis, an amount for other segment items by reportable segment and a description of its composition. In addition, the amendment requires that a public entity\nprovide all annual disclosures about a reportable segment’s profit or loss and assets currently required in interim periods and require that a public entity disclose the title and\nposition of the CODM and an explanation of how the CODM uses the reported measure(s) of segment profit or loss in assessing segment performance and deciding how to\nallocate resources. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of ASU 2023-07 on its consolidated financial statements and related\ndisclosures. This amendment will go into effect for the fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15,\n2024.\nIn December 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-09, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements To Income Tax Disclosures, to enhance the transparency and decision\nusefulness of income tax disclosures. The amendments in this Update address investor requests for more transparency about income tax information through improvements to\nincome tax disclosures primarily related to the rate reconciliation and income taxes paid information.\nThe amendments in this Update require that entities on an annual basis (1) disclose specific categories in the rate reconciliation and (2) provide additional information for\nreconciling items that meet a quantitative threshold (if the effect of those reconciling items is equal to or greater than 5 percent of the amount computed by multiplying pretax\nincome (or loss) by the applicable statutory income tax rate). In addition, public business entities are required to provide certain qualitative disclosure about the rate\nreconciliation.\nThe amendments in this Update require that all entities disclose on an annual basis the amount of income taxes paid (net of refunds received) disaggregated (1) by federal\n(national), state, and foreign taxes and (2) by individual jurisdictions in which income taxes paid (net of refunds received) is equal to or greater than 5 percent of total income\ntaxes paid (net of refunds received).\nThis Update also includes certain other amendments to improve the effectiveness of income tax disclosures, such as requiring that all entities disclose the following\ninformation:\n1. Income (or loss) from continuing operations before income tax expense (or benefit) disaggregated between domestic and foreign.\n2. Income tax expense (or benefit) from continuing operations disaggregated by federal (national), state, and foreign.\nThe amendments in this ASU require a cumulative-effect adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings (or other appropriate components of equity or net assets) as of\nthe beginning of the annual reporting period in which an entity adopts the amendments. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of ASU\n2023-09 on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. This amendment will go into effect for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2024.\nNOTE 3. BUSINESS ACQUISITIONS AND DISPOSITIONS\nAmended Eyce APA\nOn April 7, 2022, we entered into an amendment to that certain Asset Purchase Agreement dated March 2, 2021 (the “Amended Eyce APA”), by and between Eyce and\nWarehouse Goods to accelerate the issuance of shares of Class A common stock issuable to Eyce under the agreement upon the attainment of certain EBITDA and revenue\nbenchmarks (the “Amended 2022 Contingent Payment”), in an amount equal to $0.9 million. We issued 71,721 shares of Class A common stock to Eyce under the Amended\n2022 Contingent Payment, which vest ratably in seven quarterly tranches starting on July 1, 2022, such that on January 1, 2024 (the “Vesting Date”), all shares issued to Eyce\nunder the Amended 2022 Contingent Payment will have vested. The shares of Class A common stock issued under the Amended 2022 Contingent Payment are subject to\ncertain forfeiture restrictions tied to the continued employment of certain Eyce personnel with the Company through the Vesting Date.\nThe Amended Eyce APA also provided for the payment of $0.9 million in cash in four equal installments on April 1, 2023, July 1, 2023, October 1, 2023 and January 1, 2024,\ncontingent on the achievement of certain deliverables outlined in the Amended Eyce APA and the continued employment of certain Eyce personnel.\nThe transaction was accounted for separately from acquisition accounting for the Eyce business combination. Specifically, we recorded a gain of approximately $0.3 million,\nrespectively, within “other income (expense), net” in our consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive income for the year ended December 31, 2022 to write-off\nthe balance of the Eyce 2022 Contingent Payment. Also, we recorded approximately $1.3 million in compensation expense related to the Amended 2022 Contingent Payment\nwithin “salaries, benefits and payroll taxes” in our consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive income for the year ended December 31, 2022.\nThe April 2, 2023 and July 1, 2023 payments were paid timely, the remaining payments which were not paid timely have rolled into the Synergy Imports, LLC Bridge Loan and\nis included in the additionally deferred amounts under that Loan.\nVIBES Sale\nOn July 19, 2022, Warehouse Goods entered into the Sale Agreement with Portofino to sell the Company’s 50% stake in VIBES Holdings LLC for total consideration of $4.6\nmillion in cash. The transactions contemplated by the Sale Agreement were completed on July 19, 2022, immediately following the signing of the Sale Agreement. In\nconjunction with and as a result of the disposition of and deconsolidation of our interest in VIBES Holdings LLC, we recorded a gain of $2.0 million for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2022, which is included as an offset in “general and administrative expenses” in our consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss, as well as a\nreduction to non-controlling interest on our consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2022 of $1.8 million. In conjunction with the Sale Agreement, we returned inventory\nto VIBES with a carrying value of approximately $2.4 million.\nF-17\nNOTE 4. FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS\nAssets and Liabilities that are Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis\nThe carrying amounts for certain of our financial instruments, including cash, accounts receivable, accounts payable and certain accrued expenses and other assets and\nliabilities, approximate fair value due to the short-term nature of these instruments.\nAs of December 31, 2023 and 2022, we had contingent consideration that is required to be measured at fair value on a recurring basis.\nOur financial instruments measured at fair value on a recurring basis were as follows at the dates indicated:\nConsolidated\nBalance Sheet Fair Value at December 31, 2023\n(in thousands) Caption Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total\nLiabilities:\nContingent consideration - Accrued expenses and other\ncurrent current liabilities $ — $ — $ 1,000 $ 1,000\nTotal Liabilities $ — $ — $ 1,000 $ 1,000\nConsolidated\nBalance Sheet Fair Value at December 31, 2022\n(in thousands) Caption Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total\nLiabilities:\nContingent consideration - Accrued expenses and other\ncurrent current liabilities $ — $ — $ 2,738 $ 2,738\nTotal Liabilities $ — $ — $ 2,738 $ 2,738\nThere were no transfers between Level 1 and Level 2 and no transfers to or from Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy during the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022.\nDerivative Instrument and Hedging Activity\nOn July 11, 2019, we entered into an interest rate swap contract to manage our risk associated with the interest rate fluctuations on the Company’s floating rate Real Estate Note\ndescribed in “Note 6 - Debt.” The counterparty to this instrument was a reputable financial institution. Our interest rate swap contract was designated as a cash flow hedge at\nthe inception date, and was previously reflected at its fair value in our consolidated balance sheets. The fair value of our interest rate swap liability was determined based on the\npresent value of expected future cash flows. Since our interest rate swap value was based on the LIBOR forward curve and credit default swap rates, which were observable at\ncommonly quoted intervals for the full term of the swap, it was considered a Level 2 measurement.\nBeginning with the second quarter of 2022, we discontinued hedge accounting for the interest rate swap contract. During the year ended December 31, 2022, we recorded a\ngain of approximately $0.1 million based on the change in fair value of the interest rate swap contract within “interest expense” in our consolidated statement of income and\ncomprehensive loss. During the second quarter of 2022, we also reclassified the related accumulated other comprehensive income balance of $0.3 million to “interest expense”\nin our consolidated statement of income and comprehensive loss. Refer to “Note 8 - Supplemental Financial Information” for further details on the components of accumulated\nother comprehensive income (loss) for the year ended December 31, 2022, respectively.\nThe unrealized loss on the derivative instrument prior to the discontinuation of hedge accounting was included within “Other comprehensive income (loss)” in our consolidated\nstatement of operations and comprehensive loss. There was no measure of hedge ineffectiveness and no reclassifications from other comprehensive loss into interest expense\nfor the year ended December 31, 2022, respectively. In August 2022, we terminated the interest swap contract.\nContingent Consideration\nEach period we revalue our contingent consideration obligations associated with business acquisitions to their fair value. The estimate of the fair value of contingent\nconsideration is determined by applying a risk-neutral framework using a Monte Carlo Simulation, which includes inputs not observable in the market, such as the risk-free\nrate, risk-adjusted discount rate, the volatility of the underlying financial metrics and projected financial forecast of the acquired business over the earn-out period, and\ntherefore represents a Level 3 measurement. Significant increases or decreases in these inputs could result in a significantly lower or higher fair value measurement of the\ncontingent consideration liability. Changes in the fair value of contingent consideration are included within “Other income (expense), net” in our consolidated statements of\noperations and comprehensive loss.\nF-18\nA reconciliation of our liabilities that are measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring basis using significant unobservable inputs (Level 3) for the years ended December\n31, 2023 and 2022 is as follows:\n(in thousands) Contingent Consideration\nBalance, December 31, 2021 $ 6,857\nEyce 2021 Contingent Payment settlement in Class A common stock (875)\nEyce 2021 Contingent Payment settlement in cash (875)\nDaVinci 2021 Contingent Payment settlement in Class A common stock (2,611)\nWrite-off of Eyce 2022 Contingent Payment in conjunction with the Amended Eyce APA (267)\nLoss from fair value adjustments included in results of operations 509\nBalance, December 31, 2022 $ 2,738\nCash payments for earn contingent consideration (350)\nTransfer to notes payable (1,650)\nLoss from fair value adjustments included in results of operations 262\nBalance, December 31, 2023 $ 1,000\nEquity Securities Without a Readily Determinable Fair Value\nOur investment in equity securities without readily determinable fair value consist of ownership interests in Airgraft Inc., Sun Grown Packaging, LLC (“Sun Grown”) and\nVIVA. We determined that our ownership interests do not provide us with significant influence over the operations of these investments. Accordingly, we account for our\ninvestments in these entities as equity securities.\nAirgraft Inc., Sun Grown, and VIVA are private entities and their equity securities do not have a readily determinable fair value. We elected to measure these security under the\nmeasurement alternative election at cost minus impairment, if any, with adjustments through earnings for observable price changes in orderly transactions for the identical or\nsimilar investment of the same issuer. We acquired our investments in Sun Grown and VIVA as part of our merger with KushCo, which we completed in August 2021. We did\nnot identify any fair value adjustments related to these equity securities during the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022.\nAs of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the carrying value of our investment in equity securities without a readily determinable fair value was approximately $1.9 million, included\nwithin “Other assets” in our consolidated balance sheets. The carrying value included a fair value adjustment of $1.5 million based on an observable price change recognized\nduring the year ended December 31, 2019.\nNOTE 5. LEASES\nGreenlane as a Lessee\nAs of December 31, 2023, we had facilities financed under operating leases consisting of warehouses, offices, and a retail store, with lease term expirations between 2023 and\n2027. Lease terms are generally three to seven years for warehouses, office space and our retail store location. Our lease agreements do not contain any material residual value\nguarantees or material restrictive covenants.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2022, we took steps to reduce our operational footprint and we continue to optimize our distribution network, transitioning to a more\nstreamlined network with fewer, centrally-located, highly automated facilities. We successfully transferred, subleased or terminated our office leases for our Cypress, CA,\nHermosa Beach, CA, France and China locations. We also successfully transferred, subleased or terminated our retail leases for our Amsterdam, Netherlands, Barcelona, Spain,\nand Malibu, California locations.\nOn November 3, 2022, we entered into that certain Lease Termination Agreement, dated as of October 31, 2022 solely for reference purposes (the “Lease Termination\nAgreement”), by and between us and Warland Investments Company (the “Landlord”), which provided for the termination of our lease at 6261 Katella Avenue in Cypress,\nCalifornia (collectively, the “Lease Termination”). Pursuant to the terms of the Lease Termination Agreement, we agreed to pay a fee of approximately $0.5 million as an early\ntermination fee in consideration for the Landlord agreeing to terminate all of our remaining obligations under the Cypress lease.\nF-19\nThe following table provides details of our future minimum lease payments under operating lease liabilities recorded in our consolidated balance sheet as of December 31,\n2023.

The December 2021 Note accrued\ninterest at a rate of 15.0% is due monthly, and the principal amount was originally due in full on June 30, 2022. We incurred $0.3 million of debt issuance costs related to the\nDecember 2021 Note, which were recorded as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of the December 2021 Note, and which were amortized over the term of the\nDecember 2021 Note through interest expense. The December 2021 Note was secured by a continuing security interest in all of our assets and properties whether then or\nthereafter existing or required, including our inventory and receivables (as defined under the Universal Commercial Code) and included negative covenants restricting our\nability to incur further indebtedness and engage in certain asset dispositions until the earlier of the maturity date or the December 2021 Note being fully repaid.\nOn June 30, 2022, we entered into the First Amendment to the December 2021 Note (the “First Amendment”), which extended the maturity date of the December 2021 Note to\nJuly 14, 2022. On July 14, 2022, we entered into the Second Amendment to the December 2021 Note (the “Second Amendment” and together with the December 2021 Note,\nthe “Bridge Loan”), which provided for the extension of the maturity date of the Bridge Loan from July 14, 2022 to July 19, 2022. In connection with the entry into the Second\nAmendment, we repaid $4.0 million of the aggregate principal amount due under the Bridge Loan on July 14, 2022, with the remainder due at maturity. On July 19, 2022, we\nrepaid the remaining balance on the Bridge Loan in full, and, as a result, all obligations under the Bridge Loan have been satisfied.\nReal Estate Note\nOn October 1, 2018, one of the Operating Company’s wholly-owned subsidiaries financed the purchase of a building, which served as our corporate headquarters, through a\nreal estate term note (the “Real Estate Note”) in the principal amount of $8.5 million. Our obligations under the Real Estate Note were secured by a mortgage on the property.\nOn August 8, 2022, we entered into a note, mortgage and loan modification agreement (the “Real Estate Note Amendment”), which amended the maturity date of the Real\nEstate Note to reflect a maturity date of December 1, 2022, whereupon all principal and accrued interest were to become due and payable, in full.\nIn September 2022, 1095 Broken Sound consummated the previously disclosed transactions contemplated by that certain Purchase and Sale Agreement, dated as of August 16,\n2022, by and between 1095 Broken Sound and ACS 1095 LLC (“the HQ Purchaser”) whereby 1095 Broken Sound agreed to sell a certain parcel of real estate including the our\nheadquarters building to the HQ Purchaser for total proceeds of $9.6 million in cash. On the Closing Date, the Company used a portion of the proceeds from the HQ\nTransaction to repay the remainder of the Real Estate Note in full. There was no remaining balance related to the Real Estate Note on our consolidated balance sheet as of\nDecember 31, 2023 or 2022.\nAsset-Based Loan\nOn August 9, 2022, we entered into an asset-based loan pursuant to that certain Loan and Security Agreement (the “Asset-Based Loan Agreement”), dated as of August 8, 2022,\nby and among the Company, certain subsidiaries of the Company (the “Guarantors”), the parties thereto from time to time as lenders (the “Lenders”), and WhiteHawk Capital\nPartners LP, as the agent for the Lenders (the “Asset Based Loan” or “Line of Credit”).\nPursuant to the Asset-Based Loan Agreement, the Lenders agreed to make available to us a term loan of up to $15.0 million on the terms and conditions set forth therein and the\nother Financing Agreements (as defined therein). As of December 31, 2022, of the total term loan amount, $5.7 million was located in a blocked account, which was classified\nas “restricted cash” on our consolidated balance sheet, and which released the funds when permitted by the borrowing base certificate. Subject to certain exceptions described\nin the Asset-Based Loan Agreement, the Company and the Guarantors agreed to pledge all of their assets as collateral. The maturity date of the Asset-Based Loan is the third\nanniversary of the Closing Date (the “Maturity Date”).\nWe incurred $1.5 million of debt issuance costs related to the Asset-Based Loan, as well as an original issue discount of $0.5 million, which were recorded as a direct deduction\nfrom the carrying amount of the Asset-Based Loan, and which were amortized through interest expense over the term of the Asset-Based Loan. The Asset-Based Loan\ncontained customary covenants and restrictions, including, without limitation, covenants that required us to comply with applicable laws, restrictions on our ability to incur\nadditional indebtedness, and various customary remedies for the lender following an event of default, including the acceleration of repayment of outstanding amounts under the\nAsset-Based Loan and execution upon the collateral securing obligations under the Asset-Based Loan.\nThe Asset-Based Loan accrued interest at the prime rate plus 8.0%, and interest payments were due monthly. Based on the original terms, beginning with the fiscal quarter\nending September 30, 2023, and for each fiscal quarter thereafter until the Maturity Date, quarterly payments of $0.3 million would be due, with a final payment of all\nremaining outstanding principal and accrued interest due on the Maturity Date.\nOn February 9, 2023, we entered into Amendment No. 2 to the Asset-Based Loan Agreement, pursuant to which we agreed to, among other things, to voluntarily prepay\napproximately $6.6 million (inclusive of early termination fees and expenses) under the terms provided for under the Asset-Based Loan Agreement and the lenders under the\nAsset-Based Loan Agreement agreed to release $5.7 million in funds held in a blocked account pursuant to the terms of the Asset-Based Loan Agreement. Amendment No.2 to\nthe Asset-Based Loan Agreement also provided that we would make additional prepayments upon the occurrence of certain specified asset sales by the Company.\nF-21\nOn August 7, 2023, we repaid the approximately $4.3 million in aggregate principal amount (the “Loan Repayment”) which remained outstanding under the terms of the Asset-\nBased Loan Agreement. As a result of the Loan Repayment, the Company has been released from its obligations under the Asset-Based Loan Agreement, in accordance with\nthe terms of the Asset-Based Loan Agreement.\nDaVinci Promissory Note\nIn November 2021, one of the Operating Company’s wholly-owned subsidiaries financed the acquisition of DaVinci through the issuance of an unsecured promissory note (the\n“DaVinci Promissory Note”) in the principal amount of $5.0 million. Principal payments plus accrued interest at a rate of 4.0% were due quarterly through October 2023.\nEyce Promissory Note\nIn March 2021, one of the Operating Company’s wholly-owned subsidiaries financed a portion of the consideration of the acquisition of Eyce through the issuance of an\nunsecured promissory note (the “Eyce Promissory Note”) in the principal amount of $2.5 million. Principal payments plus accrued interest at a rate of 4.5% are due quarterly\nthrough April 2023. As of December 31, 2023, the Eyce Promissory Note was repaid in full, and there was no remaining balance on our condensed consolidated balance sheet.\nFuture Receivables Financings\nOn July 31, 2023 and August 3, 2023, the Company received an aggregate of approximately $3.0 million in cash pursuant to the terms of future receivables financings\n(collectively, the “Future Receivables Financings”) entered into with two private lenders. The Company will make weekly payments under the Future Receivables Financings\nand is scheduled to repay the amounts due under the Future Receivables Financings in full in approximately six to eight months. The total amount to be repaid under the initial\nFuture Receivables Financings was approximately $4.5 million. In connection with the Future Receivables Financings, the Company granted the lenders security interests in\nCompany’s accounts receivable equal to the amounts due thereunder, and in connection with any event of default, the lenders may file financing statements evidencing the\nsecurity interests.\nSecured Bridge Loan\nOn September 22, 2023, the Company entered into a secured loan pursuant to a Loan and Security Agreement (the “September 2023 Loan Agreement”), dated as of September\n22, 2023 with Synergy Imports, LLC (the “Secured Bridge Loan Lender”).\nPursuant to the September 2023 Loan Agreement, the Secured Bridge Loan Lender agreed to make available to the Company a six-month bridge loan of $2.2 million in new\nfunds.

We do not believe there are any pending legal proceedings that\nwill have a material adverse effect on our business, consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. However, the outcome of such legal matters is\ninherently unpredictable and subject to significant uncertainties. We have not taken any reserves for litigation for the year ended December 31, 2023.\nF-22\nOther Contingencies\nWe are potentially subject to claims related to various non-income taxes (such as sales, value added, consumption, and similar taxes) from various tax authorities, including in\njurisdictions in which we already collect and remit such taxes.

SUPPLEMENTAL FINANCIAL STATEMENT INFORMATION\nERC Sale\nAs of December 31, 2022, we had recorded an Employee Retention Credit (“ERC”) receivable of $4.9 million within “Other current assets” on our consolidated balance sheets,\nand a corresponding amount was included in “Other income (expense), net” in our consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive loss for the year ended December\n31, 2022. On February 16, 2023, two of Greenlane Holdings, Inc.’s subsidiaries, Warehouse Goods LLC and Kim International LLC (collectively, the “Company”), entered into\nan agreement with a third-party institutional investor pursuant to which the investor purchased, for approximately $4.9 million in cash, an economic participation interest, at a\ndiscount, in all of the Company’s rights to payment from the United States Internal Revenue Service with respect to the employee retention credits filed by the Company under\nthe ERC program.\nProperty and Equipment, net\nThe following is a summary of our property and equipment, at costs less accumulated depreciation and amortization:\nAs of December 31,\n(in thousands) Estimated useful life 2023 2022\nFurniture, equipment and software 3 - 7 years $ 8,570 $ 7,492\nPersonal property 5 years — —\nLeasehold improvements Lesser of lease term or 5 years 51 104\nBuilding 39 years — —\nLand — —\nLand improvements 15 years — —\nWork in process 411 679\n9,032 8,275\nLess: accumulated depreciation 6,556 4,313\nProperty and equipment, net $ 2,476 $ 3,962\nDepreciation expense for property and equipment for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 was approximately $2.2 million and $3.3 million, respectively.\nF-23\nIntangible Assets, Net\nIdentified intangible assets consisted of the following at the dates indicated below:\nAs of December 31, 2022\nGross carrying Accumulated\namount amortization Impairment Charge Carrying value Estimated useful life\n(in thousands)\nDesign libraries $ 8,710 $ (1,010) $ (7,700) $ — 7-15 years\nTrademarks and\ntradenames 6,915 (3,361) (3,554) — 5-15 years\nCustomer relationships 43,628 (4,666) (38,962) — 5-15 years\nOther intangibles 753 (275) (478) — 5-15 years\nTotal finite-lived\nintangibles 60,006 (9,312) (50,694) —\nTrademarks 29,500 — (29,500) — Indefinite\nTotal indefinite-lived\nintangibles 29,500 — (29,500) —\n$ 89,506 $ (9,312) $ (80,194) $ —\nWe evaluated goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment annually during the fourth quarter of each year and at interim dates if indicators of impairment\nexist. Due to declines in the Company’s stock price as well as changes to our estimates and assumptions of the expected future cash flows, management concluded that a\ntriggering event occurred in the third quarter of 2022, based upon which we recorded an impairment charge related to our indefinite-lived intangible assets of $24.9 million.\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2022, we further concluded that the remaining $4.6 million balance of indefinite-lived intangibles was impaired. Based upon these assessments, we\nrecorded a total impairment charge related to indefinite-lived intangibles of $29.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. We also recorded an impairment charge\nrelated to our goodwill balance, as described further below.\nWe did not acquire any additional intangible assets during the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022. .\nAmortization expense for intangible assets was approximately $0 million and $4.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nGoodwill\nWe evaluated goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment annually during the fourth quarter of each year and at interim dates if indicators of impairment\nexist. Goodwill was assessed for impairment at the reporting unit level. Due to declines in the Company’s stock price as well as changes to our estimates and assumptions of the\nexpected future cash flows of our Consumer Goods and Industrial Goods reporting units, management concluded that a triggering event occurred in the third quarter of 2022,\nrequiring a quantitative impairment test of our goodwill for both of our reporting units. Based on this assessment, we concluded that the fair value of each of our two reporting\nunits was below their respective carrying value, and goodwill was fully impaired for both reporting units during the year ended December 31, 2022.\nOther Current Assets\nThe following table summarizes the composition of other current assets as of the dates indicated:\nAs of December 31,\n(in thousands) 2023 2022\nOther current assets:\nEmployee retention credit (ERC) receivable $ — $ 4,854\nVAT refund receivable (Note 2) 78 143\nPrepaid expenses 1,207 1,293\nIndemnification receivable, net 7 736\nCustoms bonds 1,229 1,378\nOther 798 2,716\n$ 3,319 $ 11,120\nF-24\nAccrued Expenses and Other Current Liabilities\nThe following table summarizes the composition of accrued expenses and other current liabilities as of the dates indicated:\nAs of December 31,\n(in thousands) 2023 2022\nAccrued expenses and other current liabilities:\nVAT payable (including amounts related to VAT matter described in Note 2) $ 313 $ 2,809\nContingent consideration 1,000 2,738\nAccrued employee compensation 861 3,812\nAmended Eyce APA — 430\nAccrued expenses 499 818\nRefund liability (including accounts receivable credit balances) 68 329\nAccrued construction in progress (ERP) — 170\nSales tax payable 315 578\nOther — 198\n$ 3,056 $ 11,882\nCustomer Deposits\nFor certain product offerings, we may receive a deposit from the customer (generally 25% - 50% of the total order cost, but the amount can vary by customer contract), when an\norder is placed by a customer.

STOCKHOLDERS’ EQUITY\nShares of our Class A common stock have both voting interests and economic interests (i.e., the right to receive distributions or dividends, whether cash or stock, and proceeds\nupon dissolution, winding up or liquidation), while shares of our Class B common stock have voting interests but no economic interests. Each share of our Class A common\nstock and Class B common stock entitles the record holder thereof to one vote on all matters on which stockholders generally are entitled to vote, and except as otherwise\nrequired in the A&R Charter, the holders of Common Stock will vote together as a single class on all matters (or, if any holders of our preferred stock are entitled to vote\ntogether with the holders of Common Stock, as a single class with such holders of preferred stock).\nEffective August 9, 2022, we completed a one-for-twenty reverse stock split (the “2022 Reverse Stock Split”) of our issued and outstanding shares of Class A common stock\nand Class B common stock (collectively, the “Common Stock”), as further described in “Note 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies.” As a result of the 2022 Reverse\nStock Split, every 20 shares of Common Stock issued and outstanding were converted into one share of Common Stock. We paid cash in lieu of fractional shares, and\naccordingly, no fractional shares were issued in connection with the 2022 Reverse Stock Split.\nEffective June 5, 2023, we completed a one-for-10 reverse stock split (the “2023 Reverse Stock Split” and together with the 2022 Reverse Stock Split, the “Reverse Stock\nSplits”) of our issued and outstanding shares of Common Stock, as further described in “Note 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies.” As a result of the 2023 Reverse\nStock Split, every 10 shares of Common Stock issued and outstanding were converted into one share of Common Stock. We paid cash in lieu of fractional shares, and\naccordingly, no fractional shares were issued in connection with the 2023 Reverse Stock Split.\nThe Reverse Stock Splits did not change the par value of the Common Stock or the authorized number of shares of Common Stock. All share and per share amounts in these\nunaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and notes thereto have been retroactively adjusted for all periods presented to give effect to the Reverse Stock Split,\nincluding reclassifying an amount equal to the reduction in par value of Common Stock to additional paid-in capital.\nF-26\nNon-Controlling Interest\nAs discussed in “Note 1—Business Operations and Organization,” we consolidate the financial results of the Operating Company in our consolidated financial statements and\nreport a non-controlling interest related to the Common Units held by non-controlling interest holders. As of December 31, 2022, all Common Units of the Operating Company\nand Class B common stock had been exchanged for Class A common stock, and we owned 100.0% of the economic interests in the Operating Company. The non-controlling\ninterest in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss represents the portion of the net loss attributable to the economic interest in the\nOperating Company previously held by the non-controlling holders of Common Units calculated based on the weighted average non-controlling interests’ ownership during the\nperiods presented.\nAt-the-Market Equity Offering\nIn August 2021, we established an “at-the-market” equity offering program (the “ATM Program”) that provided for the sale of shares of our Class A common stock having an\naggregate offering price of up to $50 million, from time to time, through Cowen and Company, LLC (“Cowen”), as the sales agent.\nSales of our Class A common stock under the ATM Program were made by means of transactions that are deemed to be an “at the market offering” as defined in Rule 415(a)(4)\nunder the Securities Act, including sales made directly on the Nasdaq Capital Market or sales made to or through a market maker or through an electronic communications\nnetwork.\nShares of our Class A common stock were issued pursuant to our shelf registration statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-257654), and a prospectus supplement relating to the\nClass A common stock that was filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on April 18, 2022.\nOn April 18, 2022, we entered into Amendment No. 1 (the “ATM Amendment”) to the sales agreement dated August 2, 2022 with Cowen. The purpose of the Amendment was\nto add the limitations imposed on the ATM Program by Instruction I.B.6 to the sales agreement. At the time of our entry into the ATM Amendment, approximately $37.3 million\nin shares remained available for issuance under the ATM Program.\nDue to the untimely filing of certain of our Quarterly and Annual Reports, we are unable to issue additional shares of Class A common stock pursuant to the ATM Program or\notherwise use the Shelf Registration Statement, which will limit our liquidity options in the capital markets.\nThe table below summarizes sales of our Class A common stock under the ATM program:\nAugust 2021 (Inception)\nthrough\n($ in thousands) December 31, 2023\nClass A shares sold* 97,262\nGross proceeds $ 12,684\nFees paid to sales agent $ 381\nNet proceeds $ 12,303\n*After giving effect to the Reverse Stock Splits.\nCommon Stock and Warrant Offerings\nJune 2022 Offering\nOn June 27, 2022, we entered into a securities purchase agreement with an accredited investor, pursuant to which we agreed to issue and sell an aggregate of 585,000 shares of\nour Class A common stock, pre-funded warrants to purchase up to 495,000 shares of our Class A common stock (the “June 2022 Pre-Funded Warrants”) and warrants to\npurchase up to 1,080,000 shares of our Class A common stock (the “June 2022 Standard Warrants” and, together with the June 2022 Pre-Funded Warrants, the “June 2022\nWarrants”), in a registered direct offering (the “June 2022 Offering”). The shares of Class A common stock and June 2022 Warrants were sold in Units (the “June 2022 Units”),\nwith each unit consisting of one share of Class A common stock or a June 2022 Pre-Funded Warrant and a June 2022 Standard Warrant to purchase one share of our Class A\ncommon stock. The June 2022 Units were offered pursuant to the Shelf Registration Statement. The June 2022 Standard Warrants are exercisable six months from the date of\nissuance at an exercise price equal to $5.00 per share of Class A common stock for a period of five years. Each June 2022 Pre-Funded Warrant was exercisable immediately\nwith no expiration date for one share of Class A common stock at an exercise price of $0.002. The June 2022 Offering generated gross proceeds of approximately $5.4 million\nand net proceeds to the Company of approximately $5.0 million.\nF-27\nAll June 2022 Pre-Funded Warrants were exercised in July 2022, based upon which we issued an additional 495,000 shares of our Class A common stock, for de minimis net\nproceeds.\nOctober 2022 Offering\nOn October 27, 2022, we entered into securities purchase agreements with certain investors, pursuant to which we agreed to issue and sell an aggregate of 695,555 shares of our\nClass A common stock, pre-funded warrants to purchase up to 137,778 shares of our Class A common stock (the “October 2022 Pre-Funded Warrants”) and warrants to\npurchase up to 1,666,667 shares of our Class A common stock (the “October 2022 Standard Warrants”). The October 2022 units each consisted of one share of Class A common\nstock or a October 2022 Pre-Funded Warrant and two October 2022 Standard Warrants to purchase one share of our Class A common stock. The October 2022 units were\noffered pursuant to the S-1 Registration Statement. The October 2022 Standard Warrants are exercisable immediately at an exercise price equal to $0.90 per share of Class A\ncommon stock for a period of seven years. Each October 2022 Pre-Funded Warrant is exercisable immediately with no expiration date for one share of Class A common stock\nat an exercise price of $0.0001. The October 2022 Offering generated gross proceeds of approximately $7.5 million and net proceeds to the Company of approximately $6.8\nmillion.\nAll October 2022 Pre-Funded Warrants were exercised in November 2022, based upon which we issued an additional 137,778 shares of our Class A common stock, for de\nminimis net proceeds.\nJuly 2023 Offering\nOn June 29, 2023, we entered into securities purchase agreements with certain investors, pursuant to which we agreed to issue and sell an aggregate of 560,476 shares of our\nClass A common stock, pre-funded warrants to purchase up to 3,487,143 shares of our Class A common stock (the “July 2023 Pre-Funded Warrants”) and warrants to purchase\nup to 8,095,238 shares of our Class A common stock (the “July 2023 Standard Warrants”). The July 2023 units each consisted of one share of Class A common stock or a July\n2023 Pre-Funded Warrant and two July 2023 Standard Warrants to purchase one share of our Class A common stock. The July 2023 units were offered pursuant to an effective\nRegistration Statement on Form S-1. The July 2023 Standard Warrants are exercisable immediately at an exercise price equal to $1.05 per share of Class A common stock for a\nperiod of five years. Each July 2023 Pre-Funded Warrant is exercisable immediately with no expiration date for one share of Class A common stock at an exercise price of\n$0.0001. The July 2023 Offering generated gross proceeds of approximately $4.3 million and net proceeds to the Company of approximately $3.9 million.\nAs of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, all July 2023 Pre-Funded Warrants have been exercised, based upon which we issued an additional 1,911,000 shares of our\nClass A common stock subsequent to year end, for de minimis net proceeds.\nIn connection with the July 2023 Offering, the Company entered into privately negotiated agreements with holders participating in the offering to amend existing outstanding\nwarrants to purchase up to 1,344,367 shares of Class A common stock that were previously issued in connection with the June 2022 and October 2022 Offerings at exercise\nprices per share of $50.00 and $9.00, respectively, and expire on December 29, 2027 and November 1, 2029, respectively (collectively, the “Prior Warrants”), effective upon the\nclosing of the July 2023 Offering to reduce the exercise price of the Prior Warrants to $1.05, the exercise price of the warrants to purchase shares of Class A common stock\noffered in the July 2023 Offering. All other terms of the Prior Warrants remained unchanged.\nNet Loss Per Share\nBasic net loss per share of Class A common stock is computed by dividing net loss attributable to Greenlane by the weighted-average number of shares of Class A common\nstock outstanding during the period. Diluted net loss per share of Class A common stock is computed by dividing net loss attributable to Greenlane by the weighted-average\nnumber of shares of Class A common stock outstanding adjusted to give effect to potentially dilutive elements.\nF-28\nA reconciliation of the numerator and denominator used in the calculation of basic and diluted net loss per share of our Class A common stock is as follows (in thousands,\nexcept per share amounts):\nFor the year ended December 31,\n(in thousands, except per share data) 2023 2022\nNumerator:\nNet loss $ (32,325) $ (182,226)\nLess: Net loss attributable to non-controlling interests 150 (12,717)\nPlus: Deemed Dividend on “October 2022 Standard Warrants” (388) -\nNet loss attributable to Class A common stockholders $ (32,563) $ (169,509)\nDenominator:\nWeighted average shares of Class A common stock outstanding* 3,993 753\nNet loss per share of Class A common stock - basic and diluted* $ (8.16) $ (22.51)\n*After giving effect to the Reverse Stock Splits.\nThe July 2023 Pre-Funded Warrants were included in the weighted-average in the computation of basic net loss per share of Class A common stock for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2023, beginning with their issuance date, as their stated exercise price of $0.001 was non-substantive and their exercise was virtually assured.\nOn June 29, 2023 in connection with the July 2023 Offering, the Company entered into agreements with holders participating in the offering to amend existing outstanding\nwarrants to purchase up to 1,344,367 shares of Class A common stock that were previously issued in November 2022 at an exercise price per share of $9.00. The warrants\nexpire on November 1, 2029. In connection with the amendment, the exercise price of the warrants was reduced to $1.05. The impact of the amendment resulted in a deemed\ndividend in the amount of $0.4 million. The deemed dividend was calculated by the change in fair value.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, shares of Class B common stock and stock options and warrants to purchase Class A common stock were\nexcluded from the weighted-average in the computation of diluted net loss per share of Class A common stock because the effect would have been anti-dilutive.\nShares of our Class B common stock do not share in our earnings or losses and are therefore not participating securities. As such, separate calculations of basic and diluted net\nloss per share for each of our Class B common stock under the two-class method have not been presented for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, all Common Units\nof the Operating Company and Class B common stock had been exchanged for Class A common stock, and we owned 100.0% of the economic interests in the Operating\nCompany as of December 31, 2023 and 2022.\nNOTE 10. COMPENSATION PLANS\nAmended and Restated 2019 Equity Incentive Plan\nIn April 2019, we adopted the 2019 Equity Incentive Plan (the “2019 Plan”). In August 2021, we adopted, and our shareholders approved, the Amended and Restated 2019\nEquity Incentive Plan (the “Amended 2019 Plan”), which amends and restates the 2019 Plan in its entirety. At our 2022 Annual Meeting of Stockholders on August 4, 2022,\nstockholders approved the Second Amended and Restated 2019 Equity Incentive Plan (the “Second Amended 2019 Plan”) which, among other things, increased the number of\nshares of Class A common stock authorized for issuance under the Amended 2019 Plan. Following the effect of the Reverse Stock Splits, the total number of shares of Class A\ncommon stock authorized for issuance is 110,000 shares as of December 31, 2023.\nThe Second Amended 2019 Plan provides eligible participants with compensation opportunities in the form of cash and equity incentive awards. The Second Amended 2019\nPlan is designed to enhance our ability to attract, retain and motivate our employees, directors, and executive officers, and incentivizes them to increase our long-term growth\nand equity value in alignment with the interests of our stockholders.\nOn June 2, 2023, the Company’s stockholders approved a third amendment and restatement of the 2019 Plan (the “Third Amended Plan”). The Third Amended Plan, among\nother things, increases the number of shares of Class A common stock authorized for issuance under the Second Amended 2019 Plan by 209,862 shares to an aggregate of\n319,862 shares. As of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we have not filed a Registration Statement on Form S-8 with the Securities and Exchange Commission to\nregister the additional shares authorized under the Third Amended Plan.\nF-29\nEquity-Based Compensation Expense\nEquity-based compensation expense is included within “salaries, benefits and payroll taxes” in our consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. We\nrecognized equity-based compensation expense as follows:\nFor the year ended December 31,\n(in thousands) 2023 2022\nStock options - Class A common stock $ 36 $ 1,098\nRestricted shares - Class A common stock 37 517\nRestricted stock units (RSUs) - Class A common stock — 11\nTotal equity-based compensation expense $ 73 $ 1,626\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2022, we granted an aggregate of 129,106 options to our directors and certain employees. The stock options were granted with exercise\nprices ranging from $2.52 per share to $20.00 per share, and vesting periods ranging from three months to four years. There were no options granted during the year ended\nDecember 31, 2023.\nTotal remaining unrecognized compensation expense as of December 31, 2023 was as follows:\nWeighted Average\nPeriod over which\nRemaining\nRemaining Unrecognized\nUnrecognized Compensation Expense\nCompensation Expense is Expected to be\nDecember 31, 2023 Recognized\n(in thousands) (in years)\nStock options - Class A common stock $ — 0\nRestricted shares - Class A common stock 19 0.85\nTotal remaining unrecognized compensation expense $ 19\nThe fair value of the stock option awards granted during the year ended December 31, 2022 was determined on the grant date using the Black-Scholes valuation model based\non the following ranges of weighted-average assumptions:\nExpected volatility (1) 100% - 100%\nExpected dividend yield (2) —\nExpected term (3) 5.88 - 6.05 years\nRisk-free interest rate (4) 1.62% - 3.31%\n(1)Expected volatility is based on the historical volatility of a selected peer group over a period equivalent to the expected term.\n(2)We assumed a dividend yield of zero as management has no plans to declare dividends in the foreseeable future.\n(3)Expected term represents the estimated period of time until an award is exercised and was determined using the simplified method.\n(4)The risk-free rate is an interpolation of yields on U.S. Treasury securities with maturities equivalent to the expected term.\nA summary of stock option activity for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 is as follows:\nStock Options\nWeighted-Average\nNumber of Options Exercise Price\nOutstanding as of December 31, 2021 265,947 $ 71.80\nGranted 129,106 9.34\nExercised — —\nForfeited (167,201) 17.59\nOutstanding as of December 31, 2022 227,852 $ 58.88\nGranted — —\nExercised — —\nForfeited (83,044) —\nOutstanding as of December 31, 2023 144,808 $ 57.64\nThe weighted-average grant date fair value of options granted for the year ended December 31, 2022 was $9.34. The total fair value of stock options vested during the years\nended December 31, 2023 and 2022 was approximately $0.1 million and $2.1 million, respectively.\nF-30\n401(k) Plan\nOur 401(k) Plan is a deferred salary arrangement under Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code. Under the 401(k) Plan, participating U.S. employees may defer a portion\nof their pre-tax earnings, up to the U.S. Internal Revenue Service annual contribution limit ($23,000 for calendar year 2023). Participants are eligible to receive a matching\ncontribution from us of 100% of the first 3% and 50% of the next 2% of contributions. Matching contributions, other than safe-harbor contributions, vest 33% per year and are\n100% vested after three years of service. Safe-harbor matching contributions are 100% vested as of the date of the contribution.\nNOTE 11. INCOME TAXES\nAs a result of the IPO and the related transactions completed in April 2019, we owned a portion of the Common Units of the Operating Company, which is treated as a\npartnership for U.S. federal and most applicable state and local income tax purposes. As a partnership, the Operating Company was generally not subject to U.S. federal and\ncertain state and local income taxes. Any taxable income or loss generated by the Operating Company was passed through to and included in the taxable income or loss of its\nmembers, including Greenlane, on a pro-rata basis, in accordance with the terms of the Operating Agreement. The Operating Company was also subject to taxes in foreign\njurisdictions. We are a corporation subject to U.S. federal income taxes, in addition to state and local income taxes, based on our share of the Operating Company’s pass-\nthrough taxable income.\nEffective on December 31, 2022, the Operating Company became wholly owned by us. As a result, the Operating Company’s tax status was converted from a partnership to a\ndisregarded entity. Starting in 2023, 100% of the Operating Company’s U.S. income and expenses will be included in our US and state tax returns.\nThe Company’s United States and foreign operations components of income (loss) from continuing operations before income taxes are as follows:\nFor the year ended December 31,\n(in thousands) 2023 2022\nUnited States $ (30,325) $ (172,997)\nForeign $ (2,000) $ (9,242)\nTotal $ (32,325) $ (182,239)\nIncome Tax Expense\nThe income tax (benefit) expense for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 consisted of the following:\nFor the year ended December 31, 2023 For the year ended December 31, 2022\n(in thousands) Federal Foreign State Total Federal Foreign State Total\nCurrent tax (benefit) expense\nCurrent year $ — $ — $ — $ — $ — $ (13) $ — $ (13)\nTotal current year — — — — — (13) — (13)\nDeferred tax (benefit) expense\nCurrent year (5,991) (500) (1,798) (8,289) (31,475) (2,311) (10,368) (44,154)\nChange in valuation allowance 5,743 500 1,219 7,462 36,867 2,311 13,523 52,701\nChange in tax rate — — 780 780 72 — (344) (272)\nTax conversion of Operating Company — — — — 2,990 — 1,022 4,012\nUp-C consolidation — — — — (10,097) — (3,440) (13,537)\nKushCo merger or true ups 248 — (201) 47 1,643 — (393) 1,250\nTotal deferred tax (benefit) expense — — — — — — — —\nIncome tax (benefit) expense $ — $ — $ — $ — $ — $ (13) $ — $ (13)\nF-31\nA reconciliation of the income tax (benefit) expense computed at the U.S. federal statutory income tax rate to the income tax expense recognized is as follows:\nFor the year ended December 31,\n(in thousands) 2023 2022\nExpected federal income tax (benefit) expense at statutory rate $ (6,788) $ (38,270)\nState tax expense, net of federal benefit (1,605) (8,688)\nLoss attributable to non-controlling interests 4 2,121\nChange in valuation allowance 7,462 52,701\nTax conversion of Operating Company — 4,012\nUp-C consolidation — (13,537)\nKushCo merger — 1,250\nChange in tax rates —\nPrior year true-ups 227 —\nOther, net 700 398\nIncome tax (benefit) expense $ — $ (13)\nDeferred Tax Assets and Liabilities\nThe components of deferred tax assets and liabilities were as follows:\nAs of December 31,\n(in thousands) 2023 2022\nDeferred tax assets:\nGoodwill and other intangible assets $ 36,018 $ 36,841\nFixed assets 943 1,590\nInventory 2,854 5,858\nAllowance for doubtful accounts 833 833\nOperating lease liability 164 862\nEquity-based compensation 2,576 2,576\nBusiness interest carryforward 6,897 5,342\nNet operating loss carryforwards 67,667 57,136\nOther 411 576\nTotal deferred tax assets 118,363 111,614\nValuation allowance (118,262) (110,799)\nNet deferred tax assets 101 815\nDeferred tax liability:\nRight of use assets (101) (815)\nBasis difference in investment in the Operating Company — —\nTotal deferred tax liabilities (101) (815)\nNet deferred tax assets and liabilities $ — $ —\nWe had approximately $240.2 million of Federal net operating loss carryforwards, of which approximately $9.8 million expire in 2038, and the remainder are not subject to\nexpiration. Their utilization is limited to 80% of our future taxable income. We also had approximately $235.0 of State net operating loss carryforwards that begin expiring in\n2038, $14.9 million of Dutch net operating loss carryforwards that begin expiring in 2029, and $0.2 million Canadian net operating loss carryforwards that begin expiring in\n2026. Their utilization is limited to our future taxable income. We have not completed our evaluation of NOL utilization limitations under Internal Revenue Code, as amended\n(the “Code”) Section 382, change in ownership rules. Due to the fact that there is a full valuation allowance and losses being generated in the current year, any limitation based\non the code would not have a material impact on the net deferred tax asset balance. In addition, the deduction for business interest is limited to 30 percent of taxable income\n(the “Section 163(j) limitation”). The interest that is not deductible due this limitation is carried forward to subsequent years and subject to the next years Section 163(j)\nlimitation. At December 31, 2023 we had $26.2 million of business interest carryforwards, which includes $17.6 million from the KushCo merger. The utilization of the\nbusiness interest carryforward from the KushCo merger may be further limited by the application of the Section 382 rules.\nF-32\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, management performed an assessment of the realizability of our deferred tax assets based upon which\nmanagement determined that it is not more likely than not that the results of operations will generate sufficient taxable income to realize portions of the net operating loss\nbenefits. Consequently, we established a full valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets and reflected a carrying balance of $0 as of December 31, 2023 and 2022,\nrespectively. In the event that management determines that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of their net recorded amount, an\nadjustment to the valuation allowance will be made, which would reduce the provision for income taxes.\nWe do not record U.S. income taxes on the undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries, except for the Canadian subsidiary, based upon our intention to permanently\nreinvest undistributed earnings into working capital and further expansion of existing operations outside the United States. In the event we are required to repatriate funds from\noutside of the United States, such repatriation would be subject to local laws, customs, and tax consequences.\nUncertain Tax Positions\nFor the year ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, we did not have any unrecognized tax benefits as a result of tax positions taken during a prior period or during the current\nperiod. No interest or penalties have been recorded as a result of tax uncertainties. The Company is subject to audit examination for federal and state purposes for the years\n2019 – 2023. As of the date these financial statements were issued, there were not any ongoing income tax audits.\nTax Receivable Agreement (TRA)\nWe entered into the TRA with the Operating Company and each of the members that provides for the payment by the Operating Company to the members of 85% of the\namount of tax benefits, if any, that we may actually realize (or in some circumstances are deemed to realize) as a result of (i) increases in tax basis resulting from any future\nredemptions of Common Units as described in “Note 1—Business Operations and Organization” and (ii) certain other tax benefits attributable to payments made under the\nTRA.\nThe annual tax benefits are computed by calculating the income taxes due, including such tax benefits, and the income taxes due without such benefits. The Operating\nCompany expects to benefit from the remaining 15% of any tax benefits that it may actually realize. The TRA payments are not conditioned upon any continued ownership\ninterest in the Operating Company. The rights of each noncontrolling interest holder under the TRA are assignable to transferees of its interest in the Operating Company. The\ntiming and amount of aggregate payments due under the TRA may vary based on a number of factors, including the amount and timing of the taxable income the Operating\nCompany generates each year and the applicable tax rate.\nAs noted above, we evaluated the realizability of the deferred tax assets resulting from the IPO and the related transactions completed in April 2019 and established a full\nvaluation allowance against those benefits. As a result, we determined that the amount or timing of payments to noncontrolling interest holders under the TRA are no longer\nprobable or reasonably estimable. Based on this assessment, our TRA liability was $0 as of December 31, 2023 and 2022.\nIf utilization of the deferred tax assets subject to the TRA becomes more likely than not in the future, we will record a liability related to the TRA, which would be recognized\nas expense within our consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive (loss) income.\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, we did not make any payments, inclusive of interest, to members of the Operating Company pursuant to the TRA.\nNOTE 12. SEGMENT REPORTING\nWe define our segments as those operations whose results are regularly reviewed by our CODM to analyze performance and allocate resources. Therefore, segment information\nis prepared on the same basis that management reviews financial information for operational decision-making purposes. Our CODM is a committee comprised of our CEO and\nour CFO.\nWe determined we had two operating segments as of December 31, 2023, which are the same as our reportable segments: (1) Consumer Goods, and (2) Industrial Goods. These\noperating segments align with how we manage our business as of the fourth quarter of 2023. The accounting policies of the reportable segments are the same as those described\nin “Note 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies.”\nThe Consumer Goods segment focuses on serving consumers across wholesale, retail and e-commerce operations—through both our proprietary Greenlane Brands, including\nEyce, DaVinci, Groove, Marley Natural, Keith Haring, and Higher Standards, as well as lifestyle products and accessories from leading brands, such as Storz and Bickel, PAX,\nand many more.

CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE\nNone.\nITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nUnder the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, we conducted an\nevaluation (pursuant to Rule 13a-15(b) of the Exchange Act) of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Exchange\nAct as of December 31, 2023.\nDisclosure controls and procedures are controls and other procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed or\nsubmitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and\nprocedures include controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our company’s reports filed under the Exchange Act is accumulated\nand communicated to management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial and Legal Officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.\nBased on the evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial and Legal Officer concluded that our disclosure\ncontrols and procedures were ineffective as of December 31, 2023 due to the material weaknesses identified and described below.\nManagement’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nOur management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial and Legal Officer, is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal\ncontrol over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act). Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide\nreasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Our\ninternal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that: (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly\nreflect the transactions and dispositions of our assets; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements\nin accordance with U.S. GAAP, and that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of our management and directors; and (iii)\nprovide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on the\nfinancial statements.\nUnder the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial and Legal Officer, we conducted an\nevaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023, based on the framework in Internal Control—Integrated Framework\nissued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) (2013 framework). Based on this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and\nChief Financial and Legal Officer have concluded that as of December 31, 2023, the Company has not maintained effective internal control over financial reporting due to the\nmaterial weaknesses identified and described below.\nBecause we are an “emerging growth company” under the JOBS Act, our independent registered public accounting firm will not be required to attest to the\neffectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting for so long as we are an emerging growth company.\n58\nMaterial Weaknesses\nAs previously described in Item 9A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021, we began implementing a remediation plan to address\nthe material weaknesses identified in the prior year, and our management continues to be actively engaged in the remediation efforts.\nAmong the previously reported design and operating deficiencies which contributed to material weaknesses in our control activities, management noted ineffective\nuser access controls over certain IT systems to appropriately segregate duties and adequately restrict user access to financial applications and data to the appropriate personnel.\nWhile certain compensating control activities have been designed and implemented to mitigate the risks related to ineffective user access controls, these compensating control\nactivities are not expected to operate at a level of precision that would prevent or detect a misstatement that could be material.\nControl Environment\nWe did not maintain an effective control environment to enable the identification and mitigation of risks of material accounting errors and ensure corrective activities\nwere appropriately applied, prioritized, and implemented in a timely manner.\nRisk Assessment\nAs part of our remediation efforts related to the material weaknesses identified in the prior year, we continued our efforts during 2023 to design an effective risk\nassessment, which was not completed or fully implemented in order to identify and mitigate key business and financial reporting risks to the organization. Control deficiencies\nwere identified which constitute material weaknesses relating to: (i) identifying, assessing, and communicating appropriate objectives, (ii) identifying and analyzing risks to\nachieve these objectives, (iii) considering the potential for fraud in assessing risks to the achievement of objectives, and (iv) identifying and assessing changes that could\nsignificantly impact the system of internal controls.\nControl Activities\nAs part of our remediation efforts related to the material weaknesses identified in the prior year, we continued our efforts during 2023 to design and implement control\nactivities, however, design efforts relating to control activities were not fully implemented. Control deficiencies were identified associated with control activities. Specifically,\nthese control deficiencies constitute material weaknesses, either individually or in the aggregate, relating to: (i) selecting and developing control activities that contribute to the\nmitigation of risks and support achievement of objectives, (ii) selecting and developing general control activities over technology to support the achievement of objectives, and\n(iii) deploying control activities through policies that establish what is expected and procedures that put policies into action.\nThe following design and operating deficiencies, individually and in the aggregate, contributed to material weaknesses in our control activities, including:\n● Lack of direct and precise journal entry review\n● Ineffective user access controls over certain IT systems to appropriately segregate duties and adequately restrict user access to financial applications and data to the\nappropriate personnel, including systems and data used in financial close and reporting\nInformation and Communication\nWe did not implement effective information and communication control activities. A control deficiency was identified which constitutes a material weakness relating\nto information technology controls, which includes information security, systems change management and computer operations for systems and applications that are critical to\nprocessing financial transactions and capturing and reporting information in the financial reporting process. These ineffective information technology controls contributed to\nineffective data validation of spreadsheets and system-generated reports utilized in the preparation of the financial statements and disclosures.\nMonitoring\nWe did not implement effective monitoring activities. Control deficiencies were identified which constitute material weaknesses, individually and in the aggregate,\nrelating to: (i) selecting, developing, and performing ongoing evaluation to ascertain whether the components of internal controls are present and functioning, and (ii)\nevaluating and communicating internal control deficiencies in a timely manner to those parties responsible for taking corrective action.\n59\nRemediation Plan and Status\nChanges in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nAs discussed above, in 2021 we began a multi-year implementation of a new ERP system which fully replaced our legacy financial systems in 2024. The ERP system\nis designed to accurately maintain the Company’s financial records, enhance the flow of financial information, improve data management and provide timely information to our\nmanagement team.\nThere were no other changes to our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended December 31, 2023 that have materially affected, or\nare reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.\nInherent Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls\nManagement recognizes that a control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of\nthe control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered\nrelative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of\nfraud or error, if any, have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur\nbecause of a simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by management\noverride of the controls. The design of any system of controls is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that\nany design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions; over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or the\ndegree of compliance with policies or procedures may deteriorate. Because of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud\nmay occur and not be detected.\nITEM 9B. OTHER INFORMATION\nNone.\nITEM 9C.

CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED TRANSACTIONS, AND DIRECTOR INDEPENDENCE\nRelated Party Transaction Policy\nOur Board recognizes the fact that transactions with related persons present a heightened risk of conflicts of interests and/or improper valuation (or the perception thereof). Our\nBoard has adopted a written policy on transactions with related persons under which:\n●any related-person transaction must be reviewed and approved or ratified by the Audit Committee, or the chair of the Audit Committee in the event management decides it is\nnot practicable or desirable to wait until the next committee meeting; and\n●management must periodically inquire of directors and officers with respect to any potential related-person transaction of which they may be a party or of which they may be\naware.\n●any employment relationship or transaction involving an executive officer and any related compensation must be approved by the compensation committee of the Board or\nrecommended by the compensation committee to the Board for its approval.\nIn connection with the review and approval or ratification of a related-person transaction:\n●management must disclose to the Audit Committee or the chair of the Audit Committee, (i) the basis on which the person is a related person; (ii) the material facts of the\nrelated-party transaction, including the proposed aggregate value of such transaction or, in the case of indebtedness, the amount of principal and interest that would be involved\nand other principal terms of such indebtedness; (iii) the benefits to the Company of the proposed related-party transaction; (iv) if applicable, the availability of other sources of\ncomparable products or services; and (v) an assessment of whether the proposed related-party transaction is on terms that are comparable to the terms available to an unrelated\nthird party or to employees unrelated third parties or to employees generally. The Audit Committee may seek bids, quotes or independent valuations from third parties in\nconnection with assessing any related-person transaction; and\n●to the extent required to be disclosed in our applicable filings under the Securities Act or the Exchange Act, and related rules, management must ensure that the related-person\ntransaction is disclosed in accordance with such acts and related rules.\nIn addition, the related-person transaction policy provides that from time-to-time Audit Committee shall review any previously approved or ratified related-party transactions\nthat remain ongoing and have a remaining term of more than six months or remaining amounts payable to or receivable from the Company of more than $75,000. Based on all\nrelevant facts and circumstances, taking into consideration the Company’s contractual obligations, the Audit Committee shall determine if it is in the best interests of the\nCompany and its stockholders to continue, modify or terminate the related-person transaction.\n65\nRelated Party Transactions\nOperating Agreement\nWe operate our business through Greenlane Holdings, LLC and its subsidiaries. The operations of Greenlane Holdings, LLC, are set forth in the Greenlane Holdings, LLC’s\nFourth Amended and Restated Operating Agreement, which we refer to as the “Operating Agreement.” As of December 31, 2023, we are the sole member of Greenlane\nHoldings, LLC and hold all of the outstanding common units in Greenlane Holdings, LLC.\nAppointment as Manager\nWe are the sole manager of Greenlane Holdings, LLC. As the manager, we control all of the day-to-day business affairs and decision-making of Greenlane Holdings, LLC. As\nsuch, we, through our officers and directors, are responsible for all operational and administrative decisions of Greenlane Holdings, LLC and the day-to-day management of\nGreenlane Holdings, LLC’s business.\nCompensation\nWe are not entitled to compensation for our services as the manager. We are entitled to reimbursement by Greenlane Holdings, LLC for all fees and expenses incurred on behalf\nof Greenlane Holdings, LLC, including all expenses associated with this offering and maintaining our corporate existence, and all fees, expenses and costs of being a public\ncompany (including expenses incurred in connection with public reporting obligations, proxy statements, stockholder meetings, stock exchange fees, transfer agent fees, legal\nfees, SEC and FINRA filing fees and offering expenses) and maintaining our corporate existence, including all costs of maintaining our Board and committees of the board,\nexecutive compensation and certain insurance policies.\nDistributions\nThe Operating Agreement requires “tax distributions,” as that term is defined in the Operating Agreement, to be made by Greenlane Holdings, LLC to its “members,” as that\nterm is defined in the Operating Agreement. Tax distributions will be made at least annually based on such member’s allocable share of the taxable income of Greenlane\nHoldings, LLC and at a commencing tax rate equal tothe highest effective marginal combined federal, state and local income tax rate applicable to corporate or individual\ntaxpayers that may potentially apply to any member for the relevant period taking into account (i) any deductions pursuant to Section 199A of the Code, and (ii) the character of\nthe relevant tax items (e.g., ordinary or capital), as we, as the sole manager of Greenlane Holdings, LLC, reasonably determine. For this purpose, the taxable income of\nGreenlane Holdings, LLC, and our allocable share of such taxable income, shall be determined without regard to any tax basis adjustments that result from our deemed or\nactual purchase of Common Units from the members (as described below under “— Tax Receivable Agreement”). The tax rate used to determine tax distributions will apply\nregardless of the actual final tax liability of any such member. Tax distributions will also be made only to the extent all distributions from Greenlane Holdings, LLC for the\nrelevant period were otherwise insufficient to enable each member to cover its tax liabilities as calculated in the manner described above. The Operating Agreement also allows\nfor distributions to be made by Greenlane Holdings, LLC to its members on a pro rata basis out of “distributable cash,” as that term is defined in the Operating Agreement. We\nexpect Greenlane Holdings, LLC may make distributions out of distributable cash periodically to the extent permitted by the agreements governing its indebtedness and as\nrequired by Greenlane Holdings, LLC for its capital and other needs, such that we in turn are able to make dividend payments, if any, to the holders of our Class A Common\nStock.\nDissolution\nThe Operating Agreement provides that the decision of the manager will be required to voluntarily dissolve Greenlane Holdings, LLC. In addition to a voluntary dissolution,\nGreenlane Holdings, LLC will be dissolved upon a change of control transaction under certain circumstances, as well as upon the entry of a decree of judicial dissolution or\nother circumstances in accordance with Delaware law. Upon a dissolution event, the proceeds of a liquidation will be distributed in the following order: (i) first, to pay all\nexpenses of winding up Greenlane Holdings, LLC; and (ii) second, to pay all debts and liabilities and obligations of Greenlane Holdings, LLC.\nIndemnification and Exculpation\nThe Operating Agreement provides for indemnification for all expenses, liabilities and losses reasonably incurred by any person by reason of the fact that such person is or was\na member or is or was serving at the request of Greenlane Holdings, LLC as the manager, an officer, an employee or an agent of Greenlane Holdings, LLC; provided, however,\nthat there will be no indemnification for actions made not in good faith or in a manner which the person did not reasonably believe to be in or not opposed to the best interests\nof Greenlane Holdings, LLC, or, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding other than by or in the right of Greenlane Holdings, LLC, where the person had reasonable\ncause to believe the conduct was unlawful, or for breaches of any representations, warranties or covenants by such person or its affiliates contained in the Operating Agreement\nor in other agreements with Greenlane Holdings, LLC.\nWe, as the manager, and our affiliates, will not be liable to Greenlane Holdings, LLC for damages incurred by any acts or omissions as the manager, provided that the acts or\nomissions of these exculpated persons are not the result of fraud, intentional misconduct, knowing violations of law, or breaches of the Operating Agreement or other agreement\nwith Greenlane Holdings, LLC.\n66\nTax Receivable Agreement\nIn connection with our initial public offering we entered into a tax receivable agreement (the “Tax Receivable Agreement”) with Greenlane Holdings, LLC and each of the\nmembers of Greenlane Holdings, LLC. We expect to obtain an increase in our share of the tax basis of the assets of Greenlane Holdings, LLC when a member receives cash or\nshares of our Class A Common Stock in connection with a redemption or exchange of such member’s Common Units for Class A Common Stock or cash (such basis increase,\nthe “Basis Adjustments”). We intend to treat such acquisition of Common Units as a direct purchase by us of Common Units or net capital assets from a member for U.S.\nfederal income and other applicable tax purposes, regardless of whether such Common Units are surrendered by a member to Greenlane Holdings, LLC for redemption or sold\nto us upon the exercise of our election to acquire such Common Units directly. Basis Adjustments may have the effect of reducing the amounts that we would otherwise pay in\nthe future to various tax authorities. The Basis Adjustments may also decrease gains (or increase losses) on future dispositions of certain capital assets to the extent tax basis is\nallocated to those capital assets.\nThe Tax Receivable Agreement provides for the payment by us to such persons of 85% of the amount of tax benefits, if any, that we actually realize, or in some circumstances\nare deemed to realize, as a result ofthe Transactions described above, including increases in the tax basis of the assets of Greenlane Holdings, LLC arising from such\nTransactions, and tax basis increases attributable to payments made under the Tax Receivable Agreement and deductions attributable to imputed interest and other payments of\ninterest pursuant to the Tax Receivable Agreement. Greenlane Holdings, LLC will have in effect an election under Section 754 of the Code effective for each taxable year in\nwhich a redemption or exchange of Common Units for shares of our Class A Common Stock or cash occurs. These Tax Receivable Agreement payments are not conditioned\nupon any continued ownership interest in either Greenlane Holdings, LLC or us by any member. The rights of each member under the Tax Receivable Agreement are assignable\nby each member with our consent, which we may not unreasonably withhold, so long as the assignee joins as a party to the Tax Receivable Agreement. We expect to benefit\nfrom the remaining 15% of tax benefits, if any, that we may actually realize.\nThe actual Basis Adjustments, as well as any amounts paid to the members under the Tax Receivable Agreement, will vary depending on a number of factors, including:\n●the timing of any subsequent redemptions or exchanges — for instance, the increase in any tax deductions will vary depending on the fair value, which may fluctuate over\ntime, of the depreciable or amortizable assets of Greenlane Holdings, LLC at the time of each redemption or exchange;\n●the price of shares of our Class A Common Stock at the time of redemptions or exchanges — the Basis Adjustments, as well as any related increase in any tax deductions, is\ndirectly related to the price of shares of our Class A Common Stock at the time of each redemption or exchange;\n●the extent to which such redemptions or exchanges are taxable — if a redemption or exchange is not taxable for any reason, increased tax deductions will not be available; and\n●the amount and timing of our income — the Tax Receivable Agreement generally will require us to pay 85% of the tax benefits as and when those benefits are treated as\nrealized under the terms of the Tax Receivable Agreement. If we do not have taxable income, we generally will not be required (absent a change of control or other\ncircumstances requiring an early termination payment) to make payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement for that taxable year because no tax benefits will have been\nactually realized. However, any tax benefits that do not result in realized tax benefits in a given taxable year will likely generate tax attributes that may be utilized to generate\ntax benefits in previous or future taxable years. The utilization of any such tax attributes will result in payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement.\nFor purposes of the Tax Receivable Agreement, cash savings in income and franchise tax are computed by comparing our actual income and franchise tax liability to the\namount of such taxes that we would have been required to pay had there been no Basis Adjustments and had the Tax Receivable Agreement not been entered into. The Tax\nReceivable Agreement generally applies to each of our taxable years, beginning with the first taxable year ending after the completion of this offering. There is no maximum\nterm for the Tax Receivable Agreement; however, the Tax Receivable Agreement may be terminated by us pursuant to an early termination procedure that requires us to pay the\nmembers an agreed upon amount equal to the estimated present value of the remaining payments to be made under the agreement (calculated based on certain assumptions,\nincluding regarding tax rates and utilization of the Basis Adjustments).\nThe payment obligations under the Tax Receivable Agreement are obligations of our company and not of Greenlane Holdings, LLC. Although the actual timing and amount of\nany payments that may be made under the Tax Receivable Agreement will vary, we expect that the payments that we may be required to make to the members could be\nsubstantial. Any payments made by us to members under the Tax Receivable Agreement will generally reduce the amount of overall cash flow that might have otherwise been\navailable to us or to Greenlane Holdings, LLC and, to the extent that we are unable to make payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement for any reason, the unpaid amounts\ngenerally will be deferred and will accrue interest until paid by us.\n67\nDecisions made by us in the course of running our business, such as with respect to mergers, asset sales, other forms of business combinations or other changes in control, may\ninfluence the timing and amount of payments that are received by a member under the Tax Receivable Agreement. For example, the earlier disposition of assets following a\ntransaction that results in a Basis Adjustment will generally accelerate payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement and increase the present value of such payments.\nThe Tax Receivable Agreement provides that if (i) we materially breach any of our material obligations under the Tax Receivable Agreement, (ii) certain mergers, asset sales,\nother forms of business combination, or other changes of control were to occur, or (iii) we elect an early termination of the Tax Receivable Agreement, then our obligations, or\nour successor’s obligations, under the Tax Receivable Agreement would accelerate and become due and payable, based on certain assumptions, including an assumption that we\nwould have sufficient taxable income to fully utilize all potential future tax benefits that are subject to the Tax Receivable Agreement.\nAs a result, (i) we could be required to make cash payments to the members that are greater than the specified percentage of the actual benefits we ultimately realize in respect\nof the tax benefits that are subject to the Tax Receivable Agreement, and (ii) if we elect to terminate the Tax Receivable Agreement early, we would be required to make an\nimmediate cash payment equal to the present value of the anticipated future tax benefits that are the subject of the Tax Receivable Agreement, which payment may be made\nsignificantly in advance of the actual realization, if any, of such future tax benefits. In these situations, our obligations under the Tax Receivable Agreement could have a\nmaterial adverse effect on our liquidity and could have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing certain mergers, asset sales, other forms of business combination, or other\nchanges of control. There can be no assurance that we will be able to finance our obligations under the Tax Receivable Agreement.\nPayments under the Tax Receivable Agreement will be based on the tax reporting positions that we determine. If any such position is subject to a challenge by a taxing\nauthority the outcome of which would reasonably be expected to materially affect a recipient’s payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement, then we will not be permitted to\nsettle or fail to contest such challenge without the consent (not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed) of each member that directly or indirectly owns at least 10% of the\noutstanding Common Units. We will not be reimbursed for any cash payments previously made to any member pursuant to the Tax Receivable Agreement if any tax benefits\ninitially claimed by us are subsequently challenged by a taxing authority and ultimately disallowed. Instead, in such circumstances, any excess cash payments made by us to a\nmember will be netted against any future cash payments that we might otherwise be required to make under the terms of the Tax Receivable Agreement. However, we might not\ndetermine that we have effectively made an excess cash payment to the members for a number of years following the initial time of such payment and, if our tax reporting\npositions are challenged by a taxing authority, we will not be permitted to reduce any future cash payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement until any such challenge is\nfinally settled or determined. As a result, it is possible that we could make cash payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement that are substantially greater than our actual cash\ntax savings.\nPayments are generally due under the Tax Receivable Agreement within a specified period of time following the filing of our tax return for the taxable year with respect to\nwhich the payment obligation arises, although interest on such payments will begin to accrue at a rate of LIBOR plus 100 basis points from the due date (without extensions) of\nsuch tax return. Any late payments that may be made under the Tax Receivable Agreement will continue to accrue interest at LIBOR plus 500 basis points until such payments\nare made, including any late payments that we may subsequently make because we did not have enough available cash to satisfy our payment obligations at the time at which\nthey originally arose.\nIndemnification Agreements\nOur Bylaws provide that we will indemnify our directors and officers to the fullest extent permitted by the laws of the State of Delaware in effect from time to time, subject to\ncertain exceptions contained in our Bylaws. In addition, our Charter provides that our directors will not be personally liable to us or our stockholders for any damages other\nthan for breaches of fiduciary duty involving intentional misconduct, fraud or a knowing violation of law.\nWe have entered into indemnification agreements with each of our executive officers and directors. The indemnification agreements provide the executive officers and directors\nwith contractual rights to indemnification, and expense advancement and reimbursement, to the fullest extent permitted under the laws of the State of Delaware in effect from\ntime to time, subject to certain exceptions contained in those agreements.\nThere is no pending litigation or proceeding naming any of our directors or officers to which indemnification is being sought, and we are not aware of any pending litigation\nthat may result in claims for indemnification by any director or officer.\n68\nITEM 14.

(the “Company”) on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, as filed with the Securities and\nExchange Commission on the date hereof (the “Report”), I,Barbara Sher, the Chief Executive Officer of the Company, and I, Lana Reeve, the Chief Financial and Legal Officer\nof the Company, certify, to our knowledge, pursuant to 18 U.S.C. §1350, as adopted pursuant to Section 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, that:\n1. the Report fully complies with the requirements of Section 13(a) or Section 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended; and\n2. the information contained in the Report fairly presents, in all material respects, the financial condition and results of operations of the Company.\nDate: July 18, 2024 /s/ BARBARA SHER\nBarbara Sher\nChief Executive Officer\n(Principal Executive Officer)\n/s/ LANA REEVE\nLana Reeve\nChief Financial and Legal Officer\n(Principal Financial Officer)\nExhibit 97.1\nGREENLANE HOLDINGS, INC.\nCLAWBACK POLICY\n1. Introduction\nThe Board of Directors (the “Board”) of Greenlane Holdings, Inc. (the “Company”) believes that it is in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders to create and\nmaintain a culture that emphasizes integrity and accountability and that reinforces the Company’s pay-for-performance compensation philosophy. The Board has therefore\nadopted this policy which provides for the recoupment of certain executive compensation in the event of an Accounting Restatement resulting from material noncompliance\nwith financial reporting requirements under the federal securities laws (the “Policy”). This Policy is designed to comply with Section 10D of the Securities Exchange Act of\n1934 (the “Exchange Act”).\n2. Administration\nThis Policy shall be administered by the Board or, if so designated by the Board, the Compensation Committee, in which case references herein to the Board shall be deemed\nreferences to the Compensation Committee. Any determinations made by the Board shall be final and binding on all affected individuals.\n3. Covered Executives\nThis Policy applies to each individual who served or serves as a current or former Covered Executive, at any time during the applicable performance period for any\nperformance-based compensation Received by such executive on or after the Effective Date.\n4. Recoupment; Accounting Restatement\nIn the event the Company is required to prepare an Accounting Restatement of its financial statements due to the Company’s material noncompliance with any financial\nreporting requirement under the securities laws, the Board will:\na) review, with respect to each Covered Executive, all performance-based compensation Received by such Covered Executive during the applicable period,\nb) determine the amount of excess Incentive Compensation Received by such Covered Executive during the applicable period;\nc) require reimbursement or forfeiture of any excess Incentive Compensation Received by any Covered Executive during the three completed fiscal years immediately\npreceding the date on which the Company is required to prepare an Accounting Restatement; and\nd) reasonably promptly but in any event no later than 60 days after the date an Accounting Restatement is filed with the SEC, provide to each Covered Executive a written\nnotice containing the amount of excess Incentive Compensation and a demand for repayment or return, as applicable.\n5. Incentive Compensation\nFor purposes of this Policy, Incentive Compensation means any of the following; provided that, such compensation is granted, earned, or vested based wholly or in part on the\nattainment of a financial reporting measure:\n● Annual bonuses and other short- and long-term cash incentives.\n● Stock options.\n● Stock appreciation rights.\n● Restricted stock.\n● Restricted stock units.\n● Performance shares.\n● Performance units.\nFinancial reporting measures include:\n● Company stock price.\n● Total shareholder return.\n● Revenues.\n● Net income.\n● Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA).\n● Funds from operations.\n● Liquidity measures such as working capital or operating cash flow.\n● Return measures such as return on invested capital or return on assets.\n● Earnings measures such as earnings per share.\n6.

Method of Recoupment\nThe Board will determine, in its sole discretion, the method for recouping Incentive Compensation hereunder based on all applicable facts and circumstances which may\ninclude, without limitation:\na) requiring reimbursement of cash Incentive Compensation previously paid;\nb) seeking recovery of any gain realized on the vesting, exercise, settlement, sale, transfer, or other disposition of any equity-based awards;\nc) offsetting the recouped amount from any compensation otherwise owed by the Company to the Covered Executive;\nd) cancelling outstanding vested or unvested equity awards; and/or\ne) taking any other remedial and recovery action permitted by law, as determined by the Board.\nNotwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Company shall not be required to seek recoupment to the extent the Board determines that recoupment would be\nimpracticable in a manner consistent with Rule 10D-1 of the Exchange Act and the listing standards of the national securities exchange on which the Company’s securities are\nlisted, because either the direct expenses paid to a third party to assist in enforcing this Policy against a Covered Executive would exceed the amount to be recovered from that\nCovered Executive, after the Company has made a reasonable attempt to recover the excess Incentive Compensation.\n8.

The Board may require that any employment agreement, equity award agreement, or similar\nagreement entered into on or after the Effective Date shall, as a condition to the grant of any benefit thereunder, require a Covered Executive to agree to abide by the terms of\nthis Policy. Any right of recoupment under this Policy is in addition to, and not in lieu of, any other remedies or rights of recoupment that may be available to the Company\npursuant to the terms of any similar policy in any employment agreement, equity award agreement, or similar agreement and any other legal remedies available to the\nCompany.\n14. Successors\nThis Policy shall be binding and enforceable against all Covered Executives and their beneficiaries, heirs, executors, administrators or other legal representatives.\n15.
