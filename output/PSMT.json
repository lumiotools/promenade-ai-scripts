Generally, a non-GAAP financial measure is a numerical measure of a company's performance, financial position or cash flows that either excludes or includes amounts that are not normally excluded or included in the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP. These measures are customary for our industry and commonly used by competitors. However, these non-GAAP financial measures should not be reviewed in isolation or considered as an alternative to any other performance measure derived in accordance with GAAP and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies in our industry or across different industries.\n\nAdjusted net income and adjusted net income per diluted share are important measures used by management to compare the performance of our core operations between periods. We define adjusted net income as net income, as reported, adjusted for: separation costs associated with the departure of our former Chief Executive Officer, the write-off of certain Aeropost receivables, the write-off of certain VAT receivables following unfavorable court rulings, impairment charges primarily related to the write down of assets in connection with our decision in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2023 to seek to sell our Trinidad sustainable packaging plant, the gain on the acquisition of a building, and the tax impact of the foregoing adjustments on net income. We define adjusted net income per diluted share as adjusted net income divided by the weighted-average diluted shares outstanding.\n\nWe believe adjusted net income and adjusted net income per diluted share are useful metrics to investors and analysts because they present more accurate year-over-year comparisons for our net income and net income per diluted share because adjusted items are not the result of our normal operations. We note that no adjustments to net income or net income per diluted share have been made for the three-month and twelve-month periods ended August 31, 2024.\n\nThe following table shows the Company's reconciliation of net income to adjusted net income and adjusted net income per diluted share for the periods indicated:\n\n**Three Months Ended** | **Years Ended**  \n---|---  \n_(Amounts in thousands, except per share data)_ | **August 31,****2024** | **August 31,****2023** | **August 31,****2024** | **August 31,****2023**  \nNet income as reported | $ 29,068 | $ 15,381 | $ 138,875 | $ 109,205  \nAdjustments:  \nSeparation costs associated with Chief Executive Officer departure (1) | — | — | — | 7,747  \nAeropost-related write-offs (2) | — | — | — | 2,786  \nVAT receivable write-off (3) | — | — | — | 2,309  \nAsset impairment and closure costs (4) | — | 5,658 | — | 5,658  \nGain on acquisition of building (5) | — | (948) | — | (948)  \nTax impact of adjustments to net income (6) | — | 266 | — | (284)  \nAdjusted net income | $ 29,068 | $ 20,357 | $ 138,875 | $ 126,473  \nNet income per diluted share | $ 0.94 | $ 0.49 | $ 4.57 | $ 3.50  \nSeparation costs associated with Chief Executive Officer departure  | — | — | — | 0.23  \nAeropost-related write-offs | — | — | — | 0.09  \nVAT receivable write-off  | — | — | — | 0.08  \nAsset impairment and closure costs | — | 0.18 | — | 0.18  \nGain on acquisition of building | — | (0.02) | — | (0.02)  \nAdjusted net income per diluted share | $ 0.94 | $ 0.65 | $ 4.57 | $ 4.06  \n  \n(1)  | Reflects $7.7 million of separation costs associated with the departure of our former Chief Executive Officer in February 2023.  \n---|---  \n(2)  | Reflects $2.1 million of Aeropost-related write-offs in the first quarter of fiscal year 2023 and $660,000 of a receivable written-off in connection with the settlement in the third quarter of fiscal year 2023 of a claim for indemnification from the buyer of the Aeropost business.  \n(3)  | Reflects $2.3 million of VAT receivables deemed not recoverable and written-off in the third quarter of fiscal year 2023 following unfavorable court rulings.  \n(4)  | Reflects $5.7 million of impairment charges primarily related to the write down of assets in connection with our decision in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2023 to seek to sell our Trinidad sustainable packaging plant.  \n(5)  | Reflects a $950,000 gain related to a building we acquired upon the early termination of a lease in which we were the lessor of the land on which the building was constructed by and abandoned by one of our tenants.  \n(6)  | Reflects the tax effect of the above-mentioned adjustments.  \n  \n_Adjusted EBITDA_\n\nAdjusted EBITDA is defined as net income before interest expense, net, provision for income taxes and depreciation and amortization, adjusted for the impact of certain other items, including interest income; other income (expense), net; separation costs associated with Chief Executive Officer departure; asset impairment and closure costs; Aeropost write-offs; and the write-off of certain VAT receivables following unfavorable court rulings.

The translation of the operations of our foreign-based entities from their local currencies into U.S. dollars is sensitive to changes in foreign currency exchange rates and can have a significant impact on our reported financial results. We believe that constant currency is a useful measure, indicating the actual growth of our operations. When we use the term \"net merchandise sales - constant currency,\" it means that we have translated current year net merchandise sales at prior year monthly average exchanges rates. Net merchandise sales - constant currency results exclude the effects of foreign currency translation. Similarly, when we use the term \"comparable net merchandise sales - constant currency,\" it means that we have translated current year comparable net merchandise sales at prior year monthly average exchanges rates. Comparable net merchandise sales - constant currency results exclude the effects of foreign currency translation.\n\nNet merchandise sales growth rate on a net merchandise sales - constant currency basis is calculated as follows:\n\n**August 31, 2024**  \n---  \n**Three Months Ended** | **Year Ended**  \n_(Amounts in thousands, except % growth)_ | **Net Merchandise Sales** | **% Growth** | **Net Merchandise Sales** | **% Growth**  \nNet merchandise sales | $ 1,192,658 | 9.5 % | $ 4,783,119 | 11.2 %  \nFavorable impact of foreign currency exchange | 2,700 | 0.2 % | 114,121 | 2.6 %  \nNet merchandise sales on a constant-currency basis | $ 1,189,958 | 9.3 % | $ 4,668,998 | 8.6 %  \n  \nComparable net merchandise sales growth rate on a net merchandise sales - constant currency basis is calculated as follows:\n\n**September 1, 2024**  \n---  \n**Thirteen Weeks Ended** | **Fifty-Two****Weeks Ended**  \n**% Growth** | **% Growth**  \nComparable net merchandise sales | 6.2 % | 7.7 %  \nFavorable impact of foreign currency exchange | 0.2 % | 2.5 %  \nComparable net merchandise sales on a constant-currency basis | 6.0 % | 5.2 %  \n  \n![Cision](https://c212.net/c/img/favicon.png?sn=LA43959&sd=2024-10-30) View original content to download multimedia:<https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/pricesmart-announces-fiscal-2024-fourth-quarter-operating-results-and-plans-for-seventh-warehouse-club-in-guatemala-302291980.html>\n\nSOURCE PriceSmart, Inc.\n\nCategories: Press Releases\n\n[ View all news ](/news/default.aspx)\n"

Generally, a non-GAAP financial measure is a numerical measure of a company's performance, financial position or cash flows that either excludes or includes amounts that are not normally excluded or included in the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP. These measures are customary for our industry and commonly used by competitors. However, these non-GAAP financial measures should not be reviewed in isolation or considered as an alternative to any other performance measure derived in accordance with GAAP and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies in our industry or across different industries.\n\nAdjusted net income and adjusted net income per diluted share are important measures used by management to compare the performance of our core operations between periods. We define adjusted net income as net income, as reported, adjusted for: separation costs associated with the departure of our former Chief Executive Officer, the write-off of certain VAT receivables following unfavorable court rulings, the write-off of certain Aeropost receivables, and the tax impact of the foregoing adjustments on net income. We define adjusted net income per diluted share as adjusted net income divided by the weighted-average diluted shares outstanding.\n\nWe believe adjusted net income and adjusted net income per diluted share are useful metrics to investors and analysts because they present more accurate year-over-year comparisons for our net income and net income per diluted share because adjusted items are not the result of our normal operations. \n\nThe following table shows the Company's reconciliation of net income to adjusted net income and adjusted net income per diluted share for the periods indicated:\n\n**Three Months Ended** | **Nine Months Ended**  \n---|---  \n_(Amounts in thousands, except per share data)_ | **May 31,****2024** | **May 31,****2023** | **May 31,****2024** | **May 31,****2023**  \nNet income as reported | $ 32,489 | $ 29,572 | $ 109,807 | $ 93,824  \nAdjustments:  \nSeparation costs associated with Chief Executive Officer departure (1) | — | — | — | 7,747  \nVAT receivable write-off (2) | — | 2,309 | — | 2,309  \nAeropost-related write-offs (3) | — | 661 | — | 2,786  \nTax impact of adjustments to net income (4) | — | — | — | (550)  \nAdjusted net income  | $ 32,489 | $ 32,542 | $ 109,807 | $ 106,116  \nNet income per diluted share | $ 1.08 | $ 0.94 | $ 3.62 | $ 3.01  \nSeparation costs associated with Chief Executive Officer departure  | — | — | — | 0.23  \nVAT receivable write-off  | — | 0.08 | — | 0.08  \nAeropost-related write-offs | — | 0.02 | — | 0.09  \nAdjusted net income per diluted share | $ 1.08 | $ 1.04 | $ 3.62 | $ 3.41  \n  \n(1) | Reflects $7.7 million of separation costs associated with the departure of our former Chief Executive Officer in February 2023.  \n---|---  \n(2) | Reflects $2.3 million of VAT receivables deemed not recoverable and written off in the third quarter of fiscal year 2023 following unfavorable court rulings.  \n(3) | Reflects $2.8 million consisting of $2.1 million of Aeropost-related write-offs in the first quarter of fiscal year 2023 and $0.7 million of Aeropost-related write-offs in the third quarter of fiscal year 2023.  \n(4) | Reflects the tax effect of the above-mentioned adjustments.  \n  \n_Adjusted EBITDA_\n\nAdjusted EBITDA is defined as net income before interest expense, net, provision for income taxes and depreciation and amortization, adjusted for the impact of certain other items, including interest income; other income (expense), net; separation costs associated with Chief Executive Officer departure, the write-off of certain VAT receivables following unfavorable rulings, and Aeropost-related write-offs.

The translation of the operations of our foreign-based entities from their local currencies into U.S. dollars is sensitive to changes in foreign currency exchange rates and can have a significant impact on our reported financial results. We believe that constant currency is a useful measure, indicating the actual growth of our operations. When we use the term \"net merchandise sales - constant currency,\" it means that we have translated current year net merchandise sales at prior year monthly average exchanges rates. Net merchandise sales - constant currency results exclude the effects of foreign currency translation. Similarly, when we use the term \"comparable net merchandise sales - constant currency,\" it means that we have translated current year comparable net merchandise sales at prior year monthly average exchanges rates. Comparable net merchandise sales - constant currency results exclude the effects of foreign currency translation.\n\nNet merchandise sales growth rate on a net merchandise sales - constant currency basis is calculated as follows:\n\n**May 31, 2024**  \n---  \n**Three Months Ended** | **Nine Months Ended**  \n**Net merchandise sales** | **% Growth** | **Net merchandise sales** | **% Growth**  \nNet merchandise sales | $ 1,194,531 | 11.6 % | $ 3,590,461 | 11.8 %  \nFavorable impact of foreign currency exchange | 27,282 | 2.5 % | 111,423 | 3.5 %  \nNet merchandise sales on a constant-currency basis | $ 1,167,249 | 9.1 % | $ 3,479,038 | 8.3 %  \n  \nComparable net merchandise sales growth rate on a net merchandise sales - constant currency basis is calculated as follows:\n\n**June 2, 2024**  \n---  \n**Thirteen Weeks** **Ended** | **Thirty-Nine Weeks Ended**  \n**% Growth** | **% Growth**  \nComparable net merchandise sales | 7.8 % | 8.2 %  \nFavorable impact of foreign currency exchange | 2.2 % | 3.2 %  \nComparable net merchandise sales on a constant-currency basis | 5.6 % | 5.0 %  \n  \n![Cision](https://c212.net/c/img/favicon.png?sn=LA58049&sd=2024-07-10) View original content to download multimedia:<https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/pricesmart-announces-fiscal-2024-third-quarter-operating-results-302193930.html>\n\nSOURCE PriceSmart, Inc.\n\nCategories: Press Releases\n\n[ View all news ](/news/default.aspx)\n"

Risk Factors.” Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made, and we do not undertake to\nupdate these statements, except as required by law. In addition, these risks are not the only risks that the Company faces.\nThe Company could also be affected by additional factors that apply to all companies operating globally and in the U.S., as\nwell as other risks that are not presently known to the Company or that the Company currently considers to be immaterial.\nPART I\nItem 1. Business\nGeneral\nPriceSmart was founded in 1996 by Sol and Robert Price, the creators of Price Club, the original warehouse club\noperator. The mission of PriceSmart is to operate its warehouse club business in Central America, the Caribbean and\nColombia at operating standards as good as, or superior to, warehouse club operations in the United States.\nAs of August 31, 2024, we had 54 warehouse clubs in operation in Central America, the Caribbean and Colombia.\nWe believe PriceSmart has become one of the most respected and trusted brands in the region. With nearly two million\nmembership accounts and almost four million cardholders, we believe PriceSmart is an essential part of the shopping\nexperience for consumers and small businesses in PriceSmart’s markets.\nPriceSmart sources slightly more than half its merchandise from suppliers within the region, with the balance of\nmerchandise sourced throughout the rest of the world. Product selection includes basic consumable merchandise for\nconsumers and businesses, “Member’s Selection®” private label merchandise and unique consumable and non-consumable\nproducts that are often not otherwise available in our markets.\nPriceSmart continually focuses on innovation. In recent years, PriceSmart has added optical, audiology, and\npharmacy services in many of its locations. PriceSmart provides online shopping to our Members and offers both home\ndelivery and curbside pickup. PriceSmart is making significant investments in technology to both improve the online\nshopping experience for its Members and to enhance operating efficiencies in its supply chain and the back office.\nPriceSmart seeks to provide the best working conditions possible for our almost 12,000 employees. We seek to\nprovide safe and pleasant working environments for our employees, along with excellent pay and benefits, including\nhealthcare and retirement benefits.\nPriceSmart is committed to improving the quality of life for people living in the communities in which it does\nbusiness. In partnership with Price Philanthropies Foundation, PriceSmart provides school supplies to approximately\n150,000 children, and eye exams to thousands of children through its Aprender y Crecer program. In addition, the newly\ncreated PriceSmart Foundation makes grants to support work force development, small business entrepreneurship and to\nimprove the environment.\nWe believe that operating our business at the highest standards, providing outstanding jobs for our employees and\nbeing good stewards of the communities in which we operate result in PriceSmart being a good investment for our\nstockholders.\n1\nTable of Contents\nThe number of warehouse clubs for each country or territory were as follows:\nNumber of Number of\nWarehouse Clubs Warehouse Clubs Anticipated Warehouse\nin Operation as of in Operation as of Club Openings in Fiscal\nCountry/Territory August 31, 2023 August 31, 2024 Year 2025\nColombia 9 10 —\nCosta Rica 8 8 1\nPanama 7 7 —\nGuatemala 5 6 1\nDominican Republic 5 5 —\nTrinidad 4 4 —\nEl Salvador 3 4 —\nHonduras 3 3 —\nNicaragua 2 2 —\nJamaica 2 2 —\nAruba 1 1 —\nBarbados 1 1 —\nU.S. Virgin Islands 1 1 —\nTotals 51 54 2\nOur warehouse clubs, one regional distribution center and several smaller local distribution centers are located in\nLatin America and the Caribbean, and our corporate headquarters, U.S. buying operations and our larger regional\ndistribution center are located in the United States. Our operating segments are the United States, Central America, the\nCaribbean and Colombia.\nWe have purchased land and plan to open our ninth warehouse club in Costa Rica, located in Cartago,\napproximately 10 miles east from the nearest club in the capital of San Jose. The club will be built on a six-acre property\nand is anticipated to open in the spring of 2025. Additionally, we expect to formalize a land lease in the first quarter of\nfiscal year 2025 and build our seventh warehouse club in Guatemala, located in Quetzaltenango, approximately 122 miles\nwest from the nearest club in the capital of Guatemala City. This club will be built on a four-acre property and is\nanticipated to open in the summer of 2025. Once these two new clubs are open, we will operate 56 warehouse clubs in\ntotal.\nWe also historically exported products to a retailer in the Philippines, but effective August 31, 2024, our business\nrelationship with that retailer ceased, except for some outstanding merchandise orders to be fulfilled in fiscal year 2025.\nHowever, we are exploring expansion of our export business in other markets and recently began exporting to a retailer in\nthe Bahamas.\n2\nTable of Contents\nMerchandising\nA fundamental part of our value proposition is making available to our retail and business Members a selection of\nhigh-quality merchandise and services sourced within our region and from around the world, at lower prices than our\ncompetitors.\nWe offer merchandise and services in the following categories:\n• Consumables, consisting primarily of groceries, cleaning supplies, and health and beauty aids, representing\napproximately 49% of our net merchandise sales;\n• Fresh Foods, including meat, produce, deli, seafood and poultry, representing approximately 30% of our net\nmerchandise sales;\n• Hardlines, including electronics, large and small appliances, automotive, hardware, sporting goods, and\nseasonal products, representing approximately 11% of our net merchandise sales;\n• Softlines, including clothing, domestics and home furnishing products, representing approximately 5% of our\nnet merchandise sales;\n• Food Service and Bakery, representing approximately 4% of our net merchandise sales; and\n• Health Services, including optical, audiology and pharmacy, representing approximately 1% of our net\nmerchandise sales.\nCompetitive Strengths\nLow Operating Costs. Our club format is designed to move merchandise from suppliers to PriceSmart Members at\na lower expense ratio than our competitors. We strive to achieve efficiencies in product distribution by minimizing the\nlabor required to stock and display merchandise, limiting non-payroll operating expenses and maintaining low occupancy\ncosts. For example, we offer a limited number of stock keeping units (SKUs) with large pack sizes, which allows us to\nkeep shelves stocked with less labor cost than competitors that offer a greater number of SKUs. More recently, we also\nhave opened distribution centers in certain of our high-volume markets to improve efficiency and in-stock rate, reduce lead\ntimes on high volume products, and mitigate risks of supply chain disruption. Our focus on lowering operating costs\nsupports better value and lower prices for our Members, which we believe helps generate Member loyalty and renewals,\nwhich in turn leads to increased sales.\nMembership. Our membership provides a competitive advantage. Membership targets a desirable demographic\nwith strong purchasing power. Data we can access about our Members not only provides better connectivity with our\nMembers, but also enables us to identify and pursue additional opportunities to provide value for our Members.\nMembership has been a basic operating characteristic in the warehouse club industry, beginning over 48 years ago at Price\nClub, the first membership warehouse club business. We believe membership promotes Member loyalty, and membership\nfees contribute to our ability to operate our business on lower margins than conventional retailers and wholesalers.\nMembership fees were equal to approximately 1.6% of net merchandise sales and 34.1% of operating income in fiscal year\n2024. Our Members can sign up for and renew their memberships online, which gives us another valuable digital touch\npoint with them.\nWe continue to expand our product and services offerings to our Members. One of our primary initiatives is the\nexpansion of our wellness services, which include our optical, pharmacy and audiology departments. As of August 31,\n2024, we had 53 optical locations, 14 pharmacies and 29 audiology locations open. We expect to continue the rollout of\naudiology in fiscal year 2025. In addition, we expect to have pharmacies in substantially all clubs in Costa Rica, Panama\nand Guatemala by the end of fiscal year 2025. We believe that untapped opportunities exist to enhance the value of our\nmembership further in various areas. We continue to explore opportunities to provide our Members with products and\nservices that are particularly attractive to our unique membership base.\nBusiness Members. Our product selection, larger pack sizes, and low prices appeal to both business and retail\nconsumers. Business Members include a broad cross section of businesses such as restaurants, institutions, and other\nbusinesses that purchase products for resale and supplies used in their businesses. These business Members represent a\nsignificant source of sales and profit and provide purchasing volume that gives us better prices from our suppliers.\nWorldwide Sourcing. Approximately 49% of our sales come from merchandise sourced in the U.S., Asia and\nEurope. One of the primary advantages we have compared to most of our local competitors is our United States-based\nbuying team that sources merchandise from suppliers in the U.S. and around the world. Our buyers identify and purchase\nnew and exciting items, including our own “Member’s Selection®” private label products. Many of these products are\navailable only at PriceSmart in the markets in which we operate.\n3\nTable of Contents\nInnovation. The warehouse club industry has been operating for almost 50 years, following the founding of Price\nClub in 1976. The world of merchandising has evolved during this period, particularly with respect to how technology\nimpacts operational efficiencies and how consumers shop. We are leveraging technological innovations we have developed\nto enhance our worldwide sourcing of products and make these products available in our countries in a manner that meets\ncurrent consumer preferences. We operate in multiple markets, many of which are relatively small, with different legal\nrequirements, local buying opportunities, cultural norms, distribution and logistical challenges and Member preferences\nthat require us to source the correct mix of local and imported merchandise. We believe that our future success is highly\ndependent on our capacity to continue to adapt and innovate to meet the needs of our current and future Members. We also\nhave developed better inbound and outbound online communication channels, and we are using data analytics to better\nunderstand our Members’ evolving preferences.\nExperienced Management Team. Robert E.

Their\nexperience and knowledge represent a key strength and competitive advantage for our Company.\n4\nTable of Contents\nGrowth\nAs we look to the future, our Company is focused on three major drivers of growth:\n• Invest in Remodeling Current PriceSmart Clubs, Adding New PriceSmart Locations and\nOpening More Distribution Centers\n• Increase Membership Value\n• Drive Incremental Sales via PriceSmart.com and Enhanced Online, Digital and\nTechnological Capabilities\nI. Invest in Remodeling Current PriceSmart Clubs, Adding New PriceSmart Locations and Opening More\nDistribution Centers. We believe that one of the quickest and most effective ways to increase sales and\nprofitability is to increase the size and efficiency of our existing warehouse clubs and the number of parking\nspaces at our high-volume locations. For instance, we are currently remodeling our clubs in San Pedro Sula,\nHonduras and Santiago, Dominican Republic. In the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2024, we completed the remodel\nof our warehouse in Port of Spain, Trinidad and Tobago and the expansion of our warehouse club in Liberia,\nCosta Rica. We are also currently expanding our clubs in San Salvador, El Salvador and Portmore, Jamaica.\nDuring fiscal year 2024, we entered into a lease agreement to relocate and extend the lease term for our Miraflores\nclub, which is our highest selling location in Guatemala. The new warehouse will have increased sales floor\nsquare footage and a greater number of parking spaces, along with covered parking for our Members. We also\ncompleted the purchase of the land and building for our Via Brasil club in Panama, which we previously leased.\nThe Via Brasil club had the highest sales volume in our Panama market during fiscal year 2024. We continue to\npursue opportunities to add new warehouse clubs in our existing markets and to assess opportunities in new\nmarkets. We have plans to open a new warehouse club in Cartago, near the capital of San Jose, in Costa Rica, in\nthe spring of 2025. Additionally, we expect to formalize a land lease in the first quarter of fiscal year 2025 and\nbuild our seventh warehouse club in Guatemala, in the city of Quetzaltenango, in the summer of 2025. We are\nenhancing our distribution and logistics network through the opening of distribution centers in China and in each\nof our multi-club markets, either operated by PriceSmart or through the use of third-party logistics providers. We\nexpect to reduce landed costs and lead times (via direct shipments from Asia to our local markets) and improve\nour working capital. In addition to our regional distribution center in Costa Rica, we have PriceSmart-operated\ndistribution centers in various stages of development and implementation in markets such as Panama, Guatemala,\nand Trinidad.\nII. Increase Membership Value. We are seeking to attract more Members and retain our current Members by\nexpanding the benefits of being a Member of PriceSmart. As benefits grow and the value of being a PriceSmart\nMember increases, adjustments to the membership fee may be warranted. We increased this fee by $5 in all but\none market on a staggered basis in fiscal year 2024. A larger membership base and higher membership fee\ncontribute to the bottom line of the business or can be reinvested in providing better pricing to our Members. We\nfocus on growth of our membership base, Member renewal rates and spend per Member as part of determining\nhow Members see our value. By adding more benefits that Members can only obtain with us, we believe we can\nachieve growth in the number of Members, which drives Membership income and Net merchandise sales. Recent\nexamples of enhancements we have made to the value of membership include: providing the ability for all of our\nMembers to transact on PriceSmart.com; pickup and delivery service in our clubs; and the implementation and\nexpansion of our Well-being initiative, which offers optical services with free eye exams for our Members and\nadditional members of their families and lower prices on discounted eyeglass frames, audiology services with free\nhearing exams and deeply discounted hearing aids, and, in some of our markets, pharmacies. Another way we\nenhance Membership value is by offering private label merchandise under the “Member’s Selection®” brand,\nwhich is available only to PriceSmart Members. We believe the “Member’s Selection®” brand carries goodwill\nand is recognized in our markets for value. Private label products also provide the opportunity to source quality\nitems locally. Select local sourcing has multiple benefits, including support of local communities in which we\noperate by enhancing business activity and creating direct and indirect jobs, mitigation of foreign currency\nexchange risk, and reduced supply chain exposure. These initiatives offer additional benefits and services for our\nMembers, whether they choose to shop on-line, in-club, or both. In fiscal year 2024, our private label sales\nrepresented 27.6% of total merchandise sales, up from 26.3% for fiscal year 2023, and we plan to continue to\ninvest in the development of additional private label products under the “Member’s Selection®” brand.\n5\nTable of Contents\nIII. Drive Incremental Sales via PriceSmart.com and Enhanced Online, Digital and Technological Capabilities.\nWe recognize the growing expectation of consumers to control their shopping experience. Consumers are more\nengaged than ever before and want access 24 hours a day and 7 days a week. We’ve continued to tailor our digital\nexperience to match this expectation and meet our Members when and where they want to shop. In fiscal year\n2024, we completed a country by country roll out of our new PriceSmart.com website and mobile application\n(Android and iOS) to complement our in-club shopping. The website and app use a MACH or headless\narchitecture, which is designed for speed and scalability. We can now build and release new Member facing\ndigital experiences without a full, end to end, technology redevelopment. This provides us the opportunity to\ncontinually strengthen and expand the scope of our relationship with each Member and offer new products and\nservices in the future. Additionally, we can strengthen our data analytics around Member behavior on the website\nand app to better serve their preferences. Identification of delivery service areas, patterns in site searches, most\nviewed items and segmented homepage offerings are a few examples of the capabilities we now have through our\ninvestment in the digital experience for the Member. We are also continually finding ways to deploy technology\nthat improves efficiency. For example, we have and will continue to enhance our order picking technology to\nreduce the time it takes to fulfill an order for the Member. This allows us to meet our Member's service\nexpectations and expand our capacity for more orders.\nDistribution Efficiency\nWe have always believed that distribution efficiency is fundamental for success in selling merchandise in our\ntraditional clubs, and in today’s world, this principle holds true for purchases made online. Because PriceSmart sources\nmerchandise from all over the world and especially in the United States, and because we are doing business in countries\nwhere infrastructure—roads and ports—is not as developed as in the United States, distribution efficiency is even more\nsignificant for us. Our ability to move products efficiently and in a timely manner from the suppliers to our Members is key\nto the cost structure of our business and, consequentially, to how low we can price our products for our Members.\nHistorically, our international suppliers and especially our U.S. suppliers have generally shipped their products to\nour Miami distribution facility where they are received and assigned to various containers for direct shipment to our\nlocations. Regional and in-country suppliers have shipped directly to our locations. As our location sales volumes have\ngrown, we have routed more products from international, regional and local suppliers to regional and local distribution\ncenters in order to improve in-stocks, reduce inventory weeks of supply, reduce logistics costs and improve working\ncapital.\nIn addition to our Miami distribution facility, we have a large regional distribution center located in the\nmetropolitan area of San Jose, Costa Rica. This 165,000 square foot facility distributes both dry and refrigerated products\nprimarily to PriceSmart clubs in Costa Rica and also ships some products to other clubs in Central America. In October\n2023, we relocated our distribution center in Panama City, Panama to an approximately 120,000 square foot leased\nbuilding that serves as a distribution center for our warehouse clubs in Panama. This distribution center operates in a\nsimilar way to our distribution center in Costa Rica. Lastly, the Company has signed one promissory lease agreement for a\nfuture distribution center in Guatemala. In the third quarter of fiscal year 2024, we started using distribution centers run by\na third party in four different markets, Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua and El Salvador. These new distribution centers\nare part of our strategy to streamline a portion of our logistics network and, together with our plans to implement origin\nconsolidation, we believe we will be able to lower freight costs, reduce transit time, and improve working capital by\naccelerating our sales conversion cycle in fiscal year 2025.\nPriceSmart's Membership Policy\nWe offer three types of memberships: Diamond, Business and Platinum.\nThe Diamond Membership is targeted at individuals and families. The annual fee for a Diamond Membership\n(entitling Members to two cards), in most markets as of August 31, 2024 was approximately $40 (excluding tax).\nThe Company currently offers the Platinum Membership program in all thirteen of its markets, which entitles\nMembers to two cards. The annual fee for a Platinum Membership in most markets is approximately $80 (excluding tax).\nThe Platinum Membership provides Members with a 2% rebate on most items, up to an annual maximum of $500.\nPlatinum Members can apply this rebate to future purchases at the warehouse club at the end of the annual membership\nperiod. The rebate is issued annually to Platinum Members on March 1 and expires August 31. Any rebate amount not\nredeemed by August 31 is recognized as breakage revenue.\n6\nTable of Contents\nWe promote our Business and Business Platinum Memberships by offering certain merchandise targeted primarily\nto businesses such as restaurants, hotels, convenience stores, offices and institutions. In most markets, our Business\nMembers pay an annual membership fee of approximately $40, or approximately $80 for Business Platinum, for a primary\nand secondary membership card and approximately $15 for additional add-on membership cards. Only businesses can\nqualify for a Business Membership, which permits up to three additional members.\nFollowing many years where our annual membership fee for two cards has been $35 in most markets ($75 for\nPlatinum), we recently decided to raise our fee by $5 in all but one market for all membership types. These fee increases\ntook place on a staggered basis in most countries during fiscal year 2024.\nMembers can sign-up and renew their memberships as well as choose auto-renewal online.\nWe recognize membership income over the 12-month term of the membership. Deferred membership income was\n$36.2 million and $31.1 million as of August 31, 2024 and August 31, 2023, respectively. Our membership agreements\nprovide that if our Members cancel their membership in the first 60 days, they will receive a full refund. After the initial 60\nday period, Members may receive a refund for the prorated share of their remaining membership fee if they so request.\nOur Intellectual Property Rights\nIt is our policy to obtain appropriate intellectual property rights protection for trademarks by filing applications for\nregistration of eligible trademarks with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office and in certain foreign countries. We also rely\non copyright and trade secret laws to protect our proprietary rights. We attempt to protect our trade secrets and other\nproprietary information through agreements with our employees, consultants and suppliers. There can be no assurance,\nhowever, that we will be successful in protecting our proprietary rights. While we believe that our trademarks, copyrights\nand other proprietary know how have significant value, changing technology and the competitive marketplace make our\nfuture success dependent principally upon our employees’ technical competence and creative skills for continuing\ninnovation.\nOur Competition\nOur international merchandising business competes with a wide range of international, regional, national and local\nretailers, and traditional wholesale distributors. We compete in a variety of ways, including the prices at which we sell our\nmerchandise, merchandise selection and availability, services offered to customers, location, store hours, shopping\nconvenience and the overall shopping experience we offer. We also prioritize above all the safety of our Members and our\nemployees. Some of our competitors may have greater resources, buying power and name recognition. In the countries in\nwhich we operate, we do not currently face direct competition from U.S. membership warehouse club operators. However,\nwe do face competition from various retail formats such as hypermarkets, supermarkets, convenience stores, cash and carry\noutlets, home improvement centers, electronic retailers and specialty stores, including those within Latin America that are\nowned and operated by large U.S. and international retailers, including Walmart, Inc. in Central America and Grupo Éxito\nand Cencosud in Colombia. We have competed effectively in our markets in the past and expect to continue to do so in the\nfuture due to the unique nature of the membership warehouse club format. It is possible that additional warehouse club\noperators may decide to enter our markets and compete more directly with a similar warehouse club format. We also face\ncompetition from online retailers, such as AmazonGlobal and Mercado Libre in Colombia, and last-mile delivery services\nthat serve our markets, and we expect that this type of competition will grow and intensify in the future. Lastly, we face\ncompetition from wholesalers selling food and/or general merchandise, which more directly competes with our business-to-\nbusiness sales.\n7\nTable of Contents\nHuman Capital\nAs of August 31, 2024, we had approximately 12,000 employees. Approximately 96% of our employees were\nemployed outside of the United States, and about 1,900 employees were represented by labor unions.\nDeveloping a Diverse Workforce Representative of Our Markets\nFundamental to our mission is the ability to attract, retain, and develop a diverse workforce representative of the\ncountries in which we operate. We are proud to hire from the local communities where we operate, which then enhances\nour understanding of the operating environment and legal framework of each country, so we can better serve our Members.\nWe believe we provide our employees with excellent wages, as well as comprehensive benefit programs, which generally\ninclude life and health insurance and post-employment savings plans. We also seek to identify opportunities to support\nlocal businesses and communities, with the goal of improving the quality of life in the countries where we operate.\nTalent Development and Learning\nProviding employees with equal opportunities for development is a key focus for PriceSmart, and we strive to\nprovide opportunities for each team member to learn and grow. We believe a focus on talent development leads to long-\nserving, loyal employees, which improves efficiencies in our operations, thus resulting in higher quality service to our\nMembers. In fiscal year 2024, we held more than 6,400 corporate talent development learning sessions, which included\ngeneral leadership training. We provided specialized training in developing a “member-centric mindset” to over 2,100\nemployees, as well as courses on emotional intelligence and psychological safety. In addition, we offer a robust range of\ncourses in technical and language skills, as well as instruction in wellness and valuable “life tools,” such as the principles\nof managing personal or household finances, raising resilient children, and how to maintain healthy boundaries and a good\nwork-life balance.\nWe also seek to promote from within, allowing us to develop the leadership strengths of our employees\nto provide a better overall customer experience for our Members.\nEngaging Our Team through Internal Events – Diversity & Inclusion\nWe strive to create a work environment that fosters a sense of belonging, inclusion, growth and engagement for all\nour team members. Each month we facilitate a wide range of activities in the countries we operate in, including\ncelebrations of birthdays and work anniversaries, volunteering, employee appreciation, health and wellness events, and\nrecreational opportunities such as futbol (soccer) games and 5K runs. We also send company-wide communications to\ncelebrate events that recognize diversity and cultural heritage and educate team members about the history and significance\nof these events.\nThe activities we facilitate do more than bring employees together. They create platforms for celebrating our\ndiversity, enriching our experiences, and fueling our shared journey toward success. In addition to promoting knowledge\nsharing, they empower our employees to grow personally and professionally, fostering an inclusive environment where we\ncelebrate unique perspectives and strengthen our organizational culture.\nSeasonality\nHistorically, our merchandising businesses have experienced holiday retail seasonality in their markets. In\naddition to seasonal fluctuations, our operating results fluctuate quarter-to-quarter as a result of economic and political\nevents in markets that we serve, the timing of holidays, weather, the timing of shipments, product mix, and currency effects\non the cost of U.S.-sourced products which may make these products more or less expensive in local currencies and\ntherefore more or less affordable. Because of such fluctuations, the results of operations of any quarter are not indicative of\nthe results that may be achieved for a full fiscal year or any future quarter. In addition, there can be no assurance that our\nfuture results will be consistent with past results or the projections of securities analysts.\nOther Information\nPriceSmart, Inc. was incorporated in the State of Delaware in 1994.

Risk Factors\nIn evaluating the Company’s business, you should consider the following discussion of risk factors, in addition to\nother information contained in this report and in the Company’s other public filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange\nCommission. Any such risks could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations, cash flow, financial\ncondition, liquidity and prospects. However, the risks described below are not the only risks facing us. Our business\noperations could also be affected by additional factors that apply to all companies operating in the U.S. and globally.\nAdditional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or those we currently view to be immaterial may also\nmaterially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and prospects.\nExternal Factors that Could Adversely Affect Us\nOur financial performance is dependent on international operations, which exposes us to various risks.\nOur international operations account for nearly all of our total revenues. Our financial performance is subject to\nrisks inherent in operating and expanding our international membership warehouse club business, which include:\n• changes in, and inconsistent enforcement of, laws and regulations, including those related to tariffs and taxes;\n• the imposition of foreign and domestic governmental controls, including expropriation risks;\n• natural disasters;\n• trade restrictions, including import-export quotas and general restrictions on importation;\n• difficulty and costs associated with international sales and the administration of an international\nmerchandising business;\n• crime and security concerns that can adversely affect the economies of the countries in which we operate and\nwhich require us to incur additional costs to provide additional security at our warehouse clubs;\n• political instability, such as anti-government protests in Panama and Guatemala in 2023 and civil unrest in\nColombia in 2022 and 2021;\n• product registration, permitting and regulatory compliance;\n• volatility in foreign currency exchange rates;\n• limitations on our ability to convert foreign currencies;\n• general economic and business conditions;\n• pandemics; and\n• interruption of our supply chain.\nThese risks may result in disruption to our sales, banking transactions, operations and merchandise shipments, any\nof which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. For example, the Colombian peso\nexchange rate with the U.S. dollar devalued approximately 15% on average throughout fiscal year 2023 compared to fiscal\nyear 2022, reducing our U.S. dollar value of sales and negatively affecting overall demand for our merchandise in\nColombia during that year. In order to mitigate the significant price increase to our Members that would be required to\nmaintain our target margins, we absorbed the increase in the costs of goods resulting from the devaluation and we took\npricing actions on certain product categories that reduced our Total gross margin during that period until the exchange rate\nnormalized and we were able to return to a more normalized margin profit. However, if the Colombia peso were to weaken\nagain and we were to again absorb the costs of the devaluation or take pricing actions to lower the cost to our Members to\nmitigate a decrease in demand, consolidated Total gross margins could be negatively impacted. Fluctuations in exchange\nrates for foreign currencies have and could continue to reduce the U.S. dollar value of sales, earnings and cash flows we\nreceive from our non-U.S. markets, increase our supply costs (as measured in U.S. dollars) in those markets, negatively\nimpact our competitiveness in those markets or otherwise adversely impact our business results or financial condition.\n9\nTable of Contents\nOur business depends heavily on the uninterrupted operation of our distribution facilities located in Miami,\nFlorida and San Jose, Costa Rica, our warehouse clubs located in Colombia, Central America and the Caribbean, and our\nheadquarters and buying operations in San Diego, California. Our operations were disrupted by the COVID-19 pandemic\nand actions government authorities in our markets took to mitigate the spread of COVID-19, including travel restrictions,\nborder closings, restrictions on public gatherings, stay-at-home orders and other quarantine and isolation measures. The\npandemic also resulted in delays or difficulty sourcing products and threatened the health of our employees and Members.\nPandemics or events of this sort have had, and may have in the future, an adverse effect on our business.\nPolitical and other factors in each of our markets may have significant effects on our business. For example,\nprotestors set up roadblocks in Guatemala in October 2023 general elections. In addition, protestors set up roadblocks in\nPanama in October and November 2023 disrupting traffic to our clubs throughout most of the market as a reaction to an\nagreement between the Panamanian government and a mining company. Civil unrest in Colombia paralyzed significant\nportions of the country’s infrastructure as roadblocks and riots disrupted normal economic activity during the third quarter\nof fiscal year 2021. Austerity and tax reform measures for Colombia and other Latin American countries with high national\ndebt levels and income disparity pose a risk for political instability.\nFrom time to time, we have experienced a lack of availability of U.S. dollars in certain markets (U.S. dollar\nilliquidity). This impedes our ability to convert local currencies obtained through merchandise sales into U.S. dollars to\nsettle the U.S. dollar liabilities associated with our imported products or otherwise fund our operations. This illiquidity also\nincreases our foreign exchange exposure to any devaluation of the local currency relative to the U.S. dollar. For more\ninformation about the lack of U.S. dollar availability risks we face, see \"Financial and Accounting Risks – We are subject\nto volatility in foreign currency exchange rates and limits on our ability to convert foreign currencies into U.S. dollars.\"\nNegative economic conditions created or exacerbated by inflation, and higher interest rates could adversely\nimpact our business in various respects.\nA slowdown in the economies of one or more of the countries in which we operate or adverse changes in\neconomic conditions affecting discretionary consumer spending could adversely affect consumer demand for the products\nwe sell, change the mix of products we sell to a mix with a lower average gross margin, cause a slowdown in discretionary\npurchases of goods, adversely affect our net sales or result in slower inventory turnover and greater markdowns of\ninventory.\nSales of food and groceries are especially sensitive to general changes in economic conditions. Economic\nconditions in our markets can be adversely affected by contractions in financial markets, increased governmental\nownership or regulation of the economy, higher interest rates, high rates of inflation or deflation, higher fuel prices,\nincreased barriers to entry such as higher tariffs and taxes, and other macroeconomic factors.\nThe economic factors that affect our operations may also adversely affect the operations of our suppliers, which\ncan result in an increase in the cost to us of the goods we sell to our customers or, in more extreme cases, in certain\nsuppliers not producing goods in the volume typically available to us.\nOur profitability is vulnerable to cost increases.\nFuture increases in costs, such as the cost of merchandise, wage and benefits costs, shipping rates, freight costs,\nfuel costs, utilities and other store occupancy costs, may reduce our profitability. We seek to adjust our product sales\npricing, operate more efficiently, and increase our comparable store net sales to help offset inflation as well as currency\nrate changes, changes in tax rates or in the methods used to calculate or collect taxes on our sales or income and other\nfactors that can increase costs. We might not be able to adjust prices, operate more efficiently or increase our comparable\nstore net sales in the future to a great enough extent to offset increased costs. Although we have seen recent inflationary\npressures subsiding, substantial product cost increases and commodity price increases have and could continue to impact\nour financial results and could lead to reduced sales, fewer units sold, and/or margin pressure. Please see Part II. “Item 7.\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,” of this Form 10-K for further\ndiscussion of the effect of currency rate changes, inflation and other economic factors on our operations.\nWe face significant competition.\nOur international warehouse club business competes with exporters, importers, wholesalers, local retailers and\ntrading companies in various international markets. Some of our competitors have greater resources, buying power and\nname recognition than we have. We also face competition from online retailers who serve our markets, and we expect that\nthis type of competition will grow and intensify in the future.\n10\nTable of Contents\nIn the countries in which we operate, we do not currently face direct competition from membership warehouse\nclub operators. However, we do face competition from various retail formats such as hypermarkets, supermarkets, cash and\ncarry outlets, home improvement centers, electronic retailers and specialty stores, including those within Latin America\nthat are owned and operated by large U.S. and international retailers, including Walmart Inc. in Central America and Grupo\nÉxito and Cencosud in Colombia. We have noted that certain retailers are making investments in upgrading their locations\nor opening of new stores which may result in increased competition. Further, it is possible that other warehouse club\noperators may decide to enter our markets and compete more directly with us in a similar warehouse club format. Our\nability to operate profitably in our markets, particularly small markets, may be adversely affected by the existence or entry\nof competing warehouse clubs or discount retailers.\nWe compete in a variety of ways, including the value and prices at which we sell our merchandise, merchandise\nselection and availability, services offered to Members, location, store hours, safety protocols and the shopping\nconvenience and overall shopping experience we offer. We may be required to implement price reductions to remain\ncompetitive if any of our competitors reduce prices in any of our markets. In response to the increasing threat associated\nwith online retailers, we are making technology investments, which may result in increases in the use of cash and reduced\nprofitability in the near term.\nOur sales could be adversely affected if one or more major international online retailers were to enter our\nmarkets or if other competitors were to offer a superior online experience.\nAlthough online sales are currently a smaller proportion of total sales in our markets for the types of merchandise\nwe offer than in the U.S., online shopping is becoming more prevalent in our markets as we and our competitors begin to\noffer more opportunities for online shopping and as delivery systems in our markets improve. While major international\nonline retailers have not established a significant penetration in any of our markets, AmazonGlobal continues to expand its\nonline marketplace and ships into most of our markets. However, other regional online retailers, such as MercadoLibre,\nhave continued to increase their presence in our markets. In the case of Rappi in Colombia, we have a partnership with\nthem in which our Members can use their platform to place online orders; however, this may not be the case for other\nonline retailers. It is possible that Amazon or other major international retailers will establish a direct presence, or smaller\nregional companies will increase their penetration of online shopping. In either case, sales through our online platform or\nwarehouse clubs could be adversely affected.\nWe are exposed to significant weather events and other natural disaster risks that might not be adequately\ncompensated by insurance, and we are susceptible to the long-term impacts of climate change.\nOur operations are subject to volatile weather conditions and natural disasters, such as earthquakes, hurricanes and\nvolcanic activity, which are encountered periodically in the regions in which our warehouse clubs and other facilities are\nlocated. Natural disasters could result in physical damage to, or the complete loss of, one or more of our properties, the\nclosure of one or more clubs or distribution centers, limitations on store or club operating hours, the lack of an adequate\nwork force in a market, the inability of customers and employees to reach our clubs, the unavailability of our digital\nplatforms to our customers, disruption in the supply of products or increases in the costs of procuring products. For\nexample, in early fiscal year 2018, operations at our USVI warehouse club were adversely affected by Hurricanes Irma and\nMaria. The warehouse club was closed for nine days, and after re-opening, the warehouse club operated with limited hours\nfor 16 days due to a government-imposed curfew. Damaged and destroyed roads restricted traffic flow, adversely affecting\ncustomer access for some time after the hurricane. Future losses from business interruption may not be adequately\ncompensated by insurance and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of\noperations.\nFurthermore, the long-term impacts of climate change, whether involving physical risks (such as extreme weather\nconditions, drought, or rising sea levels) or transition risks (such as regulatory or technology changes) are expected to be\nwidespread and unpredictable. Physical risks include extreme storms that damage or destroy our buildings and inventory or\ninterrupt our business operations and supply chain and temperature changes that increase the heating and cooling costs at\nclubs and distribution and fulfillment centers. We also may experience changes in energy and commodity prices driven by\nclimate change as well as new regulatory requirements resulting in higher compliance risk and operational costs.\n11\nTable of Contents\nWe face difficulties in the shipment of, and risks inherent in the importation of, merchandise to our warehouse\nclubs.\nOur warehouse clubs typically import nearly half or more of the merchandise that they sell. This merchandise\noriginates from various countries and is transported over long distances, over water and over land, which results in:\n• substantial lead times needed between the procurement and delivery of products, thus complicating\nmerchandising and inventory controls;\n• the possible loss of products due to theft or potential damage to, or destruction of, ships or containers\ndelivering goods;\n• product markdowns due to the prohibitive cost of returning merchandise upon importation;\n• product registration, tariffs, customs and shipping regulation issues in the locations we ship to and from;\n• the possibility of business interruption due to transportation and port strikes;\n• ocean freight and duty costs; and\n• possible governmental restrictions on the importation of merchandise.\nIn addition, as a result of COVID-19 and the measures designed to contain the spread of the virus, we faced and\nmay again face delays or difficulty sourcing products, which could negatively affect our business and financial results.\nCertain of our suppliers had their manufacturing operations disrupted by the coronavirus outbreak and, even when goods\nhad been completed, they often were subject to weeks-long shipping delays. If our third-party suppliers’ operations are\ncurtailed, again, or transportation systems are disrupted, we may need to seek alternate sources of supply, which may be\nmore expensive. If the production and distribution closures were to resume for an extended period of time, the impact on\nour supply chain could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows.\nCivil unrest in certain countries in which we operate may adversely affect the flow of goods through those\ncountries. For example, protestors set up roadblocks in Panama during October and November 2023 as a reaction to an\nagreement between the Panamanian government and a mining company, disrupting traffic to our clubs throughout most of\nthe market. Roadblocks in Guatemala in October 2023 relating to election protests also limited access to certain of our\nwarehouse clubs. Civil unrest in Colombia in response to tax reform and austerity measures paralyzed significant portions\nof the country’s infrastructure as roadblocks and riots disrupted normal economic activity during the third quarter of fiscal\nyear 2021.\nMoreover, each country in which we operate has different governmental rules and regulations regarding the\nimportation of foreign products. Changes to the rules and regulations governing the importation of merchandise may result\nin additional delays, costs or barriers in our deliveries of products to our warehouse clubs or may affect the type of\nproducts we select to import. In addition, only a limited number of transportation companies service our regions. The\ninability or failure of one or more key transportation companies to provide transportation services to us, any collusion\namong the transportation companies regarding shipping prices or terms, changes in the regulations that govern shipping\ntariffs or the importation of products, or any other disruption to our ability to import our merchandise could have a material\nadverse effect on our business and results of operations.\n12\nTable of Contents\nWe are subject to payment related risks, including risks to the security of payment card information.\nWe accept payments using an increasing variety of methods, including cash, checks, wire transfers, our co-\nbranded credit cards and a variety of other credit and debit cards. Our operations, like those of most retailers, require the\ntransmission of information associated with cashless payments. As we offer new payment options to our Members, we may\nbe subject to additional rules, regulations and compliance requirements, along with the risk of higher fraud losses. For\ncertain payment methods, we pay interchange and other related card acceptance fees, along with additional transaction\nprocessing fees. We rely on third parties to provide secure and reliable payment transaction processing services, including\nthe processing of credit and debit cards, and it could disrupt our business if these companies become unwilling or unable to\nprovide these services to us. We are also subject to payment card association and network operating rules, including data\nsecurity rules, certification requirements and rules governing electronic funds transfers, which could change over time. If\nwe fail to comply with these rules or transaction processing requirements, we may not be able to accept certain payment\nmethods. In addition, if our internal systems are breached or compromised, we may be liable for banks’ compromised card\nre-issuance costs, we may be subject to fines and higher transaction fees and lose our ability to accept credit and/or debit\ncard payments from our Members, and our business and operating results could be adversely affected. Failures or\ndisruptions in data communication and transfer services also could significantly impact our ability to transact payments to\nvendors and process credit and debit card transactions. Lastly, we or our customers may experience “spoofing”\ntransactions, particularly with respect to wire transfers, which could cause us to make payments to impostor vendors or\nresult in our not receiving timely payment from customers for merchandise we have sold.\nWe face the possibility of operational interruptions related to union work stoppages.\nWe currently have unionized employees in three of our markets (Trinidad, Barbados and Panama), and our\noperations depend on shipping, trucking, ports and other elements of the supply chain that often rely on unionized labor. A\nwork stoppage or other limitation on operations from union or other labor-related matters could occur for any number of\nreasons, including as a result of disputes under existing collective bargaining agreements with labor unions or in\nconnection with negotiation of new collective bargaining agreements. For example, while it did not impact our export\nactivities, we experienced a brief disruption to the flow of imported merchandise into our Miami distribution center\noperations because of the U.S. dockworkers strike in October 2024. A lengthy work stoppage or significant limitation on\noperations could have a substantial adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks Associated with Our Business Strategy and Operations\nAny failure by us to manage our widely dispersed operations could adversely affect our business.\nAs of August 31, 2024, we had 54 warehouse clubs in operation, located in 12 countries and one U.S. territory\n(ten in Colombia; eight in Costa Rica; seven in Panama; six in Guatemala; five in Dominican Republic; four each in\nTrinidad and El Salvador; three in Honduras; two each in Nicaragua and Jamaica; and one each in Aruba, Barbados and the\nUnited States Virgin Islands). We will need to continually evaluate the adequacy of our existing infrastructure, systems and\nprocedures, financial controls, operating controls, inventory, and safety controls and make upgrades from time to time.\nMoreover, we will be required to continually analyze the sufficiency of our inventory distribution channels and systems\nand may require additional or expanded facilities in order to support our operations. We may not adequately anticipate all\nthe changing demands that will be imposed on these systems. Any failure of our systems or our inability to effectively\nupdate our internal systems or procedures as required could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial\ncondition and results of operations.\n13\nTable of Contents\nWe depend on maintaining and expanding our membership base, and any harm to our relationship with our\nMembers could have a material adverse effect on our business, net sales and results of operations.\nOur membership provides a competitive advantage. Membership has been a basic operating characteristic in the\nwarehouse club industry, beginning over 48 years ago at Price Club, the first membership warehouse club business. We\nbelieve membership promotes Member loyalty, and membership fees contribute to our ability to operate our business on\nlower margins than conventional retailers and wholesalers. The extent to which we achieve growth in our membership base\nand sustain high renewal rates materially influences our profitability. Further, our net sales are directly affected by the\nnumber of membership cardholders, the frequency with which our Members shop at our clubs and online and the amount\nthey spend, which means the loyalty and enthusiasm of our Members directly impacts our net sales and operating income.\nAccordingly, anything that would harm our relationship with our existing Members or our ability to continue to attract new\nMembers could materially adversely affect our net sales, membership fee income and results of operations.\nFactors that could adversely affect our relationship with our Members include: our failure to provide good value to\nMembers on the goods and services we offer; our failure to provide the expected quality of merchandise; our failure to\noffer the right mix of merchandise; events that harm our reputation or the reputation of our “Member’s Selection®” brand;\nour failure to provide convenience online and in-store shopping; increases to our membership fees; and increased\ncompetition.\nWe might not identify in a timely manner or effectively respond to changes in consumer preferences for\nmerchandise, which could adversely affect our relationship with Members, demand for our products and\nmarket share.\nOur success depends, in part, on our ability to identify and respond to trends in demographics and changes in\nconsumer preferences for merchandise. It is difficult to consistently and successfully predict the products and services our\nMembers will demand. Failure to timely identify or respond effectively to changing consumer tastes, preferences or\nspending patterns could adversely affect our relationship with our Members, the demand for our products and our market\nshare. If we are not successful at predicting sales trends and adjusting purchases accordingly, we might have too much or\ntoo little inventory of certain products. If we buy too much of a product, we might be required to reduce prices or otherwise\nliquidate the excess inventory, which could have an adverse effect on margins (net sales less merchandise costs) and\noperating income. If we do not have sufficient quantities of a popular product, we might lose sales and profits we otherwise\ncould have made. As our customers expect a more personalized experience, our ability to collect, use, retain, and protect\nrelevant customer data is important to our ability to effectively meet their expectations. Our ability to collect and use that\ndata, however, is subject to a number of external factors, including the impact of legislation or regulations governing data\nprivacy, data-driven technologies such as artificial intelligence, and data security, as well as customer expectations around\ndata collection, retention, and use.\nFuture sales growth depends, in part, on our ability to successfully open new warehouse clubs in our existing\nand new markets.\nSales growth at existing warehouse clubs can be impacted by, among other things, the physical limitations of the\nwarehouse clubs, which restrict the amount of merchandise that can be safely stored and displayed in the warehouse clubs\nand the number of Members that can be accommodated during business hours. As a result, sales growth will depend, in\npart, upon our acquiring suitable sites for additional warehouse clubs. Land for purchase or lease, or buildings to be leased,\nin the size and locations in those markets that would be suitable for new PriceSmart warehouse clubs may be limited in\nnumber or not be available or financially feasible. In this regard, we compete with other retailers and businesses for\nsuitable locations. Additionally, local land use, environmental and other regulations restricting the construction and\noperation of our warehouse clubs may impact our ability to find suitable locations, and increase the cost of constructing,\nleasing and operating our warehouse clubs. We have experienced these limitations in Colombia, primarily in Bogotá, and in\nsome of our other existing markets, which has negatively affected our growth rates in those markets. Limitations on the\navailability of appropriate sites for new warehouse clubs in the areas targeted by us could have a material adverse effect on\nthe future growth of PriceSmart.\nIn some cases, we have more than one warehouse club in a single metropolitan area, and we may open new\nwarehouse clubs in certain areas where we already have warehouse clubs. A new warehouse club in an area already served\nby existing warehouse clubs may draw Members away from existing warehouse clubs and adversely affect comparable\nstore sales performance. We operate in relatively small markets. Given the growth of our sales over the past few years,\nmarket saturation could impact the rate of future sales growth.\n14\nTable of Contents\nWe might open warehouse clubs in new markets in the future. The risks associated with entering a new market\ninclude potential difficulties in attracting Members due to a lack of familiarity with us and our lack of familiarity with local\nMember preferences. In addition, entry into new markets may bring us into competition with new competitors or with\nexisting competitors with a large, established market presence. As a result, our new warehouse clubs might not be\nsuccessful in new markets.\nFailure to grow our e-commerce business through the integration of physical and digital retail channels and\nthe investments we are making to develop a robust e-commerce platform could materially adversely affect our\nmarket position, net sales and/or financial performance.\nThe retail business is quickly evolving, and consumers are increasingly embracing shopping online and through\nmobile commerce applications. As a result, the portion of total consumer expenditures with all retailers and wholesale\nclubs occurring online and through mobile commerce applications is increasing and the pace of this increase could\naccelerate. As demonstrated by our launch of our PriceSmart.com and our mobile app and the upgrade of our point-of-sale\nsystem, we are increasing our investments in e-commerce, technology and other customer initiatives. The success of our e-\ncommerce initiative continues to depend in large measure on our ability to build and deliver a seamless shopping\nexperience across the physical and digital retail channels. Operating an e-commerce platform and fulfillment of online\norders is a complex undertaking, and there is no guarantee that the resources we have applied to this effort will result in\nincreased revenues or improved operating performance. If we do not maintain a successful and relevant omni-channel\nexperience for our Members, our ability to compete and our results of operations could be adversely affected. In addition, a\ngreater concentration of e-commerce sales could result in a reduction in the amount of traffic in our warehouse clubs,\nwhich would, in turn, reduce the opportunities for cross-club sales of merchandise that such traffic creates and could reduce\nour sales within our clubs, materially affecting the financial performance of the physical retail side of our operations. In\naddition, our investments in e-commerce and technology initiatives will adversely impact our short-term financial\nperformance, and our failure to realize the benefits of these investments may adversely impact our financial performance\nover the longer term.\nWe are subject to risks associated with our dependence on third-party suppliers and service providers, and we\nhave no assurances of continued supply, pricing or access to new merchandise.\nWe have important ongoing relationships with various third-party suppliers of services and merchandise. These\ninclude, but are not limited to, local, regional, and international merchandise suppliers, information technology suppliers,\nequipment suppliers, financial institutions, credit card issuers and processors, and lessors. Significant changes in the\nrelationships or the agreements that govern the terms through which business is conducted could have a material adverse\neffect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. We have no assurances of continued supply, pricing or\naccess to new merchandise, and any supplier could at any time change the terms upon which it sells to us or discontinue\nselling to us. One of our significant suppliers operates a warehouse club business and may in the future seek to compete\nwith us in some of our markets. In addition, the manner in which we acquire merchandise, either directly from the\nsupplier’s parent company or through a local subsidiary or distributor, is subject to change from time to time based on\nchanges initiated by the supplier and for reasons beyond our control. Significant changes or disruptions in how we acquire\nmerchandise from these suppliers could negatively affect our access to such merchandise, as well as the cost of\nmerchandise to us and hence our Members, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of\noperations.\nOur failure to maintain our brand and reputation could adversely affect our results of operations.\nOur success depends on our ability to continue to preserve and enhance our brand and reputation. Damage to the\nPriceSmart brand could adversely impact merchandise sales, diminish Member trust, reduce Member renewal rates and\nimpair our ability to add new Members. A failure to maintain and enhance our reputation also could lead to loss of new\nopportunities or employee retention and recruiting difficulties. Negative incidents, such as a data breach or product recall,\ncan quickly erode trust and confidence, particularly if they result in adverse publicity, governmental investigations or\nlitigation. In particular, the propagation of negative publicity on social media, whether merited or not, can have a damaging\neffect on our business in one or more markets. In addition, we sell many products under our private label “Member’s\nSelection®” brand. If we do not maintain consistent product quality of our “Member’s Selection®” products, which\ngenerally carry higher margins than national brand products carried in our warehouse clubs, our net warehouse sales and\ngross margin results could be adversely affected and Member loyalty could be harmed. Also, accidents or personal injuries\nthat sometimes occur in our facilities, such as a Member slipping and falling or injuries caused by product falling from a\nrack, could result in negative publicity or otherwise damage the Company's reputation.\n15\nTable of Contents\nWe face the risk of exposure to product liability claims, a product recall and adverse publicity.\nIf our merchandise, such as food and prepared food products for human consumption, medication, children's\nproducts, pet products and durable goods, do not meet or are perceived not to meet applicable safety standards or our\nMembers’ expectations regarding safety, we could experience lost sales, increased costs, litigation or reputational harm.\nThe sale of these items exposes us to the risk of product liability claims, a product recall and adverse publicity. We may\ninadvertently redistribute food products or prepare food products that are contaminated, which may result in illness, injury\nor death if the contaminants are not eliminated by processing at the food service or consumer level. We package and\nmarket fresh produce products within our markets, so we may be exposed to additional risk of product liability and adverse\npublicity if those fresh food products are contaminated, which may result in illness, injury or death if the contaminants are\nnot eliminated by processing at our packaging service centers.\nWe generally seek contractual indemnification and proof of insurance from our major suppliers and carry product\nliability insurance for all products we sell to or package for our Members. However, if we do not have adequate insurance\nor contractual indemnification available, product liability claims relating to products that are contaminated or otherwise\nharmful could have a material adverse effect on our ability to successfully market our products and on our financial\ncondition and results of operations. In addition, even if a product liability claim is not successful or is not fully pursued, the\nnegative publicity surrounding a product recall or any assertion that our products caused illness or injury could have a\nmaterial adverse effect on our reputation with existing and potential Members and on our business, financial condition and\nresults of operations.\nWe rely extensively on computer systems to process transactions, summarize results and manage our business.\nFailure to adequately maintain our systems or disruptions of our systems could harm our business and\nadversely affect our results of operations.\nGiven the high number of individual transactions we have each year, we seek to maintain uninterrupted operation\nof our business-critical computer systems. Our computer systems, including back-up systems, are subject to damage or\ninterruption from power outages, computer and telecommunications failures, computer viruses, internal or external security\nbreaches, catastrophic events such as fires, earthquakes, tornadoes and hurricanes, and errors by our employees. Our\ninformation systems are not fully redundant, and our disaster recovery planning cannot account for all eventualities. If our\ncomputer systems and back-up systems are damaged or cease to function properly, we may have to make significant\ninvestments to fix or replace them, and we may suffer interruptions in our operations in the interim. Any material\ninterruption in our computer systems could have a material adverse effect on our business or results of operations.\nWe depend on third-party service providers to support transaction and payment processing, data security and other\ntechnology services. Any interruption in the operations of these service providers could, in turn, have a material adverse\neffect on us. For example, in 2022, a third party that supported our point-of-sale system became insolvent, which required\nus to quickly develop and implement short-term workarounds and delayed our migration to a cloud-based system\nintegrating in-store and online functionality.\nFrom time to time, we make technology investments to improve or replace our information processes and systems\nthat are key to managing our business. The risk of system disruption increases when system changes are undertaken.\nTargeting the wrong opportunities, failing to make the right investments, or making an investment commitment\nsignificantly above or below our needs could result in the loss of our competitive position and adversely impact our\nfinancial condition and results of operations. Additionally, the potential problems and interruptions associated with\nimplementing technology initiatives could disrupt or reduce the efficiency of our operations in the short term. These\ninitiatives might not provide the anticipated benefits or may provide them on a delayed schedule or at a higher cost. For\nexample, we have begun migrating to the Elera™ point-of-sale system, which is a Toshiba product, and if we are not able\nto successfully implement this product, or experience significant delays, it may jeopardize our operations or result in\nadditional costs.\n16\nTable of Contents\nNot updating our systems on a timely basis could leave us at a disadvantage relative to our competitors. We will\nbe at a competitive disadvantage if, over time, our competitors are more effective than us in their utilization and integration\nof rapidly evolving technologies, including artificial intelligence and machine learning technologies. Our current ERP\n(Enterprise Resource Planning) system is no longer supported by the developer of the software, which could increase the\nrisk of a system disruption. In addition, there are newer versions available from the vendors of some of our other internal\nsystems offering greater functionality and reliability that we have not yet implemented. We also continue to rely on other\nsystems we developed internally a number of years ago, and we are in the process of migrating these systems to more\nindustry-standard technologies. Several years ago, we began evaluating options to replace our ERP system. However, we\nintentionally deferred this project as originally contemplated in order to more thoroughly assess our overall IT landscape.\nWe decided that the risk, cost, and implementation cycle time of a holistic ERP system was not a sound strategy. We\ninstead turned our focus to a coordinated program of upgrading packaged applications and replacing in-house applications\nwith packaged applications designed to improve our capabilities with less risk, and in less time. We are continuing to work\non the implementation of a packaged forecast and replenishment system (RELEX) for buying and upgrades to our\npackaged WMS (Warehouse Management System) and TMS (Transportation Management System) for logistics. We\nbelieve these upgrades plus several other projects, such as our point-of-sale system replacement and e-commerce\nreplacement, will modernize our key revenue-generating systems and reduce risk of disruption. However, if we are not\nsuccessful in this strategy, we might be required to operate with obsolete technology and will be subject to risks of system\ndisruption, which would put us at a disadvantage relative to our competitors.\nWe have also begun evaluation of a modern financial management application and an integrated human resources\ninformation system for timekeeping, payroll and other HR functions to replace older applications that rely mostly on\ninternal support. These initiatives might not provide the anticipated benefits, may provide them on a delayed schedule or at\na higher cost or may cause disruptions in our business.\nAny failure by us to maintain the security of the information that we hold relating to our Company, Members,\nemployees and vendors, could damage our reputation with them, could disrupt our operations, could cause us\nto incur substantial additional costs and to become subject to litigation and could materially affect our\noperating results.\nWe receive, retain, and transmit personal information about our Members and employees and entrust that\ninformation to third-party business associates, including cloud service-providers that perform activities for us. In addition,\nwe and our third-party service providers store and maintain health-related personal information, pharmacy, and medical\nrecords in connection with our health and wellness and pharmacy businesses. We also utilize third-party service providers\nfor a variety of reasons, including, without limitation, cloud services, back-office support, and other functions. In addition,\nour online operations depend upon the secure transmission of confidential information over public networks, including\ninformation permitting cashless payments. Each year, computer hackers, cyber terrorists, and others make numerous\nattempts to access the information stored in companies’ information systems. The increased use of remote work\ninfrastructure has also increased cybersecurity risk, as remote work continues even post COVID-19. Additionally, the rapid\nevolution of artificial intelligence and integration of machine learning technologies into our internal systems may intensify\nour cybersecurity risks and create new risks to our business, operations, and financial condition.\nThe use of data by our business and our business associates is regulated in all of our operating countries. Privacy\nand information-security laws and regulations change, and compliance with them may result in cost increases due to,\namong other things, systems changes and the development of new processes. If we or those with whom we share\ninformation fail to comply with these laws and regulations, we could be subjected to legal risk as a result of non-\ncompliance.\n17\nTable of Contents\nWe or our third-party service providers may be unable to anticipate one or more of the rapidly evolving and\nincreasingly sophisticated means by which computer hackers, cyber terrorists and others may attempt to defeat our security\nmeasures or those of our third-party service providers and breach our or our third-party service providers' information\nsystems. Cyber threats are rapidly evolving and are becoming increasingly sophisticated. As cyber threats evolve and\nbecome more difficult to detect and successfully defend against, one or more hackers, cyber terrorists or others might\ndefeat our security measures or those of our third-party service providers and obtain the personal information of Members,\nemployees and vendors that we hold or to which our third-party service providers have access, and we or our third-party\nservice providers may not discover any security breach and loss of information for a significant period of time after the\nsecurity breach occurs. We or one of our third-party service providers also may be subject to a ransomware or cyber-\nextortion attack, which could significantly disrupt our operations. In the enterprise context, ransomware attacks involve\nrestricting access to computer systems or vital data until a ransom is paid. Error or malfeasance by our employees and\nconsultants, faulty password management or other irregularities may result in a defeat of our or our third-party service\nproviders’ security measures and breach our or our third-party service providers’ information systems (whether digital or\notherwise).\nAny breach of our security measures or those of our third-party service providers and loss of our confidential\ninformation, which could be undetected for a period of time, or any failure by us to comply with applicable privacy and\ninformation security laws and regulations, could cause us to incur significant costs to protect any Members and/or\nemployees whose personal data was compromised and to restore Member and employee confidence in us and to make\nchanges to our information systems and administrative processes to address security issues and compliance with applicable\nlaws and regulations.\nIn addition, such events could have a material adverse effect on our reputation with our Members, employees,\nvendors and stockholders, as well as our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity; could result in the release\nto the public of confidential information about our operations and financial condition and performance; and could result in\nlitigation against us or the imposition of penalties or liabilities. Moreover, a security breach could require us to devote\nsignificant management resources to address the problems created by the security breach and to expend significant\nadditional resources to upgrade further the security measures that we employ to guard such important personal information\nagainst cyberattacks and other attempts to access such information, resulting in a disruption of our operations.\nWe regularly reassess these risks in response to the evolving cybersecurity landscape, and any significant changes\nare promptly communicated to executive management and our Board or Audit Committee. There are no assurances that our\ncybersecurity risk management program, policies, controls, or procedures will be fully implemented, complied with, or\neffectively protect our systems and information. We have not identified and are not aware of any risks from cybersecurity\nthreats, including as a result of any prior cybersecurity incidents, which have materially affected or are reasonably likely to\nmaterially affect us, including our operations, business strategy, results of operations, or financial condition. Despite our\nsecurity measures, however, there can be no assurance that we, or third parties with which we interact, will not experience\na cybersecurity incident in the future that will materially affect us.\nOur use of artificial intelligence in our business or more rapid adoption of artificial intelligence by our\ncompetitors could result in harm to our brand and adversely affect our results of operations.\nSome of our computer systems currently, and might in the future, incorporate artificial intelligence (“AI”)\nsolutions, including machine learning and generative AI tools that collect, aggregate, and analyze data to assist in the\ndevelopment of our services and products and in the use of internal tools that support our business. These applications may\nbecome increasingly important in our operations over time. This emerging technology presents a number of risks inherent\nin its use. For example, AI algorithms are based on machine learning and predictive analytics, which can create accuracy\nissues, unintended biases, and discriminatory outcomes that could harm our brand, reputation, business, or customers.\nAdditionally, any investments we make in AI technologies might not actually make us more efficient. Our competitors or\nother third parties may incorporate AI into their businesses more rapidly or more successfully than us, which could hinder\nour ability to compete effectively and adversely affect our results of operations. The technologies underlying AI are rapidly\ndeveloping, and it is not possible to predict all of the legal, operational or technological risks related to the use of AI. While\nnew AI initiatives, laws, and regulations are emerging and evolving, what they ultimately will look like remains uncertain,\nand our obligation to comply with them could entail significant costs, negatively affect our business, or limit our ability to\nincorporate certain AI capabilities into our business.\n18\nTable of Contents\nAny failure by us to protect our trademarks, trade secrets and other intellectual property, or our actual or\nalleged infringement of other companies’ intellectual property, could harm our business.\nWe depend on our brands, such as the PriceSmart name and logo, to attract Members and make sales of goods and\nservices. We monitor and protect against activities that might infringe, dilute or otherwise violate our trademarks and other\nintellectual property, and rely on trademark and other laws of the United States and other countries in which we operate.\nWe also rely on copyright, trade secret and other intellectual property laws, as well as nondisclosure and confidentiality\nagreements and other methods, to protect our trademarks, trade names, proprietary information, technologies, and\nprocesses. Moreover, the steps we take to protect our intellectual property may not adequately protect our rights or prevent\nthird parties from infringing or misappropriating our proprietary rights, and we may be unable to broadly enforce all of our\ntrademarks. Any unauthorized use of our trademarks or other intellectual property could harm our competitive position and\nhave a material adverse effect on our financial condition, cash flows or results of operations.\nAdditionally, we cannot be certain that we do not, or will not in the future, infringe on the intellectual property\nrights of third parties. Any intellectual property infringement claims against us could be costly, time-consuming and\nharmful to our reputation or could result in injunctive or other equitable relief that may require us to make changes to our\nbusiness, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, cash flows or results of operations.\nWe may need to engage in litigation or similar activities to enforce our intellectual property rights, to protect our\ntrade secrets, or to determine the validity and scope of proprietary rights of others. Any such litigation, whether or not\nresolved in our favor, could require us to expend significant resources and divert the efforts and attention of our\nmanagement and other personnel from our business operations.\nBusiness acquisitions or divestitures and new business initiatives could adversely impact the Company’s\nperformance.\nFrom time to time, we may consider acquisition opportunities and new business initiatives. During fiscal year\n2018, we acquired Aeropost, Inc. (“Aeropost”). Acquisitions and new business initiatives involve certain inherent risks,\nincluding the failure to retain key personnel from an acquired business; undisclosed or subsequently arising liabilities or\naccounting, internal control, regulatory or compliance issues associated with an acquired business; challenges in the\nsuccessful integration of operations, and alignment of standards, policies and systems; future developments that may impair\nthe value of our purchased goodwill or intangible assets; and the potential diversion of management resources from\nexisting operations to respond to unforeseen issues arising in the context of the integration of a new business or initiative.\nWe sold the legacy casillero and marketplace businesses operated by Aeropost in October 2021. In connection\nwith this sale, we retained the technology and intellectual property rights required for the furtherance of our business\ninterest in PriceSmart.com and related capabilities. We could incur unforeseen expenses or other issues in connection with\nthe separation of these businesses. In addition, we and the buyer of the legacy casillero and marketplace businesses agreed\nto indemnify each other for any breach of representations and warranties we made to one another in the purchase\nagreement. Pursuant to these indemnification obligations, during fiscal year 2023, we wrote off approximately $700,000 of\naccounts receivable from Aeropost to fully settle claims from Aeropost’s acquiror alleging that we breached\nrepresentations and warranties regarding cybersecurity matters and worker classification.\nFailure to attract and retain qualified employees could materially adversely affect our financial performance.\nOur success depends, to a significant degree, on the continued contributions of members of our senior\nmanagement and other key operations, merchandising and administrative personnel, and the loss of any such persons could\nhave a material adverse effect on our business. We must attract, develop and retain a growing number of qualified\nemployees, while controlling related labor costs and maintaining our core values. We compete with other retail and non-\nretail businesses for these employees and invest significant resources in training and motivating them. There is no\nassurance that we will be able to adequately attract, develop and retain highly qualified employees in the future or to\nexecute management transitions when members of the Company’s senior leadership retire or otherwise leave the Company,\nwhich could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. We do not\nmaintain life or disability insurance for our key executives.\n19\nTable of Contents\nLegal and Compliance Risks\nWe face compliance risks related to our international operations.\nIn the United States and within the international markets where we operate, there are multiple laws and regulations\nthat relate to our business and operations. These laws and regulations are subject to change, and any failure by us to\neffectively manage our operations and reporting obligations as required by the various laws and regulations can result in\nour incurring significant legal costs and fines as well as disruptions to our business and operations. Such failure could also\nresult in investors’ loss of confidence in us, which could have a material adverse effect on our stock price.\nIn foreign countries in which we have operations, a risk exists that our employees, contractors or agents could, in\ncontravention of our policies, engage in business practices prohibited by U.S. laws and regulations applicable to us, such as\nthe Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the laws and regulations of other countries. We maintain policies prohibiting such\nbusiness practices and have in place global anti-corruption compliance programs designed to ensure compliance with these\nlaws and regulations. Nevertheless, we remain subject to the risk that one or more of our employees, contractors or agents,\nincluding those based in or from countries where practices that violate such U.S. laws and regulations or the laws and\nregulations of other countries may be customary, will engage in business practices that are prohibited by our policies or\ncircumvent our compliance programs and, by doing so, violate such laws and regulations. Any violations of anti-corruption\nlaws, even if prohibited by our internal policies, could adversely affect our reputation, business, or financial performance.\nWe could be subject to additional tax liabilities or subject to reserves on the recoverability of tax receivables.\nWe are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and many foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in\ndetermining our consolidated provision for income taxes. In the course of our business, there are many transactions and\ncalculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. We may recognize additional tax expense and be subject to\nadditional tax liabilities due to changes in tax laws, regulations, and administrative practices and principles, including\nchanges to the global tax framework, in various jurisdictions and any changes we make to our intercompany transaction\nstructure. In recent years, multiple domestic and international tax proposals were proposed to impose greater tax burdens\non large multinational enterprises. For example, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (\"OECD\")\ncontinues to advance proposals or guidance in international taxation, including the establishment of a global minimum tax.\nWe compute our income tax based on enacted tax rates in the countries in which we operate. As the tax rates vary\namong countries, a change in earnings attributable to the various jurisdictions in which we operate could result in an\nunfavorable change in our overall taxes. Changes in tax laws, increases in the enacted tax rates, adverse outcomes in\nconnection with tax audits in any jurisdiction, or any change in the pronouncements relating to accounting for income taxes\ncould have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. In one of the countries where we\noperate, the government made changes several years ago in the method of computing minimum tax payments, under which\nthe government sought to require retailers to pay taxes based on a percentage of sales if the resulting tax were greater than\nthe tax payable based on a percentage of income (Alternative Minimum Tax or \"AMT\"). As a result, the Company has\nmade and may continue to make income tax payments substantially in excess of those it would expect to pay based on\ntaxable income, and the rules that allow the Company to obtain refunds or to offset payments that are substantially in\nexcess of taxes payable based on taxable income are unclear or complex.\nFor example, in fiscal year 2023, we recorded a $7.2 million charge to settle the minimum tax payment dispute in\none country. Of this amount, $1.0 million is a reserve we recorded against an income tax receivable for one of the tax years\nfor which we sought a refund and the remaining $6.2 million for the unpaid years of the dispute in which we made tax\npayments using the original computation based on taxable income. As part of the settlement, we will pay the minimum tax\non a go-forward basis.\n20\nTable of Contents\nA few of our stockholders own approximately 15.3% of our voting stock as of August 31, 2024, which may\nmake it difficult to complete some corporate transactions without their support and may impede a change in\ncontrol.\nRobert E. Price, the Company’s Chairman of the Board and Interim Chief Executive Officer, and affiliates of Mr.\nPrice, including Price Philanthropies, The Price Group, LLC, The Robert & Allison Price Charitable Remainder Trust and\nvarious other trusts, collectively beneficially own approximately 15.3% of our outstanding shares of common stock. Of this\namount, approximately 71.1% (i.e., 10.9% of our total outstanding shares) is held by charitable entities. As a result of their\nbeneficial ownership, these stockholders have the ability to significantly affect the outcome of all matters submitted to our\nstockholders for approval, including the election of directors. In addition, this ownership could discourage the acquisition\nof our common stock by potential investors and could have an anti-takeover effect, possibly depressing the trading price of\nour common stock.\nFinancial and Accounting Risks\nWe are subject to volatility in foreign currency exchange rates and limits on our ability to convert foreign\ncurrencies into U.S. dollars.\nAs of August 31, 2024, we had a total of 54 warehouse clubs operating in 12 foreign countries and one U.S.\nterritory, 42 of which operate under currencies other than the U.S. dollar. For fiscal year 2024, approximately 79.5% of our\nnet merchandise sales were in foreign currencies. We may enter into additional foreign countries in the future or open\nadditional locations in existing countries, which may increase the percentage of net merchandise sales denominated in\nforeign currencies.\nOur consolidated financial statements are denominated in U.S. dollars, and to prepare those financial statements\nwe must translate the amounts of the assets, liabilities, net sales, other revenues, and expenses of our operations outside of\nthe U.S. from foreign currencies into U.S. dollars using exchange rates for the current period. As a result of such\ntranslations, fluctuations in currency exchange rates from period-to-period may result in our consolidated financial\nstatements reflecting significant adverse period-over-period changes in our financial performance or reflecting a period-\nover-period improvement in our financial performance that is not as robust as it would be without such fluctuations in the\ncurrency exchange rates.\nIn addition, devaluing foreign local currencies compared to the U.S. dollar could negatively impact the purchasing\npower of our Members for imported merchandise in those countries. Merchandise imported into our markets is generally\npurchased by the Company in U.S. dollars and priced and sold in the local currency of that country. If the local currency\ndevalues against the U.S. dollar, we may elect to increase prices in the local currency to maintain our target margins,\nmaking the products more expensive for our Members. We may also decide to reduce or modify the flow of merchandise\ninto those markets. Depending on the severity of the devaluation and corresponding price increase (as experienced in\nColombia in fiscal 2023), the demand for, sales of, and profitability of those products could be negatively impacted.\nFrom time to time, we have experienced a lack of availability of U.S. dollars in certain markets (U.S. dollar\nilliquidity). This impedes our ability to convert local currencies obtained through merchandise sales into U.S. dollars to\nsettle the U.S. dollar liabilities associated with our imported products or otherwise fund our operations. This illiquidity also\nincreases our foreign exchange exposure to any devaluation of the local currency relative to the U.S. dollar. Additionally,\nthe Company may incur significant premium costs to convert our local currencies into available tradable currencies and\nU.S. dollars. For instance, since fiscal year 2017, we have experienced this situation in Trinidad and have been unable to\nsource a sufficient level of tradable currencies. We are working with our banks in Trinidad and government officials to\nconvert all of our Trinidad dollars into tradable currencies. For instance, during fiscal year 2021, we experienced\nsignificant limitations on our ability to convert Trinidad dollars to U.S. dollars or other tradable currencies. Our balance as\nof August 31, 2024 of Trinidad dollar denominated cash and cash equivalents and short and long-term investments\nmeasured in U.S. dollars was $60.2 million, a decrease of $40.3 million from the peak of $100.5 million as of November\n30, 2020. However, as the Trinidad central bank strictly manages the exchange rate of the Trinidad dollar with the U.S.\ndollar and affects the level of U.S. Dollar liquidity in the market through its interventions, we are subject to continued\nchallenges in converting our Trinidad dollars to U.S. dollars, as well as being exposed to the risk of a potential devaluation\nof the currency.\n21\nTable of Contents\nAdditionally, during fiscal year 2023, the Honduran Central Bank began limiting the availability and controlling\nthe allocation of U.S. dollars for the conversion from Honduran lempiras to U.S. dollars. As of August 31, 2024, our\nHonduran subsidiary had approximately $22.3 million of cash and cash equivalents denominated in lempiras, which cannot\nbe readily converted to U.S. dollars for general use within the Company. We are actively working with our banking\npartners and government authorities to address this situation.\nVolatility and uncertainty regarding the currencies and economic conditions in the countries where we operate\ncould have a material impact on our operations in future periods.\nChanges in accounting standards and assumptions, projections, estimates and judgments by management\nrelated to complex accounting matters could significantly affect our financial condition and results of\noperations.\nGenerally accepted accounting principles and related accounting pronouncements, implementation guidelines and\ninterpretations with regard to a wide range of matters that are relevant to our business are highly complex and involve\nmany subjective assumptions, projections, estimates and judgments by our management. These include, but are not limited\nto assumptions, projections, estimates and judgements related to contingencies and litigation, income taxes, value added\ntaxes, and long-lived assets. Changes in these rules or their interpretation or changes in underlying assumptions,\nprojections, estimates or judgments by our management could significantly change our reported or expected financial\nperformance.\nFor example, because of Accounting Standards Update ASU 2016-02 – Leases (Topic 842), which the Company\nadopted September 1, 2019, the Company is required to recognize a “Right-of-Use” (ROU) asset and lease liability for\neach of the Company’s long-term leases. Accounting Standard Codification (ASC) 842 requires that the ROU asset be\ndesignated as a non-monetary asset and the lease liability as a monetary liability. Therefore, when accounting for a lease\nthat is denominated in a foreign currency, if remeasurement into the lessee’s functional currency is required, the lease\nliability is remeasured using the current exchange rate. We have leases in several of our subsidiaries in which the lease\npayments are denominated in a foreign currency that is not the functional currency of that entity. Therefore, we are subject\nto additional volatility in foreign currency exchange rates as a result of this accounting standard update. The monetary lease\nliability subject to revaluation as of August 31, 2024 was $31.5 million. Due to the mix of foreign currency exchange rate\nfluctuations during fiscal year 2024, the impact to the consolidated statements of income of revaluing this liability was\nimmaterial.\nItem 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments\nNone.\nItem 1C. Cybersecurity\nCybersecurity Risk Management and Strategy\nPriceSmart has developed, implemented, and maintained a cybersecurity risk management program intended to\nprotect the confidentiality, integrity and availability of our critical technology systems, data and information. We have\nimplemented processes and protocols designed to monitor, identify, mitigate and prevent material risks associated with\ncybersecurity threats and incidents relevant to internal networks, business applications, customer-facing applications,\ncustomer payment systems, and business operations. Cybersecurity represents an important component of our overall\ncross-functional approach to risk management. Our cybersecurity practices are integrated into the Company's enterprise\nrisk management (\"ERM\") approach, and cybersecurity risks are among the core enterprise risks identified for oversight by\nthe Board through our annual ERM assessment.\nOur cybersecurity risk management program utilizes information and guidance derived from industry-recognized\nframeworks, including the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) 27001 Framework and the National\nInstitute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Cybersecurity Framework 2.0 (CSF), specifically the NIST 800-53 and\nNIST 811-171 publications. While we have based our cybersecurity risk management program on these frameworks, we\nhave not obtained these specific certifications to date. Our cybersecurity risk management program is overseen by our\n22\nTable of Contents\nChief Information Officer (\"CIO\") and/or our First Vice President of Information Security (\"FVPIS\") and reviewed\nannually.\nOur cybersecurity risk management program includes but is not limited to the following:\n• risk assessments performed both internally and by external vendors to assist in the identification of material\ncybersecurity risks to our critical systems, information, products, services, and our broader enterprise\nInformation Technology (IT) environment;\n• contracting with and use of third-party service providers, where deemed necessary, to assess, test or otherwise\nassist with aspects of our security controls;\n• cybersecurity awareness training for our employees;\n• adoption of a cybersecurity incident response plan that includes procedures for responding to cybersecurity\nincidents; and\n• a risk management process for selecting and working with key service providers, suppliers, and vendors that\ntakes into account our assessment of their criticality to our operations and their respective risk profiles.\nWe continuously monitor, assess, and strategically invest to improve the effectiveness and resiliency of our\ninformation security systems to keep abreast of the dynamic and complex cybersecurity landscape.\nWe use third-party vendors to review and test our IT systems and utilize our internal team of experienced\npersonnel to evaluate and assess the efficacy of cybersecurity systems and to make recommendations and identify\nopportunities for improvements to our cybersecurity risk management program. We report the results of these assessments\nto our Audit Committee regularly and to our Board of Directors at least annually.\nIn the event of a potential cybersecurity incident, or a series of related cybersecurity incidents, we have\ncybersecurity incident response frameworks in place. These frameworks are a set of coordinated procedures and tasks that\nour incident response teams execute with the goal of ensuring timely and accurate identification, resolution and reporting of\ncybersecurity incidents both internally and externally, as necessary. We regularly test and update these frameworks to\nensure timely and accurate identification, resolution, and reporting of cybersecurity incidents.\nWe have not identified and are not aware of any risks from cybersecurity threats, including as a result of any prior\ncybersecurity incidents, which have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect us, including our\noperations, business strategy, results of operations, or financial condition. Despite our security measures, however, there\ncan be no assurance that we, or third parties with which we interact, will not experience a cybersecurity incident in the\nfuture that will materially affect us. For more information about the cybersecurity risks we face, see \"Item 1A — Risk\nFactors — Any failure by us to maintain the security of the information we hold relating to our Company, Members,\nemployees and vendors, could damage our reputation with them, could disrupt our operations, could cause us to incur\nsubstantial additional costs and to become subject to litigation and could materially adversely affect our operating results.\"\nCybersecurity Governance\nOur Board considers cybersecurity risk as part of its risk oversight function and has delegated to the Audit\nCommittee oversight of cybersecurity and other information technology risks. The Audit Committee oversees\nmanagement's implementation of our cybersecurity risk management program. The Audit Committee receives quarterly\nreports from our CIO and/or our FVPIS regarding any significant cybersecurity incidents, as well as any incidents with\nlesser impact potential. The CIO and FVPIS report quarterly to the Audit Committee and Board regarding cybersecurity\nrisks and the status of our cyber risk management program. Our CIO and/or FVPIS also periodically make presentations to\nBoard members on cybersecurity topics as part of the Board's continuing education on topics that impact our company.\nOur Cybersecurity team also provides reports to the Board’s Digital Transformation Committee. The Digital\nTransformation Committee is charged with oversight of the Company’s omni-channel development and digital\ntransformation to enhance membership and stockholder value. In this capacity, the Digital Transformation Committee\noversees the Company’s design and implementation of various IT systems, with emphasis on maintaining a secure digital\nenvironment.\nOur Cybersecurity team informs executive management about ongoing efforts to prevent, detect, mitigate, and\nremediate cybersecurity risks and incidents through various means. This may include briefings from internal security\npersonnel; sharing publicly or privately available threat intelligence and other information obtained from governmental,\npublic or private sources, including external consultants engaged by us; and forwarding alerts and reports produced by\nnetwork monitoring and security tools we deploy.\n23\nTable of Contents\nOur CIO and FVPIS collectively have over eight decades of IT and cybersecurity experience, including five\ndecades in senior-level leadership roles. Our FVPIS spent over three decades in federal law enforcement working in cyber\nrelated roles.\nItem 2. Properties\nAt August 31, 2024, PriceSmart operated 54 membership warehouse clubs, as detailed below:\nLease land\nOwn land and/or\nLocation and building building\nCOLOMBIA SEGMENT\nColombia 9 1\nCENTRAL AMERICA SEGMENT\nCosta Rica(1) 8 —\nEl Salvador 4 —\nGuatemala(2) 3 3\nHonduras 2 1\nNicaragua 2 —\nPanama(3) 6 1\nCARIBBEAN SEGMENT\nAruba — 1\nBarbados 1 —\nDominican Republic 5 —\nJamaica 2 —\nTrinidad 3 1\nUSVI — 1\nTotal 45 9\n(1) The Company purchased land located in Cartago, Costa Rica, where we plan to open our ninth warehouse club in Costa Rica in the\nspring of 2025.\nThe Company expects to formalize a land lease in the first quarter of fiscal year 2025 for land in Quetzaltenango, Guatemala, where\n(2)\nwe plan to open our seventh warehouse club in Guatemala in the summer of 2025.\n(3) In January 2024, the Company purchased one of its club's buildings and land, which was previously leased, in Panama City, Panama.\nAlthough we have entered into real estate leases in the past and will likely do so in the future, our current\npreference is to own rather than lease real estate. We lease land and in some cases land and buildings when appropriate\nsites within market areas are not available to purchase. The term on these leases for our warehouse clubs generally run for\n20 to 30 years and contain options to renew from 5 to 20 years. We actively seek to secure lease extensions or find suitable\nreplacement properties before our leases expire. We have successfully negotiated extensions in the past and believe we will\ncontinue to be able to do so in the future; however, each lease renewal is subject to its own facts and circumstances, so we\ncannot be sure that we will be able to renew each lease on economically favorable terms. For instance, we've recently\nentered into a lease agreement to relocate our Miraflores, Guatemala club, for which the current lease was due to expire on\nDecember 31, 2025, to a new location adjacent to the current club location. We expect to relocate our Miraflores club to\nthis new location in fiscal year 2026. We expect minimal impact to the continuity of our operations for this club. Refer to\nPart II. “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data: Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 9 –\nCommitments and Contingencies” for additional details on our Miraflores club relocation.\nAs of August 31, 2024, sales floors of the Company’s warehouse club buildings occupied a total of approximately\n2,646,130 square feet, of which 400,191 square feet were on leased property.\n24\nTable of Contents\nWe operate two large regional distribution centers, one in Miami, Florida and the other in San Jose, Costa Rica,\nalong with several smaller local distribution centers for the consolidation and distribution of merchandise shipments to our\nwarehouse clubs. Our corporate headquarters is located in San Diego, California, and we maintain other regional offices in\nthe Miami distribution facility and our international locations. We own our regional dry merchandise distribution facility in\nMiami, Florida, but we otherwise lease most non-warehouse club facilities and expect to continue to lease these types of\nfacilities as we expand. Our leases for non-warehouse club facilities typically provide for initial lease terms between five\nand 30 years, with options to extend. We believe this leasing strategy for non-warehouse club facilities enhances our\nflexibility to pursue expansion opportunities when the needs of our business require. As current leases expire, we believe\nthat we will be able to obtain lease renewals, if desired, for these present locations, or to obtain leases for equivalent or\nbetter locations in the same general area.\nItem 3. Legal Proceedings\nWe are often involved in claims arising in the ordinary course of business seeking monetary damages and other\nrelief. Based upon information currently available to us, none of these claims is expected to have a material adverse effect\non our business, financial condition or results of operations. Refer to Part II. “Item 8.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial\nstatements and related notes thereto included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOverview\nPriceSmart, headquartered in San Diego, California, owns and operates U.S.-style membership shopping\nwarehouse clubs in Latin America and the Caribbean, selling high quality merchandise and services at low prices to our\nMembers. We operate 54 warehouse clubs in 12 countries and one U.S. territory (ten in Colombia; eight in Costa Rica;\nseven in Panama; six in Guatemala; five in Dominican Republic; four each in Trinidad and El Salvador; three in Honduras;\ntwo each in Nicaragua and Jamaica; and one each in Aruba, Barbados and the United States Virgin Islands). We have\npurchased land and plan to open our ninth warehouse club in Costa Rica, located in Cartago, approximately 10 miles east\nfrom the nearest club in the capital of San Jose. The club will be built on a six-acre property and is anticipated to open in\nthe spring of 2025. Additionally, we expect to formalize a land lease in the first quarter of fiscal year 2025 and build our\nseventh warehouse club in Guatemala, located in Quetzaltenango, approximately 122 miles west from the nearest club in\nthe capital of Guatemala City. This club will be built on a four-acre property and is anticipated to open in the summer of\n2025. Once these two new clubs are open, we will operate 56 warehouse clubs in total. Our corporate headquarters, U.S.\nbuying operations and regional distribution centers are located primarily in the United States. Our operating segments are\nthe United States, Central America, the Caribbean and Colombia. All intercompany balances and transactions have been\neliminated in consolidation.\nMission and Business Strategy\nPriceSmart exists to improve the lives and businesses of our Members, our employees and our communities\nthrough the responsible delivery of the best quality goods and services at the lowest possible prices. We aim to serve as a\nmodel company, which operates profitably and provides a good return to our investors, by providing Members in emerging\nand developing markets with exciting, high-quality merchandise sourced from around the world and valuable services at\ncompelling prices in safe U.S.-style clubs and through PriceSmart.com. We prioritize the well-being and safety of our\nMembers and employees. We provide good jobs, fair wages and benefits and opportunities for advancement. We strive to\ntreat our suppliers right and empower them when we can, including both our regional suppliers and those from around the\nworld. We try to conduct ourselves in a socially responsible manner as we endeavor to improve the quality of the lives of\nour Members and their businesses, while respecting the environment and the laws of all the countries in which we operate.\nWe also believe in facilitating philanthropic contributions to the communities in which we do business. We charge\nMembers an annual membership fee that enables us to operate our business with lower margins than traditional retail\nstores. As we continue to invest in technological capabilities, we are increasing our tools to drive sales and operational\nefficiencies. We believe we are well positioned to blend the excitement and appeal of our brick-and-mortar business with\nthe convenience and additional benefits of online shopping and services and, meanwhile, enhance Member experience and\nengagement.\n28\nTable of Contents\nFactors Affecting the Business\nOverall economic trends, foreign currency exchange volatility, and other factors impacting the business\nOur sales and profits vary from market to market depending on general economic factors, including GDP growth;\nconsumer preferences; foreign currency exchange rates; political and social conditions; local demographic characteristics\n(such as population growth); the number of years we have operated in a particular market; and the level of retail and\nwholesale competition in that market. The economies of many of our markets are dependent on foreign trade, tourism, and\nforeign direct investments. Uncertain economic conditions and slowdown in global economic growth and investment may\nimpact the economies in our markets, causing significant declines in GDP and employment and devaluations of local\ncurrencies against the U.S. dollar.\nAlthough we have seen recent inflationary pressures subsiding, substantial product cost increases and commodity\nprice increases have and could continue to impact our financial results and could lead to reduced sales, fewer units sold,\nand/or margin pressure. Events directly or indirectly related to COVID-19 resulted in market and supply-chain disruptions,\nwhich increased the complexity of managing our inventory flow and business and resulted in substantial inventory\nmarkdowns on certain non-food product categories in the third quarter of fiscal year 2022. In addition, shipping and freight\nrates increased dramatically during that time. While supply chains and transportation rates have normalized, we continue to\nwork to hold down and/or mitigate the price increases passed on to our Members while maintaining the right inventory mix\nto grow sales. One key factor has been our expanded network of distribution centers, which has facilitated alternative\nshipping routes, increased merchandise throughput, and provided flexibility to mitigate our supply chain challenges and\nrisks more effectively.\nCurrency fluctuation can be one of the largest variables affecting our overall sales and profit performance because\nmany of our markets are susceptible to foreign currency exchange rate volatility. For fiscal year 2024, some markets,\nespecially Costa Rica, benefited from currency appreciation, which helped offset currency devaluations we experienced in\nsome of the other countries. During fiscal year 2024, approximately 79.5% of our net merchandise sales were in currencies\nother than the U.S. dollar. Of those sales, 49.0% consisted of sales of products we purchased in U.S. dollars.\nA devaluation of local currency reduces the value of sales and membership income that is generated in that\ncountry when translated to U.S. dollars for our consolidated results. In addition, when local currency experiences\ndevaluation, we may elect to increase the local currency price of imported merchandise to maintain our target margins,\nwhich could impact demand for the merchandise affected by the price increase. However, during fiscal year 2023, the\ncurrency in Colombia devalued approximately 15%, but we held pricing steady or took pricing actions to mitigate declines\nin demand that negatively impacted our consolidated Total Gross Margin rate. We may also modify the mix of imported\nversus local merchandise and/or the source of imported merchandise to mitigate the impact of currency fluctuations.\nInformation about the effect of local currency devaluations is discussed further in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis\nof Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Net Merchandise Sales and Comparable Sales.”\nOur wallet-share capture of total retail and wholesale sales can vary from market to market due to competition and\nthe availability of other shopping options for our Members. Demographic characteristics within each of our markets can\naffect both the overall level of sales and future sales growth opportunities. Certain island markets, such as Aruba, Barbados\nand the U.S. Virgin Islands, offer limited upside for sales growth given their overall market size.\nWe continue to face the risk of political instability which may have significant effects on our business. For\nexample, protestors set up roadblocks in Panama during October and November 2023 as a reaction to an agreement\nbetween the Panamanian government and a mining company, disrupting traffic to our clubs throughout most of the market.\nRoadblocks in Guatemala in October 2023 relating to election protests also limited access to certain of our warehouse\nclubs. Civil unrest in Colombia in response to tax reform and austerity measures paralyzed significant portions of the\ncountry’s infrastructure as roadblocks and riots disrupted normal economic activity during the third quarter of fiscal year\n2021.\nOur operations are subject to volatile weather conditions and natural disasters. In November 2020, Hurricanes Eta\nand Iota brought severe rainfall, winds, and flooding to a significant portion of Central America, especially Honduras,\nwhich caused significant damage to parts of that country’s infrastructure. Although our warehouse clubs were not\nsignificantly affected and we were able to manage our supply chain to keep our warehouse clubs stocked with merchandise,\nsimilar natural disasters could adversely impact our overall sales, costs and profit performance in the future.\n29\nTable of Contents\nOur operations depend on shipping, trucking, ports and other elements of the supply chain that often rely on\nunionized labor. A work stoppage or other limitation on operations from union or other labor-related matters could occur\nfor any number of reasons, including as a result of disputes under existing collective bargaining agreements with labor\nunions or in connection with negotiation of new collective bargaining agreements. For example, while it did not impact our\nexport activities, we experienced a brief disruption to the flow of imported merchandise into our Miami distribution center\noperations because of the U.S. dockworkers strike in October 2024.\nChanges in tax laws, increases in the enacted tax rates, adverse outcomes in connection with tax audits in any\njurisdiction, or any change in the pronouncements relating to accounting for income taxes could have a material adverse\neffect on our financial condition and results of operations. In one of the countries where we operate, the government made\nchanges several years ago in the method of computing minimum tax payments, under which the government sought to\nrequire retailers to pay taxes based on a percentage of sales if the resulting tax were greater than the tax payable based on a\npercentage of income (Alternative Minimum Tax or \"AMT\"). We, together with our tax and legal advisers, appealed these\ninterpretations and litigated our cases in the country’s court system. Nevertheless, in fiscal year 2023, we recorded a\n$7.2 million charge to settle the minimum tax payment dispute. To address the inherent risk of operating in a country in\nwhich tax legislation changes can significantly impact our low margin business model and in which our ability to\nsuccessfully appeal the application of these taxes is limited, we have increased prices in this market to offset or partially\noffset the rise in costs to comply with the annual AMT payment. These and other challenges may persist or become more\nacute and could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nFrom time to time, we have experienced a lack of availability of U.S. dollars in certain markets (U.S. dollar\nilliquidity). This impedes our ability to convert local currencies obtained through merchandise sales into U.S. dollars to\nsettle the U.S. dollar liabilities associated with our imported products or otherwise fund our operations. This illiquidity also\nincreases our foreign exchange exposure to any devaluation of the local currency relative to the U.S. dollar. Additionally,\nthe Company may incur significant premium costs to convert our local currencies into available tradable currencies and\nU.S. dollars. For instance, since fiscal year 2017, we have experienced this situation in Trinidad and have been unable to\nsource a sufficient level of tradable currencies. We are working with our banks in Trinidad and government officials to\nconvert all of our Trinidad dollars into tradable currencies. For instance, during fiscal year 2021, we experienced\nsignificant limitations on our ability to convert Trinidad dollars to U.S. dollars or other tradable currencies. Our balance as\nof August 31, 2024 of Trinidad dollar denominated cash and cash equivalents and short and long-term investments\nmeasured in U.S. dollars was $60.2 million, a decrease of $40.3 million from the peak of $100.5 million as of November\n30, 2020. However, as the Trinidad central bank strictly manages the exchange rate of the Trinidad dollar with the U.S.\ndollar and affects the level of U.S. Dollar liquidity in the market through its interventions, we are subject to continued\nchallenges in converting our Trinidad dollars to U.S. dollars, as well as being exposed to the risk of a potential devaluation\nof the currency.\nAdditionally, during fiscal year 2023, the Honduran Central Bank began limiting the availability and controlling\nthe allocation of U.S. dollars for the conversion from Honduran lempiras to U.S. dollars. As of August 31, 2024, our\nHonduran subsidiary had approximately $22.3 million of cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments\ndenominated in lempiras, which cannot be readily converted to U.S. dollars for general use within the Company. We are\nactively working with our banking partners and government authorities to address this situation.\nAt times we face difficulties in the shipment of, and the risks inherent in the importation of, merchandise to our\nwarehouse clubs. One of those difficulties is possible governmental restrictions on the importation of merchandise. In late\nMay 2023, disputes with Nicaraguan customs and tax authorities resulted in delays in the issuance of our importation\nclearance, and general delays in the customs inspection process. While this situation has occurred frequently in the last few\nyears, we generally have been able to plan around these import blockages and resume within a manner of days. However,\nthe most recent delay in obtaining importation clearance, resulted in us being unable to import merchandise into Nicaragua\nfor several weeks in June of 2023. While at this time our tax clearances and imports seem to have returned to a more\nnormal cadence, we continue to monitor this situation closely and are working with local officials to seek continuity of\nimports into Nicaragua as well as the other jurisdictions in which we operate.\nFinancial highlights for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2024 included:\n• Total revenues increased 9.6% over the prior year period.\n• Net merchandise sales increased 9.5% over the prior year period. We ended the quarter with 54 warehouse\nclubs compared to 51 warehouse clubs at the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2023. Net merchandise\nsales - constant currency increased 9.3% over the prior year period.\n30\nTable of Contents\n• Comparable net merchandise sales (that is, sales in the 51 warehouse clubs that have been open for greater\nthan 13 ½ calendar months) for the 13 weeks ended September 1, 2024 increased 6.2%. Comparable net\nmerchandise sales - constant currency for the 13 weeks ended September 1, 2024 increased 6.0%.\n• Membership income for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2024 increased 14.1% to $19.7 million over the\ncomparable prior year period.\n• Total gross margins (net merchandise sales less associated cost of goods sold) increased 10.3% over the prior-\nyear period, and merchandise gross profits as a percent of net merchandise sales were 15.7%, an increase of\n10 basis points or 0.1% from the same period in the prior year.\n• Selling, general and administrative expenses increased $3.4 million or 2.2% compared to the fourth quarter of\nfiscal year 2023, primarily due to higher compensation costs, professional fees, depreciation expense and\nbank fees which were partially offset by costs associated with the reserve for the AMT settlement and asset\nimpairment and closure costs which occurred during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2023.\n• Operating income for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2024 was $49.2 million, an increase of 53.1%, or $17.1\nmillion, compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2023.\n• We recorded a $7.4 million net loss in total other expense, net in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2024\ncompared to a $1.5 million net loss in total other expense, net in the same period last year primarily due to an\nincrease in other expense of $4.2 million, primarily driven by an increase in total foreign currency transaction\nlosses and a decrease of $1.2 million in interest income.\n• Our effective tax rate decreased in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2024 to 30.4% from 49.9% in the fourth\nquarter of fiscal year 2023. The decrease in the effective rate versus the prior year was primarily attributable\nto the non-recurrence of the comparably unfavorable impacts in the prior year of 11.6% due to the AMT\nsettlement and 5.4% from asset impairment and related closure costs.\n• Net income for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2024 was $29.1 million, or $0.94 per diluted share, compared\nto $15.4 million, or $0.49 per diluted share, for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2023. The fourth quarter of\nfiscal year 2023 included a negative impact of $0.30 per diluted share for costs related to the reserve for the\nAMT settlement and $0.18 per diluted share of asset impairment and closure costs.\n• Adjusted net income for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2024 was $29.1 million, or an adjusted $0.94 per\ndiluted share, compared to adjusted net income of $20.4 million, or $0.65 per diluted share, for the fourth\nquarter of fiscal year 2023. The fourth quarter of fiscal year 2023 included a negative impact of $0.30 per\ndiluted share for costs related to the reserve for the AMT settlement.\n• Adjusted EBITDA for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2024 was $70.7 million compared to $57.2 million in\nthe same period last year.\nFinancial highlights for fiscal year 2024 included:\n• Total revenues increased 11.4% over the prior year period.\n• Net merchandise sales increased 11.2% over the prior year period. We ended the year with 54 warehouse clubs\ncompared to 51 warehouse clubs at the end of fiscal year 2023. Net merchandise sales - constant currency\nincreased 8.6% over the prior year period.\n• Comparable net merchandise sales (that is, sales in the 51 warehouse clubs that have been open for greater than 13\n½ calendar months) for the 52 weeks ended September 1, 2024 increased 7.7%. Comparable net merchandise sales\n- constant currency for the 52 weeks ended September 1, 2024 increased 5.2%.\n• Membership income increased 13.9% to $75.2 million.\n• Total gross margins (net merchandise sales less associated cost of goods sold) increased 11.1% over the prior\nyear, and merchandise gross profits as a percent of net merchandise sales remained constant at 15.8% compared to\nthe prior year.\n• Selling, general and administrative expenses increased $51.2 million in fiscal year 2024 or 8.9% compared to\nfiscal year 2023, primarily due to higher compensation cost, professional fees, depreciation expense, and bank\nfees.\n• Operating income was $220.9 million in fiscal year 2024, an increase of 19.7%, or $36.4 million, compared to\nfiscal year 2023.\n• We recorded a $19.5 million net loss in total other expense, net in fiscal year 2024 compared to a $15.3 million\nnet loss in total other expense, net in the same period last year primarily due to an increase of $3.5 million of other\nexpense, which is primarily foreign currency transaction losses, and an increase of $1.9 million in interest\nexpense, partially offset by an increase of $1.2 million in interest income.\n31\nTable of Contents\n• The effective tax rate for fiscal year 2024 was 31.1% as compared to the effective tax rate for fiscal year 2023 of\n35.4%. The decrease is primarily driven by the non-recurrence of the comparably unfavorable impact in the prior\nyear of write-offs of VAT receivables, Aeropost write-offs and asset impairment and related closure costs of\n2.2%, and a 1.8% unfavorable impact due to the AMT settlement.\n• Net income for fiscal year 2024 was $138.9 million, or $4.57 per diluted share, compared to $109.2 million, or\n$3.50 per diluted share, for fiscal year 2023. Fiscal year 2023 included a negative impact of $0.30 per diluted\nshare for costs related to the reserve for the AMT settlement and $0.18 per diluted share of asset impairment and\nclosure costs.\n• Adjusted net income for fiscal year 2024 was $138.9 million, or an adjusted $4.57 per diluted share, compared to\nadjusted net income of $126.5 million, or an adjusted $4.06 per diluted share, for fiscal year 2023. Fiscal year\n2023 included a negative impact of $0.30 per diluted share for costs related to the reserve for the AMT settlement.\n• Adjusted EBITDA for fiscal year 2024 was $303.6 million compared to $275.7 million in the prior year.\nNon - GAAP (Generally Accepted Accounting Principles) Financial Measures\nThe accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements, including the related notes, are presented in accordance\nwith U.S. GAAP (Generally Accepted Accounting Principles). In addition to relevant GAAP measures, we also provide\nnon-GAAP measures including adjusted net income, adjusted net income per diluted share, adjusted EBITDA, net\nmerchandise sales - constant currency and comparable net merchandise sales - constant currency because management\nbelieves these metrics are useful to investors and analysts by excluding items that we do not believe are indicative of our\ncore operating performance. These measures are customary for our industry and commonly used by competitors. However,\nthese non-GAAP financial measures should not be reviewed in isolation or considered as an alternative to any other\nperformance measure derived in accordance with GAAP and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by\nother companies in our industry or across different industries.\n32\nTable of Contents\nAdjusted Net Income and Adjusted Net Income per Diluted Share\nAdjusted net income and adjusted net income per diluted share metrics are important measures used by\nmanagement to compare the performance of our core operations results between periods. We define adjusted net income as\nnet income, as reported, adjusted for: separation costs associated with the departure of our former Chief Executive Officer,\nthe write-off of certain Aeropost receivables, the write-off of certain VAT receivables following unfavorable court rulings,\nasset impairment on our assets held for sale and closure costs, the gain on the acquisition of a building, and the tax impact\nof the foregoing adjustments on net income. We define adjusted net income per diluted share as adjusted net income\ndivided by the weighted-average diluted shares outstanding.\nWe believe adjusted net income and adjusted net income per diluted share are useful metrics to investors and\nanalysts because they present more accurate year-over-year comparisons for our net income and net income per diluted\nshare because adjusted items are not the result of our normal operations. We note that no adjustments to net income or net\nincome per diluted share have been made for the three-month and twelve-month periods ended August 31, 2024.\nThree Months Ended Years Ended\nAugust 31, August 31, August 31, August 31,\n(Amounts in thousands, except per share data) 2024 2023 2024 2023\nNet income as reported $ 29,068 $ 15,381 $ 138,875 $ 109,205\nAdjustments:\nSeparation costs associated with Chief Executive Officer\ndeparture (1) — — — 7,747\nAeropost-related write-offs (2) — — — 2,786\nVAT receivable write-off (3) — — — 2,309\nAsset impairment and closure costs (4) — 5,658 — 5,658\nGain on acquisition of building (5) — (948) — (948)\nTax impact of adjustments to net income (6) — 266 — (284)\nAdjusted net income $ 29,068 $ 20,357 $ 138,875 $ 126,473\nNet income per diluted share $ 0.94 $ 0.49 $ 4.57 $ 3.50\nSeparation costs associated with Chief Executive Officer\ndeparture — — — 0.23\nAeropost-related write-offs — — — 0.09\nVAT receivable write-off — — — 0.08\nAsset impairment and closure costs — 0.18 — 0.18\nGain on acquisition of building — (0.02) — (0.02)\nAdjusted net income per diluted share $ 0.94 $ 0.65 $ 4.57 $ 4.06\n(1) Reflects $7.7 million of separation costs associated with the departure of our former Chief Executive Officer in February 2023.\n(2) Reflects $2.1 million of Aeropost-related write-offs in the first quarter of fiscal year 2023 and $660,000 of a receivable written-off in\nconnection with the settlement in the third quarter of fiscal year 2023 of a claim for indemnification from the buyer of the Aeropost\nbusiness.\n(3) Reflects $2.3 million of VAT receivables deemed not recoverable and written-off in the third quarter of fiscal year 2023 following\nunfavorable court rulings.\n(4) Reflects $5.7 million of impairment charges primarily related to the write down of assets in connection with our decision in the\nfourth quarter of fiscal year 2023 to seek to sell our Trinidad sustainable packaging plant.\n(5) Reflects a $950,000 gain related to a building we acquired upon the early termination of a lease in which we were the lessor of the\nland on which the building was constructed by and abandoned by one of our tenants.\n(6) Reflects the tax effect of the above-mentioned adjustments.\n33\nTable of Contents\nAdjusted EBITDA\nAdjusted EBITDA is defined as net income before interest expense, net, provision for income taxes and\ndepreciation and amortization, adjusted for the impact of certain other items, including interest income; other income\n(expense), net; separation costs associated with Chief Executive Officer departure; asset impairment and closure costs;\nAeropost write-offs; and the write-off of certain VAT receivables following unfavorable court rulings.

The translation of the\noperations of our foreign-based entities from their local currencies into U.S. dollars is sensitive to changes in foreign\ncurrency exchange rates and can have a significant impact on our reported financial results. We believe that constant\ncurrency is a useful measure, indicating the actual growth of our operations. When we use the term \"net merchandise sales\n- constant currency,\" it means that we have translated current year net merchandise sales at prior year monthly average\nexchanges rates. Net merchandise sales - constant currency results exclude the effects of foreign currency translation.\nSimilarly, when we use the term \"comparable net merchandise sales - constant currency,\" it means that we have translated\ncurrent year comparable net merchandise sales at prior year monthly average exchange rates. Comparable net merchandise\nsales – constant currency results exclude the effects of foreign currency translation. Refer to “Management’s Discussion &\nAnalysis – Net Merchandise Sales” and Refer to “Management’s Discussion & Analysis – Comparable Net Merchandise\nSales” for our quantitative analysis and discussion. Reconciliations between net merchandise sales - constant currency and\ncomparable net merchandise sales - constant currency and the most directly comparable GAAP measures are included\nwhere applicable.\n34\nTable of Contents\nComparison of Fiscal Year 2024 to 2023\nThe following discussion and analysis compares the results of operations for the fiscal years ended August 31,\n2024 and 2023 and should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes\nincluded elsewhere in this report. For a comparison of the fiscal years ended August 31, 2023 and 2022, please see Part II.\n“Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition” in the Company’s\nAnnual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2023 filed with the SEC on October 30, 2023. Unless\notherwise noted, all tables present U.S. dollar amounts in thousands. Certain percentages presented are calculated using\nactual results prior to rounding. Our operations consist of four reportable segments: Central America, the Caribbean,\nColombia and the United States. The Company’s reportable segments are based on management’s organization of these\nlocations into operating segments by general geographic location, which are used by management and the Company's chief\noperating decision maker in setting up management lines of responsibility, providing support services, and making\noperational decisions and assessments of financial performance. Segment amounts are presented after converting to U.S.\ndollars and consolidating eliminations. From time to time, we revise the measurement of each segment's operating income,\nincluding certain corporate overhead allocations, and other measures as determined by the information regularly reviewed\nby our chief operating decision maker. When we do so, the previous period amounts and balances are reclassified to\nconform to the current period's presentation.\nNet Merchandise Sales\nThe following tables indicate the net merchandise sales in the reportable segments in which we operate and the\npercentage growth in net merchandise sales by segment during fiscal years 2024 and 2023:\nYears Ended\nAugust 31, 2024 August 31, 2023\nIncrease\n% of net from prior % of net\nAmount ͏sales year Change Amount ͏sales\nCentral America $ 2,908,443 60.8 % $ 288,441 11.0 % $ 2,620,002 60.9 %\nCaribbean 1,331,357 27.8 80,657 6.4 1,250,700 29.1\nColombia 543,319 11.4 113,315 26.4 430,004 10.0\nNet merchandise sales $ 4,783,119 100.0 % $ 482,413 11.2 % $ 4,300,706 100.0 %\nOverall, net merchandise sales grew by 11.2% for fiscal year 2024 compared to fiscal year 2023, driven by an\n8.6% increase in transactions and a 2.4% increase in average ticket. Transactions represent the total number of visits our\nMembers make to our warehouse clubs resulting in a sale and the total number of PriceSmart.com curbside pickup and\ndelivery service transactions. Average ticket represents the amount our Members spend on each visit or PriceSmart.com\norder. We had 54 clubs in operation as of August 31, 2024 compared to 51 clubs as of August 31, 2023.\nNet merchandise sales in our Central America segment increased 11.0% during fiscal year 2024. This increase had\na 670 basis point (6.7%) positive impact on total net merchandise sales growth. All markets within this segment had\npositive net merchandise sales growth for the twelve-month period ended August 31, 2024. We opened our third and fourth\nwarehouse clubs in El Salvador in May 2023 and February 2024, respectively. We also opened our sixth warehouse club in\nGuatemala in November 2023.\nNet merchandise sales in our Caribbean segment increased 6.4% during fiscal year 2024. This increase had a 190\nbasis point (1.9%) positive impact on total net merchandise sales growth. All of our markets in this segment had positive\nnet merchandise sales growth.\nNet merchandise sales in our Colombia segment increased 26.4% during fiscal year 2024. This increase had a 260\nbasis point (2.6%) positive impact on total net merchandise sales growth. The primary driver of the increased sales for the\ntwelve-month period ended August 31, 2024 was due to the significant appreciation of the Colombian peso for much of the\nyear, which has positively impacted reported sales when compared to the comparable prior year period. We added one new\nclub to the segment when compared to the prior year. We opened our tenth warehouse club in Colombia in September\n2023.\n35\nTable of Contents\nThe following table indicates the impact that currency exchange rates had on our net merchandise sales in dollars\nand the percentage change from the twelve-month period ended August 31, 2024. When we use the term \"net merchandise\nsales - constant currency,\" it means that we have translated current year net merchandise sales at prior year monthly\naverage exchanges rates. Net merchandise sales - constant currency results exclude the effects of foreign currency\ntranslation. Impact of foreign currency is the effect of currency fluctuations on our net merchandise sales.\nYear Ended\nAugust 31, 2024\nNet\nNet Net Merchandise\nMerchandise Impact of Merchandise Sales - % Impact of\nNet Sales - Foreign Sales Constant Foreign\nMerchandise Constant Currency Growth/ Currency Currency\nSales Currency Exchange (Decline) Growth Exchange\nCentral America $ 2,908,443 $ 2,830,078 $ 78,365 11.0 % 8.0 % 3.0 %\nCaribbean 1,331,357 1,360,813 (29,456) 6.4 8.8 (2.4)\nColombia 543,319 478,107 65,212 26.4 11.2 15.2\nConsolidated total $ 4,783,119 $ 4,668,998 $ 114,121 11.2 % 8.6 % 2.6 %\nOverall, the effects of currency fluctuations within our markets had an approximately $114.1 million, or 260 basis\npoint (2.6%), positive impact on net merchandise sales for the twelve-months ended August 31, 2024.\nCurrency fluctuations had a $78.4 million, or 300 basis point (3.0%), positive impact on net merchandise sales in\nour Central America segment for the twelve months ended August 31, 2024. These currency fluctuations contributed\napproximately 180 basis points (1.8%) of positive impact on total net merchandise sales for fiscal year 2024. The Costa\nRica colón appreciated significantly against the dollar when compared to the prior year, and was a significant factor in the\ncontribution to the favorable currency fluctuations in this segment.\nCurrency fluctuations had a $29.5 million, or 240 basis point (2.4%), negative impact on net merchandise sales in\nour Caribbean segment for the twelve months ended August 31, 2024. These currency fluctuations contributed\napproximately 70 basis points (0.7%) of negative impact on total net merchandise sales growth for the current fiscal year\nperiod. This negative impact was primarily driven by the devaluation of the Dominican Peso as compared to the prior year.\nCurrency fluctuations had a $65.2 million, or 1,520 basis point (15.2%), positive impact on net merchandise sales\nin our Colombia segment for the twelve months ended August 31, 2024. These currency fluctuations contributed\napproximately 150 basis points (1.5%) of positive impact on total net merchandise sales for the current fiscal year period.\nNet Merchandise Sales by Category\nThe following table indicates the approximate percentage of net sales accounted for by each major category of\nitems sold during the fiscal years ended August 31, 2024 and 2023:\nYears Ended August 31,\n2024 2023\nFoods & Sundries 49 % 50 %\nFresh Foods 30 29\nHardlines 11 11\nSoftlines 5 5\nFood Service and Bakery 4 4\nHealth Services 1 1\nNet Merchandise Sales 100 % 100 %\nThe mix of sales by major category changed slightly. Foods & Sundries increased approximately 8% between\nfiscal year 2024 and 2023 but decreased by 1% as a percent of Net Merchandise Sales. Fresh Foods increased\napproximately 12% between fiscal year 2024 and 2023 and increased by 1% as a percent of Net Merchandise Sales. Shifts\nin consumer preferences contributed to the changes in category mix.\n36\nTable of Contents\nComparable Net Merchandise Sales\nWe report comparable net merchandise sales on a “same week” basis with 13 weeks in each quarter beginning on\na Monday and ending on a Sunday. The periods are established at the beginning of the fiscal year to provide as close a\nmatch as possible to the calendar month and quarter that is used for financial reporting purposes. This approach equalizes\nthe number of weekend days and weekdays in each period for improved sales comparison, as we experience higher\nmerchandise club sales on the weekends. Further, each of the warehouse clubs used in the calculations was open for at least\n13 ½ calendar months before its results for the current period were compared with its results for the prior period. As a\nresult, sales related to three of our clubs opened during fiscal year 2024 will not be used in the calculation of comparable\nsales until they have been open for at least 13 ½ months. Therefore, comparable net merchandise sales includes 51\nwarehouse clubs for the 52-week period ended September 1, 2024.\nThe following table indicates the comparable net merchandise sales in the reportable segments in which we\noperate and the percentage changes in net merchandise sales by segment during the 52-week periods ended September 1,\n2024 and September 3, 2023 compared to the prior year:\n52 Weeks Ended\nSeptember 1, 2024 September 3, 2023\n% Increase % Increase/(Decrease)\nin Comparable in Comparable\nNet Merchandise Sales Net Merchandise Sales\nCentral America 7.7 % 10.9 %\nCaribbean 6.0 5.9\nColombia 12.9 (9.2)\nConsolidated comparable net merchandise sales 7.7 % 7.1 %\nComparable net merchandise sales for those warehouse clubs that were open for at least 13 ½ months for some or\nall of the 52-week period ended September 1, 2024 increased 7.7%.\nComparable net merchandise sales in our Central America segment increased 7.7% for the 52-week period ended\nSeptember 1, 2024. With the exception of El Salvador, all of our markets in Central America had positive comparable net\nmerchandise sales growth. We opened one new club in El Salvador in February 2024 that has not entered into the\ncalculation of comparable net merchandise sales, and the transfer of sales from the existing clubs included in the\ncomparable net merchandise sales calculation to the new club not yet included adversely affected comparable net\nmerchandise sales in El Salvador. The positive comparable net merchandise sales growth for our Central America segment\ncontributed approximately 460 basis points (4.6%) of positive impact in total comparable merchandise sales.\nFor the 52 weeks ended September 1, 2024, strong performance in our largest market, Costa Rica, contributed\napproximately 250 basis points (2.5%) of positive impact to total comparable net merchandise sales. During the year, Costa\nRica experienced significant appreciation of the Costa Rica colón versus the comparable prior year period, which positively\naffected comparable net merchandise sales. The relatively smaller markets of Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua, and El\nSalvador, along with our second largest market, Panama, contributed approximately 210 basis points (2.1%) of positive\nimpact on total comparable net merchandise sales.\nComparable net merchandise sales in our Caribbean segment increased 6.0% for the 52-week period ended\nSeptember 1, 2024. This increase contributed approximately 180 basis points (1.8%) of positive impact in total comparable\nnet merchandise sales. Our Jamaica market continued its strong performance in the 52-week period, with 12.2%\ncomparable net merchandise sales growth.\nComparable net merchandise sales in our Colombia segment increased 12.9% for the 52-week period ended\nSeptember 1, 2024. This increase contributed approximately 130 basis points (1.3%) of positive impact to the increase in\ntotal comparable net merchandise sales. The current year increase is primarily due to the appreciation of the Colombian\npeso for most of the year.\n37\nTable of Contents\nWhen we use the term \"comparable net merchandise sales - constant currency,\" it means that we have translated\ncurrent year comparable net merchandise sales at prior year monthly average exchanges rates. Comparable net merchandise\nsales - constant currency results exclude the effects of foreign currency translation. The following tables illustrate the\ncomparable net merchandise sales - constant currency percentage growth and the impact that changes in foreign currency\nexchange rates had on our comparable merchandise sales percentage growth for the 52-week period ended September 1,\n2024:\nFifty-Two Weeks Ended\nSeptember 1, 2024\nComparable Net\nMerchandise Sales\nComparable Net - Constant % Impact of\nMerchandise Sales Currency Growth/ Foreign Currency\nGrowth (Decline) Exchange\nCentral America 7.7 % 4.7 % 3.0 %\nCaribbean 6.0 8.4 (2.4)\nColombia 12.9 (0.8) 13.7\nConsolidated comparable net merchandise sales 7.7 % 5.2 % 2.5 %\nOverall, the mix of currency fluctuations within our markets had 250 basis points (2.5%) of positive impact on\ncomparable net merchandise sales for the 52-week period ended September 1, 2024.\nCurrency fluctuations within our Central America segment accounted for approximately 180 basis points (1.8%)\nof positive impact on total comparable merchandise sales for the 52-week period ended September 1, 2024. Our Costa Rica\nmarket was the main contributor as the market experienced currency appreciation when compared to the same period last\nyear.\nCurrency fluctuations within our Caribbean segment accounted for approximately 70 basis points (0.7%) of\nnegative impact on total comparable merchandise sales for the 52-week period ended September 1, 2024. Our Jamaica and\nDominican Republic markets experienced currency devaluation when compared to the same period last year.\nCurrency fluctuations within our Colombia segment accounted for approximately 140 basis points (1.4%) of\npositive impact on total comparable net merchandise sales for the 52-week period ended September 1, 2024. This reflects\nthe appreciation of the Colombia peso's foreign currency exchange rate when compared to the same period last year.\n38\nTable of Contents\nMembership Income\nMembership income is recognized ratably over the one-year life of the membership.\nYears Ended\nAugust 31, August 31,\n2024 2023\nMembership\n% of Increase Income % to % of\nTotal from Net Total\nOperating prior % Merchandise Operating\nAmount Income year Change Sales Amount Income\nMembership income -\nCentral America $ 43,434 $ 3,727 9.4 % 1.5 % $ 39,707\nMembership income -\nCaribbean 19,678 2,043 11.6 1.5 17,635\nMembership income -\nColombia 12,128 3,422 39.3 2.2 8,706\nMembership income - Total $ 75,240 34.1 % $ 9,192 13.9 % 1.6 % $ 66,048 35.8 %\nNumber of accounts -\nCentral America 1,059,079 53,470 5.3 % 1,005,609\nNumber of accounts -\nCaribbean 482,914 15,253 3.3 467,661\nNumber of accounts -\nColombia 351,167 16,822 5.0 334,345\nNumber of accounts - Total 1,893,160 85,545 4.7 % 1,807,615\nThe number of Member accounts at the end of fiscal year 2024 was 4.7% higher than the prior year. Membership\nincome increased 13.9% compared to the prior year.\nMembership income increased in all of our segments in the twelve months ended August 31, 2024. The\nconsolidated increase in membership income is primarily due to the $5 increase to our membership fee in all but one\nmarket during fiscal year 2024 and an increase in the membership base since the prior year. In our Central America\nsegment, membership income increased compared to fiscal year 2023, attributable to the opening of two new clubs.\nSimilarly, in the Caribbean segment, membership income rose compared to fiscal year 2023, primarily attributable to the\n$5 increase to our membership fee. In the Colombia segment, membership income increased compared to fiscal year 2023\ndue to the appreciation of the Colombian peso against the U.S. dollar and the opening of a new club. Additionally, all of\nour segments have increased their membership base since August 31, 2023.\nWe offer the Platinum Membership program in all locations where PriceSmart operates. The annual fee for a\nPlatinum Membership in most markets is approximately $75 to $80, depending on the market in which the Member lives.\nThe Platinum Membership program provides Members with a 2% rebate on most items, up to an annual maximum of $500.\nWe record the 2% rebate as a reduction of net merchandise sales at the time of the sales transaction. Platinum Membership\naccounts are 12.3% of our total membership base as of August 31, 2024, an increase from 8.9% as of August 31, 2023.\nPlatinum Members tend to have higher renewal rates than our Diamond Members. During fiscal year 2024, we ran\nplatinum promotional campaigns, resulting in an increase in the total number of Platinum Members.\nOur trailing twelve-month renewal rate was 87.9% and 86.9% for the fiscal years ended August 31, 2024 and\nAugust 31, 2023, respectively.\n39\nTable of Contents\nOther Revenue\nOther revenue primarily consists of our interest-generating portfolio from our co-branded credit cards and rental\nincome from operating leases where the Company is the lessor.\nYears Ended\nAugust 31,\nAugust 31, 2024 2023\nIncrease from\nAmount prior year % Change Amount\nMiscellaneous income $ 13,684 $ 2,511 22.5 % $ 11,173\nRental income 2,417 243 11.2 2,174\nOther revenue $ 16,101 $ 2,754 20.6 % $ 13,347\nComparison of Fiscal Year 2024 to 2023\nThe primary driver of the increase in other revenue for the year ended August 31, 2024 was an increase in\nMiscellaneous income driven primarily by an increase in incentive fee revenue due to Members having higher average\noutstanding balances on our co-branded credit cards compared to the prior year.\n40\nTable of Contents\nResults of Operations\nYears Ended\nAugust 31, August 31,\nResults of Operations Consolidated 2024 2023\n(Amounts in thousands, except percentages and number of warehouse clubs)\nNet merchandise sales\nNet merchandise sales $ 4,783,119 $ 4,300,706\nTotal gross margin $ 753,629 $ 678,352\nTotal gross margin percentage 15.8 % 15.8 %\nRevenues\nTotal revenues $ 4,913,898 $ 4,411,842\nPercentage change from prior period 11.4 % 8.5 %\nComparable net merchandise sales\nTotal comparable net merchandise sales increase 7.7% 7.1%\nTotal revenue margin\nTotal revenue margin $ 846,924 $ 759,331\nTotal revenue margin percentage 17.2 % 17.2 %\nSelling, general and administrative\nSelling, general and administrative $ 625,980 $ 574,815\nSelling, general and administrative percentage of total revenues 12.7 % 13.0 %\nOperational data\nWarehouse clubs at period end 54 51\nWarehouse club sales floor square feet at period end 2,646 2,524\nYears Ended\n% of % of\nAugust 31, Total August 31, Total\nResults of Operations Consolidated 2024 Revenue 2023 Revenue\nOperating income by segment\nCentral America $ 227,986 4.6 % $ 191,721 4.3 %\nCaribbean 95,642 1.9 87,223 2.0\nColombia 15,231 0.3 15,467 0.4\nUnited States 24,868 0.5 29,844 0.7\nReconciling Items (1) (142,783) (2.8) (139,739) (3.2)\nOperating income - Total $ 220,944 4.5 % $ 184,516 4.2 %\n(1) The reconciling items reflect the amount eliminated upon consolidation of intersegment transactions.\n41\nTable of Contents\nThe following table summarizes the selling, general and administrative expense for the periods disclosed:\nYears Ended\n% of % of\nAugust 31, Total August 31, Total\n2024 Revenue 2023 Revenue\nWarehouse club and other operations $ 466,457 9.5 % $ 417,272 9.4 %\nGeneral and administrative 156,385 3.2 134,783 3.1\nReserve for AMT settlement — — 7,179 0.2\nSeparation costs associated with Chief Executive\nOfficer departure — — 7,747 0.2\nPre-opening expenses 970 — 1,432 —\nAsset impairment and closure costs — — 5,658 0.1\nLoss on disposal of assets 2,168 — 744 —\nTotal Selling, general and administrative $ 625,980 12.7 % $ 574,815 13.0 %\nTotal gross margin is derived from our Revenue – Net merchandise sales less our Cost of goods sold – Net\nmerchandise sales and represents our sales and cost of sales generated from the business activities of our warehouse clubs.\nWe express our Total gross margin percentage as a percentage of our Net merchandise sales.\nOn a consolidated basis, total gross margin as a percent of net merchandise sales for the twelve months ended\nAugust 31, 2024 was 15.8%, unchanged from the prior year.\nTotal revenue margin is derived from Total revenues, which includes our Net merchandise sales, Membership\nincome, Export sales, and Other revenue and income less our Cost of goods sold for Net merchandise sales, Export sales,\nand Non-merchandise revenues. We express our Total revenue margin as a percentage of Total revenues.\nTotal revenue margin remained unchanged at 17.2% for the twelve months ended August 31, 2024 compared to\nthe prior year.\nSelling, general, and administrative expenses consist of warehouse club and other operations, general and\nadministrative expenses, reserve for settlement of AMT, separation costs associated with the Chief Executive Officer\ndeparture, pre-opening expenses, asset impairment and closure costs, and loss (gain) on disposal of assets. In total, selling,\ngeneral and administrative expenses increased $51.2 million compared to the prior year, and decreased as a percentage of\ntotal revenues 30 basis points (0.3%) to 12.7% of total revenues for fiscal year 2024 compared to 13.0% of total revenues\nfor fiscal year 2023 offset, in part, by our Interim Chief Executive Officer's election not to receive compensation.\nWarehouse club and other operations expenses increased to 9.5% of total revenues for fiscal year 2024 compared\nto 9.4% for fiscal year 2023, primarily due to our Colombia market which increased 20 basis points (0.2%) as a percentage\nof revenue year over year due to the appreciation of the Colombian peso and opening of one new club during the year as\nwell as an increase of 10 basis points (0.1%) each in El Salvador and Guatemala due to the opening of one new club in\neach of these markets. This was partially offset by our Panama, Honduras, and Dominican Republic markets, each of which\ndecreased 10 basis points (0.1%) as a percentage of revenue year over year.\nGeneral and administrative expenses increased to 3.2% of total revenues for the current year compared to 3.1% for\nfiscal year 2023. The 10 basis points (0.1%) increase is primarily due to investments in technology and an increase in\ncompensation expense from stock grants to executive leadership.\nIn fiscal year 2023, we recorded costs for separation and other related termination benefits for our former Chief\nExecutive Officer who resigned effective February 3, 2023. We accrued for the related charges and substantially fulfilled\nall payment obligations in fiscal year 2023; however, some vesting of performance stock units occurred in the first quarter\nof fiscal year 2024. On a go-forward basis, our Interim Chief Executive Officer has declined to receive compensation for\nhis services during his term; therefore, we expect Selling, general and administrative expenses will be positively impacted\nby $2.5 million of savings each quarter during his term, reduced by salary increases for other executives related to the\nchange in leadership.\n42\nTable of Contents\nIn fiscal year 2023, we recorded a $7.2 million charge to settle litigation regarding several AMT cases in one of\nour markets where the application of complex tax laws are subject to interpretation. In that country, we had challenged\nAMT rules requiring us to pay taxes based on a percentage of sales if the percentage of sales method resulted in a higher\namount of tax payable than the amount payable based on taxable income at the statutory rate. Of this amount, $1.0 million\nrelates to our write-off of an income tax receivable we had recorded with respect to taxes we previously paid on the\npercentage of sales basis in one tax year and for which we had sought a refund that we now no longer expect to receive. We\nalso made payments of $6.2 million to resolve amounts due for tax years in which we made tax payments using the original\ncomputation based on taxable income rather than the percentage of sales method. As part of the settlement, going forward\nwe will pay the higher of the minimum tax or the amount based on taxable income at the statutory rate.\nAdditionally, in fiscal year 2023, we recorded $5.7 million of asset impairment and closure costs primarily related\nto the write down of the assets held for sale of our Trinidad sustainable packaging plant to their estimated fair value upon\nour decision to seek to sell the plant. We planned to use the plant to increase efficiencies by eliminating intermediaries in\npackaging and labeling and manufacturing some of our packaging materials using compostable or recyclable inputs.\nHowever, we found that achieving economic feasibility for this business proved challenging. Therefore, we decided to\nrefocus our efforts on our core competencies as a retailer and redeploy the assets we could use in our club business and\nseek a buyer for the remainder.\nOperating income in fiscal year 2024 increased to $220.9 million (4.5% of total revenues) compared to $184.5\nmillion (4.2% of total revenues) for the prior year.\nInterest Income\nInterest income represents the earnings generated from interest-bearing assets held by PriceSmart, Inc. and our\nwholly owned foreign subsidiaries. These assets include investments in fixed income securities and deposits held with\nfinancial institutions. The interest income is derived from the interest payments received on these assets, which serve to\nenhance our overall financial returns.\nYears Ended\nAugust 31, August 31,\n2024 2023\nAmount Change Amount\nInterest income $ 11,049 $ 1,178 $ 9,871\nInterest income increased for the twelve-month period ended August 31, 2024 primarily due to an increase in\ninvestments at higher yields throughout the year when compared to the prior year.\nInterest Expense\nYears Ended\nAugust 31, August 31,\n2024 2023\nAmount Change Amount\nInterest expense on loans $ 11,544 $ (354) $ 11,898\nInterest expense related to hedging activity 2,354 1,149 1,205\nLess: Capitalized interest (939) 1,144 (2,083)\nInterest expense $ 12,959 $ 1,939 $ 11,020\nInterest expense reflects borrowings by PriceSmart, Inc. and our wholly owned foreign subsidiaries to finance new\nland acquisition and construction for new warehouse clubs and distribution centers, warehouse club expansions, the capital\nrequirements of warehouse club and other operations, and ongoing working capital requirements.\nInterest expense increased for the twelve-month period ended August 31, 2024, primarily due to higher interest\nexpense related to hedging activity and less capitalized interest when compared to the prior year.\n43\nTable of Contents\nOther Expense, net\nOther expense, net consists of currency gains or losses, as well as net benefit costs related to our defined benefit\nplans and other items considered to be non-operating in nature.\nYears Ended\nAugust 31, August 31,\n2024 2023\nAmount Change Amount\nOther expense, net $ (17,607) $ (3,451) $ (14,156)\nMonetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the respective\nentity (primarily U.S. dollars) are revalued to the functional currency using the exchange rate on the balance sheet date.\nThese foreign exchange transaction gains/(losses) are recorded as currency gains or losses. Additionally, gains or losses\nfrom transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the respective entity also generate\ncurrency gains or losses.\nFor the twelve months ended August 31, 2024, the primary drivers of Other expense, net were transaction costs\nassociated with increased spreads and converting the local currencies into available tradable currencies before converting\nthem to U.S. dollars in some of our countries with liquidity issues of $13.1 million as well as $4.8 million of losses due to\nrevaluation of monetary assets and liabilities (primarily U.S. dollars) in several of our markets during the twelve months\nended August 31, 2024.\nProvision for Income Taxes\nThe tables below summarize the effective tax rate for the periods reported:\nYears Ended\nAugust 31, August 31,\n2024 2023\nAmount Change Amount\nCurrent tax expense $ 66,701 $ 3,458 $ 63,243\nNet deferred tax benefit (4,083) (791) (3,292)\nProvision for income taxes $ 62,618 $ 2,667 $ 59,951\nEffective tax rate 31.1 % 35.4 %\nFor fiscal year 2024, the effective tax rate was 31.1% compared to 35.4% for fiscal year 2023. The decrease in the\neffective rate versus the prior year was primarily attributable to the non-recurrence of the comparably unfavorable impact\nin the prior year of write-offs of VAT receivables, Aeropost write-offs and asset impairment and related closure costs of\n2.2%, and a 1.8% unfavorable impact due to the AMT settlement.\nFollowing the implementation of certain tax optimization initiatives at the end of fiscal year 2024, we expect a\ndecrease in the effective tax rate by approximately 2-4% in fiscal year 2025.\n44\nTable of Contents\nOther Comprehensive Income (Loss)\nOther comprehensive income (loss) for fiscal years 2024 and 2023 resulted primarily from foreign currency\ntranslation adjustments related to assets and liabilities and the translation of the statements of income related to revenue,\ncosts and expenses of our subsidiaries whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar. When the functional currency in\nour international subsidiaries is the local currency and not U.S. dollars, the assets and liabilities of such subsidiaries are\ntranslated to U.S. dollars at the exchange rate on the balance sheet date, and revenue, costs and expenses are translated at\naverage rates of exchange in effect during the period. The corresponding translation gains and losses are recorded as a\ncomponent of accumulated other comprehensive income or loss. These adjustments will not affect net income until the sale\nor liquidation of the underlying investment. The reported other comprehensive income or loss reflects the unrealized\nincrease or decrease in the value in U.S. dollars of the net assets of the subsidiaries as of the date of the balance sheet,\nwhich will vary from period to period as exchange rates fluctuate.\nYears Ended\nAugust 31, August 31,\n2024 2023\nChange From\nAmount Prior Year % Change Amount\nOther Comprehensive Income (Loss) $ (598) $ (32,192) (101.9) % $ 31,594\nOther comprehensive loss for fiscal year 2024 of approximately $0.6 million was primarily the result of $2.2\nmillion of unrealized losses on the changes of fair value of our derivative obligations partially offset by $0.9 million related\nto unrealized gains on changes in the fair value of accrued pension obligations and the comprehensive gain of $0.7 million\nfrom foreign currency translation adjustments During fiscal year 2024, the largest translation adjustments were related to\nthe appreciation of the local currency against the U.S. dollar of our Costa Rica subsidiary partially offset by the devaluation\nof the local currency against the U.S. dollar for our Dominican Republic subsidiary.\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nFinancial Position and Cash Flow\nOur operations have historically supplied us with a significant source of liquidity. We generate cash from\noperations primarily through net merchandise sales and membership fees. Cash used in operations generally consist of\npayments to our merchandise vendors, warehouse club and distribution center operating costs (including payroll, employee\nbenefits and utilities), as well as payments for income taxes. Our cash flows provided by operating activities, supplemented\nwith our long-term debt and short-term borrowings, have generally been sufficient to fund our operations while allowing us\nto invest in activities that support the long-term growth of our operations. We also have returned cash to stockholders\nthrough a semiannual dividend, a one-time special dividend in the third quarter of fiscal year 2024, and by repurchasing\nshares of our common stock pursuant to the stock repurchase program we commenced in the fourth quarter of fiscal year\n2023 and completed in the first quarter of fiscal year 2024. We evaluate our funding requirements on a regular basis to\ncover any shortfall in our ability to generate sufficient cash from operations to meet our capital requirements. We may\nconsider funding alternatives to provide additional liquidity if necessary. Refer to Part II. “Item 8. Financial Statements and\nSupplementary Data: Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 11 - Debt” for additional information regarding\namounts outstanding on our short-term facilities and our long-term borrowings, and any repayments.\nRepatriation of cash and cash equivalents held by foreign subsidiaries may require us to accrue and pay taxes for\ncertain jurisdictions. If we decide to repatriate cash through the payment of a cash dividend by our foreign subsidiaries to\nour domestic operations, we will accrue taxes if and when appropriate.\nThe following table summarizes the cash and cash equivalents, including restricted cash, held by our foreign\nsubsidiaries and domestically (in thousands):\nAugust 31, August 31,\n2024 2023\nAmounts held by foreign subsidiaries $ 121,580 $ 139,050\nAmounts held domestically 14,731 113,152\nTotal cash and cash equivalents, including restricted cash $ 136,311 $ 252,202\n45\nTable of Contents\nThe following table summarizes the short-term investments held by our foreign subsidiaries and domestically (in\nthousands):\nAugust 31, August 31,\n2024 2023\nAmounts held by foreign subsidiaries $ 100,165 $ 74,294\nAmounts held domestically — 16,787\nTotal short-term investments $ 100,165 $ 91,081\nAs of August 31, 2024 and August 31, 2023, there were no certificates of deposit with a maturity of over one year\nheld by our foreign subsidiaries or domestically.\nFrom time to time, we have experienced a lack of availability of U.S. dollars in certain markets (U.S. dollar\nilliquidity). This impedes our ability to convert local currencies obtained through merchandise sales into U.S. dollars to\nsettle the U.S. dollar liabilities associated with our imported products or otherwise fund our operations. For instance, since\nfiscal year 2017, we have experienced this situation in Trinidad and have been unable to source a sufficient level of\ntradable currencies. We are working with our banks in Trinidad and government officials to convert all of our Trinidad\ndollars into tradable currencies. Additionally, during fiscal year 2023, the Honduran Central Bank began limiting the\navailability and controlling the allocation of U.S. dollars for the conversion from Honduran lempiras to U.S. dollars. We\nare actively working with our banking partners and government authorities to address this situation. We have and continue\nto take additional actions in this respect. Refer to “Management’s Discussion & Analysis – Factors Affecting Our\nBusiness” for our quantitative analysis and discussion.\nOur cash flows are summarized as follows (in thousands):\nYears Ended\nAugust 31, August 31,\n2024 2023 Change\nNet cash provided by operating activities $ 207,589 $ 257,331 $ (49,742)\nNet cash used in investing activities (175,450) (222,082) 46,632\nNet cash used in financing activities (150,026) (41,055) (108,971)\nEffect of exchange rates 1,996 6,635 (4,639)\nNet increase (decrease) in cash, cash equivalents $ (115,891) $ 829 $ (116,720)\nNet cash provided by operating activities totaled $207.6 million and $257.3 million for the twelve months ended\nAugust 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Net cash provided by operating activities decreased primarily due to shifts in\nworking capital resulting from changes in our merchandise inventory and accounts payable positions, which contributed\n$58.0 million to the overall decrease. The primary cause of this was higher inventory compared to the prior year due to\nthree additional clubs that opened in fiscal year 2024 and to a shift in our inventory mix towards more non-food items.\nAdditionally, a net change in our other various operating assets and liabilities contributed $21.5 million of additional cash\nused. This was partially offset by an increase in net income without non-cash items which contributed $29.8 million for the\ntwelve months ended August 31, 2024.\nNet cash used in investing activities totaled $175.5 million and $222.1 million for the twelve months ended\nAugust 31, 2024 and August 31, 2023, respectively. The $46.6 million decrease in cash used in investing activities is\nprimarily due to a $116.3 million increase in proceeds from settlements of short-term investments. This was partially offset\nby a $44.9 million increase in purchases of short-term investments and a $26.0 million increase in property and equipment\nexpenditures to support growth of our real estate footprint, compared to the prior year. We opened three additional clubs\nduring fiscal year 2024.\nNet cash used in financing activities totaled $150.0 million and $41.1 million for the twelve months ended August\n31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. We use cash flows provided by financing primarily to fund our working capital needs, our\nwarehouse club and distribution center acquisitions and expansions, and investments in technology to support our omni-\nchannel initiatives. The $109.0 million increase in cash used in financing activities is primarily the result of repurchases of\ntreasury stock during fiscal year 2024, a special dividend payment in April 2024, and lower proceeds, net of repayments,\nfrom long-term bank borrowings compared to the same period a year ago.\n46\nTable of Contents\nThe following table summarizes the dividends declared and paid during fiscal years 2024, 2023 and 2022\n(amounts are per share):\nFirst Payment Second Payment\nRecord Date Record Date\nDeclared Amount ͏Date ͏Paid Amount ͏Date ͏Paid Amount\n4/3/2024 $ 1.00 4/19/2024 4/30/2024 $ 1.00 N/A N/A N/A\n2/1/2024 $ 1.16 2/15/2024 2/29/2024 $ 0.58 8/15/2024 8/30/2024 $ 0.58\n2/3/2023 $ 0.92 2/16/2023 2/28/2023 $ 0.46 8/15/2023 8/31/2023 $ 0.46\n2/3/2022 $ 0.86 2/15/2022 2/28/2022 $ 0.43 8/15/2022 8/31/2022 $ 0.43\nOn April 3, 2024, the Company's Board of Directors declared a one-time $1.00 per share special dividend paid on\nApril 30, 2024 to stockholders of record on April 19, 2024 to distribute excess cash to stockholders. The $1.00 per share\nspecial dividend was in addition to the Company’s annual cash dividend in the total amount of $1.16 per share, with $0.58\nper share paid on February 29, 2024 to stockholders of record as of February 15, 2024 and $0.58 per share paid on August\n30, 2024 to stockholders of record as of August 15, 2024. The declaration of future dividends (ongoing or otherwise), if\nany, the amount of such dividends, and the establishment of record and payment dates is subject to final determination by\nthe Board of Directors at its discretion after its review of the Company’s financial performance and anticipated capital\nrequirements, taking into account the uncertain macroeconomic conditions on our results of operations and cash flows.\nCapital Expenditures\nCapital expenditures were $168.5 million for the year ended August 31, 2024, of which the mix between\nmaintenance and growth expenditures were $72.3 million and $96.2 million, respectively. Capital expenditures for fiscal\nyear 2023 were $142.5 million, of which the mix between maintenance and growth expenditures were $69.3 million and\n$73.2 million, respectively. In January 2024, the Company purchased its previously leased club building and land in\nPanama City, Panama for $33.0 million. The Company also purchased land located in Cartago, Costa Rica, where we plan\nto open our ninth warehouse club in Costa Rica in the spring of 2025. Maintenance expenditures are typically for\noperational fixtures and equipment, building refurbishment, solar, technology and other expenses. Growth expenditures are\nfor new clubs, purchases of previously leased clubs, investments to move existing clubs to better locations, supply chain\nimprovements, and major remodels and expansions.\nShort-Term Borrowings and Long-Term Debt\nOur financing strategy is to ensure liquidity and access to capital markets while minimizing our borrowing costs.\nThe proceeds of these borrowings were or will be used for general corporate purposes, which may include, among other\nthings, funding for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, dividends and repayment of existing debt. Refer to\nPart II. “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data: Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 11 -\nDebt” for further discussion.\nFuture Lease and Other Commitments\nWe place a strong emphasis on managing future lease commitments related to various facilities and equipment\nthat support our operations. We believe our current liquidity and cash flow projections can cover future lease commitments.\nAs of August 31, 2024, we have signed one lease agreement for a facility to be built by the lessor on which construction\nhas not yet commenced. Refer to Part II. \"Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data: Notes to Consolidated\nFinancial Statements, Note 9 - Commitments and Contingencies\" for further discussion.\nDerivatives\nPlease refer to Part II. “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data: Notes to Consolidated Financial\nStatements, Note 13 – Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities” for further discussion.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nThe Company does not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have had, or are reasonably likely to have, a\nmaterial current or future effect on its financial condition or consolidated financial statements.\n47\nTable of Contents\nRepurchase of Common Stock and Reissuance of Treasury Shares Related to Employee Stock Awards\nAt the vesting dates for restricted stock awards to our employees, we repurchase a portion of the shares that have\nvested at the prior day's closing price per share and apply the proceeds to pay the employees' tax withholding requirements,\nnot to exceed the maximum statutory tax rate, related to the vesting of restricted stock awards. The Company expects to\ncontinue this practice going forward.\nShares of common stock repurchased by us are recorded at cost as treasury stock and result in the reduction of\nstockholders’ equity in our consolidated balance sheets. We may reissue these treasury shares in the future.\nThe following table summarizes the equity securities repurchased as part of the Company's stock-based\ncompensation programs during fiscal years 2024, 2023 and 2022:\nYears Ended\nAugust 31, August 31, August 31,\n2024 2023 2022\nShares repurchased 44,413 99,998 88,415\nCost of repurchase of shares (in thousands) $ 3,512 $ 7,245 $ 6,259\nWe reissued 3,000 treasury shares as part of our stock-based compensation programs during fiscal year 2024,\n6,333 treasury shares during fiscal year 2023 and 8,314 treasury shares during fiscal year 2022.\nShare Repurchase Program\nIn July 2023 we announced a program authorized by our Board of Directors to repurchase up to $75 million of our\ncommon stock. We began repurchases in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2023 and successfully completed the share\nrepurchase program in the first quarter of fiscal year 2024. We purchased a total of approximately 1,007,000 shares of our\ncommon stock under the program. The repurchases were made on the open market pursuant to a trading plan established\npursuant to Rule 10b5-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, which permitted us to repurchase\ncommon stock at a time that we might otherwise have been precluded from doing so under insider trading laws or self-\nimposed trading restrictions. We have no plans to continue repurchases or adopt a new repurchase plan at this time.\nHowever, the Board of Directors could choose to commence another program in the future at its discretion after its review\nof the Company’s financial performance and anticipated capital requirements.\nShare repurchase activity under the Company’s repurchase programs for the periods indicated was as follows\n(total cost in thousands):\nYears Ended\nAugust 31, August 31,\n2024 2023\nNumber of common shares acquired 935,663 71,530\nAverage price per common share acquired $ 74.13 $ 78.54\nTotal cost of common share acquired $ 69,362 $ 5,618\nFor further information, refer to Part II. “Item 5.

The preparation of our\nconsolidated financial statements requires that management make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts\nof assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the\nreported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Some of our accounting policies require\nmanagement to make difficult and subjective judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are\ninherently uncertain. Management continues to review its accounting policies and evaluate its estimates, including those\nrelated to business acquisitions, contingencies and litigation, income taxes, value added taxes, and long-lived assets. We\nbase our estimates on historical experience and on other assumptions that management believes to be reasonable under the\npresent circumstances. Using different estimates could have a material impact on our financial condition and results of\noperations.\nWe believe that the accounting policies described below involve a significant degree of judgment and complexity.\nAccordingly, we believe these are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our consolidated financial\ncondition and results of operations. For further information, refer to Part II. “Item 8. Financial Statements and\nSupplementary Data: Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies.”\nIncome Taxes\nWe account for income taxes using the asset and liability method. Under the asset and liability method, deferred\ntax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial\nstatement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities\nare measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences\nand carry-forwards are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in\ntax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. A valuation allowance is established when\nnecessary to reduce deferred tax assets to amounts expected to be realized.\nAs of August 31, 2024, we evaluated our deferred tax assets and liabilities and determined that a valuation\nallowance was necessary for certain deferred tax asset balances, primarily because of the existence of significant negative\nobjective evidence, such as the fact that certain subsidiaries are in a cumulative loss position for the past three years,\nindicating that certain net operating loss carry-forward periods are not sufficient to realize the related deferred tax assets.\nWe also specifically considered whether foreign tax credit balances could be utilized in the foreseeable future in light of\ncurrent and future U.S. tax liabilities. We have historically applied foreign tax credits, generated from taxes withheld on\ncertain payments PriceSmart receives from our foreign subsidiaries, to reduce U.S. income tax liabilities. However, as an\nincidental result of U.S. tax reform, following the reduction of the U.S. corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%, we\nexpect foreign tax credits generated to exceed U.S. income tax liability for the foreseeable future. Therefore, for the twelve-\nmonth period ended August 31, 2024 and August 31, 2023, we have recorded valuation allowances of $12.5 million and\n$12.6 million against our foreign tax credits, respectively.\nWe are required to file federal and state income tax returns in the United States and income tax and various other\ntax returns in multiple foreign jurisdictions, each with changing tax laws, regulations and administrative positions. This\nrequires significant judgment, the use of estimates, and the interpretation and application of complex tax laws. We record\nthe benefits of uncertain tax positions in our financial statements only after determining it is more likely than not the\nuncertain tax positions would sustain challenge by taxing authorities, including resolution of related appeals or litigation\nprocesses, if any. We develop our assessment of an uncertain tax position based on the specific facts and legal arguments of\neach case and the associated probability of our reporting position being upheld, using internal expertise and the advice of\nthird-party experts. However, our tax returns are subject to routine reviews by the various taxing authorities in the\njurisdictions in which we file our tax returns. As part of these reviews, taxing authorities may challenge, and in some cases\npresently are challenging, the interpretations we have used to calculate our tax liability. In addition, any settlement with the\ntax authority or the outcome of any appeal or litigation process might result, and in some cases has resulted, in an outcome\nthat is materially different from our estimated liability. When facts and circumstances change, we reassess these\nprobabilities and record any changes in the consolidated financial statements as appropriate. Variations in the actual\noutcome of these cases could materially impact our consolidated financial statements.\n49\nTable of Contents\nDeferred income taxes arise from temporary differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their\nreported amounts in the financial statements, which will result in taxable or deductible amounts in the future. In evaluating\nour ability to recover our deferred tax assets in the jurisdiction from which they arise, we consider all available positive and\nnegative evidence, including scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, tax-planning\nstrategies, and results of recent operations. In projecting future taxable income, we begin with historical results and\nincorporate assumptions about the amount of future state, federal, and foreign pretax operating income adjusted for items\nthat do not have tax consequences. The assumptions about future taxable income require the use of significant judgment\nand are consistent with the plans and estimates we are using to manage the underlying businesses. In evaluating the\nobjective evidence that historical results provide, we consider three years of cumulative operating income. There were no\nmaterial changes in our uncertain income tax positions for the period ended on August 31, 2024.\nTax Receivables\nWe pay Value Added Tax (“VAT”) or similar taxes, income taxes, and other taxes within the normal course of our\nbusiness in most of the countries in which we operate related to the procurement of merchandise and/or services we acquire\nand/or on sales and taxable income. VAT is a form of indirect tax applied to the value added at each stage of production\n(primary, manufacturing, wholesale and retail). This tax is similar to, but operates somewhat differently than, sales tax paid\nin the United States. We generally collect VAT from our Members upon sale of goods and services and pay VAT to our\nvendors upon purchase of goods and services. Periodically, we submit VAT reports to governmental agencies and reconcile\nthe VAT paid and VAT received. The net overpaid VAT may be refunded or applied to subsequent returns, and the net\nunderpaid VAT must be remitted to the government.\nWith respect to income taxes paid, if the estimated income taxes paid or withheld exceed the actual income tax\ndue this creates an income tax receivable. In most countries where we operate, the governments have implemented\nadditional collection procedures, such as requiring credit card processors to remit a portion of sales processed via credit and\ndebit cards directly to the government as advance payments of VAT and/or income tax. This collection mechanism\ngenerally leaves us with net VAT and/or income tax receivables, forcing us to process significant refund claims on a\nrecurring basis. These refund or offset processes can take anywhere from several months to several years to complete.\nMinimum tax rules, applicable in some of the countries where the Company operates, require the Company to pay\ntaxes based on a percentage of sales if the resulting tax were greater than the tax payable based on a percentage of income\n(Alternative Minimum Tax or \"AMT\"). This can result in AMT payments substantially in excess of those the Company\nwould expect to pay based on taxable income. As the Company believes that, in one country where it operates, it should\nonly be ultimately liable for an income-based tax, it has accumulated income tax receivables of $10.9 million and $10.7\nmillion and deferred tax assets of $3.4 million and $3.2 million as of August 31, 2024 and August 31, 2023, respectively, in\nthis country.\nIn fiscal year 2023, we recorded a $7.2 million charge to settle the AMT payment dispute in another one of our\nmarkets. Of this amount, $1.0 million is a reserve we recorded against an income tax receivable for one of the tax years for\nwhich we sought a refund and the remaining $6.2 million is for the unpaid years of the dispute in which we made tax\npayments using the original computation based on taxable income.\nIn one of the countries where we had a significant VAT receivable balance, the Company received unfavorable\nrulings at the supreme court level of that country denying a portion of the Company’s appeals for refund of over-\nwithholdings of VAT. After evaluating the merits of the Company’s arguments, the court’s decision, and probability that\nthe other related refund appeals would receive the same judgment, the Company concluded that a total of $2.3 million of\nrelated VAT receivable would not be recoverable and wrote this amount off in fiscal year 2023. These charges were\nrecorded in the Warehouse club and other expenses line item under the Selling, general and administrative caption within\nthe consolidated statements of income.\n50\nTable of Contents\nThe Company’s various outstanding VAT receivables and/or income tax receivables are based on cases or appeals\nwith their own set of facts and circumstances. The Company consults and evaluates with legal and tax advisors regularly to\nunderstand the strength of its legal arguments and probability of successful outcomes in addition to its own experience\nhandling these complex tax issues. While the rules related to refunds of income tax receivables in these countries are\nunclear and complex, the Company has not placed any type of allowance on the recoverability of the remaining tax\nreceivables or deferred tax assets, because the Company believes that it is more likely than not that it will ultimately\nsucceed in its refund requests. Similarly, we have not placed any recoverability allowances on tax receivables that arise\nfrom payments we are required to make pursuant to tax assessments that we are appealing because we believe it is more\nlikely than not that we will ultimately prevail in the related appeals. There can be no assurance, however, that the Company\nwill be successful in recovering all tax receivables or deferred tax assets.\nOur policy for classification and presentation of VAT receivables, income tax receivables and other tax\nreceivables is as follows:\n• Short-term VAT and Income tax receivables, recorded as Other current assets: This classification is used for\nany countries where our subsidiary has generally demonstrated the ability to recover the VAT or income tax\nreceivable within one year. We also classify as short-term any approved refunds or credit notes to the extent\nthat we expect to receive the refund or use the credit notes within one year.\n• Long-term VAT and Income tax receivables, recorded as Other non-current assets: This classification is used\nfor amounts not approved for refund or credit in countries where our subsidiary has not demonstrated the\nability to obtain refunds within one year and/or for amounts which are subject to outstanding disputes. An\nallowance is provided against VAT and income tax receivable balances in dispute when we do not expect to\neventually prevail in our recovery of such balances. We do not currently have any allowances provided\nagainst VAT and income tax receivables.\nLong-lived Assets\nWe evaluate quarterly our long-lived assets for indicators of impairment. Indicators that an asset may be impaired\nare:\n• the asset's inability to continue to generate income from operations and positive cash flow in future periods;\n• loss of legal ownership or title to the asset;\n• significant changes in its strategic business objectives and utilization of the asset(s); and\n• the impact of significant negative industry or economic trends.\nManagement's judgments are based on market and operational conditions at the time of the evaluation and can\ninclude management's best estimate of future business activity, which in turn drives estimates of future cash flows from\nthese assets. These periodic evaluations could cause management to conclude that impairment factors exist, requiring an\nadjustment of these assets to their then-current fair market value. Future business conditions and/or activity could differ\nmaterially from the projections made by management causing the need for additional impairment charges. We did not\nrecord any impairment charges during fiscal year 2024 related to the loss of legal ownership or title to assets; significant\nchanges in the Company's strategic business objectives or utilization of assets; or the impact of significant negative\nindustry or economic trends. Loss on disposal of assets recorded during the years reported resulted from improvements to\noperations and normal preventive maintenance.\nSeasonality\nHistorically, our merchandising businesses have experienced holiday retail seasonality in their markets. In\naddition to seasonal fluctuations, our operating results fluctuate quarter-to-quarter as a result of economic and political\nevents in markets that we serve, the timing of holidays, weather, the timing of shipments, product mix, and currency effects\non the cost of U.S.-sourced products which may make these products more or less expensive in local currencies and\ntherefore more or less affordable. Because of such fluctuations, the results of operations of any quarter are not indicative of\nthe results that may be achieved for a full fiscal year or any future quarter. In addition, there can be no assurance that our\nfuture results will be consistent with past results or the projections of securities analysts.\n51\nTable of Contents\nItem 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk\nWe are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and commodity\nprice risk. These market risks arise in the normal course of business. To manage the risk arising from these exposures, we\nutilize interest rate swaps, cross-currency interest rate swaps, non-deliverable foreign currency forward contracts and loans\ndenominated in foreign currencies. We do not engage in speculative trading activities.\nInformation about the change in the fair value of our hedges and the financial impact thereof for the twelve-month\nperiod ended August 31, 2024 is disclosed in Part II. “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data: Notes to\nConsolidated Financial Statements, Note 13 - Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities.”\nInformation about the movements in currency exchange rates and the related impact on the translation of the\nbalance sheets of our subsidiaries whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar for the twelve-month period ended\nAugust 31, 2024 is disclosed in “Item 7. Management’s Discussion & Analysis – Other Comprehensive Income (Loss).”\nEach market risk sensitivity analysis presented below is based on hypothetical scenarios used to calibrate potential\nrisk and do not represent our view of future market changes. The effect of a change in a particular assumption is calculated\nwithout adjusting any other assumption. In reality, however, a change in one factor could cause a change in another factor,\nwhich may magnify or negate other sensitivities.\nInterest Rate Risk\nWe are exposed to changes in interest rates as a result of our short-term borrowings and long-term debt\nborrowings. We have mitigated a portion of our interest rate risk by managing the mix of fixed and variable rate debt and\nby entering into interest rate swaps and cross-currency interest rate swaps to hedge interest rate risk. The notional amount,\ninterest payment and maturity dates of the swap match the terms of the associated debt.\nThe table below provides information about our financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates.\nFor debt obligations, the table represents the principal cash flows and related weighted-average interest rates by expected\nmaturity dates. For interest rate swaps, including cross-currency interest rate swaps, the table represents the contractual\ncash flows and weighted-average interest rates by the contractual maturity date, unless otherwise noted. The notional\namounts are used to calculate contractual cash flows to be exchanged under the contracts. The weighted-average variable\nrates are based upon prevailing market interest rates and the outstanding balances as of August 31, 2024.\n52\nTable of Contents\nAnnual maturities of long-term debt and derivatives are as follow (in thousands):\nTwelve Months Ended August 31,\n(Amounts in thousands)\n2025 2026 2027 2028 2029 Thereafter Total\nLong-Term Debt (Unhedged):\nLong-term debt with fixed interest rate $ 12,786 $ 9,681 $ 6,386 $ 13,176 $ 3,770 $ 10,677 $ 56,476 (1)\nWeighted-average interest rate 6.40 % 6.40 % 6.20 % 6.20 % 6.70 % 6.70 % 6.40 %\nLong-term debt with variable interest\nrate $ 23,131 $ 8,781 $ 26,818 $ 620 $ 676 $ 13,858 $ 73,884\nWeighted-average interest rate 5.60 % 4.70 % 3.90 % 4.40 % 4.40 % 4.40 % 4.80 %\nTotal long-term debt $ 35,917 $ 18,462 $ 33,204 $ 13,796 $ 4,446 $ 24,535 $ 130,360 (1)\nDerivatives:\nInterest Rate Swaps:\nVariable to fixed interest $ 1,518 $ 1,804 $ 26,818 $ 620 $ 676 $ 13,858 $ 45,294 (2)\nWeighted-average pay rate 3.78 % 3.88 % 3.67 % 4.43 % 4.43 % 4.43 %\nWeighted-average receive rate 6.72 % 6.50 % 6.94 % 5.34 % 5.34 % 5.34 %\nCross-Currency Interest Rate Swaps:\nVariable to fixed interest $ 19,770 $ — $ — $ — $ — $ — $ 19,770 (2)\nWeighted-average pay rate 7.92 % — % — % — % — % — %\nWeighted-average receive rate 7.59 % — % — % — % — % — %\nLong-Term Debt Payments with Fixed\nInterest or Subject to Financial\nDerivatives:\nLong-term debt with fixed interest rate\nor with variable to fixed interest rate\nswaps $ 34,074 $ 11,485 $ 33,204 $ 13,796 $ 4,446 $ 24,535 $ 121,540\nPortion of long-term debt with fixed\ninterest rate or with variable to fixed\ninterest rate swaps 94.9 % 62.2 % 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % 93.2 %\nPortion of long-term debt with variable\ninterest rates and no swaps 5.1 % 37.8 % — % — % — % — % 6.8 %\n(1) The Company has disclosed the future annual maturities of long-term debt, for which it has entered into cross-currency interest rate\nswaps by using the derivative obligation as of August 31, 2024 to estimate the future commitments.

As of August 31, 2024, we had a total of 54 consolidated warehouse clubs operating in 12 foreign\ncountries and one U.S. territory, 42 of which operate under currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Approximately 49.0% of\nour net merchandise sales are comprised of products we purchased in U.S. dollars that were sold in countries whose\ncurrencies were other than the U.S. dollar. Approximately 79.5% of our net merchandise sales are in markets whose\nfunctional currency is other than the U.S. dollar. We may enter into additional foreign countries in the future or open\nadditional locations in existing countries, which may increase the percentage of net merchandise sales denominated in\nforeign currencies.\n53\nTable of Contents\nCurrency exchange rate changes either increase or decrease the cost of imported products that we purchase in U.S.\ndollars and price in local currency. If the local currency devalues against the U.S. dollar, we may elect to increase prices in\nthe local currency to maintain our target margins, making these products more expensive for our Members. Currency\nexchange rates also affect the reported sales of the consolidated company when local currency-denominated sales are\ntranslated to U.S. dollars. In addition, we revalue all U.S. dollar denominated assets and liabilities within those markets that\ndo not use the U.S. dollar as the functional currency. These assets and liabilities include, but are not limited to, excess cash\npermanently reinvested offshore and the value of items shipped from the U.S. to our foreign markets. The gain or loss\nassociated with this revaluation, net of reserves, is recorded in Other income (expense) in the consolidated statements of\nincome.\nForeign currencies in most of the countries where we operate have historically devalued against the U.S. dollar\nand are expected to continue to devalue. The following tables summarize by country, for those countries with functional\ncurrencies other than the U.S. dollar, the weakening of the countries' currency against the U.S. dollar (devaluation) or the\nstrengthening of their currencies (revaluation):\nRevaluation/(Devaluation)\nTwelve Months Ended\nAugust 31,\n2024 2023\nCountry % Change % Change\nColombia (1.84) % 7.15 %\nCosta Rica 3.25 18.30\nDominican Republic (5.23) (7.06)\nGuatemala 1.81 (1.72)\nHonduras (0.62) (0.48)\nJamaica (2.11) (2.29)\nNicaragua (0.33) (1.42)\nTrinidad (0.01) % (0.09) %\nWe seek to manage foreign exchange risk by (1) adjusting prices on goods acquired in U.S. dollars on a periodic\nbasis to maintain our target margins after taking into account changes in exchange rates; (2) obtaining local currency loans\nfrom banks within certain markets where it is economical to do so and where management believes the risk of devaluation\nand the level of U.S. dollar denominated liabilities warrants this action; (3) reducing the time between the acquisition of\nproduct in U.S. dollars and the settlement of that purchase in local currency; (4) maintaining a balance between assets held\nin local currency and in U.S. dollars; and (5) entering into cross-currency interest rate swaps and forward currency\nderivatives. We have local-currency-denominated long-term loans in Barbados, Honduras, Guatemala, and Trinidad and we\nhave cross-currency interest rate swaps in Colombia. Turbulence in the currency markets can have a significant impact on\nthe value of the foreign currencies within the countries in which we operate. We report the gains or losses associated with\nthe revaluation of these monetary assets and liabilities on our consolidated statements of income under the heading “Other\nincome (expense), net.” Future volatility and uncertainties regarding the currencies in the countries that we operate in could\nhave a material impact on our operations in future periods. However, there is no way to accurately forecast how currencies\nmay trade in the future and, as a result, we cannot accurately project the impact of the change in rates on our future demand\nfor imported products, reported sales, or financial results.\nWe are exposed to foreign exchange risks related to U.S. dollar-denominated and other foreign-denominated cash,\ncash equivalents and restricted cash, to U.S. dollar-denominated intercompany debt balances and to other U.S. dollar-\ndenominated debt/asset balances (excluding U.S. dollar-denominated debt obligations for which we hedge a portion of the\ncurrency risk inherent in the interest and principal payments), within entities whose functional currency is not the U.S.\ndollar. As part of the adoption of the Accounting Standard Codification (ASC) 842 - Leases, we recorded several monetary\nliabilities on the consolidated balance sheet that are exposed to foreign exchange movements. These monetary liabilities\narise from leases denominated in a currency that is not the functional currency of the Company’s local subsidiary. The\nmonetary liability for these leases as of August 31, 2024 was $31.5 million. Due to the mix of foreign currency exchange\nrate fluctuations during fiscal year 2024, the impact to the consolidated statements of income of revaluing the monetary\nliabilities for these leases was immaterial.\n54\nTable of Contents\nThe following table discloses the net effect on other expense, net for U.S. dollar-denominated and other foreign-\ndenominated accounts relative to a hypothetical simultaneous currency revaluation based on balances as of August 31,\n2024 (in thousands) including the lease-related monetary liabilities described above:\nLosses based on change in\nU.S. dollar denominated Gains based on\nand change in U.S. dollar Gains based on change in\nOverall weighted other foreign denominated denominated U.S. dollar denominated\nnegative currency cash, cash equivalents and inter-company other asset/liability\nmovement restricted cash balances balances balances Net Loss(1)\n5% $ (372) $ 1,616 $ (1,680) $ (436)\n10% $ (744) $ 3,232 $ (3,360) $ (872)\n20% $ (1,488) $ 6,463 $ (6,721) $ (1,746)\n(1) Amounts are before consideration of income taxes.\nInformation about the financial impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations for the twelve months ended\nAugust 31, 2024 is disclosed in Part II. “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis – Other Expense, net.”\nExamples of where we have significant U.S. dollar net asset positions subjecting us to exchange rate losses if the\nlocal currency strengthens against the U.S. dollar are our Costa Rica and Nicaragua subsidiaries, with balances of $73.5\nmillion, and $36.9 million, respectively, as of August 31, 2024. Examples where we have significant U.S. dollar net\nliability positions subjecting us to exchange rate losses if the local currency weakens against the U.S. dollar are our\nHonduras, Guatemala, Dominican Republic, and Trinidad subsidiaries, with balances of $28.3 million, $23.9 million, $13.0\nmillion, and $11.0 million, respectively, as of August 31, 2024.\nWe are also exposed to foreign exchange risks related to local-currency-denominated cash and cash equivalents, to\nlocal-currency-denominated debt obligations, to local-currency-denominated current assets and liabilities and to local-\ncurrency-denominated long-term assets and liabilities within entities whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar.

We hedge a portion of the currency risk inherent in the interest and principal\npayments associated with this debt through the use of cross-currency interest rate swaps. The terms of these swap\nagreements are commensurate with the underlying debt obligations. The aggregate fair value of these swaps was in a net\nasset position of approximately $1.3 million at August 31, 2024 and approximately $2.3 million at August 31, 2023. A\nhypothetical 10% devaluation in the currency exchange rates underlying these swaps from the market rates at August 31,\n2024 would have resulted in a further increase in the value of the swaps of approximately $4.4 million. Conversely, a\nhypothetical 10% appreciation in the currency exchange rates underlying these swaps from the market rates at August 31,\n2024 would have resulted in a net decrease in the value of the swaps of approximately $3.3 million.\n55\nTable of Contents\nFrom time to time, we use non-deliverable forward foreign exchange contracts primarily to address exposure to\nU.S. dollar merchandise inventory expenditures made by our international subsidiaries whose functional currency is other\nthan the U.S. dollar. The net increase or decrease in the fair value of these derivative instruments would be economically\noffset by the gains or losses on the underlying transactions.\nFrom time to time, we have experienced a lack of availability of U.S. dollars in certain markets (U.S. dollar\nilliquidity). This impedes our ability to convert local currencies obtained through merchandise sales into U.S. dollars to\nsettle the U.S. dollar liabilities associated with our imported products or otherwise fund our operations. For instance, since\nfiscal year 2017, we have experienced this situation in Trinidad and have been unable to source a sufficient level of\ntradable currencies. We are working with our banks in Trinidad and government officials to convert all of our Trinidad\ndollars into tradable currencies. Additionally, during fiscal year 2023, the Honduran Central Bank began limiting the\navailability and controlling the allocation of U.S. dollars for the conversion from Honduran lempiras to U.S. dollars. We\nare actively working with our banking partners and government authorities to address this situation. We have and continue\nto take additional actions in this respect. Refer to “Item 7. Management’s Discussion & Analysis – Factors Affecting Our\nBusiness” and “Item 7. Management’s Discussion & Analysis – Liquidity: Financial Position and Cash Flow” for our\nquantitative analysis and discussion.\nCommodity Price Risk\nThe increasing price of oil and certain commodities could have a negative effect on our operating costs and sales.\nHigher oil prices can negatively impact the economic growth of the countries in which we operate, thereby reducing the\nbuying power of our Members. Higher oil prices can also increase our operating costs, particularly utilities and\nmerchandise transportation expenses. Inflationary pressures on various commodities also may impact consumer spending.\nWe do not currently seek to hedge commodity price risk.\nItem 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\nSee the list of financial statements filed with this report under Part IV. Item 15 below.\nItem 9. Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure\nNone.\nItem 9A. Controls and Procedures\n(a)Evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures.\nAs of August 31, 2024, under the supervision and with the participation of the Company’s management, including\nthe Company’s principal executive officer and principal financial officer, the Company carried out an evaluation of the\neffectiveness of the design and operation of the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Exchange Act\nRules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e). These disclosure controls and procedures are designed to provide reasonable assurance that\nthe information required to be disclosed by the Company in its periodic reports with the SEC is recorded, processed,\nsummarized and reported within the time periods specified by the SEC’s rules and forms, and that the information is\naccumulated and communicated to the Company’s management, including the principal executive officer and principal\nfinancial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. The design of any disclosure\ncontrols and procedures also is based in part on certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be\nno assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions.\nBased upon their evaluation, the principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that the\nCompany’s disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level as of the end of the period\ncovered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n56\nTable of Contents\n(b)Management’s report on internal control over financial reporting.\nInternal control over financial reporting refers to the process designed by, or under the supervision of, the\nCompany’s principal executive officer and principal financial officer, and effected by its board of directors, management\nand other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of\nfinancial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, and includes\nthose policies and procedures that: (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly\nreflect the transactions and dispositions of the Company’s assets; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are\nrecorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting\nprinciples and that receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of the Company’s\nmanagement and directors; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized\nacquisition, use or disposition of the Company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nInternal control over financial reporting cannot provide absolute assurance of achieving financial reporting\nobjectives because of its inherent limitations. Internal control over financial reporting is a process that involves human\ndiligence and compliance and is subject to lapses in judgment and breakdowns resulting from human failures. Internal\ncontrol over financial reporting also can be circumvented by collusion or improper management override. Because of such\nlimitations, there is a risk that material misstatements may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis by internal control\nover financial reporting. However, these inherent limitations are known features of the financial reporting process.\nTherefore, it is possible to design into the process safeguards to reduce, though not eliminate, this risk.\nManagement is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over the Company’s\nfinancial reporting, as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act. Under the supervision, and with the\nparticipation, of the Company’s management, including its principal executive officer and principal financial officer, the\nCompany conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of its internal control over financial reporting. Management has\nused the 2013 framework set forth in the report entitled “Internal Control-Integrated Framework” published by the\nCommittee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission to evaluate the effectiveness of its internal control\nover financial reporting. Based on its evaluation, management has concluded that the Company’s internal control over\nfinancial reporting was effective as of August 31, 2024, the end of its most recent fiscal year.\nErnst & Young LLP, the Company's independent registered public accounting firm, has issued an attestation\nreport on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of August 31, 2024, as stated in\ntheir report which is included herein.\n(c)Changes in internal control over financial reporting.\nThere have been no changes in the Company's internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules\n13a-15(f) or 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act) during the fiscal year ended August 31, 2024 that have materially affected, or\nare reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company's internal control over financial reporting.\nThe certifications required by Section 302 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 are filed as Exhibit 31.1 and 31.2 to\nthis report.\n57\nTable of Contents\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nThe Board of Directors and Stockholders of PriceSmart, Inc.\nOpinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nWe have audited PriceSmart, Inc.’s internal control over financial reporting as of August 31, 2024, based on criteria\nestablished in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the\nTreadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria). In our opinion, PriceSmart, Inc. (the Company) maintained,\nin all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of August 31, 2024, based on the COSO\ncriteria.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United\nStates) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of August 31, 2024 and 2023, the related\nconsolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period\nended August 31, 2024, and the related notes and financial statement schedule listed in the Index at Item 15(a) and our\nreport dated October 30, 2024 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.\nBasis for Opinion\nThe Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its\nassessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management’s\nreport on internal control over financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal\ncontrol over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are\nrequired to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the\napplicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform\nthe audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in\nall material respects.\nOur audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material\nweakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk,\nand performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides\na reasonable basis for our opinion.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the\nreliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with\ngenerally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and\nprocedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the\ntransactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded\nas necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and\nthat receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and\ndirectors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized\nacquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also,\nprojections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate\nbecause of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n/s/ Ernst & Young LLP\nSan Diego, California\nOctober 30, 2024\n58\nTable of Contents\nItem 9B.

(the Company) as of August 31, 2024\nand 2023, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, equity and cash flows for each of the\nthree years in the period ended August 31, 2024, and the related notes and financial statement schedule listed in the Index\nat Item 15(a) (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). In our opinion, the consolidated financial\nstatements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at August 31, 2024 and 2023, and\nthe results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended August 31, 2024, in\nconformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United\nStates) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of August 31, 2024, based on criteria\nestablished in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the\nTreadway Commission (2013 framework), and our report dated October 30, 2024 expressed an unqualified opinion\nthereon.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion\non the Company’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB\nand are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the\napplicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and\nperform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement,\nwhether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the\nfinancial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures\nincluded examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits\nalso included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as\nevaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our\nopinion.\nCritical Audit Matter\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the financial statements\nthat was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or\ndisclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective or complex\njudgments. The communication of the critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated\nfinancial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a\nseparate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\nF-2\nTable of Contents\nUncertain Tax Positions and Income Tax and VAT Receivables\nDescription of the Matter As discussed in Note 2 and in Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company\npays Value Added Tax (“VAT”) or similar indirect taxes, income taxes, and other taxes within\nthe normal course of the Company’s business in the United States and numerous foreign\njurisdictions. The different interpretations of sometimes complex tax regulations create\nuncertainty and necessitate the use of significant judgment in the determination of the\nCompany’s uncertain tax positions and the recoverability of both income tax and VAT\nreceivables. As of August 31, 2024, the Company had $6.0 million accrued for uncertain tax\npositions and had income tax and VAT receivables of $43.8 million and $34.2 million,\nrespectively.\nAuditing the recognition and measurement of the Company’s uncertain tax positions and\nrecoverability of income tax and VAT receivables was challenging because the evaluation of\nthe various tax positions can be complex, highly judgmental and based on international tax\nlaws, interpretations and legal rulings which can vary significantly between the countries in\nwhich the Company has operations\nHow We Addressed the We tested controls over the Company’s process to assess the technical merits of its uncertain\nMatter in Our Audit tax positions and income tax and VAT receivables, including management’s process to\nmeasure the uncertain tax positions, and evaluate the recoverability of the receivables. For\nexample, we tested controls over management’s review of the uncertain tax positions and the\nsignificant assumptions surrounding more-likely-than-not conclusions, as well as controls over\nmanagement’s review of the income tax and VAT receivables and the significant assumptions\nsurrounding the recoverability of such.\nWe involved our international and other tax professionals to assist in our assessment of the\ntechnical merits of certain of the Company’s tax positions and the Company’s understanding\nand documentation of the respective international laws and regulations related to\nrecoverability of income tax and VAT receivables. Depending on the nature of the specific tax\nposition and, as applicable, developments with the relevant tax authorities, our procedures\nincluded obtaining and reviewing the Company’s correspondence with such tax authorities\nand evaluating income tax opinions or other third-party advice obtained by the Company. We\nused our knowledge of and experience with the application of international and other tax laws\nby the relevant income tax authorities to evaluate the Company’s accounting for its tax\npositions and receivables. We evaluated developments in the applicable regulatory\nenvironments to assess potential effects on the Company’s positions, including searching for\ncontrary evidence. We considered the Company’s historical experiences with the different\ntaxing authorities and their historical results in evaluating and concluding on the likely impact\nof different tax cases. In this manner, we analyzed the Company’s assumptions used to\ndetermine the tax positions and recoverability of the receivables.\n/s/ Ernst & Young LLP\nWe have served as the Company’s auditor since 1997.\nSan Diego, California\nOctober 30, 2024\nF-3\nTable of Contents\nPRICESMART, INC.\nCONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS\n(AMOUNTS IN THOUSANDS, EXCEPT SHARE DATA)\nAugust 31,\n2024 2023\nASSETS\nCurrent Assets:\nCash and cash equivalents $ 125,364 $ 239,984\nShort-term restricted cash 1,383 2,865\nShort-term investments 100,165 91,081\nReceivables, net of allowance for credit losses of $52 as of August 31, 2024 and $67 as\nof August 31, 2023, respectively 18,847 17,904\nMerchandise inventories 528,678 471,407\nPrepaid expenses and other current assets (includes $4,480 and $0 as of August 31, 2024\nand August 31, 2023, respectively, for the fair value of derivative instruments) 57,910 53,866\nTotal current assets 832,347 877,107\nLong-term restricted cash 9,564 9,353\nProperty and equipment, net 936,108 850,328\nOperating lease right-of-use assets, net 96,415 114,201\nGoodwill 43,197 43,110\nDeferred tax assets 36,618 32,039\nOther non-current assets (includes $1,482 and $7,817 as of August 31, 2024 and August\n31, 2023, respectively, for the fair value of derivative instruments) 61,563 68,991\nInvestment in unconsolidated affiliates 6,882 10,479\nTotal Assets $ 2,022,694 $ 2,005,608\nLIABILITIES AND EQUITY\nCurrent Liabilities:\nShort-term borrowings $ 8,007 $ 8,679\nAccounts payable 485,961 453,229\nAccrued salaries and benefits 48,263 45,441\nDeferred income 38,079 32,613\nIncome taxes payable 6,516 9,428\nOther accrued expenses and other current liabilities (includes $1,179 and $1,913 as of\nAugust 31, 2024 and August 31, 2023, respectively, for the fair value of derivative\ninstruments) 50,035 57,273\nOperating lease liabilities, current portion 7,370 7,621\nLong-term debt, current portion 35,917 20,193\nTotal current liabilities 680,148 634,477\nDeferred tax liability 1,644 1,936\nLong-term income taxes payable, net of current portion 4,762 5,045\nLong-term operating lease liabilities 103,890 122,195\nLong-term debt, net of current portion 94,443 119,487\nOther long-term liabilities (includes $2,100 and $3,321 for the fair value of derivative\ninstruments and $12,742 and $12,105 for post-employment plans as of August 31, 2024\nand August 31, 2023, respectively) 14,842 15,425\nTotal Liabilities 899,729 898,565\nF-4\nTable of Contents\nStockholders' Equity:\nCommon stock $0.0001 par value, 45,000,000 shares authorized;

Contents\nPRICESMART, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nNOTE 1 – COMPANY OVERVIEW AND BASIS OF PRESENTATION\nPriceSmart, Inc.’s (“PriceSmart,” the “Company,” “we” or “our”) business consists primarily of international\nmembership shopping warehouse clubs similar to, but typically smaller in size than, warehouse clubs in the United States.\nAs of August 31, 2024, the Company had 54 warehouse clubs in operation in 12 countries and one U.S. territory (ten in\nColombia; eight in Costa Rica; seven in Panama; six in Guatemala; five in Dominican Republic; four each in Trinidad and\nEl Salvador; three in Honduras; two each in Nicaragua and Jamaica; and one each in Aruba, Barbados and the United\nStates Virgin Islands), of which the Company owns 100% of the corresponding legal entities (see Note 2 - Summary of\nSignificant Accounting Policies). In addition, the Company plans to open one warehouse club in Cartago, Costa Rica in the\nspring of 2025 and one new warehouse club in Quetzaltenango, Guatemala in the summer of 2025. Once these two new\nclubs are open, the Company will operate 56 warehouse clubs. Our operating segments are the United States, Central\nAmerica, the Caribbean and Colombia.\nPriceSmart continues to invest in technology and talent to support the following three major drivers of growth:\n1.Invest in Remodeling Current PriceSmart Clubs, Adding New PriceSmart Locations and Opening\nMore Distribution Centers;\n2.Increase Membership Value; and\n3.Drive Incremental Sales via PriceSmart.com and Enhanced Online, Digital and Technological\nCapabilities.\nBasis of Presentation – The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the\ninstructions to Form 10-K for annual financial reporting pursuant to the rules and regulations of the U.S. Securities and\nExchange Commission (“SEC”) and U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) for annual financial\ninformation. The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of PriceSmart, Inc., a Delaware corporation, and its\nsubsidiaries. Inter-company transactions between the Company and its subsidiaries have been eliminated in consolidation.\nNOTE 2 – SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nPrinciples of Consolidation – The consolidated financial statements of the Company included herein include the\nassets, liabilities and results of operations of the Company’s wholly owned subsidiaries, and subsidiaries in which it has a\ncontrolling interest. The Company’s net income excludes income attributable to non-controlling interests. The Company\nreports non-controlling interests in consolidated entities as a component of equity separate from the Company’s equity. The\nconsolidated financial statements also include the Company's investment in, and the Company's share of the income (loss)\nof, joint ventures recorded under the equity method. All significant inter-company accounts and transactions have been\neliminated in consolidation. The consolidated financial statements have been prepared by the Company pursuant to the\nrules and regulations of the SEC and reflect all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring adjustments) that are, in the\nopinion of management, necessary to fairly present the financial position, results of operations and cash flows for the\nperiods presented.\nThe Company determines whether any of the joint ventures in which it has made investments is a Variable Interest\nEntity (“VIE”) at the start of each new venture and if a reconsideration event has occurred. At this time, the Company also\nconsiders whether it must consolidate a VIE and/or disclose information about its involvement in a VIE. A reporting entity\nmust consolidate a VIE if that reporting entity has a variable interest (or combination of variable interests) and is\ndetermined to be the primary beneficiary. If the Company determines that it is not the primary beneficiary of the VIE, then\nthe Company records its investment in, and the Company's share of the income (loss) of, joint ventures recorded under the\nequity method. Due to the nature of the joint ventures that the Company participates in and the continued commitments for\nadditional financing, the Company determined these joint ventures are VIEs.\nF-11\nTable of Contents\nPRICESMART, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)\nIn the case of the Company's ownership interest in a real estate development joint venture, both parties to the joint\nventure share all rights, obligations and the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the VIE's\neconomic performance. As a result, the Company has determined that it is not the primary beneficiary of the VIE and,\ntherefore, has accounted for this entity under the equity method. Under the equity method, the Company's investments in\nunconsolidated affiliates are initially recorded as an investment in the stock of an investee at cost and are adjusted for the\ncarrying amount of the investment to recognize the investor's share of the earnings or losses of the investee after the date of\nthe initial investment. In the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2024, the Company terminated its ownership interest in Price\nPlaza Alajuela PPA, S.A. Refer to Note 15 - Unconsolidated Affiliates for more information regarding this transaction. The\nCompany's ownership interest in a real estate development joint venture the Company has recorded under the equity\nmethod as of August 31, 2024 is listed below:\nBasis of\nReal Estate Development Joint Venture Country Ownership ͏Presentation\nGolfPark Plaza, S.A. Panama 50.0 % Equity(1)\n(1) Joint venture interests are recorded as investment in unconsolidated affiliates on the consolidated balance sheets.\nUse of Estimates – The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management\nto make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and\naccompanying notes. These estimates and assumptions take into account historical and forward-looking factors that the\nCompany believes are reasonable. Actual results could differ from those estimates and assumptions.\nCash and Cash Equivalents – The Company considers as cash and cash equivalents all cash on deposit, highly\nliquid investments with a maturity of three months or less at the date of purchase and proceeds due from credit and debit\ncard transactions in the process of settlement. In addition, the Company invests some of our cash in money market funds\nwhich are considered equity securities and are held at fair value in Cash and cash equivalents on the consolidated balance\nsheets. The fair value of money market funds held was $7.0 million as of August 31, 2024 and $100.2 million as of August\n31, 2023. We receive interest payments from the money market funds which are recorded in the Interest income line item\nunder the Total other expense caption within the consolidated statements of income.\nRestricted Cash – The following table summarizes the restricted cash reported by the Company (in thousands):\nAugust 31, August 31,\n2024 2023\nShort-term restricted cash $ 1,383 $ 2,865\nLong-term restricted cash 9,564 9,353\nTotal restricted cash(1) $ 10,947 $ 12,218\n(1) Restricted cash consists of cash deposits held within banking institutions in compliance with federal regulatory requirements in Costa\nRica and Panama. In addition, the Company is required to maintain a certificate of deposit and/or security deposits of Trinidad\ndollars, as measured in U.S dollars, of approximately $4.4 million with a few of its lenders as compensating balances for several U.S.\ndollar and euro denominated loans payable over several years. The certificates of deposit will be reduced annually commensurate\nwith the loan balances.\nShort-Term Investments – The Company considers certificates of deposit and similar time-based deposits with\nfinancial institutions with original maturities over three months and up to one year to be short-term investments.\nLong-Term Investments – The Company considers certificates of deposit and similar time-based deposits with\nfinancial institutions with original maturities over one year to be long-term investments.\nGoodwill – Goodwill totaled $43.2 million as of August 31, 2024 and $43.1 million as of August 31, 2023. The\nCompany reviews reported goodwill at the reporting unit level for impairment. The Company tests goodwill for\nimpairment at least annually or when events or changes in circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that the\nasset is impaired.\nF-12\nTable of Contents\nPRICESMART, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)\nThe changes in the carrying amount of goodwill for the year ended August 31, 2024 are as follows (in thousands):\nAmount\nGoodwill at August 31, 2023 $ 43,110\nForeign currency exchange rate changes 87\nGoodwill at August 31, 2024 $ 43,197\nReceivables – Receivables consist primarily of credit card receivables and receivables from vendors and are\nstated net of allowances for credit losses. The determination of the allowance for credit losses is based on the Company’s\nassessment of collectability along with the consideration of current and expected market conditions that could impact\ncollectability.\nTax Receivables – The Company pays Value Added Tax (“VAT”) or similar taxes, income taxes, and other taxes\nwithin the normal course of business in most of the countries in which it operates related to the procurement of\nmerchandise and/or services the Company acquires and/or on sales and taxable income. VAT is a form of indirect tax\napplied to the value added at each stage of production (primary, manufacturing, wholesale and retail). This tax is similar to,\nbut operates somewhat differently than, sales tax paid in the United States. The Company generally collects VAT from its\nMembers upon sale of goods and services and pays VAT to its vendors upon purchase of goods and services. Periodically,\nthe Company submits VAT reports to governmental agencies and reconciles the VAT paid and VAT received. The net\noverpaid VAT may be refunded or applied to subsequent returns, and the net underpaid VAT must be remitted to the\ngovernment. With respect to income taxes paid, if the estimated income taxes paid or withheld exceed the actual income\ntax due this creates an income tax receivable. In most countries where the Company operates, the governments have\nimplemented additional collection procedures, such as requiring credit card processors to remit a portion of sales processed\nvia credit and debit cards directly to the government as advance payments of VAT and/or income tax. This collection\nmechanism generally leaves the Company with net VAT and/or income tax receivables, forcing the Company to process\nsignificant refund claims on a recurring basis. These refund or offset processes can take anywhere from several months to\nseveral years to complete. Additionally, we are occasionally required to make payments for tax assessments that we are\nappealing, notwithstanding that we believe it is more likely than not we will ultimately prevail.\nMinimum tax rules, applicable in some of the countries where the Company operates, require the Company to pay\ntaxes based on a percentage of sales if the resulting tax were greater than the tax payable based on a percentage of income\n(Alternative Minimum Tax or \"AMT\"). This can result in AMT payments substantially in excess of those the Company\nwould expect to pay based on taxable income. As the Company believes that, in one country where it operates, it should\nonly be ultimately liable for an income-based tax, it has accumulated income tax receivables of $10.9 million and\n$10.7 million and deferred tax assets of $3.4 million and $3.2 million as of August 31, 2024 and August 31, 2023,\nrespectively, in this country.\nIn fiscal year 2023, we recorded a $7.2 million charge to settle the AMT payment dispute in one of our markets.\nOf this amount, $1.0 million relates to the reserve for an income tax receivable for one of the tax years for which we sought\na refund and the remaining $6.2 million for the unpaid years of the dispute in which the Company made tax payments\nusing the original computation based on taxable income.\nWhile the rules related to refunds of income tax receivables in this country are unclear and complex, the Company\nhas not placed any type of allowance on the recoverability of these tax receivables, deferred tax assets or amounts that may\nbe deemed under-paid, because the Company believes that it is more likely than not that it will ultimately succeed in its\nrefund requests and appeals of these rules.\nIn one of the countries where we had a significant VAT receivable balance, the Company received unfavorable\nrulings at the supreme court level of that country denying a portion of the Company’s appeals for refund of over-\nwithholdings of VAT. After evaluating the merits of the Company’s arguments, the court’s decision, and probability that\nthe other related refund appeals would receive the same judgment, the Company concluded that a total of $2.3 million of\nrelated VAT receivables would not be recoverable and wrote this amount off in fiscal year 2023. These charges were\nrecorded in the Warehouse club and other expenses line item under the Selling, general and administrative caption within\nthe consolidated statements of income.\nF-13\nTable of Contents\nPRICESMART, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)\nThe Company's various outstanding VAT receivables and/or income tax receivables are based on cases or appeals\nwith their own set of facts and circumstances. The Company consults and evaluates with legal and tax advisors regularly to\nunderstand the strength of its legal arguments and probability of successful outcomes in addition to its own experience\nhandling complex tax issues. Based on those evaluations, the Company has not placed any type of allowance on the\nrecoverability of the remaining tax receivables or deferred tax assets, because the Company believes that it is more likely\nthan not that it will ultimately succeed in its refund requests.\nThe Company’s policy for classification and presentation of VAT receivables, income tax receivables and other\ntax receivables is as follows:\n• Short-term VAT and Income tax receivables, recorded as Prepaid expenses and other current assets: This\nclassification is used for any countries where the Company’s subsidiary has generally demonstrated the\nability to recover the VAT or income tax receivable within one year. The Company also classifies as short-\nterm any approved refunds or credit notes to the extent that the Company expects to receive the refund or use\nthe credit notes within one year.\n• Long-term VAT and Income tax receivables, recorded as Other non-current assets: This classification is used\nfor amounts not approved for refund or credit in countries where the Company’s subsidiary has not\ndemonstrated the ability to obtain refunds within one year and/or for amounts which are subject to\noutstanding disputes. An allowance is provided against VAT and income tax receivable balances in dispute\nwhen the Company does not expect to eventually prevail in its recovery. The Company does not currently\nhave any allowances provided against VAT and income tax receivables.\nThe following table summarizes the VAT receivables reported by the Company (in thousands):\nAugust 31, August 31,\n2024 2023\nPrepaid expenses and other current assets $ 3,322 $ 2,774\nOther non-current assets 30,845 36,060\nTotal amount of VAT receivables reported $ 34,167 $ 38,834\nThe following table summarizes the Income tax receivables reported by the Company (in thousands):\nAugust 31, August 31,\n2024 2023\nPrepaid expenses and other current assets $ 20,088 $ 17,749\nOther non-current assets 23,679 19,176\nTotal amount of income tax receivables reported $ 43,767 $ 36,925\nLease Accounting – The Company’s leases are operating leases for warehouse clubs and non-warehouse club\nfacilities such as corporate headquarters, regional offices, and regional distribution centers. The Company determines if an\narrangement is a lease and classifies it as either a finance or operating lease at lease inception. Operating leases are\nincluded in Operating lease right-of-use assets, net; Operating lease liabilities, current portion; and Long-term operating\nlease liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets. The Company does not have finance leases.\nOperating lease liabilities are recognized at the commencement date based on the present value of the future\nminimum lease payments over the lease term. The Company’s leases generally do not have a readily determinable implicit\ninterest rate; therefore, the Company uses a collateralized incremental borrowing rate at the commencement date in\ndetermining the present value of future payments. The incremental borrowing rate is based on a yield curve derived from\npublicly traded bond offerings for companies with credit characteristics that approximate the Company's market risk\nprofile.\nF-14\nTable of Contents\nPRICESMART, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)\nIn addition, we adjust the incremental borrowing rate for jurisdictional risk derived from quoted interest rates from\nfinancial institutions to reflect the cost of borrowing in the Company’s local markets. The Company’s lease terms may\ninclude options to purchase, extend or terminate the lease, which are recognized when it is reasonably certain that the\nCompany will exercise that option. The Company does not combine lease and non-lease components.\nThe Company measures Right-of-use (“ROU”) assets based on the corresponding lease liabilities, adjusted for any\ninitial direct costs and prepaid lease payments made to the lessor before or at the commencement date (net of lease\nincentives). The lease expense for minimum lease payments is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term.\nVariable lease payments are not included in the calculation of the ROU asset and the related lease liability and are\nrecognized as incurred. The Company’s variable lease payments generally relate to amounts the Company pays for\nadditional contingent rent based on a contractually stipulated percentage of sales.\nIn January 2024, the Company purchased the building and land occupied by one of our clubs, which were\npreviously leased, in Panama City, Panama, for $33.0 million. Management assessed the fair market value using the market\nand replacement cost methods and, per the assessment, allocated approximately 88.7% of the purchase price to the land and\n11.3% of the purchase price to the building. The transaction resulted in the termination of the related ROU asset, net of tax,\nand lease liability, net of tax, of $8.2 million and $9.1 million, respectively. No gain or loss was recognized as the lease\ntermination occurred due to the purchase of the leased asset. This allocation of the purchase price, after accounting for the\nimpact of the lease termination, resulted in $28.2 million allocated to the land and $3.9 million allocated to the building.\nAdditionally, the Company already carried approximately $8.6 million of leasehold improvements related to the club which\nhave been reclassified to the building and remain on the balance sheet. This purchase triggered a change in the estimate of\nthe depreciable lives of certain leasehold improvements, which were previously limited to the lease term, lowering future\nannual depreciation. Going forward, the lower annual depreciation expense and the cost savings on straight-line rent\nexpense, partially offset by the depreciation expense on the building, will lower the expense by approximately $1.1 million\nper year, net of tax, within our Warehouse club and other operations expenses in the Company's consolidated statements of\nincome. Additionally, the Company entered into a loan agreement for $16.5 million, payable over 15 years, to partially\nfund the purchase of this club. We expect approximately $1.0 million in interest payments, net of tax, over the next 12\nmonths associated with this loan, which will continue to decrease as the loan balance is paid off over the life of the loan.\nThe interest expense related to this loan will be recorded within the Interest expense caption on the consolidated statements\nof income.\nMerchandise Inventories – Merchandise inventories, which include merchandise for resale, are valued at the\nlower of cost (average cost) or net realizable value. The Company provides for estimated inventory losses and obsolescence\nbased on a percentage of sales. The provision is adjusted every reporting period to reflect the trend of actual physical\ninventory and cycle count results. In addition, the Company may be required to take markdowns below the carrying cost of\ncertain inventory to expedite the sale of such merchandise.\nStock Based Compensation – The Company utilizes three types of equity awards: restricted stock awards\n(“RSAs”), restricted stock units (“RSUs”) and, except for fiscal year 2024, performance-based restricted stock units\n(“PSUs”). Compensation cost related to RSAs, RSUs and PSUs is based on the fair market value at the time of the grant.\nThe Company recognizes the compensation cost related to RSAs and RSUs over the requisite service period as determined\nby the grant, amortized ratably or on a straight-line basis over the life of the grant. The Company also recognizes\ncompensation cost for PSUs over the performance period of each tranche, adjusting this cost based on the Company's\nestimate of the probability that performance metrics will be achieved. As of August 31, 2024, all outstanding PSUs have\nsuccessfully met all performance metrics except for the requisite service period.\nThe Company accounts for actual forfeitures as they occur. The Company records the tax savings resulting from\ntax deductions in excess of expense for stock-based compensation and the tax deficiency resulting from stock-based\ncompensation in excess of the related tax deduction as income tax expense or benefit. In addition, the Company reflects the\ntax savings (deficiency) resulting from the taxation of stock-based compensation as an operating cash flow in its\nconsolidated statement of cash flows.\nF-15\nTable of Contents\nPRICESMART, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)\nRSAs are outstanding shares of common stock and have the same cash dividend and voting rights as other shares\nof common stock. Shares of common stock subject to RSUs are not issued nor outstanding until vested, and RSUs do not\nhave the same dividend and voting rights as common stock. However, all outstanding RSUs have accompanying dividend\nequivalents, requiring payment to the employees and directors with unvested RSUs of amounts equal to the dividend they\nwould have received had the shares of common stock underlying the RSUs been actually issued and outstanding. Payments\nof dividend equivalents to employees are recorded as compensation expense.\nPSUs, similar to RSUs, are awarded with dividend equivalents, subject to achievement of applicable performance\ncriteria.\nTreasury Stock – Shares of common stock repurchased by the Company are recorded at cost, including\ntransaction costs and excise taxes, as treasury stock and result in the reduction of stockholders’ equity in the Company’s\nconsolidated balance sheets. The Company may reissue these treasury shares as part of its stock-based compensation\nprograms. When treasury shares are reissued, the Company uses the first in/first out (“FIFO”) cost method for determining\ncost of the reissued shares. If the issuance price is higher than the cost, the excess of the issuance price over the cost is\ncredited to additional paid-in capital (“APIC”). If the issuance price is lower than the cost, the difference is first charged\nagainst any credit balance in APIC from treasury stock and the balance is charged to retained earnings. During the twelve\nmonths ended August 31, 2024, the Company reissued approximately 3,000 treasury shares.\nFair Value Measurements – The Company measures the fair value for all financial and non-financial assets and\nliabilities that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the consolidated financial statements on a recurring or\nnonrecurring basis. The fair value of an asset is the price at which the asset could be sold in an orderly transaction between\nunrelated, knowledgeable and willing parties able to engage in the transaction. A liability’s fair value is defined as the\namount that would be paid to transfer the liability to a new obligor in a transaction between such parties, not the amount\nthat would be paid to settle the liability with the creditor.\nASC 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures, sets forth a fair value hierarchy that categorizes inputs to\nvaluation techniques used to measure and revalue fair value. These tiers include: Level 1, defined as observable inputs such\nas quoted prices in active markets; Level 2, defined as inputs other than quoted prices in active markets that are either\ndirectly or indirectly observable; and Level 3, defined as unobservable inputs in which little or no market data exists,\ntherefore requiring an entity to develop its own assumptions. The Company was not required to revalue any assets or\nliabilities utilizing Level 1 or Level 3 inputs at the balance sheet dates. The Company's Level 2 assets and liabilities\nrevalued at the balance sheet dates, on a recurring basis, consisted of cash flow hedges (interest rate swaps and cross-\ncurrency interest rate swaps) and forward foreign exchange contracts. In addition, the Company utilizes Level 2 inputs in\ndetermining the fair value of long-term debt.\nNon-financial assets and liabilities are revalued and recognized at fair value subsequent to initial recognition when\nthere is evidence of impairment. During fiscal year 2024, no impairment of such non-financial assets were recorded.\nThe disclosure of fair value of certain financial assets and liabilities recorded at cost is as follows:\nCash and cash equivalents: The carrying value approximates fair value due to the short maturity of these\ninstruments. The carrying value of our money market funds is the fair value based on quoted prices in active\nmarkets at the measurement date and therefore are classified as Level 1 inputs. The fair value of money market\nfunds held was $7.0 million as of August 31, 2024 and $100.2 million as of August 31, 2023.\nShort-term restricted cash: The carrying value approximates fair value due to the short maturity of these\ninstruments.\nShort-term investments: Short-term investments consists of certificates of deposit and similar time-based deposits\nwith financial institutions with maturity dates over three months and up to twelve months. The carrying value\napproximates fair value due to the maturity of the underlying certificates of deposit within the normal operating\ncycle of the Company.\nLong-term investments: Long-term investments consists of certificates of deposit and similar time-based deposits\nwith financial institutions with maturity dates over one year. The carrying value approximates fair value due to the\nmaturity of the underlying certificates of deposit.\nF-16\nTable of Contents\nPRICESMART, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)\nLong-term restricted cash: Long-term restricted cash primarily consists of certificates of deposit with maturity\ndates of over a year, which are held as collateral against our long-term debt. The carrying value approximates fair\nvalue due to the maturity of the underlying certificates of deposit.\nAccounts receivable: Receivables consist primarily of credit card receivables and receivables from vendors and\nare stated net of allowances for credit losses. The determination of the allowance for credit losses is based on the\nCompany’s assessment of collectability along with the consideration of current and expected market conditions\nthat could impact collectability.\nShort-term VAT and income tax receivables: The carrying value approximates fair value due to the short maturity\nof these accounts.\nLong-term VAT and income tax receivables: The fair value of long-term receivables would normally be measured\nusing a discounted cash flow analysis based on the current market interest rates for similar types of financial\ninstruments, with an estimate of the time these receivables are expected to be outstanding. The Company is not\nable to provide an estimate as to the time these receivables owed to the Company by various government agencies\nare expected to be outstanding; therefore, the Company has not presented a fair value on the long-term VAT and\nincome tax receivables.\nShort-term debt: The carrying value approximates fair value due to the short maturity of these instruments.\nLong-term debt: The fair value of debt is generally measured using a discounted cash flow analysis based on\ncurrent market interest rates for similar types of financial instruments. These inputs are not quoted prices in active\nmarkets but they are either directly or indirectly observable; therefore, they are classified as Level 2 inputs. The\ncarrying value and fair value of the Company’s debt as of August 31, 2024 and August 31, 2023 is as follows (in\nthousands):\nAugust 31, 2024 August 31, 2023\nCarrying Fair Carrying Fair\n͏Value Value(1) ͏Value Value(1)\nLong-term debt, including current portion $ 130,360 $ 121,764 $ 139,680 $ 133,150\n(1) The Company has disclosed the fair value of long-term debt, including debt for which it has entered into cross-currency interest rate\nswaps, using the derivative obligation as of August 31, 2024 to estimate the fair value of long-term debt, which includes the effects\nthat the cross-currency interest rate swaps have had on the fair value of long-term debt.\nDerivative Instruments and Hedging Activities – The Company uses derivative financial instruments for\nhedging and non-trading purposes to manage its exposure to changes in interest and currency exchange rates. In using\nderivative financial instruments for the purpose of hedging the Company’s exposure to interest and currency exchange rate\nrisks, the contractual terms of a hedged instrument closely mirror those of the hedged item and are intended to provide a\nhigh degree of risk reduction and correlation. Contracts that are effective at meeting the risk reduction and correlation\ncriteria (effective hedge) are recorded using hedge accounting. If a derivative financial instrument is an effective hedge,\nchanges in the fair value of the instrument will be reported in accumulated other comprehensive loss until the hedged item\ncompletes its contractual term. Instruments that do not meet the criteria for hedge accounting, or contracts for which the\nCompany has not elected hedge accounting, are valued at fair value with unrealized gains or losses reported in earnings\nduring the period of the change.\nThe Company did not change valuation techniques utilized in the fair value measurement of assets and liabilities\npresented on the Company’s consolidated balance sheets from previous practice during the reporting period. The Company\nseeks to manage counterparty risk associated with these contracts by limiting transactions to counterparties with which the\nCompany has an established banking relationship. There can be no assurance, however, that this practice effectively\nmitigates counterparty risk.\nF-17\nTable of Contents\nPRICESMART, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)\nCash Flow Instruments. The Company is a party to receive floating interest rate and pay fixed-rate interest rate\nswaps to hedge the interest rate risk of certain U.S. dollar denominated debt within its international subsidiaries. The swaps\nare designated as cash flow hedges of interest expense risk. These instruments are considered effective hedges and are\nrecorded using hedge accounting. The Company is also a party to receive variable or fixed interest rate and pay fixed\ninterest rate cross-currency interest rate swaps to hedge the interest rate and currency exposure associated with the expected\npayments of principal and interest of U.S. denominated debt within its international subsidiaries whose functional currency\nis other than the U.S. dollar. The swaps are designated as cash flow hedges of the currency risk and interest-rate risk related\nto payments on the U.S. denominated debt. These instruments are also considered to be effective hedges and are recorded\nusing hedge accounting. Under cash flow hedging, the entire gain or loss of the derivative, calculated as the net present\nvalue of the future cash flows, is reported on the consolidated balance sheets in accumulated other comprehensive loss.\nAmounts recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss are released to earnings in the same period that the hedged\ntransaction impacts consolidated earnings. Refer to “Note 13 - Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities” for\ninformation on the fair value of interest rate swaps and cross-currency interest rate swaps as of August 31, 2024 and\nAugust 31, 2023.\nFair Value Instruments. The Company is exposed to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations in the normal\ncourse of business. This includes exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on U.S. dollar denominated\nliabilities within the Company’s international subsidiaries whose functional currency is other than the U.S. dollar. The\nCompany manages these fluctuations, in part, through the use of non-deliverable forward foreign-exchange contracts that\nare intended to offset changes in cash flows attributable to currency exchange movements. The contracts are intended\nprimarily to economically address exposure to U.S. dollar merchandise inventory expenditures made by the Company’s\ninternational subsidiaries whose functional currency is other than the U.S. dollar. Currently, these contracts are treated for\naccounting purposes as fair value instruments and do not qualify for derivative hedge accounting, and as such the Company\ndoes not apply derivative hedge accounting to record these transactions. As a result, these contracts are valued at fair value\nwith unrealized gains or losses reported in earnings during the period of the change. The Company seeks to mitigate\nforeign currency exchange-rate risk with the use of these contracts and does not intend to engage in speculative\ntransactions. These contracts do not contain any credit-risk-related contingent features and are limited to less than one year\nin duration.\nRevenue Recognition – The accounting policies and other disclosures such as the disclosure of disaggregated\nrevenues are described in “Note 3 – Revenue Recognition.”\nCost of Goods Sold – The Company includes the cost of merchandise and food service and bakery raw materials\nin cost of goods sold - net merchandise sales. The Company also includes in cost of goods sold - net merchandise sales the\nexternal and internal distribution and handling costs for supplying merchandise, raw materials and supplies to the\nwarehouse clubs, and, when applicable, costs of shipping to Members. External costs include inbound freight, duties,\ndrayage, fees, insurance, and non-recoverable value-added tax related to inventory shrink, spoilage and damage. Internal\ncosts include payroll and related costs, utilities, consumable supplies, repair and maintenance, rent expense and building\nand equipment depreciation at the Company's distribution facilities and payroll and other direct costs for in-club\ndemonstrations.\nFor export sales, the Company includes the cost of merchandise and external and internal distribution and\nhandling costs for supplying merchandise in cost of goods sold - exports.\nVendor consideration consists primarily of volume rebates, time-limited product promotions, cooperative\nmarketing efforts, digital advertising, slotting fees, demonstration reimbursements and prompt payment discounts. Volume\nrebates and time-limited promotions are recognized on a systematic and rational allocation of the cash consideration as the\nCompany progresses toward earning the rebate, provided the amounts to be earned are probable and reasonably estimable.\nCooperative marketing efforts and digital advertising are related to consideration received by the Company from vendors\nfor non-distinct online advertising services on the Company’s website and social media platforms. Slotting fees are related\nto consideration received by the Company from vendors for preferential \"end cap\" placement of the vendor's products\nwithin the warehouse club. Demonstration reimbursements are related to consideration received by the Company from\nvendors for the in-club promotion of the vendors' products. The Company records the reduction in cost of goods sold on a\ntransactional basis for these programs. On a quarterly basis, the Company calculates the amount of rebates recorded in cost\nof goods sold that relates to inventory on hand and this amount is reclassified as a reduction to inventory, if significant.\nPrompt payment discounts are taken in substantially all cases and therefore are applied directly to reduce the acquisition\ncost of the related inventory, with the resulting effect recorded to cost of goods sold when the inventory is sold.\nF-18\nTable of Contents\nPRICESMART, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)\nSelling, General and Administrative – Selling, general and administrative costs consist primarily of expenses\nassociated with operating warehouse clubs and non-income based taxes such as alternative minimum taxes based on\nrevenue or sales. These costs include payroll and related costs, including separation costs associated with the Chief\nExecutive Officer departure, utilities, consumable supplies, repair and maintenance, rent expense, building and equipment\ndepreciation, bank fees, credit card processing fees, and amortization of intangibles. Also included in selling, general and\nadministrative expenses are the payroll and related costs for the Company’s U.S. and regional management and purchasing\ncenters.\nIn December 2022, the Company announced that Sherry Bahrambeygui would resign as Chief Executive Officer\neffective February 3, 2023. In connection with her departure, the Company recognized a one-time separation charge of\napproximately $7.7 million ($7.2 million net of tax) in fiscal year 2023. This amount consists of approximately\n$4.2 million of non-cash charges related to the acceleration of certain equity awards and approximately $3.5 million for\nother separation costs. The Company recorded these charges in fiscal year 2023. These charges were recorded in the\nSeparation costs associated with Chief Executive Officer departure line item under the Selling, general and administrative\ncaption within the consolidated statements of income and are recorded in the Company’s United States segment. In\nconnection with her departure, the Company accrued for the related charges and substantially fulfilled all payment\nobligations in fiscal year 2023; however, some vesting of PSUs occurred in the first quarter of fiscal year 2024.\nPre-Opening Costs – The Company expenses pre-opening costs (the costs of start-up activities, including\norganization costs and rent) for new warehouse clubs as incurred.\nAsset Impairment and Closure Costs – The Company periodically evaluates its long-lived assets for indicators\nof impairment. Management's judgments are based on market and operational conditions at the time of the evaluation and\ncan include management's best estimate of future business activity. These periodic evaluations could cause management to\nconclude that impairment factors exist, requiring an adjustment of these assets to their then-current fair value. Future\nbusiness conditions and/or activity could differ materially from the projections made by management causing the need for\nadditional impairment charges. In fiscal year 2023, the Company recorded a $5.7 million charge primarily related to\nremeasurement of the assets of our Trinidad sustainable packaging plant to their estimated fair value upon our decision to\nseek to sell the plant. We planned to use the plant to increase efficiencies by eliminating intermediaries in packaging and\nlabeling and manufacturing some of our packaging materials using compostable or recyclable inputs. However, we found\nthat achieving economic feasibility proved challenging. Therefore, we decided to refocus our efforts on our core\ncompetencies as a retailer and redeploy plant assets we could use in our club business and seek a buyer for the remainder.\nThe assets were written down to their estimated fair value less costs to sell and are presented within the Prepaid expenses\nand other current assets line within the consolidated balance sheets. The impairment charges are recorded within the Asset\nimpairment and closure costs line item within the consolidated statements of income and are recorded in the Company's\nCaribbean segment. The sale of the assets held for sale was completed as of August 31, 2024.\nLoss Contingencies and Litigation – The Company records and reserves for loss contingencies if (a) information\navailable prior to issuance of the consolidated financial statements indicates that it is probable that an asset had been\nimpaired or a liability had been incurred at the date of the consolidated financial statements and (b) the amount of loss can\nbe reasonably estimated. If one or both criteria for accrual are not met, but there is at least a reasonable possibility that a\nmaterial loss will occur, the Company does not record and reserve for a loss contingency but describes the contingency\nwithin a note and provides detail, when possible, of the estimated potential loss or range of loss. If an estimate cannot be\nmade, a statement to that effect is made.\nForeign Currency Translation – The assets and liabilities of the Company’s foreign operations are translated to\nU.S. dollars when the functional currency in the Company’s international subsidiaries is the local currency and not U.S.\ndollars. Assets and liabilities of these foreign subsidiaries are translated to U.S. dollars at the exchange rate on the balance\nsheet date, and revenue, costs and expenses are translated at average rates of exchange in effect during the period. The\ncorresponding translation gains and losses are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income or\nloss. These adjustments will affect net income upon the sale or liquidation of the underlying investment.\nF-19\nTable of Contents\nPRICESMART, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)\nThe following table discloses the net effect of translation into the reporting currency on other comprehensive loss\nfor these local currency denominated accounts for the years ended August 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022 (in thousands):\nYears Ended August 31,\n2024 2023 2022\nEffects on other comprehensive income (loss) due to foreign currency\nrestatement $ 693 $ 33,708 $ (19,034)\nMonetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the respective\nentity (primarily U.S. dollars) are revalued to the functional currency using the exchange rate on the balance sheet date.\nThese foreign exchange transaction gains (losses), including transactions recorded involving these monetary assets and\nliabilities, are recorded as Other income (expense) in the consolidated statements of income (in thousands):\nYears Ended August 31,\n2024 2023 2022\nCurrency loss $ (17,877) $ (15,396) $ (7,414)\nIncome Taxes – We are required to file federal and state income tax returns in the United States and income tax\nand various other tax returns in multiple foreign jurisdictions, each with changing tax laws, regulations and administrative\npositions. This requires significant judgment, the use of estimates, and the interpretation and application of complex tax\nlaws. We record the benefits of uncertain tax positions in our financial statements only after determining it is more likely\nthan not the uncertain tax positions would sustain challenge by taxing authorities, including resolution of related appeals or\nlitigation processes, if any. We develop our assessment of an uncertain tax position based on the specific facts and legal\narguments of each case and the associated probability of our reporting position being upheld, using internal expertise and\nthe advice of third-party experts. However, our tax returns are subject to routine reviews by the various taxing authorities in\nthe jurisdictions in which we file our tax returns. As part of these reviews, taxing authorities may challenge, and in some\ncases presently are challenging, the interpretations we have used to calculate our tax liability. In addition, any settlement\nwith the tax authority or the outcome of any appeal or litigation process might result, and in some cases has resulted, in an\noutcome that is materially different from our estimated liability. When facts and circumstances change, we reassess these\nprobabilities and record any changes in the consolidated financial statements as appropriate. Variations in the actual\noutcome of these cases could materially impact our consolidated financial statements\nDeferred income taxes arise from temporary differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their\nreported amounts in the financial statements, which will result in taxable or deductible amounts in the future. In evaluating\nour ability to recover our deferred tax assets in the jurisdiction from which they arise, we consider all available positive and\nnegative evidence, including scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, tax-planning\nstrategies, and results of recent operations. In projecting future taxable income, we begin with historical results and\nincorporate assumptions about the amount of future state, federal, and foreign pretax operating income adjusted for items\nthat do not have tax consequences. The assumptions about future taxable income require the use of significant judgment\nand are consistent with the plans and estimates we are using to manage the underlying businesses. In evaluating the\nobjective evidence that historical results provide, we consider three years of cumulative operating income.\nOther Taxes – The Company is subject to tax examinations for value added, sales-based, payroll and other non-\nincome taxes and the Company is subject to ongoing examinations in various jurisdictions. In certain cases, the Company\nhas received assessments and judgments from the respective tax authorities in connection with these examinations. Unless\notherwise indicated, the Company considers, based on its interpretation and application of complex tax laws, that a material\nliability is not probable or the possible losses or range of possible losses associated with these cases are immaterial;\nhowever, if cases are decided adversely to the Company, the Company could incur a liability material to the Company's\nconsolidated financial statements. In certain countries, the Company is required to pay taxes based on a percentage of sales\n(Alternative Minimum Tax or \"AMT\") if the percentage of sales method results in a higher amount of tax payable than the\namount payable based on taxable income at the statutory income tax rate. The portion of taxes based on a percentage of\nsales that is greater than the amount based on taxable income at the statutory income tax rate, are recorded in the\nWarehouse club and other expenses line item under the Selling, general and administrative caption within the consolidated\nstatements of income.\nF-20\nTable of Contents\nPRICESMART, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements - Not Yet Adopted\nFASB ASC 740 ASU 2023-09—Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures\nIn December 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-09, Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures. ASU No.\n2023-09 focuses on income tax disclosures around effective tax rates and cash income taxes paid. The ASU is effective for\nannual periods beginning after December 15, 2024. Early adoption is permitted. The Company expects to adopt ASU No.\n2023-09 on September 1, 2025, the first day of the first quarter of fiscal year 2026. The Company does not expect this\nguidance to have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements.\nIn November 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-07, Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures. ASU\nNo. 2023-07 focuses on improving reportable segment disclosure requirements, primarily through enhanced disclosures\nabout significant expenses. The ASU is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2023, and for interim\nperiods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024. Early adoption is permitted. The Company expects to adopt\nASU No. 2023-07 on September 1, 2024, the first day of the first quarter of fiscal year 2025. The Company has not yet\ncompleted its assessment of the impact of ASU No. 2023-07 on the Company's consolidated financial statements.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements Adopted\nThere were no new accounting standards that had a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial\nstatements during the twelve-month period ended August 31, 2024.\nNOTE 3 – REVENUE RECOGNITION\nThe Company uses the five-step model to recognize revenue according to Accounting Standards Codification\n(ASC) Topic 606, “Revenue Recognition from Contracts with Customers.” The five steps are:\n• Identify the contract with the customer;\n• Identify the performance obligation(s);\n• Determine the transaction price;\n• Allocate the transaction price to each performance obligation if multiple obligations exist; and\n• Recognize the revenue as the performance obligations are satisfied.\nPerformance Obligations\nThe Company identifies each distinct performance obligation to transfer goods (or bundle of goods) or services.\nThe Company recognizes revenue when (or as) it satisfies a performance obligation by transferring control of the goods or\nservices to the customer.\nNet Merchandise Sales. The Company recognizes merchandise sales revenue, net of sales taxes, on transactions\nwhere the Company has determined that it is the principal in the sale of merchandise. These transactions may include\nshipping commitments and/or shipping revenue if the transaction involves delivery to the customer.\nNon-merchandise Sales. Until the disposal of Aeropost in the first quarter of fiscal year 2022, the Company\nrecognized non-merchandise revenue, net of sales taxes, on transactions where the Company had determined that it was the\nagent in the transaction. These transactions primarily consisted of contracts the Company entered into with its customers to\nprovide delivery, insurance and customs processing services for products its customers purchased online in the United\nStates either directly from other vendors utilizing the vendor’s website or through the Company’s marketplace site.\nRevenue was recognized when the Company’s performance obligations were completed (that is when delivery of the items\nhave been made to the destination point) and was recorded in “non-merchandise revenue” on the consolidated statements of\nincome. Prepayment for orders for which the Company had not fulfilled its performance obligation were recorded as\ndeferred income. Additionally, the Company recorded revenue at the net amounts retained, i.e., the amount paid by the\ncustomer less amounts remitted to the respective merchandise vendors, as the Company was acting as an agent and was not\nthe principal in the sale of those goods being purchased from the vendors by the Company’s customers.\nF-21\nTable of Contents\nPRICESMART, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)\nMembership Fee Revenue. Membership income represents annual membership fees paid by the Company’s\nwarehouse club Members, which are recognized ratably over the 12-month term of the membership. Our membership\npolicy allows Members to cancel their membership within the first 60 days and receive a full refund. After the 60-day\nperiod, membership refunds are prorated over the remaining term of the membership. The Company has significant\nexperience with membership refund patterns and expects membership refunds will not be material. Therefore, no refund\nreserve was required for the periods presented. Membership fee revenue is included in membership income in the\nCompany's consolidated statements of income. The deferred membership fee is included in deferred income in the\nCompany's consolidated balance sheets.\nPlatinum Points Reward Programs. The Company currently offers Platinum Memberships in all of its markets.\nDuring fiscal year 2024, we raised the annual fee for a Platinum Membership by $5 to approximately $80 in most markets.\nThe Platinum Membership provides Members with a 2% rebate on most items, up to an annual maximum of $500. The\nrebate is issued annually to Platinum Members on March 1 and expires August 31. Platinum Members can apply this rebate\nto future purchases at the warehouse club during the redemption period. The Company records this 2% rebate as a\nreduction of revenue at the time of the sales transaction. Accordingly, the Company has reduced warehouse sales and has\naccrued a liability within other accrued expenses and other current liabilities, platinum rewards. The Company has\ndetermined that breakage revenue is 5% of the awards issued; therefore, it records 95% of the Platinum Membership\nliability at the time of sale. Annually, the Company reviews for expired unused rebates outstanding, and the expired unused\nrebates are recognized as “Other revenue and income” on the consolidated statements of income.͏\nCo-branded Credit Card Points Reward Programs. Most of the Company’s subsidiaries have points reward\nprograms related to co-branded credit cards. These points reward programs provide incremental points that a Member can\nuse at a future time to acquire merchandise within the Company’s warehouse clubs. This results in two performance\nobligations, the first performance obligation being the initial sale of the merchandise or services purchased with the co-\nbranded credit card and the second performance obligation being the future use of the points rewards to purchase\nmerchandise or services. As a result, upon the initial sale, the Company allocates the transaction price to each performance\nobligation with the amount allocated to the future use points rewards recorded as a contract liability within other accrued\nexpenses and other current liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet. The portion of the selling price allocated to the\nreward points is recognized as Net merchandise sales when the points are used or when the points expire. The Company\nreviews on an annual basis expired points rewards outstanding, and the expired rewards are recognized as Net merchandise\nsales on the consolidated statements of income within markets where the co-branded credit card agreement allows for such\ntreatment.\nGift Cards. Members’ purchases of gift cards to be utilized at the Company's warehouse clubs are not recognized\nas sales until the card is redeemed and the customer purchases merchandise using the gift card. The outstanding gift cards\nare reflected as other accrued expenses and other current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets. These gift cards\ngenerally have a one-year stated expiration date from the date of issuance and are generally redeemed prior to expiration.\nHowever, the absence of a large volume of transactions for gift cards impairs the Company's ability to make a reasonable\nestimate of the redemption levels for gift cards; therefore, the Company assumes a 100% redemption rate prior to\nexpiration of the gift cards. The Company periodically reviews unredeemed outstanding gift cards, and the gift cards that\nhave expired are recognized as “Other revenue and income” on the consolidated statements of income.\nCo-branded Credit Card Revenue Sharing Agreements. As part of the co-branded credit card agreements that the\nCompany has entered into with financial institutions within its markets, the Company often enters into revenue sharing\nagreements. As part of these agreements, in some countries, the Company receives a portion of the interest income\ngenerated from the average outstanding balances on the co-branded credit cards from these financial institutions (“interest\ngenerating portfolio” or “IGP”). The Company recognizes its portion of interest received as revenue during the period it is\nearned. The Company has determined that this revenue should be recognized as “Other revenue and income” on the\nconsolidated statements of income.\nDetermining the Transaction Price\nThe transaction price is the amount of consideration the Company expects to receive under the arrangement. The\nCompany is required to estimate variable consideration (if any) and to factor that estimate into the determination of the\ntransaction price. The Company may offer sales incentives to customers, including discounts. For retail transactions, the\nCompany has significant experience with returns and refund patterns and relied on this experience in its determination that\nexpected returns are not material; therefore, returns are not factored in when determining the transaction price.\nF-22\nTable of Contents\nPRICESMART, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)\nDiscounts given to customers are usually in the form of coupons and instant markdowns and are recognized as\nredeemed and recorded in contra revenue accounts, as they are part of the transaction price of the merchandise sale.\nManufacturer coupons that are available for redemption at all retailers are not recorded as a reduction to the sale price of\nmerchandise. Manufacturer coupons or discounts that are specific to the Company are recorded as a reduction to the cost of\nsales.\nAgent Relationships\nThe Company evaluates the criteria outlined in ASC 606-10-55, Principal versus Agent Considerations, in\ndetermining whether it is appropriate in these arrangements to record the gross amount of merchandise sales and related\ncosts, or the net amount earned as commissions. When the Company is considered the principal in a transaction, revenue is\nrecorded gross; otherwise, revenue is recorded on a net basis. The Company's Non-merchandise Sales revenues are\nrecorded on a net basis.\nSignificant Judgments\nFor arrangements that contain multiple performance obligations, the Company allocates the transaction price to\neach performance obligation on a relative standalone selling price basis. During fiscal year 2024, there were no revenue\ntransactions that required significant judgment.\nIncremental costs to obtain contracts are not material to the Company.\nPolicy Elections\nIn addition to those previously disclosed, the Company has made the following accounting policy elections and\npractical expedients:\n• Taxes - The Company excludes from the transaction price any taxes collected from customers that are\nremitted to taxing authorities.\n• Shipping and Handling Charges - Charges that are incurred after the customer obtains control of goods are\ndeemed costs required to complete our performance obligation. Therefore, the Company considers the act of\nshipping after the customer obtains control of goods to not be a separate performance obligation. These\nshipping and handling costs are classified as “Costs of goods sold” in the consolidated statements of income\nbecause they are incurred to fulfill a revenue obligation.\n• Time Value of Money - The Company's payment terms are less than one year from the transfer of goods.\nTherefore, the Company does not adjust promised amounts of consideration for the effects of the time value\nof money.\nContract Performance Liabilities\nContract performance liabilities as a result of transactions with customers primarily consist of deferred\nmembership income, other deferred income, deferred gift card revenue, Platinum points programs, and liabilities related to\nco-branded credit card points rewards programs which are included in deferred income and other accrued expenses and\nother current liabilities in the Company’s consolidated balance sheets.

The historical cost of acquiring an asset includes the costs\nincurred to bring it to the condition and location necessary for its intended use. Depreciation is computed on the straight-\nline basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets. The useful life of fixtures and equipment ranges from 3 to 15 years\nand that of certain components of building improvements and buildings from 10 to 40 years. Leasehold improvements are\namortized over the shorter of the life of the improvement or the expected term of the lease. In some locations, leasehold\nimprovements are amortized over a period longer than the initial lease term where management believes it is reasonably\ncertain that the renewal option in the underlying lease will be exercised because an economic penalty may be incurred if the\noption is not exercised. The sale or purchase of property and equipment is recognized upon legal transfer of property.\nProperty and equipment consist of the following (in thousands):\nAugust 31, August 31,\n2024 2023\nLand $ 278,115 $ 238,374\nBuilding and improvements 737,269 650,060\nFixtures and equipment 421,273 385,100\nConstruction in progress 85,271 99,545\nTotal property and equipment, historical cost 1,521,928 1,373,079\nLess: accumulated depreciation (585,820) (522,751)\nProperty and equipment, net $ 936,108 $ 850,328\nDepreciation and amortization expense (in thousands):\nYears Ended August 31,\n2024 2023 2022\nDepreciation expense, Property and equipment $ 82,611 $ 71,933 $ 66,255\nAmortization expense, Intangible assets — 765 1,613\nTotal depreciation and amortization expense $ 82,611 $ 72,698 $ 67,868\nF-24\nTable of Contents\nPRICESMART, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)\nThe Company capitalizes interest on expenditures for qualifying assets over a period that covers the duration of\nthe activities required to get the asset ready for its intended use, provided that expenditures for the asset have been made\nand interest cost is being incurred. Interest capitalization continues as long as those activities and the incurrence of interest\ncost continue. The amount capitalized in an accounting period is determined by applying the Company’s consolidated\ncapitalization rate (average interest rate) to the average amount of accumulated expenditures for the qualifying asset, for\neach country, during the period.

The two-class method is an\nearnings allocation formula that treats a participating security as having rights to earnings that otherwise would have been\navailable to common stockholders and that determines basic net income per share for each class of common stock and\nparticipating security according to dividends declared (or accumulated) and participation rights in undistributed earnings\nthat would have been available to common stockholders. A participating security is defined as a security that may\nparticipate in undistributed earnings with common stock. The Company’s capital structure includes securities that\nparticipate with common stock on a one-for-one basis for distribution of dividends. These are the restricted stock awards\n(“RSAs”), restricted stock units (“RSUs”) and performance stock units (“PSUs”) issued pursuant to the 2013 Equity\nIncentive Award Plan, provided that the Company does not include PSUs as participating securities until the performance\nconditions have been met. The Company has not issued any new PSU awards since fiscal year 2023. As of August 31,\n2024, all outstanding PSUs have successfully met all performance metrics except for the requisite service period. RSAs are\noutstanding shares of common stock and have the same cash dividend and voting rights as other shares of common stock.\nShares of common stock subject to RSUs are not issued nor outstanding until vested, and RSUs do not have the same\ndividend and voting rights as common stock. However, all outstanding RSUs have accompanying dividend equivalents,\nrequiring payment to the employees and directors with unvested RSUs of amounts equal to the dividend they would have\nreceived had the shares of common stock underlying the RSUs been actually issued and outstanding. PSUs, similar to\nRSUs, are awarded with dividend equivalents, provided that such amounts become payable only if the performance metric\nis achieved. At the time the Compensation Committee confirms the performance metric has been achieved, the\ncorresponding dividend equivalents are paid on the PSUs. The Company determines the diluted net income per share by\nusing the more dilutive of the two class-method or the treasury stock method and by including the basic weighted average\nof outstanding performance stock units in the calculation of diluted net income per share under the two-class method and\nincluding all potential common shares assumed issued in the calculation of diluted net income per share under the treasury\nstock method.\nThe following table sets forth the computation of net income per share attributable to PriceSmart for the twelve\nmonths ended August 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022 (in thousands, except per share amounts):\nYears Ended August 31,\n2024 2023 2022\nNet income attributable to PriceSmart, Inc. $ 138,875 $ 109,205 $ 104,534\nLess: Allocation of income to unvested stockholders (1,759) (1,311) (1,245)\nNet income attributable to PriceSmart, Inc. available for distribution $ 137,116 $ 107,894 $ 103,289\nBasic weighted average shares outstanding 30,032 30,763 30,591\nAdd dilutive effect of performance stock units (two-class method) — 23 9\nDiluted average shares outstanding 30,032 30,786 30,600\nBasic net income per share $ 4.57 $ 3.51 $ 3.38\nDiluted net income per share $ 4.57 $ 3.50 $ 3.38\nF-26\nTable of Contents\nPRICESMART, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)\nNOTE 6 – STOCKHOLDERS’ EQUITY\nDividends\nThe following table summarizes the dividends declared and paid during fiscal years 2024, 2023 and 2022\n(amounts are per share):\nFirst Payment Second Payment\nRecord Date Record Date\nDeclared Amount ͏Date ͏Paid Amount ͏Date ͏Paid Amount\n4/3/2024 $ 1.00 4/19/2024 4/30/2024 $ 1.00 N/A N/A N/A\n2/1/2024 $ 1.16 2/15/2024 2/29/2024 $ 0.58 8/15/2024 8/30/2024 $ 0.58\n2/3/2023 $ 0.92 2/16/2023 2/28/2023 $ 0.46 8/15/2023 8/31/2023 $ 0.46\n2/3/2022 $ 0.86 2/15/2022 2/28/2022 $ 0.43 8/15/2022 8/31/2022 $ 0.43\nOn April 3, 2024, the Company's Board of Directors declared a one-time $1.00 per share special dividend paid on\nApril 30, 2024 to stockholders of record on April 19, 2024 to distribute excess cash to stockholders.

We began repurchases in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2023 and successfully completed the program in\nthe first quarter of fiscal year 2024. We purchased a total of approximately 1,007,000 shares of our common stock under\nthe program. The repurchases were made on the open market pursuant to a trading plan established pursuant to Rule\n10b5-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, which permitted us to repurchase common stock at times\nwhen we might otherwise have been precluded from doing so under insider trading laws or self-imposed trading\nrestrictions. We have no plans to continue repurchases or adopt a new repurchase plan at this time.

The Company makes non-discretionary contributions to the 401(k) plan with a 4% “Company Contribution”\nbased on the employee’s salary regardless of the employee’s own contributions to the plan up to the IRS maximum\nallowed. The Company also makes incremental non-discretionary contributions to the 401(k) plan to the employees who\ndefer up to 2% of their salary. Employer contributions to the 401(k) plan for the Company's U.S. employees were $3.4\nmillion during fiscal year 2024 and $2.9 million during fiscal years 2023 and 2022.\nPriceSmart also offers defined contribution retirement plans in many of its subsidiaries. The Company makes non-\ndiscretionary contributions to these plans based on the employee’s salary, regardless of the employee’s own contributions\nto the plan, up to the maximum allowed. The expenses associated with the plans for the Company’s non-U.S. employees\nwere $4.6 million, $4.5 million and $3.6 million during fiscal years 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nDefined Benefit Plans\nThe Company's subsidiaries located in three countries have unfunded post-employment benefit plans (defined\nbenefit plans) in which the subsidiary is required to pay a specified benefit upon retirement, voluntary departure or death of\nthe employee. The amount of the benefit is predetermined by a formula based on the employee's earnings history, tenure of\nservice and age. Because the obligation to provide benefits arises as employees render the services necessary to earn the\nbenefits pursuant to the terms of the plan, the Company recognizes the cost of providing the benefits over the projected\nemployee service periods. These payments are only due if an employee reaches certain thresholds, such as tenure and/or\nage. Therefore, these plans are treated as defined benefit plans. For these defined benefit plans, the Company has engaged\nactuaries to assist with estimating the current costs associated with these future benefits. The liabilities for these unfunded\nplans are recorded as non-current liabilities.\nF-29\nTable of Contents\nPRICESMART, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)\nThe following table summarizes the amount of the funding obligation and the line items in which it is recorded on\nthe consolidated balance sheets as of August 31, 2024 and 2023 and consolidated statements of income for the fiscal years\nended August 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022 (in thousands):\nOther Long-Term Accumulated Other\n͏Liability ͏Comprehensive Loss Operating Expenses\nAugust 31, Year Ended August 31,\n2024 2023 2024 2023 2024 2023 2022\nStart of period $ (5,843) $ (2,976) $ 3,604 $ 1,205 $ — $ — $ —\nService cost (601) (303) — — 555 365 315\nInterest cost (289) (139) — — 289 139 129\nPrior service cost\n(including amortization) — — (24) (26) 24 26 36\nActuarial gains/(losses) 1,223 (2,425) (1,223) 2,425 373 122 92\nTotals $ (5,510) $ (5,843) $ 2,357 $ 3,604 (1) $ 1,241 $ 652 $ 572\n(1) The Company has recorded a deferred tax asset of $756,000 and $1,106,000 as of August 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, relating to\nthe unrealized expense on defined benefit plans. The Company also recorded accumulated other comprehensive loss, net of tax, for\n$1,602,000 and $2,500,000 as of August 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\nThe valuation assumptions used to calculate the liability for the defined benefit plans differ based on the country\nwhere the plan applies. These assumptions are summarized as follows:\nYear Ended August 31,\nValuation Assumptions: 2024 2023\nDiscount rate 5.0% to 9.7% 4.6% to 6.4%\nFuture salary escalation 3.5% to 4.0% 3.0% to 5.2%\nPercentage of employees assumed to withdraw from Company without a benefit\n(“turnover”) 7.5% to 15.0% 6.7% to 15.0%\nPercentage of employees assumed to withdraw from Company with a benefit\n(“disability”) 0.5% to 1.5% 0.5% to 1.5%\nFor the fiscal year ending August 31, 2025, the Company expects to recognize, as components of net periodic\nbenefit cost, the following amounts currently recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss (in thousands):\nPrior service cost $ 26\nAmortization of actuarial loss 286\n$ 312\nOther Post-Employment Benefit Plans\nSome of the Company’s subsidiaries are parties to funded and unfunded post-employment benefit plans based on\nservices that the employees have rendered. These plans require the Company to pay a specified benefit on retirement,\nvoluntary departure or death of the employee, or monthly payments to an external fund manager. The amount of these\npayments is predetermined by a formula based on the employee's earnings history and tenure of service. Because the\nobligation to provide benefits arises as employees render the services necessary to earn the benefits pursuant to the terms of\nthe plan, the cost associated with providing the benefits is recognized as the employee provides those services. The\nemployees' rights to receive payment on these plans are not dependent on their reaching certain thresholds like age or\ntenure. Therefore, these plans are not treated as defined benefit plans. For these post-employment benefit plans, the\nCompany has accrued liabilities that are recorded as accrued salaries and benefits and other long-term liabilities.\nF-30\nTable of Contents\nPRICESMART, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)\nThe following table summarizes the amounts recorded on the balance sheet and amounts expensed on the\nconsolidated statements of income (in thousands):\nAccrued Salaries Other Long- Restricted Cash\n͏and Benefits Term Liability Held (1) Operating Expenses\nYears Ended August 31,\n2024 2023 2024 2023 2024 2023 2024 2023 2022\nOther Post Employment\nPlans $ 850 $ 738 $ 5,694 $ 5,077 $ 5,389 $ 4,859 $ 2,130 $ 1,754 $ 1,423\n(1) With some locations, local statutes require the applicable Company subsidiary to deposit cash in its own name with designated fund\nmanagers. The funds earn interest, which the Company recognizes as interest income.\nNOTE 8 – STOCK BASED COMPENSATION\nStock Based Compensation – The Company utilizes three types of equity awards: restricted stock awards\n(“RSAs”), restricted stock units (“RSUs”) and, except for fiscal year 2024, performance stock units (“PSUs”).\nThe Company adopted the 2013 Equity Incentive Award Plan (the \"2013 Plan\") for the benefit of its eligible\nemployees, consultants and non-employee directors on January 22, 2013. The 2013 Plan provides for awards covering up\nto 1.1 million shares of common stock plus the number of shares that remained available for issuance as of January 22,\n2013 under three equity participation plans previously maintained by the Company. The 2013 plan was amended in fiscal\nyear 2021 to increase the number of shares of Common Stock available for the grant of awards by 500,000 shares and\nfurther amended in fiscal year 2023 to increase the number of shares of Common Stock available for the grant of awards by\nan additional 750,000 shares. The number of shares reserved for issuance under the 2013 Plan increases during the term of\nthe plan by the number of shares relating to awards outstanding under the 2013 Plan or any of the prior plans that expire, or\nare forfeited, terminated, canceled or repurchased, or are settled in cash in lieu of shares. However, in no event will more\nthan an aggregate of 2,966,867 shares of the Company’s common stock be issued under the 2013 Plan.\nThe following table summarizes the shares authorized and shares available for future grants:\nShares available to grant\nShares authorized for issuance as of August 31, 2024 August 31, August 31,\n(including shares originally authorized for issuance under prior plans) 2024 2023\n2013 Plan 2,317,923 596,058 1,223,574\nThe following table summarizes the components of the stock-based compensation expense for the twelve-month\nperiods ended August 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022 (in thousands), which are included in general and administrative expense\nand warehouse club and other operations in the consolidated statements of income:\nYears Ended August 31,\n2024 2023 2022\nRestricted stock awards $ 12,128 $ 10,641 $ 9,378\nRestricted stock units 4,501 3,701 3,519\nPerformance stock units (1) 664 2,232 3,906\nStock-based compensation expense $ 17,293 $ 16,574 $ 16,803\n(1) The stock-based compensation expense relates to vesting of PSUs granted in prior years.\nF-31\nTable of Contents\nPRICESMART, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)\nThe following tables summarize other information related to stock-based compensation:\nBalance as of\nAugust 31, August 31, August 31,\n2024 2023 2022\nRemaining unrecognized compensation cost (in thousands) $ 43,490 $ 15,386 $ 18,478\nWeighted average period of time over which this cost will be\nrecognized (years) 3 2 2\nYears Ended August 31,\n2024 2023 2022\nExcess tax benefit (deficiency) on stock-based compensation (in\nthousands) $ (588) $ (2,787) $ (2,259)\nThe restricted stock awards and units generally vest over a three-year or five-year period and the unvested portion\nof the award is forfeited if the employee or non-employee director leaves the Company before the vesting period is\ncompleted.\nRestricted stock awards, restricted stock units, and performance-based restricted stock units activity for the twelve\nmonths ended August 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022 was as follows:\nYears Ended\nAugust 31, August 31, August 31,\n2024 2023 2022\nGrants outstanding at beginning of period 342,741 361,822 375,622\nGranted 657,649 365,850 261,204\nForfeited (61,029) (118,577) (16,184)\nVested (171,414) (266,354) (258,820)\nGrants outstanding at end of period 767,947 342,741 361,822\nThe following table summarizes the weighted average per share grant date fair value for restricted stock awards,\nrestricted stock units, and performance based restricted stock units for fiscal years 2024, 2023 and 2022:\nYears Ended\nAugust 31, August 31, August 31,\nWeighted Average Grant Date Fair Value 2024 2023 2022\nRSAs, RSUs, and PSUs granted $ 73.28 $ 63.93 $ 76.85\nRSAs, RSUs, and PSUs vested $ 71.12 $ 70.26 $ 72.69\nRSAs, RSUs, and PSUs forfeited $ 66.97 $ 66.14 $ 69.70\nThe following table summarizes the total fair market value of restricted stock awards, restricted stock units, and\nperformance based restricted stock units vested for the period (in thousands):\nYears Ended\nAugust 31, August 31, August 31,\n2024 2023 2022\nTotal fair market value of restricted stock awards and units vested (in\nthousands) $ 13,424 $ 19,325 $ 18,422\nF-32\nTable of Contents\nPRICESMART, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)\nAt the vesting dates for equity awards to employees, the Company repurchases a portion of the shares that have\nvested at the prior day's closing price per share, with the funds used to pay the employees' tax withholding requirements\nrelated to the vesting of restricted stock awards.

The Company evaluates\nsuch matters on a case by case basis, and vigorously contests any such legal proceedings or claims which the Company\nbelieves are without merit. The Company believes that the final disposition of these matters will not have a material\nadverse effect on its financial position, results of operations or liquidity. It is possible, however, that the Company's results\nof operations for a particular quarter or fiscal year could be impacted by changes in circumstances relating to such matters.\nThe Company establishes an accrual for legal proceedings if and when those matters reach a stage where they\npresent loss contingencies that are both probable and reasonably estimable. In such cases, there may be a possible exposure\nto loss in excess of any amounts accrued. The Company monitors those matters for developments that would affect the\nlikelihood of a loss and the accrued amount, if any, thereof, and adjusts the amount as appropriate. If the loss contingency\nat issue is not both probable and reasonably estimable, the Company does not establish an accrual, but will continue to\nmonitor the matter for developments that will make the loss contingency both probable and reasonably estimable. If it is at\nleast a reasonable possibility that a material loss will occur, the Company will provide disclosure regarding the\ncontingency.\nF-33\nTable of Contents\nPRICESMART, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)\nIncome Taxes\nWe are required to file federal and state income tax returns in the United States and income tax and various other\ntax returns in multiple foreign jurisdictions, each with changing tax laws, regulations and administrative positions. This\nrequires significant judgment, the use of estimates, and the interpretation and application of complex tax laws. We record\nthe benefits of uncertain tax positions in our financial statements only after determining it is more likely than not the\nuncertain tax positions would sustain challenge by taxing authorities, including resolution of related appeals or litigation\nprocesses, if any. We develop our assessment of an uncertain tax position based on the specific facts and legal arguments of\neach case and the associated probability of our reporting position being upheld, using internal expertise and the advice of\nthird-party experts. However, our tax returns are subject to routine reviews by the various taxing authorities in the\njurisdictions in which we file our tax returns. As part of these reviews, taxing authorities may challenge, and in some cases\npresently are challenging, the interpretations we have used to calculate our tax liability. In addition, any settlement with the\ntax authority or the outcome of any appeal or litigation process might result, and in some cases has resulted, in an outcome\nthat is materially different from our estimated liability. When facts and circumstances change, we reassess these\nprobabilities and record any changes in the consolidated financial statements as appropriate. Variations in the actual\noutcome of these cases could materially impact our consolidated financial statements.\nThe Company accrues an amount for its estimate of probable additional income tax liability. In certain cases, the\nimpact of an uncertain income tax position on the income tax return must be recognized at the largest amount that is more-\nlikely-than-not to be sustained upon audit by the relevant tax authority. An uncertain income tax position will not be\nrecognized if it has less than 50% likelihood of being sustained (refer to “Note 10 - Income Taxes for additional\ninformation”).\nIn evaluating the exposure associated with various non-income tax filing positions, the Company accrues for\nprobable and estimable exposures for non-income tax related tax contingencies. As of August 31, 2024 and 2023, the\nCompany has recorded within other accrued expenses and other current liabilities a total of $1.2 million and $9.6 million,\nrespectively, for various non-income tax related tax contingencies.\nMinimum tax rules, applicable in some of the countries where the Company operates, require the Company to pay\ntaxes based on a percentage of sales if the resulting tax were greater than the tax payable based on a percentage of income\n(Alternative Minimum Tax or \"AMT\"). This can result in AMT payments substantially in excess of those the Company\nwould expect to pay based on taxable income. As the Company believes that, in one country where it operates, it should\nonly be ultimately liable for an income-based tax, it has accumulated income tax receivables of $10.9 million and\n$10.7 million and deferred tax assets of $3.4 million and $3.2 million as of August 31, 2024 and August 31, 2023,\nrespectively, in this country.\nIn fiscal year 2023, we recorded a $7.2 million charge to settle an AMT payment dispute in another one of our\nmarkets. Of this amount, $1.0 million is a reserve recorded against an income tax receivable for one of the tax years for\nwhich we sought a refund and the remaining $6.2 million was for the unpaid years of the dispute in which the Company\nmade tax payments using the original computation based on taxable income. Additionally, as part of the settlement, the\nCompany agreed to pay AMT on a go-forward basis, which was approximately $1.9 million for fiscal year 2024.\nWhile the Company believes the recorded liabilities are adequate, there are inherent limitations in projecting the\noutcome of litigation, in estimating probable additional income tax liability taking into account uncertain tax positions and\nin evaluating the probable additional tax associated with various non-income tax filing positions. As such, the Company is\nunable to make a reasonable estimate of the sensitivity to change of estimates affecting its recorded liabilities. As\nadditional information becomes available, the Company assesses the potential liability and revises its estimates as\nappropriate.\nF-34\nTable of Contents\nPRICESMART, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)\nOther Commitments\nThe Company is committed under non-cancelable operating leases for the rental of facilities and land. Refer to\n“Note 12 – Leases”.\nThe Company is also committed to non-cancelable construction service obligations for various warehouse club\ndevelopments and expansions. As of August 31, 2024 and August 31, 2023, the Company had approximately $14.7 million\nand $11.3 million, respectively, in contractual obligations for construction services not yet rendered.\nAs of August 31, 2024, the Company has signed a lease agreement for a facility to be built by the lessor related to\nthe relocation of its warehouse club in Miraflores, Guatemala. As part of the agreement, the landlord has agreed to build a\nshell building which is estimated to be delivered in the second half of calendar year 2025. Once this building is ready, the\nCompany expects to use approximately $12.1 million in cash to outfit this club. The lease will have a term of\napproximately 20 years, with a 5-year renewal option, and will commence upon delivery of the shell building to the\nCompany. Per the lease agreement, the Company will pay monthly fixed base rent payments which increase annually based\non the Consumer Price Index. The Company will also pay variable rent payments if the yearly warehouse sales for the\nlocation are in excess of a certain threshold. A collateralized incremental borrowing rate was used to determine the present\nvalue of estimated future minimum lease commitments. The present value of estimated future minimum lease commitments\nfor this lease are as follows (in thousands):\nYears Ended August 31, Amount\n2026 $ 845\n2027 1,646\n2028 1,607\n2029 1,569\n2030 1,532\nThereafter 19,894\nTotal future lease payments $ 27,093\nFrom time to time, the Company has entered into general land purchase and land purchase option agreements. The\nCompany’s land purchase agreements are typically subject to various conditions, including, but not limited to, the ability to\nobtain necessary governmental permits or approvals. A deposit under an agreement is typically returned to the Company if\nall permits or approvals are not obtained. Generally, the Company has the right to cancel any of its agreements to purchase\nland without cause by forfeiture of some or all of the deposits it has made pursuant to the agreement. As of August 31,\n2024 the Company had entered into four land purchase agreements that, if completed, would result in the use of\napproximately $13.7 million in cash. Additionally, the Company has one lease agreement for the Miraflores warehouse\nclub relocation, as mentioned above. Lastly, the Company has signed two promissory lease agreements in Guatemala; one\nfor a distribution center and one for a land option. If the pending contingencies are resolved favorably, the Company would\nexpect an increase in its total lease liability of approximately $15.6 million upon commencement.\nRefer to “Note 15 - Unconsolidated Affiliates” for a description of additional capital contributions that may be\nrequired in connection with a joint venture to develop a commercial center adjacent to a PriceSmart warehouse club in\nPanama.\nF-35\nTable of Contents\nPRICESMART, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)\nNOTE 10 – INCOME TAXES\nIncome from continuing operations before provision for income taxes and loss of unconsolidated affiliates\nincludes the following components (in thousands):\nYears Ended August 31,\n2024 2023 2022\nUnited States $ 60,697 $ 57,941 $ 55,667\nForeign 140,730 111,270 100,754\nIncome from continuing operations before provision for income taxes\nand income (loss) of unconsolidated affiliates $ 201,427 $ 169,211 $ 156,421\nSignificant components of the income tax provision are as follows (in thousands):\nYears Ended August 31,\n2024 2023 2022\nCurrent:\nU.S. tax expense $ 23,213 $ 21,604 $ 20,824\nForeign tax expense 43,488 41,639 34,334\nTotal $ 66,701 $ 63,243 $ 55,158\nDeferred:\nU.S. tax benefit $ (15,389) $ (11,958) $ (11,894)\nU.S. valuation allowance change 12,532 12,598 11,823\nForeign tax benefit (1,904) (3,935) (3,259)\nForeign valuation allowance change 678 3 30\nTotal $ (4,083) $ (3,292) $ (3,300)\nProvision for income taxes $ 62,618 $ 59,951 $ 51,858\nThe reconciliation of income tax computed at the Federal statutory tax rate to the provision for income taxes is as\nfollows (in percentages):\nYears Ended August 31,\n2024 2023 2022\nFederal tax provision at statutory rates 21.0 % 21.0 % 21.0 %\nState taxes, net of federal benefit 0.2 0.3 0.2\nDifferences in foreign tax rates 2.1 6.8 7.1\nPermanent items and other adjustments 0.6 (0.1) (2.6)\nIncrease in valuation allowance 7.2 7.4 7.5\nProvision for income taxes 31.1 % 35.4 % 33.2 %\nF-36\nTable of Contents\nPRICESMART, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)\nSignificant components of the Company’s deferred tax assets as of August 31, 2024 and 2023 are shown below (in\nthousands):\nAugust 31,\n2024 2023\nDeferred tax assets:\nForeign tax credits 54,451 43,632\nDeferred compensation 2,819 1,664\nU.S. timing differences 7,992 6,845\nForeign net operating losses 4,590 4,911\nForeign timing differences:\nAccrued expenses and other timing differences 8,765 9,365\nDepreciation and amortization 16,944 15,160\nDeferred income 9,120 7,338\nGross deferred tax assets 104,680 88,915\nU.S. deferred tax liabilities (depreciation and other timing differences) (1,199) (3,035)\nForeign deferred tax liabilities netted against deferred tax assets (5,883) (5,552)\nU.S. valuation allowance (55,871) (43,860)\nForeign valuation allowance (5,110) (4,430)\nNet deferred tax assets $ 36,618 $ 32,038\nFor fiscal year 2024, the effective tax rate was 31.1%. The decrease in the effective rate versus the prior year was\nprimarily attributable to the non-recurrence of the comparably unfavorable impact in the prior year of write-offs of VAT\nreceivables, Aeropost write-offs and asset impairment and related closure costs of 2.2%, and a 1.8% unfavorable impact\ndue to the AMT settlement.\nFollowing the implementation of certain tax optimization initiatives at the end of fiscal year 2024, we expect a\ndecrease in the effective tax rate by approximately 2-4% in fiscal year 2025.\nFor fiscal year 2024, management concluded that a valuation allowance continues to be necessary for certain U.S.\nand foreign deferred tax assets primarily because of the existence of negative objective evidence, such as the fact that\ncertain subsidiaries are in a cumulative loss position for the past three years, and the determination that certain net\noperating loss carryforward periods are not sufficient to realize the related deferred tax assets. The Company factored into\nits analysis the inherent risk of forecasting revenue and expenses over an extended period of time and also considered the\npotential risks associated with its business. The Company had net foreign deferred tax assets of $28.4 million and\n$26.8 million as of August 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\nThe Company does not provide for income taxes which would be payable if undistributed earnings of its foreign\nsubsidiaries were remitted to the U.S. The Company considers earnings to be permanently reinvested for any jurisdiction\nwhere distribution from a foreign affiliate would cause additional tax cost, and management has no plans to repatriate the\nrelated undistributed earnings and profits from these foreign affiliates. As of August 31, 2024 and 2023 the undistributed\nearnings of these foreign subsidiaries are approximately $461.5 million and $369.6 million, respectively.\nThe Company accrues for the estimated additional amount of taxes for uncertain income tax positions if the\nlikelihood of sustaining the tax position does not meet the more-likely-than-not-standard for recognition of tax benefits.\nThese positions are recorded as unrecognized tax benefits.\nF-37\nTable of Contents\nPRICESMART, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)\nA reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits is as follows (in thousands):\nYears Ended August 31,\n2024 2023 2022\nBalance at beginning of fiscal year $ 4,745 $ 5,041 $ 3,911\nGross increase - tax positions in prior period 11 35 264\nGross decrease - tax positions in prior period — — —\nAdditions based on tax positions related to the current year 7 143 1,356\nExpiration of the statute of limitations for the assessment of taxes (469) (474) (490)\nBalance at end of fiscal year $ 4,294 $ 4,745 $ 5,041\nAs of August 31, 2024, the liability for income taxes associated with unrecognized tax benefits was $4.3 million\nand can be reduced by $1.3 million of tax benefits recorded as deferred tax assets and liabilities. The total $4.3 million\nunrecognized tax benefit includes $200,000 of associated timing adjustments. The net amount of $4.1 million would, if\nrecognized, favorably affect the Company's financial statements and favorably affect the Company's effective income tax\nrate.\nThe Company recognizes interest and/or penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense. As\nof August 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company had accrued an additional $1.7 million and $1.6 million, respectively, for the\npayment of interest and penalties related to the above-mentioned unrecognized tax benefits.\nThe Company expects changes in the amount of unrecognized tax benefits in the next 12 months as the result of a\nlapse in various statutes of limitations. The lapse of statutes of limitations in the twelve-month period ending August 31,\n2025 could result in a total income tax benefit amounting up to $1.8 million.\nThe Company has various appeals pending before tax courts in its subsidiaries' jurisdictions. Any possible\nsettlement could increase or decrease earnings but is not expected to be significant. Audit outcomes and the timing of audit\nsettlements are subject to significant uncertainty.\nMinimum tax rules, applicable in some of the countries where the Company operates, require the Company to pay\ntaxes based on a percentage of sales if the resulting tax were greater than the tax payable based on a percentage of income\n(Alternative Minimum Tax or \"AMT\"). This can result in AMT payments substantially in excess of those the Company\nwould expect to pay based on taxable income. As the Company believes that, in one country where it operates, it should\nonly be ultimately liable for an income-based tax, it has accumulated income tax receivables of $10.9 million and\n$10.7 million and deferred tax assets of $3.4 million and $3.2 million as of August 31, 2024 and August 31, 2023,\nrespectively, in this country.\nIn fiscal year 2023, the Company recorded a $7.2 million charge to settle the AMT payment dispute in another\none of our markets, $1.0 million of which was a reserve for an income tax receivable for one of the tax years for which the\nCompany sought a refund and the remaining $6.2 million for the unpaid years of the dispute in which the Company made\ntax payments using the original computation based on taxable income.\nWhile the rules related to refunds of income tax receivables in these countries are either unclear or complex, the\nCompany has not placed any type of allowance on the recoverability of the remaining tax receivables, deferred tax assets or\namounts that may be deemed under-paid, because the Company believes that it is more likely than not that it will ultimately\nsucceed in its refund requests and appeals of these rules.\nF-38\nTable of Contents\nPRICESMART, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)\nThe Company and its subsidiaries file income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and various state and\nforeign jurisdictions.

If and to the extent the tax year resulted in a taxable loss, the statute is\nextended to three years from the filing date of the income tax return in which the carryforward tax loss was used to offset\ntaxable income in the carryforward year. Given the historical losses in these jurisdictions and the Section 382 change in\ncontrol limitations on the use of the tax loss carryforwards, there is uncertainty and significant variation as to when a tax\nyear is no longer subject to audit.\nF-39\nTable of Contents\nPRICESMART, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)\nNOTE 11 – DEBT\nShort-term borrowings consist of unsecured lines of credit and short-term overdraft borrowings.

Lease expense for operating\nleases is included in selling, general and administrative expense on the Company’s consolidated statements of income.\nLeases with an initial term of twelve months or less are not recorded on the Company’s consolidated balance sheet.\nThe Company is generally obligated for the cost of property taxes, insurance, and maintenance relating to its\nleases, which are often variable lease payments. Such costs are included in selling, general and administrative expense in\nthe consolidated statements of income.\nF-42\nTable of Contents\nPRICESMART, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)\nCertain of the Company's lease agreements provide for lease payments based on future sales volumes at the leased\nlocation, or include rental payments adjusted periodically for inflation or based on an index, which are not measurable at\nthe inception of the lease. The Company expenses such variable amounts in the period incurred, which is the period in\nwhich it becomes probable that the specified target that triggers the variable lease payments will be achieved. The\nCompany's lease agreements do not contain any material residual value guarantees or material restrictive covenants.\nROU assets represent the right to use an underlying asset for the lease term, and lease liabilities represent the\nobligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. Operating lease ROU assets and liabilities are recognized at the\ncommencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the reasonably certain lease term. The operating\nlease terms may include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that the Company will\nexercise that option or if an economic penalty may be incurred if the option is not exercised. The initial lease term of the\nCompany’s operating leases range from 2 to 41 years.\nWhere the Company's leases do not provide an implicit rate, a collateralized incremental borrowing rate (\"IBR\") is\nused to determine the present value of lease payments. The IBR is based on a yield curve derived by publicly traded bond\nofferings for companies with similar credit characteristics that approximate the Company's market risk profile. In addition,\nwe adjust the IBR for jurisdictional risk derived from quoted interest rates from financial institutions to reflect the cost of\nborrowing in the Company’s local markets.\nThe following table is a summary of the Company’s components of total lease costs for fiscal year 2024 and 2023\n(in thousands):\nYears Ended August 31,\n2024 2023\nOperating lease cost $ 15,368 $ 15,753\nShort-term lease cost 243 162\nVariable lease cost 5,464 5,034\nSublease income (109) (91)\nTotal lease costs $ 20,966 $ 20,858\nThe weighted average remaining lease term and weighted average discount rate for operating leases as of August\n31, 2024 and August 31, 2023 were as follows:\nYears Ended August 31,\n2024 2023\nWeighted average remaining lease term in years 18.1 17.8\nWeighted average discount rate percentage 6.7 % 6.8 %\nSupplemental cash flow information related to leases under which the Company is the lessee was as follows\n(amounts in thousands):\nYears Ended August 31,\n2024 2023\nOperating cash flows paid for operating leases $ 15,368 $ 15,753\nF-43\nTable of Contents\nPRICESMART, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)\nThe Company is committed under non-cancelable operating leases for the rental of facilities and land.

To manage interest rate\nexposure, the Company enters into hedge transactions (interest rate swaps) using derivative financial instruments. The\nobjective of entering into interest rate swaps is to eliminate the variability of cash flows in the SOFR interest payments\nassociated with variable-rate loans over the life of the loans. As changes in interest rates impact the future cash flow of\ninterest payments, the hedges provide a synthetic offset to interest rate movements.\nIn addition, the Company is exposed to foreign currency and interest rate cash flow exposure related to non-\nfunctional currency long-term debt of one of its wholly owned subsidiaries. To manage this foreign currency and interest\nrate cash flow exposure, some of the Company’s subsidiaries have entered into cross-currency interest rate swaps that\nconvert their U.S. dollar denominated floating interest payments to functional currency fixed interest payments during the\nlife of the hedging instrument. As changes in foreign exchange and interest rates impact the future cash flow of interest\npayments, the hedges are intended to offset changes in cash flows attributable to interest rate and foreign exchange\nmovements.\nThese derivative instruments (cash flow hedging instruments) are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges,\nwith the entire gain or loss on the derivative reported as a component of other comprehensive loss. Amounts are deferred in\nother comprehensive loss and reclassified into earnings in the same income statement line item that is used to present the\nearnings effect of the hedged item when the hedged item affects earnings.\nThe Company is exposed to foreign-currency exchange-rate fluctuations in the normal course of business,\nincluding foreign-currency exchange-rate fluctuations on U.S. dollar denominated liabilities within its international\nsubsidiaries whose functional currency is other than the U.S. dollar. The Company manages these fluctuations, in part,\nthrough the use of non-deliverable forward foreign-exchange contracts (NDFs) that are intended to offset changes in cash\nflow attributable to currency exchange movements. These contracts are intended primarily to economically address\nexposure to U.S. dollar merchandise inventory expenditures made by the Company’s international subsidiaries whose\nfunctional currency is other than the U.S. dollar. Currently, these contracts do not qualify for derivative hedge accounting.\nThe Company seeks to mitigate foreign-currency exchange-rate risk with the use of these contracts and does not intend to\nengage in speculative transactions. These contracts do not contain any credit-risk-related contingent features.\nCash Flow Hedges\nAs of August 31, 2024, all of the Company’s interest rate swap and cross-currency interest rate swap derivative\nfinancial instruments are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges. The Company formally documents the hedging\nrelationships for its derivative instruments that qualify for hedge accounting.\nF-44\nTable of Contents\nPRICESMART, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)\nThe following table summarizes agreements for which the Company has recorded cash flow hedge accounting for\nthe twelve months ended August 31, 2024:\nFloating\nDerivative Initial US$ Leg\nDate Financial Derivative US$ Loan ͏(swap Fixed Rate\nEntered Counter- Financial Notional Held counter- ͏for PSMT Settlement Effective\nEntity into ͏party Instruments Amount With party) Subsidiary Dates Period of swap\nColombia 30-Nov-23 Citibank, N.A.

On December 12, 2013, the Company entered\ninto a lease agreement for approximately 17,976 square feet (1,670 square meters) of land with Golf Park Plaza, S.A. upon\nwhich the Company constructed its central offices in Panama. The lease term is for 15 years with three options to renew for\nfive years each at the Company's discretion. On July 14, 2017, the Company entered into a lease agreement for\napproximately 2,992 square feet (278 square meters) of a building with Golf Park Plaza, S.A. for warehouse storage space.\nThe agreement was recently renewed for an additional five years during fiscal year 2022.

Price, a Company founder and Chairman of the\nBoard, became Interim Chief Executive Officer. Mr. Price has elected not to receive compensation for his role as Interim\nChief Executive Officer. Therefore, the financial statements do not include compensation charges for his services. We have\nestimated the fair value of these services, based on a number of factors, to be approximately $5.1 million on an annual\nbasis. We acknowledge that this may not be representative of what ultimately could be the cost to the Company when a\nreplacement Chief Executive Officer is hired.\nF-47\nTable of Contents\nPRICESMART, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)\nNOTE 15 – UNCONSOLIDATED AFFILIATES\nThe Company determines whether any of the joint ventures in which it has made investments is a Variable Interest\nEntity (“VIE”) at the start of each new venture and if a reconsideration event has occurred. At this time, the Company also\nconsiders whether it must consolidate a VIE and/or disclose information about its involvement in a VIE. A reporting entity\nmust consolidate a VIE if that reporting entity has the power to direct the VIE’s activities that most significantly impact the\nVIE’s economic performance and has the obligation to absorb losses of the VIE or the right to receive benefits from the\nVIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE. The reporting entity that consolidates a VIE is called the primary\nbeneficiary of that VIE.\nIn 2008, the Company entered into real estate joint ventures to jointly own and operate separate commercial retail\ncenters adjacent to warehouse clubs in Panama (GolfPark Plaza, S.A.) and Costa Rica (Price Plaza Alajuela PPA, S.A.).\nDue to the initial nature of the joint ventures and the continued commitments for additional financing, the Company\ndetermined these joint ventures are VIEs. Since all rights, obligations and the power to direct the activities of a VIE that\nmost significantly impact the VIE's economic performance is shared equally by both parties within each joint venture, the\nCompany has determined that it is not the primary beneficiary of the VIEs and, therefore, has accounted for these entities\nunder the equity method. Under the equity method, the Company's investments in unconsolidated affiliates are initially\nrecorded as an investment in the stock of an investee at cost and are adjusted for the carrying amount of the investment to\nrecognize the investor's share of the earnings or losses of the investee after the date of the initial investment. In the fourth\nquarter of fiscal year 2024, the Company dissolved its joint venture with Price Plaza Alajuela PPA, S.A in order to exert\ncontrol over property tied to its adjacent warehouse club. As a result of this dissolution, the Company recognized a loss of\napproximately $80,000 in Other income (expense) on the consolidated statements of income for the quarter ended August\n31, 2024. The Company used a market-based valuation model to determine the fair value of the two plots of land received\nat $1.9 million and an income-based valuation model to determine the fair value of the building received at $1.3 million.\nThe Company also received cash and other assets of approximately $490,000.\nOn December 12, 2013, the Company entered into a lease agreement for approximately 17,976 square feet (1,670\nsquare meters) of land with Golf Park Plaza, S.A. upon which the Company constructed its central offices in Panama.\nConstruction of the offices was completed in October 2014. The lease term is for 15 years with three options to renew for\nfive years each at the Company's discretion. On July 14, 2017, the Company entered into a lease agreement for\napproximately 2,992 square feet (278 square meters) of a building with Golf Park Plaza, S.A. for warehouse storage space.\nThe agreement was recently renewed for an additional five years during fiscal year 2022. Combined, the Company\nrecognized $140,000 in rent expense for each of the fiscal years ended August 31, 2024, and August 31, 2023, and\n$149,000 in rent expense for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2022.\nThe table below summarizes the Company’s interest in these VIEs and the Company’s maximum exposure to loss\nas a result of its involvement with these VIEs as of August 31, 2024 (in thousands):\nCompany's͏\nNet Income Company’s Commitment͏ Maximum͏\n(Loss) Dissolution Variable to Future Exposure͏\n% Initial Additional Inception to of Joint Interest Additional to Loss in\nEntity Ownership Investment Investments Date Venture(1) in Entity Investments(2) Entity(3)\nGolfPark\nPlaza, S.A. 50 % $ 4,616 $ 2,402 $ (136) $ — $ 6,882 $ 99 $ 6,981\nPrice Plaza\nAlajuela\nPPA, S.A. — % 2,193 1,236 234 (3,663) — — —\nTotal $ 6,809 $ 3,638 $ 98 $ (3,663) $ 6,882 $ 99 $ 6,981\n(1) In the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2024, the Company dissolved its joint venture with Price Plaza Alajuela PPA, S.A.\n(2) The parties intend to seek alternate financing for the project, which could reduce the amount of investments each party would be\nrequired to provide.

In addition, the Company operates distribution centers and corporate offices in the United States. The Company\nhas aggregated its warehouse clubs, distribution centers and corporate offices into reportable segments. The Company’s\nreportable segments are based on management’s organization of these locations into operating segments by general\ngeographic location, which are used by management in setting up management lines of responsibility, providing support\nservices, and making operational decisions and assessments of financial performance. Segment amounts are presented after\nconverting to U.S. dollars and consolidating eliminations. Certain revenues, operating costs and inter-company charges\nincluded in the United States segment are not allocated to the segments within this presentation, as it is impractical to do\nso, and they appear as reconciling items to reflect the amount eliminated on consolidation of intersegment transactions.\nFrom time to time, the Company revises the measurement of each segment's operating income and net income, including\ncertain corporate overhead allocations, and other measures as determined by the information regularly reviewed by\nmanagement. When the Company does so, the previous period amounts and balances are reclassified to conform to the\ncurrent period's presentation.\nF-49\nTable of Contents\nPRICESMART, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED

Generally, a non-GAAP financial measure is a numerical measure of\na company’s performance, financial position or cash flows that either excludes or includes amounts that are not normally\nexcluded or included in the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP. These\nmeasures are customary for our industry and commonly used by competitors. However, these non-GAAP financial\nmeasures should not be reviewed in isolation or considered as an alternative to any other performance measure derived in\naccordance with GAAP and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies in our industry or\nacross different industries.\nAdjusted net income and adjusted net income per diluted share are important measures used by management to\ncompare the performance of our core operations between periods. We define adjusted net income as net income, as\nreported, adjusted for: separation costs associated with the departure of our former Chief Executive Officer, the write-off of\ncertain Aeropost receivables, the write-off of certain VAT receivables following unfavorable court rulings, impairment\ncharges primarily related to the write down of assets in connection with our decision in the fourth quarter of fiscal year\n2023 to seek to sell our Trinidad sustainable packaging plant, the gain on the acquisition of a building, and the tax impact\nof the foregoing adjustments on net income. We define adjusted net income per diluted share as adjusted net income\ndivided by the weighted-average diluted shares outstanding.\nWe believe adjusted net income and adjusted net income per diluted share are useful metrics to investors and\nanalysts because they present more accurate year-over-year comparisons for our net income and net income per diluted\nshare because adjusted items are not the result of our normal operations. We note that no adjustments to net income or net\nincome per diluted share have been made for the three-month and twelve-month periods ended August 31, 2024.\nThe following table shows the Company’s reconciliation of net income to adjusted net income and adjusted net\nincome per diluted share for the periods indicated:\nThree Months Ended Years Ended\n(Amounts in thousands, except per share August 31, August 31, August 31, August 31,\ndata) 2024 2023 2024 2023\nNet income as reported $ 29,068 $ 15,381 $ 138,875 $ 109,205\nAdjustments:\nSeparation costs associated with Chief\nExecutive Officer departure (1) — — — 7,747\nAeropost-related write-offs (2) — — — 2,786\nVAT receivable write-off (3) — — — 2,309\nAsset impairment and closure costs (4) — 5,658 — 5,658\nGain on acquisition of building (5) — (948) — (948)\nTax impact of adjustments to net income (6) — 266 — (284)\nAdjusted net income $ 29,068 $ 20,357 $ 138,875 $ 126,473\nNet income per diluted share $ 0.94 $ 0.49 $ 4.57 $ 3.50\nSeparation costs associated with Chief\nExecutive Officer departure — — — 0.23\nAeropost-related write-offs — — — 0.09\nVAT receivable write-off — — — 0.08\nAsset impairment and closure costs — 0.18 — 0.18\nGain on acquisition of building — (0.02) — (0.02)\nAdjusted net income per diluted share $ 0.94 $ 0.65 $ 4.57 $ 4.06\n(1) Reflects $7.7 million of separation costs associated with the departure of our former Chief Executive Officer in February 2023.\n(2) Reflects $2.1 million of Aeropost-related write-offs in the first quarter of fiscal year 2023 and $660,000 of a receivable written-off\nin connection with the settlement in the third quarter of fiscal year 2023 of a claim for indemnification from the buyer of the\nAeropost business.\n(3) Reflects $2.3 million of VAT receivables deemed not recoverable and written-off in the third quarter of fiscal year 2023 following\nunfavorable court rulings.\n(4) Reflects $5.7 million of impairment charges primarily related to the write down of assets in connection with our decision in the\nfourth quarter of fiscal year 2023 to seek to sell our Trinidad sustainable packaging plant.\n(5) Reflects a $950,000 gain related to a building we acquired upon the early termination of a lease in which we were the lessor of the\nland on which the building was constructed by and abandoned by one of our tenants.\n(6) Reflects the tax effect of the above-mentioned adjustments.\nAdjusted EBITDA\nAdjusted EBITDA is defined as net income before interest expense, net, provision for income taxes and\ndepreciation and amortization, adjusted for the impact of certain other items, including interest income; other income\n(expense), net; separation costs associated with Chief Executive Officer departure; asset impairment and closure costs;\nAeropost write-offs; and the write-off of certain VAT receivables following unfavorable court rulings.

This line item includes a gain of $950,000 associated with the acquisition of a building upon a lease termination in the\nfourth quarter of fiscal year 2023.\n(2) Reflects $7.7 million of separation costs associated with the departure of our former Chief Executive Officer in February 2023.\n(3) Reflects $2.1 million of Aeropost-related write-offs in the first quarter of fiscal year 2023 and $660,000 of a receivable written-off\nin connection with the settlement in the third quarter of fiscal year 2023 of a claim for indemnification from the buyer of the\nAeropost business.\n(4) Reflects $2.3 million of VAT receivables related to prior periods deemed not recoverable and written-off in the third quarter of\nfiscal year 2023 following unfavorable court rulings.\n(5) Reflects $5.7 million of impairment charges primarily related to the write down of assets in connection with our decision in the\nfourth quarter of fiscal year 2023 to seek to sell our Trinidad sustainable packaging plant.\nNet Merchandise Sales - Constant Currency and Comparable Net Merchandise Sales – Constant Currency\nAs a multinational enterprise, we are exposed to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. The translation of the\noperations of our foreign-based entities from their local currencies into U.S. dollars is sensitive to changes in foreign\ncurrency exchange rates and can have a significant impact on our reported financial results. We believe that constant\ncurrency is a useful measure, indicating the actual growth of our operations. When we use the term \"net merchandise sales\n- constant currency,\" it means that we have translated current year net merchandise sales at prior year monthly average\nexchanges rates. Net merchandise sales - constant currency results exclude the effects of foreign currency translation.\nSimilarly, when we use the term \"comparable net merchandise sales - constant currency,\" it means that we have translated\ncurrent year comparable net merchandise sales at prior year monthly average exchanges rates. Comparable net merchandise\nsales - constant currency results exclude the effects of foreign currency translation.\nNet merchandise sales growth rate on a net merchandise sales - constant currency basis is calculated as follows:\nAugust 31, 2024\nThree Months Ended Year Ended\nNet Net\nMerchandise % Growth Merchandise % Growth\n(Amounts in thousands, except % growth) Sales Sales\nNet merchandise sales $ 1,192,658 9.5 % $ 4,783,119 11.2 %\nFavorable impact of foreign currency exchange 2,700 0.2 % 114,121 2.6 %\nNet merchandise sales on a constant-currency basis $ 1,189,958 9.3 % $ 4,668,998 8.6 %\nComparable net merchandise sales growth rate on a net merchandise sales - constant currency basis is calculated\nas follows:\nSeptember 1, 2024\nThirteen Weeks Ended Fifty-Two Weeks Ended\n% Growth % Growth\nComparable net merchandise sales 6.2 % 7.7 %\nFavorable impact of foreign currency exchange 0.2 % 2.5 %\nComparable net merchandise sales on a constant-currency basis 6.0 % 5.2 %"

Now I am pleased to ask Michael to continue with his\npresentation.\nMichael McCleary: Thank you, Robert. We had a strong fourth quarter as net merchandise\nsales reached almost $1.2 billion, and total revenue was over $1.2 billion. Net merchandise\nPriceSmart, Inc.\nQ4 2024 Earnings Release Conference Call\nsales increased by 9.5% or 9.3% in constant currency and comparable net merchandise sales\nincreased by 6.2% or 6.0% in constant currency.\nFor the fiscal year ended August 31, 2024, total net merchandise sales reached almost $4.8\nbillion and total revenues were over $4.9 billion. Net merchandise sales increased by 11.2%, or\n8.6% in constant currency and comparable net merchandise sales increased by 7.7%, or 5.2%\nin constant currency, for the 12-month and 52-week periods, respectively.\nBy segment, in Central America, where we had 30 clubs at quarter end, net merchandise sales\nincreased 9.1% or 7.9% in constant currency, with a 6.1% increase in comparable net\nmerchandise sales, or 4.9% in constant currency. All of our markets in Central America had\npositive comparable net merchandise sales growth. Our Central America segment contributed\napproximately 370 basis points of positive impact to the growth in total consolidated comparable\nnet merchandise sales for the quarter. We opened our sixth warehouse club in Guatemala in\nNovember 2023 and our fourth warehouse club in El Salvador in February 2024.\nIn the Caribbean, where we had 14 clubs at quarter end, net merchandise sales increased\n6.9%, or 9.4% in constant currency and comparable net merchandise sales increased 6.7% or\n9.2% in constant currency. All of our markets in this segment had positive comparable net\nmerchandise sales growth. Our Caribbean region contributed approximately 190 basis points of\npositive impact to the growth in total consolidated comparable net merchandise sales for the\nquarter.\nIn Colombia, where we had 10 clubs open at the end of our fourth quarter, net merchandise\nsales increased 18.7% or 16.8%, in constant currency and comparable net merchandise sales\nincreased 5.4% and or 3.8% in constant currency. Colombia contributed approximately 60 basis\npoints of positive impact to the growth in total consolidated comparable net merchandise sales\nfor the quarter.\nIn terms of merchandise categories, when comparing our fourth quarter sales to the same\nperiod in the prior year, our foods category grew approximately 1%, our non-foods category\nincreased approximately 19%, our food services and bakery categories increased approximately\n17% and our health services including optical, audiology and pharmacy increased\napproximately 36%.\nMembership accounts grew 4.7% versus the prior year to almost 1.9 million accounts. Platinum\nmembership accounts are 12.3% of our total membership base as of August 31, 2024, an\nincrease from 8.9% in the prior year due to an increased focus on this important segment of our\nMembers including through platinum promotional campaigns.\nOur membership income was $19.7 million, an increase of 14.1% over the same period last\nyear due to the increased platinum penetration and a $5 increase in the annual membership fee\nPriceSmart, Inc.\nQ4 2024 Earnings Release Conference Call\nfor all membership types staggered throughout the year in all but one of our markets. At year-\nend, we continued with a strong 12-month renewal rate of 87.9%.\nTotal gross margin for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2024, as a percentage of net\nmerchandise sales increased 10 basis points to 15.7%, versus 15.6% in the fourth quarter of\nfiscal year 2023. The 10 basis point increase was primarily due to general margin improvement\nacross most of our sales categories. In total dollars, total gross margin increased $17.5 million\nor approximately 10.3% versus the same quarter of the prior fiscal year.\nTotal revenue margins increased 20 basis points to 17.3% of total revenue when compared to\nthe same period last year, primarily due to the increase in total gross margin as a percent of net\nmerchandise sales and an increase to other revenues due to an increase in interest earned on\nour co-branded credit cards.\nDuring the quarter, our average sales ticket grew by 2.4% and transactions grew 6.9% versus\nthe same period in the prior year. For the 12-month period, our average ticket grew by 2.4% and\ntransactions grew 8.6% versus the same prior year period. The average price per item\nincreased approximately 3.1% year-over-year, while average items per basket decreased\napproximately 0.7%, compared to the same period of the prior year.\nTotal SG&A expenses decreased to 13.3% of total revenues for the fourth quarter of fiscal year\n2024, compared to 14.2% for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2023, primarily due to two\nsignificant expenses in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2023. As you may recall these 2023\ncharges related to a $9.2 million settlement of a minimum tax dispute and a $5.7 million\nimpairment charge and related closure costs primarily for the write-down of assets of our\nTrinidad sustainable packaging plan.\nGeneral and administrative expenses increased to 3.4% of total revenues for the fourth quarter\nof fiscal year 2024, compared to 3.1% for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2023. The 30 basis\npoint increase is primarily due to investments in technology and an increase in compensation\nexpense from stock grants to executive leadership.\nOperating income for the quarter increased 53.1% from the same period last year to $49.2\nmillion. Operating income for the fiscal year increased 19.7% from the same period last year to\n$22.9 million.\nIn the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2024, we recorded a $7.4 million net loss in total other\nexpense, compared to $1.5 million net loss and total other expense in the same period last year.\nThe increased net loss and total other expense was primarily due to an increase in other\nexpenses of $4.2 million, which was primarily driven by an increase in foreign currency\ntransaction losses due to premiums to convert local currencies into U.S. dollars and unrealized\nPriceSmart, Inc.\nQ4 2024 Earnings Release Conference Call\nlosses in value of U.S. dollar deposits due to appreciation of the Costa Rica colón, as well as a\ndecrease of $1.2 million in interest income, due to lower cash balances.\nOur effective tax rate for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2024 came in at 30.4% versus 49.9% a\nyear ago. The decrease in the effective tax rate is primarily attributable to the non-recurrence of\nthe comparably unfavorable impacts in the prior year of 11.6% due to the AMT settlement and\n5.4% from asset impairment and related closure costs.\nFor fiscal year 2024, the effective tax rate was 31.1% compared to 35.4% for the prior year\nperiod. The decrease in the effective tax rate is primarily driven by the non-recurrence of the\ncomparably unfavorable impact in the prior year of write-offs of VAT receivables, Aeropost write-\noffs and asset impairment and related closure costs of 2.2% and a 1.8% unfavorable impact due\nto the AMT settlement.\nLooking forward, following the implementation of certain tax optimization initiatives, we expect\nour effective tax rate to decrease to between 27% and 29% and in fiscal year 2025.\nNet income for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2024 was $29.1 million or $0.94 per diluted share\ncompared to $15.4 million, or $0.49 per diluted share, in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2023.\nNet income for fiscal year 2024 was $138.9 million or $4.57 per diluted share, compared to\n$109.2 million or $3.50 per diluted share, in the comparable prior year period.\nOur earnings per share for the fourth quarter and full year of fiscal 2023 are inclusive of a\nnegative impact of $0.30 per diluted share for costs related to the reserve for the AMT\nsettlement and $0.18 per diluted share of asset impairment and closure costs. Adjusted net\nincome for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024 was $29.1 million, or an adjusted $0.94 per diluted\nshare, compared to adjusted net income of $20.4 million, or an adjusted $0.65 per diluted share,\nin the comparable prior year period.\nAdjusted EBITDA for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2024 was $70.7 million compared to $57.2\nmillion in the same period last year. Adjusted net income for fiscal year 2024 was $138.9 million,\nor an adjusted $4.57 per diluted share, compared to adjusted net income of $126.5 million, or\nadjusted $4.06 per diluted share in the comparable prior year period. Adjusted EBITDA for fiscal\nyear 2024 was $303.6 million compared to $275.7 million in the same prior year period.\nMoving on to our strong balance sheet, we ended the quarter with cash, cash equivalents and\nrestricted cash totaling $136.3 million in addition to approximately $100.2 million of short-term\ninvestments.\nFrom a cash flow perspective, net cash provided by operating activities totaled $207.6 million for\nfiscal year 2024 compared to $257.3 million for the same prior year period.\nPriceSmart, Inc.\nQ4 2024 Earnings Release Conference Call\nShifts in working capital generated from changes in our merchandise inventory and accounts\npayable positions contributed $58.0 million to the overall decrease along with an increase in\nvarious other operating assets, net of changes in liabilities. Average inventory per club\nincreased by approximately $550,000 or 5.9% and inventory days on hand increased by\napproximately two days or 4.5% for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2024 and versus the same\nperiod in 2023. The increase of inventory per club and days on hand is primarily due to a shift in\nour inventory mix towards more non-food items, which have longer lead times.\nNet cash used in investing activities decreased by $46.6 million for fiscal year 2024 compared to\nthe prior year, primarily due to a $71.4 million net increase in proceeds from settlements of\nshort-term investments. This was partially offset by a $26.0 million increase in property and\nequipment expenditures to support growth of our real estate footprint, compared to the same\nperiod a year ago. We opened three additional clubs during fiscal year 2024.\nNet cash used in financing activities during fiscal 2024 increased by $109.0 million, primarily\nfrom the result of the share repurchase program we completed during the first quarter, a special\n$1.00 dividend payment in April 2024, and lower proceeds, net of repayments, from long-term\nbank borrowings compared to the same period a year ago.\nWhen reviewing our cash balances, it is important to note that as of August 31, 2024, we had\n$82.5 million of cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments denominated in local\ncurrency in Trinidad and Honduras, which we could not readily convert into U.S. dollars.\nNow on to our growth drivers: starting with real estate. We have purchased land and plan to\nopen our ninth warehouse club in Costa Rica, located in Cartago, approximately 10 miles east\nfrom the nearest club in the Greater San Jose metropolitan area. This club will be built on a 6-\nacre property and is anticipated to open in the spring of 2025.\nAdditionally, we expect to formalize a land lease this quarter and build our seventh warehouse\nclub in Guatemala located in Quetzaltenango, approximately 122 miles west from the nearest\nclub in the capital of Guatemala City. This club will be built on a 4-acre property and is\nanticipated to open in the summer of 2025. Once these two new clubs are open, we will operate\n56 warehouse clubs in total.\nAdditionally, we are currently remodeling several of our high-volume clubs, which were in San\nPedro Sula, Honduras and Santiago, Dominican Republic; as well as expanding our clubs in\nSan Salvador, El Salvador and Portmore, Jamaica.\nIn the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2024, we completed the remodel of our warehouse club in\nPort of Spain, Trinidad and Tobago and the expansion of our warehouse club in Liberia, Costa\nRica.\nPriceSmart, Inc.\nQ4 2024 Earnings Release Conference Call\nFinally, we continue to seek ways to improve our distribution infrastructure to better serve our\nMembers. We are enhancing our distribution and logistics network through the expected\nopening of distribution centers in China and in each of our multi-club markets, either operated\nby PriceSmart or through the use of third-party logistics providers. We expect to reduce lending\ncost and lead times via direct shipments from Asia to our local markets while also improving our\nworking capital.\nIn addition to our regional distribution center in Costa Rica, we have a PriceSmart-operated\ndistribution center in Panama for dry merchandise, which we are currently in the process of\nexpanding to include cold merchandise.\nWe are also in various stages of development and implementation of PriceSmart operated\ndistribution centers in markets such as Guatemala, Trinidad and the Dominican Republic.\nTurning now to membership value.\nAs we've highlighted in previous calls, our Private Label Members’ Selection brand continues to\nbe a significant area of focus based on the good value it brings to our Members. We offer\nprivate-label food, household products, and apparel under our Member’s Selection brand across\nall markets. During fiscal year 2024, our private-label sales represented 27.6% of our total\nmerchandise sales. That's up 130 basis points from 26.3% in the comparable period of fiscal\nyear 2023.\nWe also continue to focus on health services. We currently have 53 locations with optical\ncenters, as well as pharmacy centers in all eight of our warehouse clubs in Costa Rica, five\nwarehouse clubs in Panama and one in Guatemala. By the end of fiscal 2025, we expect to\nhave pharmacies in substantially all clubs in Costa Rica, Panama and Guatemala. We also\ncurrently have 29 audiology centers open.\nOur optical program provides four free eye exams with every membership, and we performed\nalmost 17,000 eye exams during the quarter. Optical services are also an important component\nof our contributions to the communities in which our clubs are located.\nIn partnership with Price Philanthropies’ Aprender y Crecer Vision program, PriceSmart\noptometrists perform free eye exams for children and the charity provides free lenses and\nframes.\nA PriceSmart membership provides access to high-quality products at low prices and\ncomplementary services, all under one roof. Memberships are for personal use of the main and\nsecondary cardholders and are not meant to be shared. We are working towards ensuring that\nour Members are not sharing their memberships with non-Members.\nPriceSmart, Inc.\nQ4 2024 Earnings Release Conference Call\nOur third growth driver is providing omni-channel shopping options for our Members, including\nsales via our app and/or our desktop website, as well as enhancing our technological\ncapabilities. We currently utilize PriceDmart.com, our app and other third-party last mile delivery\nservices to drive online sales. During the fourth quarter, total net merchandise sales through\ndigital channels increased 21.0% versus the same period in the prior year and represented\n$65.1 million or 5.5% of total net merchandise sales. Total orders placed directly on\nPriceSmart.com and our app increased 19.1% and the average transaction value increased\n0.9% versus the prior year period.\nDuring fiscal year 2024, we completed a country-by-country rollout of our new PriceSmart.com\nwebsite, as well as mobile applications on both Android and iOS devices, to complement our in-\nclub shopping. These new platforms will allow us to better tailor delivery zones and services for\nour Members, update inventory availability more quickly, improve product discovery and reduce\nfriction in the shopping experience.\nAs of August 31, 2024, approximately 61.3% of our Members had created an online profile with\nPriceSmart.com and 28.5% of our total membership base has made a purchase on\nPriceSmart.com or our app. We believe that there are significant growth opportunities in our\ndigital channel, and we will continue to invest in this part of our business to provide an\nenhanced omni-channel experience and additional value to our Members.\nWe are also continually improving the digital experience for our employees by finding ways to\ndeploy technology that improves efficiency. One example of these efforts is RELEX, which will\nmodernize our ordinary and inventory management. We started this project in 2023 and expect\nit to be completed by the end of fiscal 2025. As a result of this implementation, we anticipate\nimproved sales and efficiencies due to enhanced in-stock positions, diminished spoilage, and\nstreamlined inventory flow. Additionally, in the first quarter of fiscal year 2025, we began\nimplementation of a new point-of-sale system, Elera, a Toshiba product, in one of our countries.\nShifting now to our ESR activities.\nDuring the year, we released our comprehensive environmental and social responsibility report\nfor fiscal year 2023. This report showcases our commitment to environmental and social\nresponsibility. The full ESR report is available on our Investor Relations website at\ninvestors.pricesmart.com, under the ESG tab.\nEnvironmental and social responsibility continues to be an important component of how we\napproach our business and add value to the membership. We do our best to incorporate\npractices that use natural resources responsibly. Just to give a quick update, we currently have\nseven recycling centers open, with two in El Salvador, three in Honduras and two in Guatemala.\nEach location collects an average of 30,000 pounds of recycled material monthly. with the\nTegucigalpa, Honduras location collecting around 50,000 pounds per month. Looking ahead, we\nPriceSmart, Inc.\nQ4 2024 Earnings Release Conference Call\nplan to expand this successful program by opening four additional recycling centers in the\nDominican Republic during fiscal year 2025.\nIn response to Hurricane Beryl in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2024, PriceSmart and the\nPriceSmart Foundation, swiftly mobilized to support affected communities in Barbados and\nJamaica. We collected 57 kilos of food and 551 kilos of non-food items in the U.S. alongside 91\nkilos of food and 30 kilos of essential goods in Jamaica. Additionally, the PriceSmart Foundation\ndonated $15,000 to Global Empowerment Mission for the purchase of generators and repair\nmaterials, and $10,000 to Young Women/Men of Purpose, a Jamaican nonprofit, for aid\npackages. In Barbados, we gathered 210 kilos of food to support those in need.\nYou can find more information about PriceSmart's philanthropic and corporate social\nresponsibility efforts on PriceSmart.org.\nWe believe that all of our efforts to enhance our membership value and our community efforts\nhave also resonated with our employees, as we are excited to announce that we were ranked in\nthe top five retailers to be employed by in Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador by Tecoloco.\nTecoloco is an operator of a recruitment website in Central America.\nLooking forward a little into our current first quarter, our comparable net merchandise sales for\nthe eight weeks ended October 27, 2024, were up 5.6% in U.S. dollars and 5.7% in constant\ncurrency.\nIn closing, it was a great result for our fourth quarter and fiscal year. We are proud to continue\nseeking to make shopping easier, more efficient and more rewarding for our Members. We are\nexcited about the many initiatives we have underway, especially on the technology front, to\nmake our procurement, logistics and other front and back-office processes more efficient and\nare looking forward to an exciting fiscal year 2025.\nThank you for joining our call today. I will now turn the call over to the operator to take your\nquestions. Operator, you may now start taking our callers' questions. Thank you.\nOperator: (Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from the line of Jon Braatz of\nKansas City Capital.\nJon Braatz: Michael, could you talk a little bit more about -- I think you referenced the tax\noptimization program that you're looking at for 2025 and a lower tax rate. What's behind that?\nMichael McCleary: John, yes, I mean as you know kind of the basis of our business model is to\nalways be looking to reduce costs and deliver as much of that benefit on to the Members we\ncan.\nPriceSmart, Inc.\nQ4 2024 Earnings Release Conference Call\nSo as our model evolves, we continue to adapt to changes in, for instance, the investment in\ntechnology and how we do that and how we ensure we're sharing the cost of that with the\noperating subsidiaries and as a result of those efforts together working with our tax advisers.\nWe feel that we can reduce our taxes fairly significantly in this coming year.\nRobert Price: Let me add something to that. So we knew this question would come up, so it's\nnot a surprise.\nAnd Michael and I talked about how to properly respond. First of all, we think we've come up\nwith something that's going to be much better in terms of tax planning than what we had.\nBut one of the things that I think is important to be aware of, and I don't -- I assume this is\ndisclosed. The nature of our business is that we do generate a substantial amount of tax --\nusable tax credits from our countries, and we have not been as thoughtful or as creative in how\nto use the income from the United States, and there is a lot of income that we get in the United\nStates Corporation to offset or to take advantage of those tax credits. And so part of what we've\ncome up with is a better approach to using these tax credits against U.S. profits, which\neffectively saves us taxes.\nAnd in fact, we're recapturing a portion of taxes.\nSo I guess you could say, well why didn't we do this before, and we should have probably -- but\nthe nature of -- you're constantly thinking about your business and how to improve it. And I think\nthis is something that we feel can be very beneficial to our business and continue to improve our\nsales by having lower prices and also our profitability.\nJon Braatz: Okay. So would it be fair to say, and I know this is part of your strategy, would it be\nfair to say that the benefits that you get from these tax savings will not necessarily flow to the\nbottom line because you're going to invest those tax savings into lower prices.\nRobert Price: That was the second question we knew you'd ask. So I think our answer is that we\nwill take some and leave some.\nJon Braatz: All right. Do you know my third question?\nRobert Price: Now you're putting me on the spot.\nJon Braatz: The other question I have is, I noticed in the 10-K that -- and it's not a big deal, but\nyour export business to the Philippines has been discontinued and there's some export\nbusiness, I think, to the Bahamas or something like that. And I guess my question is what\nhappened to the Philippines business? And will new business replace the Philippine business?\nPriceSmart, Inc.\nQ4 2024 Earnings Release Conference Call\nAnd is there an opportunity to go beyond just, I think, again, I think it was a Bahamas, but is\nthere an opportunity to go beyond that?\nRobert Price: Okay. So the Philippines, which -- that's S&R, which, by the way, used to be\nPriceSmart, but then when we got out of there, you know the history. They've gotten big. And\nbasically, they can buy direct and have decided that our pricing doesn't benefit them, I guess.\nSo they're on their own way. As far as the export business, other than -- I don't know why the\nBahamas is focused on specifically. Do you? Because we already have one some transactions\ngoing on so far.\nJon Braatz: I thought maybe that was mentioned in the 10-K, and I may have that country right?\nMaybe.\nRobert Price: No. I think it is. I'm surprised that it's the only one mentioned because we do have\nother countries. We've decided to focus in the Hemisphere and not Western Hemisphere not go\noutside of this area for the time being.\nBut we think there's opportunity. I don't know that we can tell you how that will compare with\nwhat's been going on with the Philippines. But I do think there's good opportunity.\nAnd we have set up a group of people who are working specifically on exports. And the benefit\nof the exports, of course, there's another opportunity to increase profits in the United States that\nare basically can be used because they're foreign source income to -- against these credits that\nwe have so that effectively, we don't pay taxes on those -- I mean we can neutralize the tax hit.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Hector Maya.\nHector Maya: Robert, Michael.\nI just have a couple. The first one is, if you could please give us an update on how the\nconsumer environment has continued to evolve in Colombia. I mean you can share the trends\nthat you have seen by category particularly related to private label.\nRobert Price: I can address that somewhat. I mean our -- I think our acceptance in the\nColombia market continues to grow. I think we're very well thought of in that market. The\nconsumer environment in the last couple of weeks may -- the peso has weakened against the\ndollar. And that generally is not good for our -- the products we export to Colombia.\nBut the sales are -- have been good. And I don't know generally that I can tell you about the\noverall consumer environment in Colombia, but our situation, I think we continue to be well\nthought of and continue to grow.\nPriceSmart, Inc.\nQ4 2024 Earnings Release Conference Call\nHector Maya: I understand. And also out of your business regions or ongoing projects, what\nwould you say that makes you most excited about 2025. That's a good question. I think the --\nthere are a lot of things that are very positive.\nRobert Price: There are a lot of things that are positive. I think we start with technology. We\nhave a number of initiatives that really are going to benefit our business.\nWe mentioned RELEX, but we also now are in the middle of implementation of a new point-of-\nsale system. And so our investment in technology, which I think was not where it needed to be\nin the past, we're catching up. And I think that's a very positive sign for the future.\nI think the fact that we are -- we've done quite a few remodels and expanding our buildings that\nwill be completed by the end of calendar '24 are very positive for the business.\nI'm excited about the improvement we've made in non-food buying and merchandising, which,\nof course, most of that is product we export to our countries.\nI'm also excited about our distribution center initiatives because I think having been here in this\nbusiness since the day one, distribution has always been a key to this business because we\nreally have the benefit of getting lower prices because of the efficiencies of how we distribute\nour products. And I think these in-country distribution centers in our major markets have the\nbenefit both of allowing us to bring product in net landed cost will be lower and also improve\noperating efficiencies within the country. And that is a very positive benefit going forward for us\nto be able to continue to bring better values to our Members. And those are some of the things\nthat I think are pretty positive.\nI also am very positive about our senior management team in terms of the people who we have\nhere but also some new people we brought in. We just brought in a person who's going to focus\non government relations in our countries, I think this individual can be very helpful to us. So I\nthink overall, assuming the world stays in reasonable shape, I think we're okay.\nOperator: There are no further questions at this time. I'd now like to turn the call back over to\nMichael for final closing remarks. Please go ahead.\nMichael McCleary: Okay. Thank you, everybody. That wraps up our call for today. We hope you\nall have a good day. And for those who celebrate the Halloween, a Happy Halloween. Thank\nyou. Take care.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes your conference call for today. We thank you\nfor participating and ask that you please disconnect your lines."
