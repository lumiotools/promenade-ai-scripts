Adjusted EBITDA is defined as EBITDA (defined as earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) adjusted for stock-based compensation, restructuring and other charges and non-routine legal settlements. Both EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are considered non-GAAP financial measures. Generally, a non-GAAP financial measure is a numerical measure of a company’s performance, financial position, or cash flows that either includes or excludes amounts that are not normally included or excluded in the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP. We believe that EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA provide helpful information with respect to our operating performance including our ability to fund our future capital expenditures and working capital requirements. Adjusted EBITDA also provides helpful information as it is the primary measure used in certain financial covenants contained in our credit agreement. When analyzing our operating performance, investors should use EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA in addition to, and not as alternatives for Net income or any other performance measure presented in accordance with GAAP. Our non-GAAP financial measures may not be comparable to other similar titled measures of other companies.\n\n​\n\n​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​  \n---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \n​| ​| **Three Months Ended September 30,**|  ​| **LTM Ended September 30,**(1)  \n_(amounts in thousands)_|  ​| **2024**|  ​| **2023**|  ​| **% Change**|  ​| **2024**|  ​| **2023**|  ​| **% Change**  \n**Net income**|  ​| $|  27,059| ​| $|  25,598| ​|  6| %| ​| $|  90,152| ​| $|  78,316| ​|  15| %  \nDepreciation and amortization| ​| ​|  3,279| ​| ​|  3,289| ​|  (0)| ​| ​| ​|  13,016| ​| ​|  12,434| ​|  5| ​  \nIncome tax expense| ​| ​|  9,519| ​| ​|  9,112| ​|  4| ​| ​| ​|  32,081| ​| ​|  27,414| ​|  17| ​  \nInterest income| ​| ​|  (4,888)| ​| ​|  (2,689)| ​|  82| ​| ​| ​|  (18,230)| ​| ​|  (6,638)| ​|  175| ​  \nInterest expense| ​| ​|  51| ​| ​|  1| ​|  5,000| ​| ​| ​|  64| ​| ​|  27| ​|  137| ​  \n**EBITDA**|  ​| ​|  35,020| ​| ​|  35,311| ​|  (1)| ​| ​| ​|  117,083| ​| ​|  111,553| ​|  5| ​  \nRestructuring and other charges (2)| ​| ​|  —| ​| ​|  44| ​|  (100)| ​| ​| ​|  415| ​| ​|  2,687| ​|  (85)| ​  \nLegal settlement (3)| ​| ​|  (1,700)| ​| ​|  —| ​|  100| ​| ​| ​|  (1,700)| ​| ​|  —| ​|  100| ​  \nStock-based compensation| ​| ​|  1,999| ​| ​|  1,789| ​|  12| ​| ​| ​|  7,793| ​| ​|  7,028| ​|  11| ​  \n**Adjusted EBITDA**|  ​| $|  35,319| ​| $|  37,144| ​|  (5)| %| ​| $|  123,591| ​| $|  121,268| ​|  2| %  \n  \n​\n\n(1)| LTM: Last twelve months  \n---|---  \n(2)| Restructuring and other charges in 2024 and 2023 consisted of severance and other charges related to internal restructuring activities.  \n---|---  \n(3)| The Company recorded $1.7 million of income in other income as a result of a legal settlement received.  \n---|---  \n  \n**ADJUSTED NET INCOME AND ADJUSTED DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE**\n\n​\n\nA reconciliation from Net Income to Adjusted Net Income is detailed below.

Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Diluted Earnings Per Share are considered non-GAAP financial measures (see note above in EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA for a description of non-GAAP financial measures). The Company believes that Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Diluted Earnings per Share provide helpful information with respect to the Company's operating performance. When analyzing our operating performance, investors should use Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Diluted Earnings per Share in addition to, and not as alternatives for Net income and Diluted Earnings per Share or any other performance measure presented in accordance with GAAP. Our non-GAAP financial measures may not be comparable to other similar titled measures of other companies.\n\n​\n\n​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​  \n---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \n​| ​| **Three Months Ended September 30,**|  ​| **Nine Months Ended September 30,**  \n_(amounts in thousands, except per share data)_|  ​| **2024**|  ​| **2023**|  ​| **% Change**|  ​| **2024**|  ​| **2023**|  ​| **% Change**  \n**Net income**|  ​| $|  27,059| ​| $|  25,598| ​|  6| %| ​| $|  66,374| ​| $|  59,493| ​|  12| %  \nRestructuring and other charges (1)| ​| ​|  —| ​| ​|  44| ​|  (100)| ​| ​| ​|  415| ​| ​|  2,687| ​|  (85)| ​  \nLegal settlement (2)| ​| ​|  (1,700)| ​| ​|  —| ​|  100| ​| ​| ​|  (1,700)| ​| ​|  —| ​|  100| ​  \nTax benefit| ​| ​|  442| ​| ​|  (12)| ​|  (3,783)| ​| ​| ​|  339| ​| ​|  (715)| ​|  (147)| ​  \n**Adjusted Net Income**|  ​| $|  25,801| ​| $|  25,630| ​|  1| %| ​| $|  65,428| ​| $|  61,465| ​|  6| %  \nDiluted shares| ​| ​|  26,501| ​| ​|  26,434| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​|  26,518| ​| ​|  26,406| ​| ​| ​  \n**Diluted Earnings per Share**|  ​| $|  1.02| ​| $|  0.97| ​|  5| %| ​| $|  2.50| ​| $|  2.25| ​|  11| %  \n**Adjusted Diluted Earnings per Share**|  ​| $|  0.97| ​| $|  0.97| ​|  0| %| ​| $|  2.47| ​| $|  2.33| ​|  6| %  \n  \n​\n\n(1)| Restructuring and other charges in 2024 and 2023 consisted of severance and other charges related to internal restructuring activities.  \n---|---  \n(2)| The Company recorded $1.7 million of income in other income as a result of a legal settlement received.  \n---|---\n"

AND SUBSIDIARIES**\n\n**PART I―FINANCIAL INFORMATION**\n\n**Item 1―Financial Statements**\n\n**NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENT****S**\n\n(amounts in thousands, except per share data)\n\n**Note 1–****Basis of Presentation**\n\n​\n\nThe accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements of PC Connection, Inc. and its subsidiaries, or the Company, have been prepared pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC, regarding interim financial reporting and in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, or U.S. GAAP. Such principles were applied on a basis consistent with the accounting policies described in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, filed with the SEC. The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements contained in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.\n\n​\n\nIn the opinion of management, the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements contain all adjustments (consisting only of normal recurring adjustments) necessary for a fair presentation of the results of operations for the interim periods reported and of the Company’s financial condition as of the date of the interim balance sheet. The Company considers events or transactions that occur after the balance sheet date but before the financial statements are issued to provide additional evidence relative to certain estimates or to identify matters that require additional disclosure. Subsequent events have been evaluated through the date of issuance of these financial statements. The operating results for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 may not be indicative of the results expected for any succeeding quarter or the entire year ending December 31, 2024.\n\n​\n\nUse of Estimates in the Preparation of Financial Statements\n\n​\n\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions. These estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts and disclosures of assets and liabilities and the reported amounts and disclosures of revenue and expenses during the period. Management bases its estimates and judgments on the information available at the time and various other assumptions believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. By nature, estimates are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty. Actual results could differ from those estimates and assumptions.\n\n​\n\nCash and Cash Equivalents and Investments\n\n​\n\nThe Company considers all highly liquid short-term investments with original maturities of 90 days or less to be cash equivalents. The carrying value of the Company’s cash equivalents approximates fair value. Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.\n\n​\n\nAt the time of purchase, the Company determines the appropriate classification of investments based upon its intent with regard to such investments. All of the Company’s investments are classified as available-for-sale. The Company classifies investments as short-term when their remaining contractual maturities are one year or less from the balance sheet date, and as long-term when the investment has a remaining contractual maturity of more than one year from the balance sheet date. The Company records investments at fair value with unrealized gains and losses recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income on the condensed consolidated balance sheets.\n\n​\n\nIncluded in interest income, net on the condensed consolidated statements of income is interest income on cash equivalents and short-term investments of $4,840 and $14,060 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, and $2,684 and $5,866 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively.\n\n​\n\n6\n\n[Table of Contents](#Toc)\n\nTreasury Stock, at Cost\n\n​\n\nThe total repurchases for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were recorded as treasury stock of $7,723 and $5,446, respectively. Such costs reflect the applicable one percent excise tax imposed by the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 on the net value of certain stock repurchases made after December 31, 2022.\n\n​\n\nRestructuring and Other Charges\n\n​\n\nThe restructuring and other charges recorded for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were primarily related to an involuntary reduction in the Company’s headquarter workforce and included cash severance and other related termination benefits. No amounts related to these costs are included in accrued expenses and other liabilities as all such amounts have been paid as of September 30, 2024.\n\n​\n\nRestructuring and other charges are presented separately from selling, general and administrative expenses.

This ASU is effective for the Company’s annual reporting periods beginning January 1, 2024, and for interim reporting periods beginning January 1, 2025, with early adoption permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of this standard on its consolidated financial statement disclosures.\n\n​\n\nIn December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09, _Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures._ This guidance is intended to improve the transparency of income tax disclosures through, among other things, enhancement of the disclosure requirements within the rate reconciliation, as well as increased income tax disaggregation disclosures. This ASU is effective for the Company’s annual reporting periods beginning January 1, 2025, with early adoption permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of this standard on its consolidated financial statement disclosures.\n\n​\n\n**Note 2–Revenue**\n\n​\n\nThe Company disaggregates

Diluted earnings per share is computed using the weighted average number of shares outstanding adjusted for the incremental shares attributable to non-vested stock units and stock options outstanding, if dilutive.\n\n​\n\nThe following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted earnings per share for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 (in thousands, except per share data):\n\n​\n\n​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​  \n---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \n​| ​| **Three Months Ended September 30,**|  ​| **Nine Months Ended September 30,**|  ​  \n​| **2024**| **2023**| **2024**| **2023**  \nNumerator:| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​  \nNet income| ​| $|  27,059| ​| $|  25,598| ​| $|  66,374| ​| $|  59,493| ​  \nDenominator:| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​  \nDenominator for basic earnings per share| ​|  26,292| ​|  26,262| ​|  26,334| ​|  26,281| ​  \nDilutive effect of employee stock awards | ​|  209| ​|  172| ​|  184| ​|  125| ​  \nDenominator for diluted earnings per share| ​|  26,501| ​|  26,434| ​|  26,518| ​|  26,406| ​  \nEarnings per share:| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​  \nBasic| ​| $|  1.03| ​| $|  0.97| ​| $|  2.52| ​| $|  2.26| ​  \nDiluted| ​| $|  1.02| ​| $|  0.97| ​| $|  2.50| ​| $|  2.25| ​  \n  \n​\n\nFor the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company had no outstanding non-vested stock units that were excluded from the computation of diluted earnings per share because including them would have had an anti-dilutive effect.\n\n​\n\n10\n\n[Table of Contents](#Toc)\n\n**Note 5****–****Leases**\n\n​\n\nThe Company leases certain facilities from a related party, which is a company affiliated with it through common ownership.\n\n​\n\nAs of September 30, 2024, there were no additional significant operating leases that have not yet commenced.

The Company’s CODM is its Chief Executive Officer, and he evaluates operations and allocates resources based on a measure of operating income.\n\n​\n\nThe Company’s operations are organized under three segments—the Enterprise Solutions segment, which serves primarily medium-to-large corporations; the Business Solutions segment, which serves primarily small- to medium-sized businesses; and the Public Sector Solutions segment, which serves primarily federal, state, and local government and educational institutions. In addition, the Headquarters/Other group provides services in areas such as finance, human resources, information technology, or IT, marketing, and product management. Most of the operating costs associated with the Headquarters/Other group functions are charged to the operating segments based on their estimated usage of the underlying functions. The Company reports these charges to the operating segments as “Allocations”. Certain headquarters costs relating to executive oversight and other fiduciary functions that are not allocated to the operating segments are included under the heading of Headquarters/Other in the tables below.\n\n​\n\n12\n\n[Table of Contents](#Toc)\n\nNet sales presented below exclude inter-segment product revenues.

Additional liabilities for these and other audits could be assessed, but such outcomes are not expected to have a material, adverse impact on the Company’s financial position, results of operations, and/or cash flows.\n\n​\n\n**Note 9–Bank Borrowings**\n\n​\n\nThe Company has a $50,000 credit facility collateralized by its account receivables that expires March 31, 2025. This facility can be increased, at the Company’s option, to $80,000 for permitted acquisitions or other uses authorized by the lender on substantially the same terms. Amounts outstanding under this facility bear interest at the daily Bloomberg Short-Term Bank Yield Index, or BSBY Rate, plus a spread based on the Company’s funded debt ratio, or in the absence of BSBY Rate, the prime rate (8.00% at September 30, 2024). The credit facility includes various customary financial ratios and operating covenants, including minimum net worth and maximum funded debt ratio requirements, and default acceleration provisions. The credit facility does not include restrictions on future dividend payments. Funded debt ratio is the ratio of average outstanding advances under the credit facility for a given quarter to consolidated trailing twelve months Adjusted Earnings Before Interest Expense, Taxes, Depreciation, Amortization, and Special Charges, or Adjusted EBITDA. The maximum allowable funded debt ratio under the agreement is 2.0 to 1.0. Decreases in the Company’s consolidated trailing twelve months Adjusted EBITDA could limit its potential borrowing capacity under the credit facility. As of September 30, 2024, the Company was in compliance with all financial covenants contained in the agreement governing the credit facility.\n\n​\n\nCash receipts are automatically applied against any outstanding borrowings. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company borrowed incremental amounts that were each repaid in full. These borrowings for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 totaled $25,204 and $70,877, respectively; however, at no time were the outstanding borrowings greater than the $50,000 limit under the credit facility. The Company had no outstanding borrowings under the credit facility as of September 30, 2024 or 2023, and accordingly, the entire $50,000 credit facility was available for borrowings on such date.\n\n​\n\n14\n\n[Table of Contents](#Toc)\n\n**Item 2.

Our dedicated account managers partner with customers to design, deploy, and support cutting-edge IT environments using the latest hardware, software, and services. We provide a wide range of IT solutions, from the desktop to the cloud—including computer systems, data center solutions, software and peripheral equipment, networking communications, and other products and accessories that we purchase from manufacturers, distributors, and other suppliers. Our Technology Solutions Organization, or TSO, and state-of-the-art Technology Integration and Distribution Center with ISO 9001:2015 certified technical configuration lab offer end-to-end services related to the design, configuration, and implementation of IT solutions. Our team also provides a comprehensive portfolio of managed services and professional services. These services are performed by our personnel and by third-party providers. Our GlobalServe offering ensures worldwide coverage for our multinational customers, delivering global procurement solutions through our network of in-country suppliers in over 150 countries.\n\n​\n\nThe “Connection®” brand includes Connection Enterprise Solutions, Connection Business Solutions, and Connection Public Sector Solutions, which provide IT solutions and services to enterprise, small- to medium-sized businesses, and public sector markets.\n\n​\n\nFinancial results for each of our segments are included in the financial statements attached hereto. We generate sales through (i) outbound inside sales and field sales contacts by sales representatives focused on the business, educational, healthcare, retail, manufacturing, and government markets, (ii) our websites, and (iii) direct responses from customers responding to our advertising media. We offer a broad selection of over 460,000 products at competitive prices, including products from vendors like Apple, Cisco, Dell Inc., Hewlett-Packard Inc., Hewlett-Packard Enterprise, Intel, Lenovo, Microsoft Corporation, and VMware, and we partner with more than 2,500 suppliers. We are able to leverage our state-of-the art logistic capabilities to rapidly ship product to customers.\n\n​\n\nAs a value-added reseller in the IT supply chain, we do not manufacture IT hardware or software products. We are dependent on our suppliers—manufacturers and distributors that historically have only sold to resellers rather than directly to end users. However, certain manufacturers have, on multiple occasions, sold or attempted to sell directly to our customers, and in some cases, have restricted our ability to sell their products directly to certain customers, thereby attempting to and, in some cases successfully, eliminate our role. We believe that the success of these direct sales efforts by manufacturers will depend on their ability to meet our customers’ ongoing demands and provide solutions to meet their needs. We believe more of our customers are seeking out comprehensive and integrated IT solutions, rather than the ability to acquire specific IT products on a one-off basis. Our advantage is our ability to be product-neutral and provide a broader combination of products, services, and advice tailored to our customers’ individual needs. By providing customers with customized solutions from a variety of manufacturers, we believe we can mitigate the negative impact of continued direct sales initiatives from individual manufacturers. Through the formation of our TSO, we are able to provide customers complete IT solutions, from identifying their needs, to designing, developing, and managing the integration of products and services to implement their IT projects. Such service offerings carry higher margins than traditional product sales. Additionally, the technical certifications of our service engineers permit us to offer higher-end, more complex products that generally carry higher gross margins. We expect these service offerings and technical certifications to continue to play a role in sales generation and gross margin improvements in this competitive environment.\n\n​\n\nThe primary challenges we continue to face in effectively managing our business are (1) increasing our product and service revenues while at the same time improving our gross margin in all three segments, (2) recruiting, retaining, and improving the productivity of our sales and technical support personnel, and (3) effectively controlling our selling, general and administrative, or SG&A, expenses while making major investments in our IT systems and solution selling personnel, especially in relation to changing revenue levels.\n\n​\n\nTo support future growth, we have invested and expect to continue to invest in our IT solutions business, which requires the addition of highly skilled service engineers. Although we expect to realize the ultimate benefit of higher-margin service revenues under this multi-year initiative, we believe that our cost of services will increase as we add additional service engineers. If our service revenues do not grow enough to offset the cost of these headcount additions, our operating results may be negatively impacted.\n\n​\n\n16\n\n[Table of Contents](#Toc)\n\nMarket conditions and technology advances significantly affect the demand for our products and services. Virtual delivery of software products and advanced Internet technology providing customers enhanced functionality have substantially increased customer expectations, requiring us to invest on an ongoing basis in our own IT infrastructure to meet these new demands.\n\n​\n\nOur investments in IT infrastructure are designed to enable us to operate more efficiently and provide our customers enhanced functionality. \n\n​\n\n**RESULTS OF OPERATIONS**\n\n​\n\nThe following table sets forth information derived from our statements of income expressed as a percentage of net sales for the periods indicated (dollars in millions):\n\n​\n\n​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​  \n---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \n​| ​| **Three Months Ended September 30,**|  ​| **Nine Months Ended September 30,**|  ​| ​  \n​| **2024**| **2023**| **2024**| **2023**|  ​  \nNet sales| ​| $|  724.7| ​| $|  693.1| ​| $|  2,093.2| ​| $|  2,154.2| ​| ​  \nGross margin| ​| ​|  18.7| %| ​|  19.0| %| ​|  18.6| %| ​|  17.7| % | ​  \nSelling, general and administrative expenses| ​|  14.5| %|  14.4| %|  15.1| %|  14.1| %| ​  \nIncome from operations| ​|  4.1| %|  4.6| %|  3.6| %|  3.5| %| ​  \n  \n​\n\nNet sales of $724.7 million for the third quarter of 2024 reflected an increase of $31.6 million, or 4.6% compared to the third quarter of 2023. The increase was primarily driven by increases in net sales of notebooks/mobility, desktops, software, accessories, and displays and sound of $37.9 million, $10.8 million, $8.7 million, $8.5 million, and $4.1 million, respectively, as shown in the table in Note 2 “Revenue” in the Notes to our Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. These increases were partially offset by decreases in net sales of advanced technology categories including net/com products, servers/storage, and other hardware/services of $26.3 million, $6.7 million, and $5.6 million, respectively. Gross profit for the third quarter of 2024 increased year-over-year by $3.5 million, or 2.7%, to $135.4 million as illustrated in the table and the discussion beginning on page 19 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Gross margin decreased to 18.7% from 19.0% a year ago. The decrease in gross margin was primarily driven by a shift in product mix to lower-margin sales of endpoint devices including notebooks/mobility and desktops as shown in the table in Note 2 “Revenue” in the Notes to the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements and the product mix table on page 18. This decrease was partially offset by an increase in the amount of software sales recognized on a net basis. SG&A expenses increased year-over-year by $5.6 million, or 5.6%, to $105.4 million. SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales increased to 14.5% compared to 14.4% a year ago. The increase in SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales is primarily due to increases in personnel costs related to investments in resources designed to strengthen our sales, technical sales, and services capabilities, advertising, and service contracts/subscriptions as shown in the table on page 18 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q combined with the increase in net sales as discussed above. Operating income for the third quarter of 2024 decreased year-over-year both in dollars and as a percentage of net sales by $2.0 million and 50 basis points, respectively, primarily as a result of the increase in SG&A expenses as discussed above.\n\n​\n\n17\n\n[Table of Contents](#Toc)\n\nNet Sales Distribution\n\n​\n\nThe following table sets forth our percentage of net sales by segment and product mix for the periods indicated:\n\n​\n\n​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​  \n---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \n​| ​| **Three Months Ended September 30,**|  ​| ​| **Nine Months Ended September 30,**|  ​| ​  \n​| ​| **2024**| **2023**|  ​| ​| **2024**| **2023**|  ​| ​  \n**Operating Segment**|  ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​  \nEnterprise Solutions| ​|  41| %|  40| %| ​|  42| %|  41| %| ​  \nBusiness Solutions| ​|  35| ​|  39| ​| ​|  38| ​|  37| ​| ​  \nPublic Sector Solutions| ​|  24|  21| ​|  20|  22| ​  \nTotal| ​|  100| %|  100| %| ​|  100| %|  100| %| ​  \n​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​  \n**Product Mix**|  ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​  \nNotebooks/Mobility| ​|  36| %|  32| %| ​|  35| %|  34| %| ​  \nDesktops| ​|  11| ​|  10| ​| ​|  11| ​|  9| ​| ​  \nSoftware| ​|  12| ​|  11| ​| ​|  11| ​|  11| ​  \nServers/Storage| ​|  6|  7| ​|  7| ​|  7| ​  \nNet/Com Products| ​|  8|  12| ​|  8|  11| ​| ​  \nDisplays and Sound| ​|  10|  10| ​|  10| ​|  9| ​  \nAccessories| ​|  11| ​|  10| ​| ​|  11| ​|  11| ​| ​  \nOther Hardware/Services| ​|  6|  8| ​|  7|  8| ​  \nTotal| ​|  100| %|  100| %| ​|  100| %|  100| %| ​  \n  \n​\n\nGross Profit Margin\n\n​\n\nThe following table summarizes our gross margin, as a percentage of net sales, for the periods indicated:\n\n​\n\n​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​  \n---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \n​| ​| **Three Months Ended September 30,**|  ​| ​| **Nine Months Ended September 30,**|  ​| ​  \n​| ​| **2024**|  ​| **2023**|  ​| ​| **2024**| **2023**|  ​| ​  \n**Operating Segment**|  ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​  \nEnterprise Solutions| ​|  15.6| %|  16.0| %| ​|  15.4| %|  14.7| %| ​  \nBusiness Solutions| ​|  25.0| ​|  23.3| ​| ​|  24.1| ​|  22.9| ​| ​  \nPublic Sector Solutions| ​|  14.9|  16.9| ​|  15.2|  14.5| ​  \nTotal Company| ​|  18.7| %|  19.0| %| ​|  18.6| %|  17.7| %| ​  \n  \n​\n\nOperating Expenses\n\n​\n\nThe following table reflects our SG&A expenses for the periods indicated (dollars in millions):\n\n​\n\n​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​  \n---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \n​| ​| **Three Months Ended September 30,**|  ​| ​| **Nine Months Ended September 30,**|  ​  \n​| ​| **2024**|  ​| **2023**|  ​| ​| **2024**|  ​| **2023**|  ​  \nPersonnel costs| ​| $|  79.9| ​| $|  77.5| ​| ​| $|  239.5| ​| $|  233.5| ​  \nAdvertising| ​|  6.2| ​|  4.6| ​| ​|  18.8| ​|  16.5| ​  \nService contracts/subscriptions| ​| ​|  6.4| ​| ​|  5.1| ​| ​| ​|  18.1| ​| ​|  15.5| ​  \nProfessional fees| ​|  3.3| ​|  2.6| ​| ​|  9.8| ​|  9.3| ​  \nDepreciation and amortization| ​|  3.3| ​|  3.3| ​| ​|  9.8| ​|  9.5| ​  \nFacilities operations| ​|  1.9| ​|  2.0| ​| ​|  5.6| ​|  6.2| ​  \nCredit card fees| ​|  1.8| ​|  2.1| ​| ​|  5.1| ​|  5.3| ​  \nOther| ​|  2.6| ​|  2.6| ​| ​|  8.5| ​|  8.3| ​  \nTotal SG&A expense| ​| $|  105.4| ​| $|  99.8| ​| ​| $|  315.2| ​| $|  304.1| ​  \nAs a percentage of net sales| ​| ​|  14.5| %| ​|  14.4| %| ​| ​|  15.1| %| ​|  14.1| %  \n​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​  \n  \nRestructuring and Other Charges\n\n​\n\nDuring the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, we undertook actions to lower our cost structure.

The decrease in net sales is primarily due to decreases in net sales of net/com products, displays and sound, and other hardware/services of $32.7 million, $8.4 million, and $1.8 million, respectively. These decreases were partially offset by increases in net sales of notebooks/mobility, servers/storage, and accessories of $16.0 million, $6.0 million, and $4.5 million, respectively.  \n---|---  \n  \n​\n\n●| Net sales of $428.1 million for the Public Sector Solutions segment reflect a decrease of $45.2 million, or 9.6%. Sales to the federal government decreased by $22.1 million, or 18.9%, and sales to state and local government and educational institutions decreased by $23.1 million, or 6.5%. The decrease in net sales is primarily due to decreases in net sales of net/com products, desktops, other hardware/services, displays and sound, accessories, and servers/storage of $23.3 million, $11.9 million, $7.8 million, $7.0 million, $6.5 million, and $2.4 million, respectively.

The year-over-year change in SG&A dollars was primarily attributable to an increase in use of shared Headquarter services of $10.2 million, partially offset by decreases in personnel costs and depreciation and amortization of $3.7 million and $0.6 million, respectively. SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales were 12.4% for the Enterprise Solutions segment for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, which reflects an increase of 70 basis points and is primarily due to the increase in SG&A expenses.  \n---|---  \n  \n​\n\n●| SG&A expenses for the Business Solutions segment increased year-over-year both in dollars and as a percentage of net sales.

SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales were 16.8% for the Business Solutions segment for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, which reflects an increase of 90 basis points and is primarily due to the decrease in net sales discussed above, combined with the increase in SG&A expenses.  \n---  \n  \n​\n\n●| SG&A expenses for the Public Sector Solutions segment increased year-over-year both in dollars and as a percentage of net sales. The year-over-year change in SG&A dollars was primarily attributable to an increase in use of shared Headquarter services of $1.9 million, partially offset by decreases in personnel costs, credit card fees, and other expenses of $0.6 million, $0.4 million, and $0.4 million, respectively. SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales were 14.8% for the Public Sector Solutions segment for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, which reflects an increase of 150 basis points and is primarily due to the decrease in net sales discussed above.   \n---|---  \n  \n​\n\n●| SG&Aexpenses for the Headquarters/Other group increased year-over-year primarily due to increases in personnel costs, service contracts/subscriptions, depreciation and amortization, and other expenses of $11.6 million, $2.9 million, $1.0 million, and $0.9 million, respectively, partially offset by an increase in the allocated amounts to the sales segments of $15.8 million. The Headquarters/Other group provides services to the three segments in areas such as finance, distribution center, human resources, IT, marketing, and product management. Most of the operating costs associated with such corporate Headquarters services are charged to the segments based on their estimated allocation usage of the underlying services.   \n---|---  \n  \n​\n\n _Restructuring and other charges_ for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were $0.4 million, compared to $2.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The restructuring and other charges were primarily related to expenses incurred in connection with the involuntary reduction in our headquarter workforce and included cash severance and other related termination benefits.\n\n​\n\n _Income from operations_ for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 decreased to $74.4 million, compared to $75.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to the increase in SG&A expenses, partially offset by the increase in gross profit and decrease in restructuring and other charges, as discussed above. Income from operations as a percentage of net sales was 3.6% for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 3.5% for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to the decrease in net sales discussed above.\n\n​\n\n _Interest income, net_ for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased to $14.1 million, compared to $5.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to an increase in interest income of $8.3 million as a result of higher cash equivalent balances and interest rates on short-term investments.\n\n​\n\n _Other income_ for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was $1.7 million as a result of a legal settlement received.\n\n​\n\n _Income taxes._ Our provision for income taxes for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased to $23.8 million, compared to $21.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Our effective tax rate decreased to 26.4% for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 26.6% for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to non-recurring benefits included in the current year.\n\n​\n\n _Net income_ for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased to $66.4 million, compared to $59.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to a $8.3 million increase in interest income, net and other income of $1.7 million, partially offset by a $2.2 million increase in the provision for income taxes.\n\n​\n\n**Liquidity and Capital Resources**\n\n​\n\nOur primary sources of liquidity are internally generated funds from operations, short-term investments, and borrowings under our credit facility. We have historically used and expect to use in the future those funds to meet our capital requirements, which consist primarily of working capital for operational needs, capital expenditures for computer equipment and software used in our business, repurchases of our common stock for treasury, dividend payments, and as opportunities arise, possible acquisitions of new businesses.\n\n​\n\n23\n\n[Table of Contents](#Toc)\n\nWe believe that funds generated from operations, short-term investments, and the available capacity under our credit facility will be sufficient to finance our working capital, capital expenditures, and other requirements for at least the next twelve calendar months and beyond such twelve calendar month period. Our investments in IT systems and infrastructure are designed to enable us to operate more efficiently and to provide our customers enhanced functionality.\n\n​\n\nWe expect to meet our cash requirements for the next twelve months and beyond through a combination of cash on hand, short-term investments, cash generated from operations, and borrowings under our credit facility, as follows:\n\n​\n\n●|  _Cash and Cash Equivalents_. As of September 30, 2024, we had $167.5 million in cash and cash equivalents.  \n---|---  \n  \n​\n\n●|  _Short-term Investments_. As of September 30, 2024, we had $261.6 million in short-term investments.  \n---|---  \n  \n​\n\n●|  _Cash Generated from Operations_. We expect to generate cash flows from operations in excess of operating cash needs by generating earnings and managing net changes in inventories and receivables with changes in payables to generate positive cash flow.  \n---|---  \n  \n​\n\n●|  _Credit Facility._ As of September 30, 2024, no borrowings were outstanding under our $50.0 million credit facility, which is available until March 31, 2025. Accordingly, our entire line of credit was available for borrowing as of September 30, 2024. This maximum borrowing capacity under our credit facility can be increased, at our option, to up to $80.0 million for approved acquisitions or other uses authorized by the bank. Borrowings are, however, limited by certain minimum collateral and earnings requirements, as described more fully below. As of September 30, 2024, we were in compliance with the covenants of our credit facility.  \n---|---  \n  \n​\n\nOur ability to continue funding our planned growth, both internally and externally, is dependent upon our ability to generate sufficient cash flow from operations or to obtain additional funds through equity or debt financing, or from other sources of financing, as may be required. While we do not anticipate needing any additional sources of financing to fund our operations at this time, if demand for IT products declines, or our customers are materially adversely impacted by the developing macroeconomic trends characterized by inflation and increased interest rates, our cash flows from operations may be substantially affected. \n\n​\n\nDividends\n\n​\n\nA summary of 2024 dividend activity for our common stock is as follows:\n\n​\n\n​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​  \n---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \n**Dividend Amount**| **Declaration Date**| **Record Date**| **Payment Date**  \n$|  0.10| ​| February 12, 2024| ​| February 27, 2024| ​| March 15, 2024  \n$|  0.10| ​| April 30, 2024| ​| May 14, 2024| ​| May 29, 2024  \n$|  0.10| ​| July 30, 2024| ​| August 13, 2024| ​| August 30, 2024  \n  \n​\n\nOn October 30, 2024, we announced that our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend on our common stock of $0.10 per share.

The declaration and payment of any future dividends is at the discretion of our Board of Directors and will depend upon our financial position, strategic plans, general business conditions and any other factors deemed relevant by our Board of Directors.\n\n​\n\nSummary of Sources and Uses of Cash\n\n​\n\nCash flows from operating, investing and financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, as reflected in our Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows included in Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, are summarized in the following table (in millions):\n\n​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​  \n---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \n​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​  \n​| ​| **Nine Months Ended September 30,**|  ​  \n​| **2024**| **2023**|  ​  \nNet cash provided by operating activities| ​| $|  148.7| ​| $|  185.7| ​  \nNet cash used in investing activities| ​|  (109.7)| ​|  (56.1)| ​  \nNet cash used in financing activities| ​|  (16.4)| ​|  (12.0)| ​  \nIncrease in cash and cash equivalents| ​| $|  22.6| ​| $|  117.6| ​  \n  \n​\n\n24\n\n[Table of Contents](#Toc)\n\nCash provided by operating activities was $148.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Cash provided by operating activities resulted primarily from $66.4 million of net income, an increase in accounts payable of $29.1 million, and a decrease in accounts receivable of $20.9 million. A decrease in inventory of $10.5 million, an increase in accrued expenses and other liabilities of $9.6 million, and depreciation and amortization and stock-based compensation expense added back to net income of $9.8 million and $6.2 million, respectively, also contributed to the positive inflow of cash for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. These inflows were partially offset by the amortization of discounts on short-term investments of $4.4 million subtracted from net income. The increase in accounts payable and decrease in accounts receivable were primarily driven by the timing of payments. For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, cash provided by operating activities resulted primarily from net income adjusted for non-cash charges of $76.8 million, a decrease in inventory of $66.4 million, an increase in accounts payable of $31.6 million, and a decrease in accounts receivable of $20.9 million, partially offset by an increase in prepaid expenses, income tax receivable, and other current assets of $9.6 million. \n\n​\n\nIn order to manage our working capital and operating cash needs, we monitor our cash conversion cycle, defined as days of sales outstanding in accounts receivable plus days of supply in inventory minus days of purchases outstanding in accounts payable, based on a rolling three-month average. Components of our cash conversion cycle are as follows:\n\n​\n\n​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​  \n---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \n​| ​| **September 30,**|  ​  \n(in days)| ​| **2024**|  ​| **2023**|  ​  \nDays of sales outstanding (DSO)(1)| ​| ​|  67| ​| ​|  71| ​  \nDays of supply in inventory (DIO)(2)| ​| ​|  18| ​| ​|  23| ​  \nDays of purchases outstanding (DPO)(3)| ​| ​|  (45)| ​| ​|  (43)| ​  \nCash conversion cycle| ​| ​|  40| ​| ​|  51| ​  \n  \n​\n\n(1)| Represents the trade receivable at the end of the quarter divided by average daily net sales for the same three-month period.  \n---|---  \n  \n​\n\n(2)| Represents the inventory balance at the end of the quarter divided by average daily cost of sales for the same three-month period.  \n---|---  \n  \n​\n\n(3)| Represents the accounts payable balance at the end of the quarter divided by average daily cost of sales for the same three-month period.  \n---|---  \n  \n​\n\nThe cash conversion cycle decreased to 40 days at September 30, 2024, compared to 51 days at September 30, 2023. The decrease in DSO is consistent with the increase in net sales for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in DIO is consistent with the decrease in inventory for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in DPO is consistent with the increase in accounts payable as of September 30, 2024 compared to September 30, 2023.\n\n​\n\n _Cash used in investing activities_ for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 consisted of $255.1 million of purchases of U.S. Government treasury securities, $150.6 million of maturities of U.S. Government treasury securities, and $5.2 million of purchases of property and equipment. These property and equipment expenditures were primarily for computer equipment and capitalized internally developed software in connection with investments in our IT infrastructure. In the prior year period, investing activities consisted of $48.7 million of purchases of U.S. Government treasury securities and $7.4 million of purchases of property and equipment. \n\n​\n\n _Cash used in financing activities_ for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 consisted of $25.2 million of aggregate borrowings and repayments, $7.7 million of treasury purchases, $7.9 million of dividend payments, $0.5 million of issuances of stock under the Employee Stock Purchase Plan, and $1.3 million payments of payroll taxes on stock-based compensation through shares withheld. In the prior year period, financing activities primarily consisted of $70.9 million of aggregate borrowings and repayments, $5.4 million of treasury purchases, $6.3 million of dividend payments, $0.5 million of issuances of stock under the Employee Stock Purchase Plan, and $0.9 million payments of payroll taxes on stock-based compensation through shares withheld. \n\n​\n\n25\n\n[Table of Contents](#Toc)\n\nDebt Instruments, Contractual Agreements, and Related Covenants\n\n​\n\nBelow is a summary of certain provisions of our credit facility and other contractual obligations. For more information about the restrictive covenants in our credit facility, see “Factors Affecting Sources of Liquidity” below. For more information about our obligations, commitments, and contingencies, see our condensed consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.\n\n​\n\n _Credit Facility._ Our credit facility extends until March 2025 and is collateralized by our accounts receivable. As of September 30, 2024, our borrowing capacity under the credit facility was up to $50.0 million. Amounts outstanding under this facility bear interest at the greatest of (i) the prime rate (8.00% at September 30, 2024), (ii) the federal funds effective rate plus 0.50% per annum, and (iii) the daily BSBY Rate, plus 1.00% per annum, provided that the rate shall at no time be less than 0% per annum. In addition, we have the ability to increase our borrowing capacity under the credit facility up to an additional $30.0 million provided that we meet certain additional borrowing requirements and obtain the consent of the administrative agent. Our credit facility is subject to certain covenant requirements which are described below under “Factors Affecting Sources of Liquidity”. We did not have any borrowings outstanding under the credit facility as of September 30, 2024.\n\n​\n\nCash receipts are automatically applied against any outstanding borrowings. Any excess cash on account may either remain on account to generate earned credits to offset up to 100% of cash management fees, or may be invested in short-term qualified investments. Borrowings under the credit facility are classified as current in our condensed consolidated balance sheets. As of September 30, 2024, the entire $50.0 million facility was available for borrowing.\n\n​\n\n _Operating Leases._ We lease facilities from a related party, which is a company affiliated with us through common ownership, and facilities from third parties under non-cancelable operating leases. Certain leases require us to pay real estate taxes, insurance, and common area maintenance charges. See “Item 2. Properties” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 for additional information regarding our operating leases.\n\n​\n\nFactors Affecting Sources of Liquidity\n\n​\n\n _Internally Generated Funds._ The key factors affecting our internally generated funds are our ability to manage costs and fully achieve our operating efficiencies, timely collection of our customer receivables, and management of our inventory levels. \n\n​\n\n _Credit Facility._ Our credit facility extends until March 2025 and is collateralized by our accounts receivable. As of September 30, 2024, the entire $50.0 million facility was available for borrowing. Our credit facility contains certain financial ratios and operational covenants and other restrictions (including restrictions on additional debt, guarantees, and other distributions, investments, and liens) with which we and all of our subsidiaries must comply. Any failure to comply with these covenants would constitute a default and could prevent us from borrowing additional funds under this line of credit. This credit facility contains two financial tests:\n\n​\n\n●| The funded debt ratio (defined as the average outstanding advances under the line for the quarter, divided by the consolidated trailing twelve months Adjusted EBITDA) must not be more than 2.0 to 1.0. Such amount was calculated as 0.0 to 1.0 at September 30, 2024, and accordingly, the funded debt ratio did not limit potential borrowings as of September 30, 2024. Future decreases in our consolidated trailing twelve months Adjusted EBITDA could limit our potential borrowings under the line of credit.  \n---|---  \n  \n​\n\n●| Minimum consolidated net worth (defined as our consolidated total assets less our consolidated total liabilities) must be at least $346.7 million, plus 50% of consolidated net income for each quarter, beginning with the quarter ended December 31, 2016 (loss quarters not counted). Such amount was calculated as $636.2 million at September 30, 2024, whereas our actual consolidated stockholders’ equity at that date was $897.4 million.  \n---|---  \n  \n​\n\n _Capital Markets._ Our ability to raise additional funds in the capital market depends upon, among other things, general economic conditions, the condition of the IT industry, our financial performance and stock price, and the state of the capital markets. In addition, market volatility, inflation and interest rate fluctuations may increase our cost of financing or restrict our access to potential sources of future liquidity.\n\n​\n\n26\n\n[Table of Contents](#Toc)\n\n**APPLICATION OF CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES**\n\n​\n\nOur critical accounting policies and estimates have not materially changed from those discussed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.\n\n​\n\n**RECENTLY ISSUED FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS**\n\n​\n\nRecently issued financial accounting standards are detailed in Note 1, “Basis of Presentation,” in the Notes to our Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.\n\n​\n\n27\n\n[Table of Contents](#Toc)\n\n**Item 3.

The term “disclosure controls and procedures,” as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) promulgated under the Exchange Act, means controls and other procedures of a company that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the company’s management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Our management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives and management necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. Our disclosure controls and procedures are designed to provide reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives as described above. Based on this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of the end of the period covered by this report, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level.\n\n​\n\n**Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting**\n\n​\n\nThere were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that occurred during the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.\n\n​\n\n​\n\n29\n\n[Table of Contents](#Toc)\n\n**PART II****―****OTHER INFORMATIO****N**\n\n​\n\nItem 1.
