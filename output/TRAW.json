(“Traws” or “Traws Pharma”), a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company developing oral small molecules for respiratory viral diseases, today outlined recent business updates and reported unaudited financial results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2024. \n\n“Traws is making excellent progress with its clinical pipeline. Phase 1 data for each of the antiviral programs for COVID and influenza are particularly exciting,” said **Werner Cautreels, PhD, Chief Executive Officer** of Traws Pharma. “Based on our recent Phase 1 pharmacokinetic results, we believe that **ratutrelvir** has the potential to be used as a monotherapy to treat COVID, without ritonavir, with a lower likelihood of clinical rebound. In addition, recent Phase 1 pharmacokinetic data suggest that **tivoxavir marboxil** could be a single-dose treatment for influenza, including potential pandemic settings such as avian flu. These distinct characteristics support the potential for each agent to be a differentiated, best-in-class treatment and progress to Phase 2 studies expected to commence in 2025.“\n\n** _Upcoming Milestones_**\n\n**Tivoxavir marboxil:** Flu:an oral influenza cap-dependent endonuclease, highly conserved across flu strains, including avian flu. Intended as a one dose treatment or prevention of seasonal and pandemic flu\n\n  * Initiation of Phase 2 clinical proof of concept study in community-acquired setting\n\n\n\n\n**Ratutrelvir:** COVID: an oral Mpro/3CL protease inhibitor, without the need for a CYP-inhibitor such as ritonavir. Intended as a once-a-day, single-dose, 10-day antiviral regimen for the treatment of COVID\n\n  * Initiation of Phase 2 clinical proof of concept study in community-acquired setting\n\n\n\n\n** _Recent Developments_**\n\n** _Antiviral programs advancing as potential best-in-class agents, poised to begin Phase 2_**\n\n  * **COVID: Phase 1 data affirms ratutrelvir’s potential to be dosed without ritonavir, with lower rebound risk** : Data from the Phase 1 healthy volunteer study, with once-a-day ratutrelvir dosing for 10 days showed no treatment related adverse events and demonstrated consistent plasma drug levels in the predicted therapeutic window. The study showed that ratutrelvir achieved plasma concentrations that were consistently above the EC90 against a panel of SARS-COV-2 viruses, without the need for ritonavir co-administration, which can be a source of drug-drug interactions and severe side effects. Pharmacokinetic data also suggest that ratutrelvir may have a reduced likelihood of clinical rebound, helped to define the dose for Phase 2 studies. Previous preclinical testing in animal models showed that levels of ratutrelvir in the lung were higher than in plasma. Taken together, the data further suggest that ratutrelvir has the potential to be a once-a-day, single-dose, 10-day antiviral therapy for COVID and support Phase 2 studies.\n\n  * **Flu: Phase 1 data support tivoaxavir marboxil’s potential to treat flu with a single dose, with potential for pandemic/avian flu** : Data from the Phase 1 healthy volunteer study, with one-time tivoxavir marboxil dosing showed good overall tolerability and a pharmacokinetic profile that appears to support potential use as a one-time treatment for flu, including pandemic flu. The study showed that a single dose of tivoxavir maintained plasma drug levels above the EC90 for more than five days and helped to define a Phase 2 dose. Prior preclinical studies have shown that tivoxavir has broad activity against drug resistant viruses and highly pathogenic strains such as avian flu. In addition, preclinical data showed that a single dose of tivoxavir has more than 15X higher accumulation in the lung compared to plasma. The combined dataset support further development of tivoxavir marboxil as a potential treatment of community-acquired influenza or for use in case of an avian flu outbreak or pandemic, with further potential to prevent virus spread in households and congregant settings.\n\n\n\n\n**Additional Updates: Luba Greenwood, J.D. added to the Board:** Ms. Greenwood brings a rich depth of experience as a Board Member, Investor, Strategic Advisor and Company Executive through her industry roles, including as a board member for public life science companies across a range of therapeutic areas. In addition, Traws **continues ongoing investigator-sponsored trial driven (IST) development** of narazaciclib and rigosertib.\n\n**Financial Results:**\n\n**Cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments** : As of September 30, 2024, the Company had cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments of approximately $5.4 million, compared to cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments of approximately $20.8 million at December 31, 2023. \n\n**Research and development (R &D) expense** for the three months ended September 30, 2024, totaled $5.1 million, compared to $2.5 million for the comparable period in 2023. This increase was primarily attributable to the initiation and completion of our Phase 1 study for TRX100 in Australia, partially offset by the reductions in research and development costs attributable to the Australian tax incentive receivable. \n\n**General and administrative (G &A) expense** for the three months ended September 30, 2024, totaled $3.5 million, compared to $2.7 million for the comparable period in 2023. This increase was primarily attributable to a $1.2 million increase in professional and consulting fees associated with seeking strategic alternatives for our investors. This increase was offset by a $0.7 million decrease in public company costs. \n\n**Net loss** : The net loss for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was $8.5 million, or $8.81 per basic and diluted common share. This compares with a net loss of $4.7 million, or $5.64 per basic and diluted common share, for the same period in 2023. \n\nTraws had 3,025,554 shares outstandings as of November 11, 2024. The shares outstanding reflect a 25:1 reverse split, effective as of September 20, 2024.\n\n**About Traws Pharma, Inc.**\n\nTraws Pharma is a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company developing potential oral small molecule therapies for the treatment of respiratory viral diseases and cancer.

(NASDAQ: TRAW) (“Traws Pharma”, “Traws” or “the Company”), a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company developing oral small molecule therapies for the treatment of respiratory viral diseases, today announced positive topline Phase 1 safety and pharmacokinetic results for its investigational one-dose influenza (flu) therapy, tivoxavir marboxil (tivoxavir). Tivoxavir was designed as a potential best-in-class inhibitor of the highly-conserved influenza protein, CAP-dependent endonuclease (CEN), intended for use across a broad range of flu viruses.\n\n“Topline data from the Phase 1 healthy volunteer study showed good overall tolerability and a pharmacokinetic profile that appears to support tivoxavir’s potential use as a one-time treatment for flu, including pandemic flu. We are especially pleased with data showing that a single dose of tivoxavir maintained plasma drug levels above the EC90 for greater than 5 days(1),” said **Werner Cautreels, PhD, Chief Executive Officer** of Traws Pharma. “In addition, preclinical data show that tivoxavir is a potent inhibitor of drug-resistant influenza and bird flu viruses. Together, these initial results suggest that tivoxavir has the potential to be developed as a best-in-class agent for influenza. With these data, we plan to advance the program to a Phase 2 study in H1 2025.”\n\n“Influenza is a substantial public health burden in the US(2), with a disproportionate impact on older adults and vulnerable populations. Data from the last influenza season showed that flu-related hospitalizations(3) and mortality(4) were highest, by approximately three times, among people 65 years of age or older(5). Recent bird flu outbreaks, and the risk that this highly pathogenic virus (H5N1) poses for evolving into a pandemic outbreak(6), also signal the need for new antiviral treatments,” said **Robert R. Redfield, MD, Chief Medical Officer** for Traws Pharma and former Director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). “Our enthusiasm for tivoxavir is based on the data announced today and the need for novel therapeutics, especially as valuable resources in case of an avian flu outbreak or a pandemic, and for potential use to prevent virus spread in households and congregant settings.” \n\n“We selected CEN as the target for our flu program because it is conserved among human and avian influenza viruses, including the highly pathogenic H5N1. As a result, we believe tivoxavir has the potential to suppress a wide range of viruses. We are very pleased that tivoxavir demonstrated broad activity in laboratory studies against drug-resistant viruses and highly pathogenic strains such as avian flu1. In addition, we believe that preferential uptake in the lung is another important feature of a candidate agent. Preclinical data indicate that a single dose of tivoxavir has more than 15X higher accumulation in the lung compared to plasma(1),” said **C. David Pauza, PhD, Chief Science Officer** for Traws Pharma. “Positive Phase 1 data showing that tivoxavir achieved plasma blood levels in healthy subjects that are consistently above the EC90 and within the predicted therapeutic window for more than five days lead to the identification of our Phase 2 dose, supporting further development of the program.” \n\n**Topline Phase 1 Results**\n\nThe Phase 1 trial was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to assess the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PD) of ascending doses of one-time tivoxavir marboxil treatment in healthy, influenza-negative, adult volunteers. \n\nAt the identified Phase 2 dose, no treatment related adverse events were reported during the Phase 1 study. Topline data from this study showed that a single dose of tivoxavir marboxil maintained plasma drug levels consistently above the EC90 for more than five days and within the predicted therapeutic window. Preclinical studies showed that tivoxavir marboxil demonstrated potent inhibition of drug-resistant influenza viruses, as well as potent inhibition of highly pathogenic bird flu viruses(1). \n\n**About Tivoxavir Marboxil**\n\nSeasonal influenza is estimated to represent a multi-billion antiviral market opportunity, largely driven by global health organizations, practice guidelines and government tenders1, with upside potential from pandemic flu outbreaks. Tivoxavir marboxil (also known as 27-5116 or TRX-100) was designed as an inhibitor of the highly conserved influenza protein, CAP-dependent endonuclease (CEN). It has demonstrated potent _in vitro_ activity against a range of influenza strains, including the highly pathogenic avian flu, in preclinical studies. The drug candidate’s Phase 1 pharmacokinetic (PK) profile in healthy subjects, including the ability to achieve plasma levels that are consistently above the EC90 (as determined in laboratory studies), for more than five days and within the predicted therapeutic window, may enable a single dose treatment regimen. These data, combined with good overall tolerability results in healthy subjects, support further development of tivoxavir marboxil as a one-time treatment for influenza.\n\nSource information: \n\n1.
