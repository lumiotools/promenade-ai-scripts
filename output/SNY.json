Sanofi continue ainsi de soutenir la production en France de Thymoglubuline, médicament notamment utilisé en transplantation, et anticipe les besoins à venir en bioproduction en localisant en France la production d’un médicament dans le diabète de type 1 - TZIELD.\n\nDans le cadre de cet investissement, **25 millions****d’euros** sont ainsi consacrés à la production et au développement de la seconde génération de son anticorps polyclonal crucial pour les patients transplantés. Par ailleurs, un investissement de plus de **15 millions****d’euros** est prévu pour internaliser et localiser en France la production d’anticorps monoclonal dans le traitement du diabète de type 1 aux stades pré-clinique et clinique de la maladie.\n\n**_Charles Wolf_** Directeur général France, Sanofi _“ Avec cet investissement significatif, nous renforçons notre empreinte et notre leadership en bioproduction depuis la France pour servir nos ambitions en immunologie. Notre site de Lyon Gerland tient déjà une place centrale dans l’écosystème lyonnais des sciences du vivant et cet investissement fait office de nouvelle étape pour nous permettre d’accélérer son rôle accru au service des patients en France et dans le monde entier. ”_\n\nDédié aux patients transplantés, le sérum anti-lymphocytaire de Sanofi est un immunosuppresseur exclusivement fabriqué depuis le site de Lyon Gerland. Le site produit 1,6 million de flacons pour traiter environ 70 000 patients par an dans 74 pays. Pour répondre à l’augmentation constante du nombre de patients transplantés dans le monde, **Sanofi a développé un nouveau procédé de fabrication qui permettra d’augmenter la capacité de production, de fiabiliser l’approvisionnement et d’améliorer encore l’impact environnemental du produit. Les travaux de modernisation ont démarré à l’été 2024.** Les premiers lots industriels seront produits dès 2025 et les premiers lots commerciaux disponibles en 2027. La production de ce médicament se poursuivra dans l’intervalle et en parallèle, selon le processus actuellement en vigueur, ce qui garantit sa disponibilité pour les patients. \n\nLe site de Lyon Gerland dispose par ailleurs**d’une plateforme de bioproduction agile qui lui permet d’internaliser la production d’un médicament à destination des patients ayant un stade pré-clinique de diabète de type 1** , jusqu'alors produit en dehors de l’Union européenne et pas par Sanofi. Ce traitement immunomodulateur vient répondre à un besoin patient non satisfait. L’aménagement de la zone de bioproduction débutera dès le début de l’année 2025. Les premiers lots seront produits dès la fin de l’année 2025 et seront disponibles pour une commercialisation à partir de 2027.\n\nAvec plus de 2,5 milliards d’euros déjà engagés dans de grands projets depuis la pandémie Covid-19, et plus d’1 milliard d’euros supplémentaires d’investissement en bioproduction [_annoncés en mai dernier_](https://www.sanofi.com/fr/media-room/communiques-de-presse/2024/2024-05-13-05-00-00-2880074), Sanofi continue à démontrer son engagement en faveur de la souveraineté sanitaire de la France et le développement économique de ses territoires.Sanofi assure 60 % de sa production mondiale au sein de l’Union Européenne et reste le 1er investisseur privé en R&D en France, avec 2,5 milliards d’euros par an. Ces investissements soutiennent l’ambition de Sanofi de devenir le leader mondial en immunologie, en lançant des médicaments et traitements innovants au service de millions de patients atteints de maladies comme l’asthme, la sclérose en plaques, le diabète de type 1 ou encore la bronchite chronique.\n\n_À propos de Sanofi_ Nous sommes une entreprise mondiale de santé, innovante et animée par une vocation : poursuivre les miracles de la science pour améliorer la vie des gens.

The target action date for the FDA decision is April 18, 2025.\n\nThe resubmitted sBLA is supported by data from the multi-study LIBERTY-CUPID phase 3 clinical program ([Study A](https://www.sanofi.com/en/media-room/press-releases/2021/2021-07-29-05-00-00-2270858), [Study B](https://www.sanofi.com/en/media-room/press-releases/2022/2022-02-18-06-00-00-2387700), and [Study C](https://www.sanofi.com/en/media-room/press-releases/2024/2024-09-11-05-05-00-2944239)) for Dupixent in CSU. The sBLA adds results from Study C, which was conducted in patients with uncontrolled CSU who were on standard-of-care antihistamines. Study C, the second LIBERTY-CUPID pivotal study in biologic-naïve patients, met its primary and key secondary endpoints, confirming results seen in the previous Study A. Results showed Dupixent significantly reduced itch and urticaria activity (itch and hives).\n\nSafety results in all LIBERTY-CUPID phase 3 studies were generally consistent with the known safety profile of Dupixent in its approved indications. Adverse events more commonly observed with Dupixent (≥5%) compared to placebo were injection site reactions and COVID-19 infection.\n\n**About CSU** CSU is a chronic inflammatory skin disease driven in part by type-2 inflammation, which causes sudden and debilitating hives and recurring itch. CSU is typically treated with H1 antihistamines, medicines that target H1 receptors on cells to control symptoms of urticaria. However, the disease remains uncontrolled despite antihistamine treatment in many patients, some of whom are left with limited alternative treatment options. These individuals continue to experience symptoms that can be debilitating and significantly impact their quality of life. More than 300,000 people in the US suffer from CSU that is inadequately controlled by antihistamines.\n\n**About Dupixent in CSU** The LIBERTY-CUPID Phase 3 study program evaluating Dupixent for CSU consists of Study A, Study B, and Study C. Study A and Study C were conducted in CSU patients who were uncontrolled on standard-of-care antihistamines while Study B was conducted in CSU patients who were uncontrolled on standard-of-care antihistamines and refractory or intolerant to omalizumab.\n\nDupixent has been approved for CSU in Japan and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and is also under regulatory review in the EU based on earlier study readouts. Outside of Japan and the UAE, the safety and efficacy of Dupixent for CSU has not been fully evaluated by any regulatory authority.\n\n**About Dupixent** Dupixent (dupilumab) is a fully human monoclonal antibody that inhibits the signaling of the IL4 and IL13 pathways and is not an immunosuppressant. The Dupixent development program has shown significant clinical benefit and a decrease in type-2 inflammation in phase 3 studies, establishing that IL4 and IL13 are two of the key and central drivers of type-2 inflammation that play a major role in multiple related and often co-morbid diseases. \n\nDupixent has received regulatory approvals in more than 60 countries in one or more indications including certain patients with atopic dermatitis, asthma, chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps, eosinophilic esophagitis, prurigo nodularis, CSU, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in different age populations. More than 1,000,000 patients are currently being treated with Dupixent globally.\n\n**Dupilumab development program** Dupilumab is being jointly developed by Sanofi and Regeneron under a global collaboration agreement. To date, dupilumab has been studied across more than 60 clinical studies involving more than 10,000 patients with various chronic diseases driven in part by type-2 inflammation.\n\nIn addition to the currently approved indications, Sanofi and Regeneron are studying dupilumab in a broad range of diseases driven in part by type-2 inflammation or other allergic processes in phase 3 studies, including chronic pruritus of unknown origin and bullous pemphigoid. These potential uses of dupilumab are currently under clinical investigation, and the safety and efficacy in these conditions have not been fully evaluated by any regulatory authority.\n\n**About Regeneron** Regeneron (NASDAQ: REGN) is a leading biotechnology company that invents, develops and commercializes life-transforming medicines for people with serious diseases.

The European Medicines Agency (EMA)’s Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) has adopted a positive opinion recommending the approval of Sarclisa in combination with bortezomib, lenalidomide, and dexamethasone (VRd) for the treatment of adult patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma (NDMM) who are ineligible for autologous stem cell transplant (ASCT). A final decision is expected in the coming months.\n\n**_Dietmar Berger, M.D., Ph.D._** Chief Medical Officer, Global Head of Development at Sanofi _“The positive CHMP opinion is an important step forward for people with transplant-ineligible newly diagnosed multiple myeloma for whom effective front-line therapy may improve long-term outcomes. If approved, this Sarclisa-based combination could establish a new standard-of-care treatment approach for patients in the EU, helping to address a critical care gap in multiple myeloma treatment, and reinforcing Sarclisa’s potential as the anti-CD38 therapy of choice.”_\n\nIn September 2024, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) [approved](https://www.sanofi.com/en/media-room/press-releases/2024/2024-09-20-22-36-34-2949916) Sarclisa in combination with VRd for the treatment of adult patients with NDMM who are not eligible for ASCT, representing the first global approval for Sarclisa in the first line setting. In addition, the FDA granted orphan drug exclusivity for Sarclisa in the approved indication.\n\nSarclisa is currently approved in two indications for the treatment of certain adult patients with relapsed or refractory MM in more than 50 countries, including the US and EU.\n\n_First positive global phase 3 study combining anti-CD38 therapy with VRd to significantly improve PFS versus VRd alone in transplant-ineligible NDMM supports CHMP decision_ The positive CHMP opinion is based on data from the IMROZ phase 3 study, which was presented at the American Society of Clinical Oncology 2024 annual meeting, European Hematology Association 2024 meeting, and published in [_The New England Journal of Medicine_](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2400712). IMROZ is the [first global phase 3 study](https://www.sanofi.com/en/media-room/press-releases/2024/2024-06-03-20-15-00-2892607) of a CD38 monoclonal antibody in combination with standard-of-care VRd to significantly improve progression-free survival (PFS) versus VRd alone. The safety and tolerability of Sarclisa observed was consistent with the established safety profile of Sarclisa and VRd with no new safety signals.\n\n_About Sarclisa_ Sarclisa (isatuximab) is a CD38 monoclonal antibody that binds to a specific epitope on the CD38 receptor on MM cells, inducing distinct antitumor activity. It is designed to work through multiple mechanisms of action including programmed tumor cell death (apoptosis) and immunomodulatory activity. CD38 is highly and uniformly expressed on the surface of MM cells, making it a target for antibody-based therapeutics such as Sarclisa. In the US, the non-proprietary name for Sarclisa is isatuximab-irfc, with irfc as the suffix designated in accordance with nonproprietary naming of biological products guidance for industry issued by the US FDA.\n\nCurrently Sarclisa is approved in more than 50 countries, including the US and EU, across two indications; Sarclisa is approved under an additional indication in the US. In Europe, based on the ICARIA-MM phase 3 study, Sarclisa is approved in combination with pomalidomide and dexamethasone for the treatment of patients with relapsed refractory MM (RRMM) who have received ≥2 prior therapies, including lenalidomide and a proteasome inhibitor and who progressed on last therapy. Based on the IKEMA phase 3 study, Sarclisa is also approved in 50 countries in combination with carfilzomib and dexamethasone, including in the US for the treatment of patients with RRMM who have received 1–3 prior lines of therapy and in the European Union for patients with MM who have received at least 1 prior therapy. In the US, Sarclisa is also approved in combination with VRd as a first line treatment option for adult patients with NDMM who are not eligible for ASCT, based on the IMROZ phase 3 study.\n\nSanofi continues to advance Sarclisa as part of a patient-centric clinical development program, which includes several phase 2 and phase 3 studies across the MM treatment continuum spanning six potential indications. In addition, the company is evaluating a subcutaneous administration method for Sarclisa in clinical studies. The safety and efficacy of Sarclisa has not been evaluated by any regulatory authority outside of its approved indications and methods of delivery.\n\nIn striving to become the number one immunoscience company globally, Sanofi remains committed to advancing oncology innovation. Through focused strategic decisions the company has reshaped and prioritized its pipeline, leveraging its expertise in immunoscience to drive progress. Efforts are centered on difficult-to-treat cancers such as select hematologic malignancies and solid tumors with critical unmet needs, including multiple myeloma, acute myeloid leukemia, certain types of lymphomas, as well as gastrointestinal and lung cancers.\n\nFor more information on Sarclisa clinical studies, please visit [www.clinicaltrials.gov](http://www.clinicaltrials.gov).\n\n_About Sanofi_ We are an innovative global healthcare company, driven by one purpose: we chase the miracles of science to improve people’s lives.

Risk factors\nImportant factors that could cause actual financial, business, research, or operating results to differ materially from expectations\nare disclosed in this annual report, including without limitation the following risk factors. Investors should carefully consider all the\ninformation set forth in the following risk factors and elsewhere in this document before deciding to invest in any of the\nCompany’s securities. In addition to the risks listed below, we may be subject to other material risks that as of the date of this\nreport are not currently known to us or that we deem immaterial at this time.\nRisks relating to legal and regulatory matters\nProduct liability claims could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition\nProduct liability is a significant risk for any pharmaceutical company, given that liability claims relating to our industry are\nunforeseeable by nature. The evolving regulatory environment worldwide (the ever-more stringent regulatory requirements\napplicable to the pharmaceutical industry, plus more stringent data, quality and supply obligations) clearly impacts our potential\nliability, and we may incur different liability claims to what we have handled in the past, with regard to their nature, scope and\nlevel. For a detailed analysis of the regulatory environment in which we operate, refer to “Item 4. Information on the Company - B.\nBusiness Overview - B.5.3 Regulatory framework.” Substantial damages have been awarded by some jurisdictions and/or\nsettlements agreed – notably in the United States and other common law jurisdictions – against pharmaceutical companies\nbased on claims for injuries allegedly caused by the use of their products. Such claims can also lead to product recalls,\nwithdrawals, or declining sales, and/or be accompanied by consumer fraud claims by customers, third-party payers seeking\nreimbursement of the cost of the product and/or other claims, including potential civil or criminal governmental actions.\nWe are currently defending a number of product liability claims (see Note D.22.a. to the consolidated financial statements\nincluded at Item 18. of this annual report) notably with respect to TAXOTERE, ZANTAC, DEPAKINE and GOLD BOND, and there\ncan be no assurance that we will be successful in defending these claims, or that we will not face additional claims in the future.\nEstablishing the full side effect profile of a pharmaceutical drug goes beyond data derived from preapproval clinical studies\nwhich may only involve several hundred to several thousand patients. Routine review and analysis of the continually growing\nbody of post-marketing safety data and clinical trials provide additional information – for example, potential evidence of rare,\npopulation-specific or long-term adverse events or of drug interactions that were not observed in preapproval clinical studies.\nThis causes product labeling to evolve over time following interactions with regulatory authorities, which may include restrictions\nof therapeutic indications, new contraindications, warnings or precautions and occasionally even the suspension or withdrawal of\na product marketing authorization. Following any of these events, pharmaceutical companies can face significant product liability\nclaims (see Note D.22.a. to the consolidated financial statements included at Item 18. of this annual report).\nFurthermore, we commercialize several devices (some of which use new technologies) which, if they malfunction, could cause\nunexpected damage and lead to product liability claims (see “Breaches of data security, disruptions of information technology\nsystems and cyber threats could result in financial, legal, business or reputational harm” below).\nSANOFI FORM 20-F 2023 1\nPART I\nITEM 3. Key Information\nAlthough we continue to insure a portion of our product liability with third-party carriers, product liability coverage is increasingly\ndifficult and costly to obtain, particularly in the United States. In the future, it is possible that self-insurance may become the sole\ncommercially reasonable means available for managing the financial risk associated with product liability in our pharmaceuticals\nand vaccines businesses (see “Item 4. Information on the Company — B. Business Overview — B.8. Insurance and Risk\nCoverage”). In cases where we self-insure, the legal costs that we would bear for handling such claims, and potential damage\nawards to be paid to claimants, could have a negative impact on our financial condition. Due to insurance conditions, even when\nwe have insurance coverage, recoveries from insurers may not be totally successful due to market-driven insurance limitations\nand exclusions. Moreover, insolvency of an insurer could affect our ability to recover claims on policies for which we have already\npaid a premium.\nProduct liability claims, regardless of their merits or the ultimate success of our defense, are costly, divert management’s\nattention, may harm our reputation, and can impact the demand for our products and generate speculative news flows and/or\nrumors relating to such claims. Substantial product liability claims could materially adversely affect our business, results of\noperations and financial condition, and/or may have an impact on market perception of our company and negatively affect our\nstock price.\nClaims and investigations relating to ethics and business integrity, competition law, marketing practices,\npricing, human rights of workers and other legal matters could adversely affect our business, results of\noperations and financial condition\nOur industry is heavily regulated and legal requirements vary from country to country, and new requirements are imposed on our\nindustry from time to time. Governments and regulatory authorities around the world have been strengthening implementation\nand enforcement activities in recent years, including in relation to anti-bribery, anti-corruption and ethical requirements with\nrespect to medical and scientific research, interactions with healthcare professionals and payers, and respect for the human\nrights of workers.\nWe have adopted a Code of Conduct that requires employees to comply with applicable laws and regulations, as well as the\nspecific principles and rules of conduct set forth in the Code. We also have policies and procedures designed to help ensure that\nwe, our officers, employees, agents, intermediaries and other third parties comply with applicable laws and regulations (including\nbut not limited to the US Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA), the UK Bribery Act, the OECD Anti-Bribery Convention, the\nFrench Anti-Corruption measures law (Sapin II), the French duty of vigilance law and other anti-bribery laws and regulations).\nNotwithstanding these efforts, failure to comply with laws and regulations (including as a result of a business partner’s breach)\nmay occur and could result in liabilities for us and/or our management.\nSanofi and certain of its subsidiaries could become the subject of investigations or proceedings by various government entities or\ncould face audits and/or litigation, including allegations of corruption, claims related to employment matters, patent and\nintellectual property disputes, consumer law claims, competition law and tax audits. We are currently the target of a number of\nlawsuits relating to pricing and marketing practices (including, for example, “whistleblower” litigation in the United States), which\nwe are vigorously defending. With respect to tax issues, the complexity of the fiscal environment is such that the ultimate\nresolution of any tax matter may result in payments that are greater or less than the amounts we have accrued. See\n“Item 8. Financial Information — A. Consolidated Financial Statements and Other Financial Information — Information on Legal or\nArbitration Proceedings” and Note D.22. to our consolidated financial statements included at Item 18. of this annual report. In\naddition, responding to such investigations is costly and may divert management’s attention from our business.\nUnfavorable outcomes in any of these matters, or in similar matters that may arise in the future, could preclude the\ncommercialization of our products, harm our reputation, negatively affect the profitability of existing products and subject us to\nsubstantial fines, punitive damages, penalties and injunctive or administrative remedies, potentially leading to the imposition of\nadditional regulatory controls, monitoring or self-reporting obligations, or exclusion from government reimbursement programs\nor markets, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.\nThe unpredictability of these proceedings could lead Sanofi, after consideration of all relevant factors, to enter into settlement\nagreements to settle certain claims. Such settlements may involve significant monetary payments and/or potential criminal\npenalties, may include admissions of wrongdoing and may require entering into a Corporate Integrity Agreement (CIA) or a\nDeferred Prosecution Agreement (in the United States), which is intended to regulate company behavior for a specified number\nof years. For example, on February 28, 2020, Sanofi US entered into a civil settlement with the United States Department of\nJustice and agreed to pay approximately $11.85 million to resolve allegations regarding certain charitable donations Sanofi US\nmade to an independent patient assistance foundation that assisted patients being treated for multiple sclerosis. In connection\nwith this settlement, Sanofi US also entered into a CIA with the Office of the Inspector General for the United States Department\nof Health and Human Services effective the same day, which will require us to meet and maintain certain compliance\nrequirements in the United States.\nOur activities (including our products and manufacturing activities) are subject to significant\ngovernment regulations and regulatory approvals, which are often costly and could result in adverse\nconsequences to our business if we fail to anticipate the regulations, comply with them, maintain the\nrequired approvals, and/or adapt to changes in applicable regulations\nObtaining a marketing authorization for a product is a long and highly regulated process requiring us to present extensive\ndocumentation and data to the relevant regulatory authorities either at the time of the filing of the application for a marketing\nauthorization or later during its review. Each regulatory authority may impose its own requirements which can evolve over time.\n2 SANOFI FORM 20-F 2023\nPART I\nITEM 3. Key Information\nEach regulatory authority may also delay or refuse to grant approval even though a product has already been approved in\nanother country. Regulatory authorities are increasingly strengthening their requirements on product safety and risk/benefit\nprofiles. All of these requirements, including post-marketing requirements, have increased the costs associated with maintaining\nmarketing authorizations (see “Item 4. Information on the Company — B. Business Overview — B.5. Markets — B.5.3. Regulatory\nframework”).\nMoreover, to monitor our compliance with applicable regulations, the FDA, EMA, WHO and comparable national agencies in other\njurisdictions routinely conduct regulatory inspections of our facilities, distribution centers, commercial activities and development\ncenters (including hospitals), and may identify potential deficiencies which we must adequately address. For example, in\nNovember 2020, the FDA issued a Complete Response Letter (CRL) regarding the Biologics License Application (BLA) for\nsutimlimab, a monoclonal antibody for the treatment of hemolysis in adults with cold agglutinin disease (which has been\napproved in the meantime), referring to certain deficiencies identified by the agency during a pre-license inspection of a third-\nparty facility responsible for manufacturing. More generally, if we fail to adequately respond to regulatory inspection\nobservations identified during an inspection or fail to comply with applicable regulatory requirements at all or within the targeted\ntimeline, we could be subject to enforcement, remedial and/or punitive actions by the FDA (such as a Warning Letter, injunction,\nseizure or cease and desist order), the EMA or other regulatory authorities. In addition, we have an obligation to monitor and\nreport adverse events and safety signals. In order to comply with these duties, we must regularly train our employees and certain\nthird parties (such as external sales forces and distributor employees) on regulatory matters, including on pharmacovigilance. If\nwe fail to train these people, or fail to train them appropriately, or if they do not comply with contractual requirements, we may be\nexposed to the risk that safety events are not reported or not reported in a timely manner in breach of our reporting obligations.\nDue to regulatory or geopolitical constraints, we may face delays in our clinical trials due, for example, to the new EU Clinical Trials\nRegulation review process for approvals of new trials or for the transition of ongoing trials under such new regulation, and/or\nrestrictions imposed on clinical trial sites, and/or delays in the supply chain for investigational products and/or the initiation and\nenrollment of patients in our clinical trials, and/or disruptions related to regulatory approvals, for instance due to the inability of\nhealth authorities to perform inspections in other countries and/or delays in label expansions for existing products. We may not\nbe able to fully mitigate these delays, which could negatively impact the timing of our pipeline development programs and may\nhave a negative impact on our product development and launches and hence on future product sales, business and results of\noperations.\nIn addition, all aspects of our business, including research and development, manufacturing, marketing, reimbursement, pricing\nand sales, are subject to extensive legislation and governmental regulation. Changes in applicable laws and the costs of\ncompliance with such laws and regulations could have an adverse effect on our business.\nFor example, in response to the European Union regulations for Medical Devices (EU MDR), which entered into force in May 2021,\nSanofi created the EU MDR task force. This task force was commissioned to address the risk of potential delays in approvals (for\nnew drug-device combination products, for substantial changes to the design or intended purpose of the device component of\nalready approved drug-device combination products, and for medical devices) and of product discontinuation (for some legacy\nmedical devices), as well as compliance risks for existing products due to increased requirements for post-marketing surveillance,\nclinical evaluations, traceability and transparency. A similar task force was set up in the first quarter of 2021 to examine risks\nrelated to the new regulations for In-Vitro Diagnostic Devices (IVDR) implemented in May 2022.\nFor information about risks related to changes:\n• in proprietary rights rules and regulations, see “– We rely on our patents and other proprietary rights to provide exclusive\nrights to market certain of our products. If such patents and other rights were limited, invalidated or circumvented, our\nfinancial results could be adversely affected” below; and\n• in environmental rules and regulations, see “– Management of the historical contamination related to our past industrial\nactivities could adversely impact our results of operations and reputation” below.\nIn addition, changes in tax laws or regulations or their interpretation or exposures to additional tax liabilities around the world\ncould negatively impact our operating results. Changes to tax laws or regulations may occur at any time, and any related expense\nor benefit recorded may be material to the fiscal quarter and year in which the law change is enacted.\nFurthermore, most of the jurisdictions in which we operate have double tax treaties with other foreign jurisdictions, which provide\na framework for mitigating the impact of double taxation on our revenues and capital gains. However, the outcome of those\nmechanisms developed to resolve such conflicting claims can be uncertain and can be expected to be very lengthy. Accruals for\ntax contingencies are made based on experience, interpretations of tax law, and judgments about potential actions by tax\nauthorities. However, due to the complexity of tax contingencies, the ultimate resolution of any tax matter may result in\npayments materially different from the amounts accrued.\nWe rely on our patents and other proprietary rights to provide exclusive rights to market certain of our\nproducts. If such patents and other rights were limited, invalidated or circumvented, our financial results\ncould be adversely affected\nThrough patent and other proprietary rights, such as data exclusivity or supplementary protection certificates in Europe, we hold\nexclusivity rights for a number of our research-based products. However, the protection that we are able to obtain varies in its\nduration and scope. Furthermore, patents and other proprietary rights do not always provide effective protection for our\nproducts. We cannot be certain that we will obtain adequate patent protection for new products and technologies in important\nmarkets or that such protections, once granted, will last as long as originally anticipated.\nSANOFI FORM 20-F 2023 3\nPART I\nITEM 3. Key Information\nFor example, governmental authorities are increasingly looking to facilitate generic and biosimilar competition for existing\nproducts through new regulatory proposals intended to achieve, or resulting in, changes to the scope of patent or data\nexclusivity rights and through the use of accelerated regulatory pathways for generic and biosimilar drug approvals. At the EU\nlevel, the proposed wide-ranging revision of the general pharmaceutical legislation may pose downside risks to innovation and\ncompetitiveness in Europe, primarily due to the reduction of intellectual property (IP) protections and a stricter incentives\nframework for orphan medicinal products (OMPs). Such regulatory proposals could make patent prosecution for new products\nmore difficult and time consuming or could adversely affect the exclusivity period for our products.\nMoreover, manufacturers of generic products or biosimilars are increasingly seeking to challenge patent validity or coverage\nbefore the patents expire, and manufacturers of biosimilars or interchangeable versions of the products are seeking to have their\nversion of the product approved before the exclusivity period ends. Furthermore, in an infringement suit against a third party, we\nmay not prevail and the decision rendered may not conclude that our patent or other proprietary rights are valid, enforceable or\ninfringed. Our competitors may also successfully avoid our patents. Even in cases where we ultimately prevail in an infringement\nclaim, legal remedies available for harm caused to us by infringing products may be inadequate to make us whole. Moreover, a\nsuccessful result against a competing product for a given patent or in a specific country is not necessarily predictive of our future\nsuccess against another competing product or in another country because of local variations in the patents and patent laws.\nIn addition, if we lose patent protection as a result of an adverse court decision or a settlement, we face the risk that government\nand private third-party payers and purchasers of pharmaceutical products may claim damages alleging they have over-\nreimbursed or overpaid for a drug. For example, in 2009, in Australia, our patent on clopidogrel was ultimately held invalid.\nFollowing this decision, the Australian Government sought damages for its alleged over-reimbursement of clopidogrel drugs due\nto the preliminary injunction we had secured against the sale of generic clopidogrel during the course of the litigation. The\nAustralian Government’s claim was dismissed following two decisions, one of the Federal Court of Australia in April 2020 and one\nof the Full Court of the Federal Court of Australia in June 2023. On December 18, 2023, the Australian Government was granted a\nspecial leave to appeal to the High Court of Australia.\nWe also rely on unpatented proprietary technology, know-how, trade secrets and other confidential information, which we seek\nto protect through various measures, including confidentiality agreements with licensees, employees, third-party collaborators,\nand consultants who may have access to such information. If these agreements are breached or our other protective measures\nshould fail, then our contractual or other remedies may not be adequate to cover our losses.\nIn certain cases, to terminate or avoid patent litigation we or our collaboration partners may be required to obtain licenses from\nthe holders of third-party intellectual property rights. Any payments under these licenses may reduce our profits from such\nproducts and we may not be able to obtain these licenses on favorable terms or at all.\nThird parties may also request a preliminary or permanent injunction in a country from a court of law to prevent us from\nmarketing a product if they consider that we infringe their patent rights in that country. If third parties obtain a preliminary or\npermanent injunction or if we fail to obtain a required license for a country where valid third-party intellectual property rights as\nconfirmed by a court of law exist, or if we are unable to alter the design of our technology to fall outside the scope of third-party\nintellectual property rights, we may be unable to market some of our products in certain countries, which may limit our\nprofitability.\nIn addition, the pursuit of valid business opportunities may require us to challenge intellectual property rights held by others that\nwe believe were improperly granted, including through negotiation and litigation, and such challenges may not always be\nsuccessful. Third parties may claim that our products infringe one or more patents owned or controlled by them. Claims of\nintellectual property infringement can be costly and time-consuming to resolve, may delay or prevent product launches, and may\nresult in significant royalty payments or damages.\nFurthermore, some countries may consider granting a compulsory license to a third party to use patents protecting an\ninnovator’s product, which limits the value of the patent protection granted to such products.\nWe have increased the proportion of biological therapeutics in our pipeline relative to traditional small molecule pharmaceutical\nproducts. Typically, the development, manufacture, sale and distribution of biological therapeutics is complicated by third-party\nintellectual property rights (otherwise known as freedom to operate (FTO) issues), to a greater extent than for the small molecule\ntherapeutics, because of the types of patents allowed by national patent offices. Further, our ability to successfully challenge\nthird-party patent rights is dependent on the legal interpretation and case law of national courts. In addition, we expect to face\nincreasing competition from biosimilars in the future. With the accelerated regulatory pathways provided in the United States\nand Europe for biosimilar drug approval, biosimilars can be a threat to the exclusivity of any biological therapeutics we sell or may\nmarket in the future and can pose the same issues as the small molecule generic threat described above. If a biosimilar version of\none of our products were to be approved, it could reduce our sales and/or profitability of that product.\nWe currently hold trademark registrations and have trademark applications pending in many jurisdictions, any of which may be\nthe subject of a governmental or third-party objection, which could prevent the maintenance or issuance of the trademark. As\nour products mature, our reliance on our trademarks and trade dress to differentiate us from our competitors increases and, as a\nresult, our business could be adversely affected if we are unable to prevent third parties from adopting, registering or using\ntrademarks and trade dress that infringe, dilute or otherwise violate our rights.\nIf our patents and/or proprietary rights to our products were limited or circumvented, our financial results could be adversely\naffected.\n4 SANOFI FORM 20-F 2023\nPART I\nITEM 3. Key Information\nFailure to comply with data ethics and privacy regulations could adversely affect our business and\nreputation\nWe operate in an environment that relies on the collection, processing, analysis and interpretation of large sets of patients’ and\nother individuals’ personal data, and the operation of our business requires data to flow freely across borders of numerous\ncountries.\nThe legal and regulatory environment of data privacy is diversified, with regional legislation such as the General Data Protection\nRegulation (GDPR) in Europe, the Personal Information Protection Law (PIPL) enacted in 2021 in China, and other significant\nprivacy legislation, including the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) in the United States. As the framework continues to\nevolve, some uncertainty remains with respect to absence of clear guidance or case law.\nSuch uncertainty could result in an operational risk limiting or preventing the transfer of data across borders, which may have an\nimpact on our activities (e.g., on clinical trials). Breach of the regulations described above could also carry financial sanctions and\nmay harm our reputation and those of our activities that rely on personal data processing.\nFurthermore, the increasing volume of data processed and advances in new technologies, such as artificial intelligence, have\nresulted in a greater focus on data governance and the ethical use of personal data. Failure in our data governance and ethical\nuse of personal data could affect our business and reputation.\nRisks relating to our business\nThe pricing and reimbursement of our products is negatively affected by increasing cost containment\npressures and decisions of governmental authorities and other third parties\nThe commercial success of our existing products and our product candidates depends in part on their pricing and reimbursement\nconditions. Our products are negatively affected by continued downward pricing pressure and scrutiny due, inter alia, to:\n• stricter price and access controls imposed by governments and other payers around the world:\n– requirements for greater transparency around drug pricing and drug development costs,\n– widespread use of international reference pricing and therapeutic reference pricing, among other pricing methodologies\nand caps,\n– mandatory price cuts, renegotiations, industry payback and rebates,\n– delisting from reimbursement and restrictions on the label population,\n– access restrictions for high-priced innovative medicines,\n– prescribing guidelines and binding medicine utilization controls,\n– Medicare drug price negotiations under the US Inflation Reduction Act (IRA),\n– greater use of tendering and centralized procurement (national/regional/class-wide level),\n– cross-country cooperation in price negotiations, contracting or procurement, which is already occurring to some extent,\nsuch as the Vaccine Alliance (GAVI), the COVID-19 Vaccines Global Access (COVAX) initiative, the BeNeLuxA alliance in\nEurope, and the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO),\n– shifting of the payment burden to US patients and access disruptions through co-pay accumulator and maximizer\nprograms as well as alternative funding programs,\n– more aggressive formulary utilization management controls (including stepped therapy, strict prior authorization criteria,\nformulary exclusions) by US insurers and pharmacy benefits managers (PBMs), and\n– discriminatory and non-transparent pricing and procurement policies (e.g. government procurement restrictions, import\nbans) in favor of domestic pharmaceutical companies;\n• widespread use of health technology assessment (HTA) to inform coverage and reimbursement decisions:\n– more stringent evidence and value requirements (e.g. comparative effectiveness, patient preferences, real-word evidence,\nhealth economic modelling) by payers and HTA authorities, raising the bar for market entry,\n– unreasonable thresholds for cost-effectiveness, and\n– increasingly restrictive HTA decisions with significant variation across markets;\n• increased generic and biosimilar competition, accelerating price erosion:\n– next generation biosimilars coming to the market across major therapeutic areas,\n– potential savings from increased biosimilar use, expected to be a cumulative $285 billion globally through 2025 according\nto the IQVIA Institute, and\n– evolving regulatory landscapes to support interchangeability (e.g., in the US and EU) and pharmacy substitution (e.g. in the\nEU Nordic countries, Germany and France).\nIn the United States, which accounted for 43.0% of our net sales in 2023, the IRA was enacted in August 2022. The law includes\nthree core drug pricing provisions (Medicare negotiation, Part D redesign, and Medicare inflation penalties) with effective dates\nranging from 2022 through 2026. The IRA legislation is likely to have a negative impact on industry revenue growth and future\ninnovation. While significant uncertainties remain on the process and methods of Medicare negotiation, we anticipate exposure\nto the negotiation provision in the latter part of the decade, and in the case of DUPIXENT not before 2031.\nSANOFI FORM 20-F 2023 5\nPART I\nITEM 3. Key Information\nFurthermore, we face increasing pricing pressure and gross-to-net (GTN) erosion from continuing vertical integration and\nconsolidation of the US health insurance market. With the three largest pharmacy benefit manager group purchasing\norganizations (PBM GPOs) (i.e. Ascent, Zinc and Emisar) now covering over 85% of prescription drug claims, consolidation has led\nto increased utilization management and restrictive formularies, resulting in strong bargaining power to negotiate discounted\nprices, thereby adversely impacting our sales.\nThere is also uncertainty about the potential impact of the continued growth of the federal 340B drug pricing program, among\nother risks.\nIn China, pricing pressure is likely to intensify as a growing number of our products are subject to national reimbursement drug list\n(NRDL) price negotiations and national volume-based procurement (VBP) tenders, with the lowest prices prevailing to compete\nwith local champions. At market entry, new drugs listed on the NRDL had an average price cut of 60% over the past five years.\nFurther expansion of the VBP policy to biologics and biosimilars also poses a growing threat to our key established products, with\nover 500 drugs targeted for inclusion by 2025.\nIn Europe, budget pressure remains high in the wake of Covid-19, translating into an acceleration of cost-containment policies in\nmajor EU markets.\nThe industry is also facing high uncertainty in the context of the new pharmaceutical strategy in Europe, including numerous\npolicy changes to the EU pharmaceutical legislation, HTA and joint procurement, among others. If passed, these reforms will likely\ncreate new challenges and risks for access, innovation and competitiveness in Europe, primarily because of the reductions in\nregulatory data protection (from eight to six years for all new drugs) and market exclusivity for orphan medicines.\nOur research and development efforts may not succeed in adequately renewing our product portfolio\nDiscovering and developing a new product is a costly, lengthy and uncertain process. To be successful in the highly competitive\npharmaceutical industry, we must commit substantial resources each year to research and development in order to develop new\nproducts to compensate for decreasing sales of products facing patent expiration and termination of regulatory data exclusivity,\nintroduction of lower-priced generics, or competition from new products of competitors that are perceived as being superior or\nequivalent to our products. We must pursue both early-stage research and early and late development stages in order to propose\na sustainable and well-balanced portfolio of products. In 2023, we spent €6,728 million on research and development, amounting\nto 15.6% of our net sales. As part of an update on our strategy, we announced in October 2023 our intent to increase our research\nand development investments. Failure to invest in the right technology platforms, therapeutic areas, product classes, geographic\nmarkets and/or licensing opportunities could adversely impact the productivity of our pipeline.\nWe are pursuing our strategic transformation through R&D, including potential multi-indication assets such as amlitelimab,\nfrexalimab and the oral TNFR1si, intended to address unmet patient needs in markets with low penetration of advanced therapies.\nWe focus our R&D strategy on oncology, immunology and inflammation, multiple sclerosis, neurology, rare diseases and rare\nblood disorders. In 2021, Sanofi acquired Translate Bio to accelerate the deployment of mRNA technology for the development of\nnew vaccines, including for seasonal influenza, and beyond vaccines, therapeutics where there is a strong unmet medical need.\nHowever, mRNA technology is still in its early days and the ability of this technology to produce strong results and safety still\nremains to be fully asserted. We may also fail to improve our development productivity sufficiently to sustain our pipeline (see\nalso “— We may fail to successfully identify external business opportunities or realize the anticipated benefits from our strategic\ninvestments or divestments” below). Other new innovations under investigation, such as natural killer (NK) cells and conditionally\nactivated biologics, raise similar uncertainties.\nIn addition, the competitive landscape includes a high level of uncertainty as numerous companies are working on or may be\nevaluating similar targets and a product considered as promising at the beginning of its development may become less attractive\nif a competitor addressing the same unmet need reaches the market earlier. There can be no assurance that any of our product\ncandidates will be proven safe or effective (see “Item 4. Information on the Company — B. Business Overview — B.4. Global\nresearch & development”). Over these research and development cycles, usually spanning several years, there is a substantial risk\nat each stage of development – including pre-clinical activities and clinical trials – that we will not achieve our goals of safety\nand/or efficacy and that we will have to abandon a product in which we have invested substantial amounts of money and human\nresources. For instance, in 2022 patient enrollment of Phase 3 tolebrutinib trials paused globally after a decision of the FDA\nregarding potential side effects. As another example, the global clinical development program of amcenestrant (breast cancer)\nwas discontinued in August 2022 following the outcome of the prespecified interim analysis of a Phase 3 trial. More and more\ntrials are designed with clinical endpoints of superiority; failure to achieve those endpoints could damage the product’s outlook\nand our overall development program.\nDecisions concerning the studies to be carried out can have a significant impact on the marketing strategy for a given product.\nMultiple in-depth studies can demonstrate that a product has additional benefits, facilitating the product’s marketing, but such\nstudies are expensive and time consuming and may delay the product’s submission to regulatory authorities for approval.\nIn addition, following (or in some cases contemporaneously with) the marketing authorization, the dossier is also submitted to\ngovernmental agencies and/or national or regional third-party payers (HTA bodies) for review. These HTA bodies evaluate\nevidence on the value of the new product, assess the medical need it serves, and provide recommendations on the\ncorresponding reimbursement. Such analyses may require additional studies, including comparative studies, which may\neffectively delay marketing, change the population which the new product treats, and add costs to its development. Our\ncontinuous investments in research and development for future products and for the launches of newly registered molecules\ncould therefore result in increased costs without a proportionate increase in revenues, which would negatively affect our\noperating results and profitability.\n6 SANOFI FORM 20-F 2023\nPART I\nITEM 3. Key Information\nLastly, there can be no assurance that all the products approved or launched will achieve commercial success.\nIn addition, even after a product reaches the market, certain developments following regulatory approval may decrease demand\nfor our products. Clinical trials and post-marketing surveillance of certain marketed drugs have the potential to raise concerns\namong some prescribers and patients relating to the safety or efficacy of pharmaceutical products in general, which could\nnegatively affect the sales of such products or lead to increased volatility in market reaction.\nBreaches of data security, disruptions of information technology systems and cyber threats could result\nin financial, legal, competitive, operational, business or reputational harm\nOur business depends heavily on the use of interdependent information technology systems, including Internet-based systems\nand digital tools. Certain key areas such as research and development, production and sales are to a large extent dependent on\nour information systems (including cloud-based computing) or those of third-party providers (including for the storage and\ntransfer of critical, confidential, sensitive or personal information regarding our patients, clinical trials, vendors, customers,\nemployees, collaborators and others). We are therefore vulnerable to cybersecurity attacks and incidents and misuse or\nmanipulation of any of these IT systems could result in exposure of confidential information or the modification of critical data.\nWe and our third-party service providers, suppliers, contract manufacturers, distributors or other contracting third parties use, to\nthe best of our ability, secure information technology systems for the protection of data and threat detection. Like many\ncompanies, we may experience certain of the following events which pose a risk to the security and availability of these systems\nand networks, and the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of our sensitive data: breakdown, outages, service disruption or\nimpairment, data loss or deterioration in the event of a system malfunction or increasing threat of data theft or corruption in the\nevent of a cyber-attack, security breach, industrial espionage attacks, insider threat attacks, cybercrimes, including state-\nsponsored cybercrimes, malware, misplaced or lost data, programming or human errors or other similar events. Also, in the event\nof an attack, US and European legislation related to the financing of terrorism imposes increasing restrictions on payments of\nransom. As a result, our ability to recover the data might be limited. Therefore, our business continuity could be at risk if we are\nunable to recover data through back-ups and restorations.\nWe are increasingly using generative artificial intelligence to enhance our business processes. Although we have set up a\ngovernance body to control the artificial intelligence initiatives taken on a company-wide scale and have made a generative\nartificial intelligence charter available to all our employees, this new technology, like other artificial intelligence technology,\nentails risks linked to transparency and explainability, privacy and confidentiality, eco-responsibility, and cybersecurity. Those\nrisks could lead to, among other things, unethical practices, business and reputational harm, cyber-attacks and security breaches\n(see \"— We may fail to develop or take advantage of digitalization and prioritizing data as an organizational asset\" below).\nEach of these events could negatively impact important processes, such as scientific research and clinical trials, the submission of\noutcomes to health authorities for marketing authorizations, the functioning of production processes and the supply chain,\ncompliance with legal requirements, trade secrets, security strategies and other key activities, including Sanofi’s employees’\nability to communicate between themselves as well as with third parties (see also “— Product liability claims could adversely\naffect our business, results of operations and financial condition” above). This could result in material financial, legal, competitive,\noperational, business or reputational harm.\nAlthough we maintain relevant insurance coverage, this insurance may not be sufficiently available in the future to cover the\nfinancial, business or reputational losses that may result from an interruption or breach of our systems. For example, certain types\nof cyber-attacks could be considered as an Act of War subject to insurance exclusion.\nThe manufacture of our products is technically complex, and supply interruptions, product recalls or\ninventory losses caused by unforeseen events may reduce sales, adversely affect our operating results\nand financial condition, delay the launch of new products and negatively impact our image\nMany of our products are manufactured using technically complex processes with production constraints, including the need for\nspecialized facilities, trained and certified employees, and highly specific raw materials. We must ensure that all manufacturing\nprocesses comply with (i) current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMP), (ii) other applicable regulations issued by governmental\nhealth authorities around the world, as well as (iii) our own quality standards. Third parties supply us with a portion of our raw\nmaterials, active ingredients and medical devices, which exposes us to the risk of a supply shortage or interruption especially in\nthe event that these suppliers are unable to manufacture our products in line with quality standards or if they experience financial\ndifficulties.\nEpidemics and other public health crises, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, expose us to risks of a slowdown or temporary\nsuspension in the production of our APIs, raw materials, and some of our products. Any prolonged restrictive measures put in\nplace in order to control an outbreak of contagious disease or other adverse public health development, in any of our principal\nproduction sites, may have a material and adverse effect on our manufacturing operations. Any of these factors could adversely\naffect our business, operating results or financial condition (see “Item 4. Information on the Company — B. Business Overview\n— B.7. Production and raw materials” for a description of these outsourcing arrangements and “A failure in our crisis and business\ncontinuity management processes in case of unpredictable events could have negative consequences for our business,\noperations and reputation” below).\nOur business may require the transformation and adaptation of our plants in order to ensure the continuity of production of our\nproducts in sufficient quantities to satisfy demand. This may be necessary to meet the need for the production of new products,\nincluding biologics, or to ensure the scaling up production of products under development once approved. This need may also\nresult from new regulatory requirements. Furthermore, our biological products, in particular, are subject to the risk of\nSANOFI FORM 20-F 2023 7\nPART I\nITEM 3. Key Information\nmanufacturing stoppages or the risk of loss of inventory because of the difficulties inherent in the processing of biological\nmaterials and the potential difficulties in accessing adequate amounts of raw materials meeting required standards. In addition,\nspecific storage and distribution conditions are required for many biological products (for example, cold storage is required for\ncertain vaccines, insulin-based products and some hemophilia products). These production difficulties may also be encountered\nduring testing, which is a mandatory requirement prior to drug products being released.\nThe complexity of our production processes, as well as standards required for the manufacture of our products, subject us to risks\nbecause the investigation and remediation of any identified or suspected problems can cause production delays, substantial\nexpense, product recalls or lost sales and inventories, and delay the launch of new products; this could adversely affect our\noperating results and financial condition, and cause reputational damage and the risk of product liability (see “— Product liability\nclaims could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition” above). In addition, some of our\nproduction sites, and some of our suppliers’ and/or contractors’ sites, are located in areas exposed to natural disasters such as\nfloods, earthquakes and hurricanes. Such disasters could be exacerbated by climate change. In the event of a major disaster, we\ncould experience severe destruction or interruption of our operations and production capacity at these sites.\nWhen manufacturing disruptions occur, we may not have alternate manufacturing capacity, particularly for certain biologics. In\nthe event of manufacturing disruptions, our ability to use backup facilities or set up new facilities is more limited because\nbiologics are more complex to manufacture and generally require dedicated facilities. Even though we aim to have backup\nsources of supply whenever possible, including by manufacturing backup supplies of our principal active ingredients at additional\nfacilities when practicable, we cannot be certain they will be sufficient if our principal sources become unavailable. Switching\nsources and manufacturing facilities requires significant time and prior approval by health authorities.\nSupply shortages generate even greater negative reactions when they occur with respect to life saving medicines with limited or\nno viable therapeutic alternatives. Shortages of specific products can have a negative impact on the confidence of patients,\ncustomers and professional healthcare providers and the image of Sanofi and may lead to lower product revenues.\nA substantial share of the revenue and income of Sanofi depends on the performance of certain flagship\nproducts\nAs part of the presentation of our strategy in December 2019, we announced our intent to prioritize our activities on growth\ndrivers including DUPIXENT and our Vaccines operations, which we have identified as key growth drivers. Nevertheless market\nexpansion and new launches of medicines and vaccines may not deliver the expected benefits. We may also encounter failures or\ndelays in our launch strategy (in terms of timing, pricing, market access, marketing efforts and dedicated sales forces), such that\nour products that may not deliver the expected benefits. The competitive environment for a given product may also have\nchanged by the time of the actual launch, modifying our initial expectations. The need to prioritize the allocation of resources\nmay also cause delays in or hamper the launch or expansion of some of our products.\nAlso, we currently generate a substantial share of our net sales from certain key products (see “Item 5. Operating and\nFinancial Review and Prospects — A.2. Results of Operations — Year ended December 31, 2023 compared with year ended\nDecember 31, 2022 — A.2.1.3/Net Sales — Biopharma segment”). For example, DUPIXENT generated net sales of €10,715 million\nin 2023 representing 24.9% of our net sales for the year and is Sanofi’s biggest product in terms of sales.\nAmong our flagship products, LANTUS, LOVENOX, PLAVIX and JEVTANA already face generic competition on the market.\nLANTUS is particularly important; it was one of Sanofi’s leading products in 2023 with net sales of €1,420 million. AUBAGIO,\nanother leading product, has faced generic competition in the US since March 2023, following a settlement agreement entered\ninto in 2017 and in Europe since the fourth quarter of 2023.\nMore generally, an expiration of effective intellectual property protections for our products typically results in the market entry of\none or more lower-priced generic competitors, often leading to a rapid and significant decline in revenues on those products (for\ninformation regarding ongoing patent litigation see Note D.22.b. to the consolidated financial statements included at Item 18. of\nthis annual report).\nThe introduction of a generic product results in adverse price and volume effects for our branded or genericized products. For\nexample, although we do not believe it is possible to state with certainty what level of net sales would have been achieved in the\nabsence of generic competition, a comparison of our consolidated net sales for 2023 and 2022 for the main products affected by\ngeneric and biosimilar competition shows a loss of €651 million of net sales on a reported basis (see “Item 5. Operating and\nFinancial Review and Prospects — A.1.2. Impacts of Competition from generics and biosimilars”). However, other parameters may\nhave contributed to the loss of sales, such as a fall in the average price of certain products (e.g., LANTUS).\nFurthermore, in general, if one or more of our flagship products were to encounter problems (such as material product liability\nlitigation, unexpected side effects, product recalls, non-approval by the health authorities of a new indication for a marketed\nproduct, pricing pressure and manufacturing or supply issues), the adverse impact on our business, results of operations and\nfinancial condition could be significant.\nWe rely on third parties for the discovery, manufacture, marketing and distribution of some of our\nproducts\nOur industry is both highly collaborative and competitive, whether in the discovery and development of new products, in-\nlicensing, the marketing and distribution of approved products, or manufacturing activities. We expect that we will continue to\nrely on third parties for key aspects of our business and we need to ensure our attractiveness as a potential partner.\n8 SANOFI FORM 20-F 2023\nPART I\nITEM 3. Key Information\nWe conduct a number of significant research and development programs and market some of our products in collaboration with\nother biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies. For example, we currently have a global strategic collaboration with\nRegeneron on monoclonal antibodies for the development and commercialization of DUPIXENT, KEVZARA (sarilumab) and\nSAR440340 (REGN3500- itepekimab) (see “Item 5. Operating and Financial Review and Prospects — A.1.7. Financial\nPresentation of Alliances — A.1.7.1/ Alliance Arrangements with Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc.”). We rely upon Regeneron to\nsuccessfully carry out their responsibilities with regard to the manufacture and supply of these collaboration antibodies.\n(see “Item 4. Information on the Company — B. Business Overview”). We may rely on partners to design and manufacture medical\ndevices as well, notably for the administration of our products. Finally, we may also rely on partners for the development and\ncommercialization of in-vitro diagnostic tests used in clinical trials and in-vitro diagnostic tests which are specified in the labeling\nof our products as necessary or useful for the management of patients taking our products.\nAs regards products recently launched or under development for which we have a collaboration agreement with partners, the\nterms of the applicable alliance agreement may require us to share profits and losses arising from commercialization of such\nproducts with our partners. This differs from the treatment of revenue and costs generated by other products for which we have\nno alliance agreement, and such profit sharing may deliver a lower contribution to our financial results.\nWe could also be subject to the risk that we may not properly manage the decision-making process with our partners. Decisions\nmay be controlled by, or subject to the approval of our collaboration partners, who may have views that differ from ours. We are\nalso subject to the risk that our partners may not perform effectively, which could have a detrimental effect when our\ncollaboration partners are responsible for the performance of certain key tasks or functions, for example related to\nmanufacturing or distribution. This risk is further increased by the growing number of distribution centers divested by Sanofi as\npart of its global strategy and by the resulting growing externalization of distribution tasks and functions.\nAny failures in the development process or differing priorities may adversely affect our business, including the activities\nconducted through our collaboration arrangements. We also cannot guarantee that third-party manufacturers will be able to\nmeet our near-term or long-term manufacturing requirements, for internal reasons (e.g., in case of financial difficulties), reasons\ndirectly related to their contractual relationship with Sanofi, or external reasons (e.g., in the event of a health crisis). Thereby,\nfollowing the completion of the spin-off of EUROAPI in May 2022, EUROAPI became a third-party manufacturer and continues to\nmanufacture a certain number of APIs for Sanofi. We are also subject to the risk that contract research organizations or other\nvendors (for instance regarding digital activities) retained by us or our collaboration partners may not perform effectively.\nAny conflicts or difficulties with our partners during the course of these agreements or at the time of their renewal or\nrenegotiation, or any disruption in the relationships with our partners, may affect the development, manufacturing, launch and/or\nmarketing of certain of our products or product candidates and may cause a decline in our revenues or otherwise negatively\naffect our results of operations.\nWe are subject to the risk of non-payment by our customers(1)\nWe run the risk of delayed payments or even non-payment by our customers, which consist principally of wholesalers,\ndistributors, pharmacies, hospitals, clinics and government agencies. This risk is accentuated by recent concentrations among\ndistributors and retailers, as well as by uncertainties around global credit and economic conditions, in particular in emerging\nmarkets. As a result, we may be affected by fluctuations in the buying patterns of such customers. The United States poses\nparticular customer credit risk issues because of the concentrated distribution system: our three main customers represented\nrespectively 11%, 9% and 7% of our consolidated net sales in 2023. We are also exposed to large wholesalers in other markets,\nparticularly in Europe. An inability of one or more of these wholesalers to honor their debts to us could adversely affect our\nfinancial condition (see Note D.34. to our consolidated financial statements included at Item 18. of this annual report).\nIn some countries, some customers are public or subsidized health systems. The economic and credit conditions in these\ncountries may lead to an increase in the average length of time needed to collect on accounts receivable.\nGlobal economic conditions and an unfavorable financial environment could have negative\nconsequences for our business(2)\nOver the past several years, growth of the global pharmaceutical market has become increasingly tied to global economic\ngrowth. In this context, a substantial and lasting slowdown of the global economy, major national economies or emerging markets\ncould negatively affect growth in the global pharmaceutical market and, as a result, adversely affect our business. For example,\nunpredictable political conditions that currently exist in various parts of the world could have a material negative impact on our\nbusiness, in particular armed conflicts between Russia and Ukraine since 2022, and in Gaza following the terrorist attacks that\noccurred in Israel in October 2023. The consequences of those conflicts are difficult to predict and will depend on developments\noutside Sanofi’s control, including, but not limited to the duration and severity of the conflicts, and the consequences of the\nongoing and additional financial and economic sanctions imposed by governments in response. Other related issues have arisen\nor are arising such as regional instability; geopolitical uncertainties; adverse effects on fuel and energy costs, supply chains,\nmacroeconomic conditions, inflation, and currency exchange rates in various regions of the world; and exposure of third parties\nto gas shortages. Collectively, such unstable conditions could, among other things, disturb the international flow of goods and\nincrease the costs and difficulties associated with international transactions.\n(1) The information in this section supplements the disclosures required under IFRS 7 as presented in Notes B.8.7., D.10. and D.34. to our consolidated\nfinancial statements, provided at Item 18. of this annual report.\n(2) The information in this section supplements the disclosures required under IFRS 7 as presented in Note B.8.7. to our consolidated financial statements,\nprovided at Item 18. of this annual report.\nSANOFI FORM 20-F 2023 9\nPART I\nITEM 3. Key Information\nUnfavorable economic conditions have reduced the sources of funding for national social security systems, leading to austerity\nmeasures including heightened pressure on drug prices, increased substitution of generic drugs, and the exclusion of certain\nproducts from formularies among others (see “— The pricing and reimbursement of our products is negatively affected by\nincreasing cost containment pressures and decisions of governments and other third parties” above).\nFurther, our net sales may be negatively impacted by the continuing challenging global economic environment, as high\nunemployment, increases in cost-sharing, and lack of developed third-party payer systems in certain regions may lead some\npatients to switch to generic products, delay treatments, skip doses or use other treatments to reduce their costs. In the United\nStates there has been a significant increase in the number of beneficiaries in the Medicaid program, under which sales of\npharmaceuticals are subject to substantial rebates and, in many US states, to formulary restrictions limiting access to brand-\nname drugs, including ours. Also, employers may seek to transfer a greater portion of healthcare costs to their employees due to\nrising costs, which could lead to further downward price pressure and/or lower demand.\nOur Consumer Healthcare (CHC) business could also be adversely impacted by difficult economic conditions, as the financial\nresources of our customers may be reduced as a result of the economic situation.\nIf economic conditions worsen, or in the event of default or failure of major players including wholesalers or public sector buyers\nfinanced by insolvent states, our financial situation, the profitability and results of our operations and the distribution channels of\nour products may be adversely affected. See also “— We are subject to the risk of non-payment by our customers” above.\nA failure in our crisis and business continuity management processes in case of unpredictable events\ncould have negative consequences for our business, operations and reputation\nDespite enhanced crisis preparedness and response, due in particular to recent crises such as the COVID-19 pandemic and the\nwar in Ukraine since February 2022, unpredictable and extraordinary internal or external events, or a combination of escalating\nevents that may occur as a result of a large scale cyber-attack (see also “— Breaches of data security, disruptions of information\ntechnology systems and cyber threats could result in financial, legal, competitive, operational, business or reputational harm”\nabove), a pandemic or natural disasters, which could result in the failure of critical processes within Sanofi or a third party on\nwhom we rely. Such failure may adversely impact our business, operations and reputation.\nThe occurrence of these unforeseen events may also heighten other risks such as a disruption or temporary suspension in\nproduction of APIs, raw materials and some of other products and/or lead to manufacturing delays or disruptions and supply\nchain interruptions (including to the extent those measures apply to our third-party suppliers) and may have an adverse effect on\nour business (see “— The manufacture of our products is technically complex, and supply interruptions, product recalls or\ninventory losses caused by unforeseen events may reduce sales, adversely affect our operating results and financial condition,\ndelay the launch of new products and negatively impact our image” above). Also, a sudden increase in demand for selected\nmedicinal products in the event of a crisis can result in short-term unavailability or shortages of raw materials.\nClimate change or legal, regulatory or market measures to address climate change may negatively affect\nour business and results of operations\nClimate change resulting from increased concentrations of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere could\npresent risks to our operations, including an adverse impact on global temperatures, weather patterns and the frequency and\nseverity of extreme weather and natural disasters. Natural disasters and extreme weather conditions, such as a hurricane,\ntornado, earthquake, wildfire or flooding, may pose physical risks to our facilities and disrupt the operation of our supply chain.\nThe impacts of the changing climate on water resources may result in water scarcity, limiting our ability to access sufficient high-\nquality water in certain locations, which may increase operational costs. For example, some of our facilities are located in certain\nareas in France where specific administrative prefectural orders have been issued to regulate the water consumption (e.g.\nprefectural order issued by the Préfet de la Gironde in April 2023 regarding requirements imposed on Sanofi for the operation of\na drug manufacturing facility located in the city of Ambarès-et-Lagrave (i.e. implementation of specific water saving measures in\nthe event of a period of drought)).\nConcern over climate change may also result in new or additional legal or regulatory requirements, designed to reduce\ngreenhouse gas emissions and/or mitigate the effects of climate change on the environment. If such laws or regulations are more\nstringent than current legal or regulatory obligations (e.g. increased carbon taxation risk), we may experience disruption in, or an\nincrease in the costs associated with sourcing, manufacturing and distribution of our products, which may adversely affect our\nbusiness, results of operations or financial condition.\nThe increasing use of social media platforms and new technologies present risks and challenges for our\nbusiness and reputation\nWe increasingly rely on social media, new technologies and digital tools to communicate about our products and about diseases\nor to provide health services. The use of these media requires specific attention, monitoring programs and moderation of\ncomments. Political and market pressures may be generated by social media because of rapid news cycles. This may result in\ncommercial harm, overly restrictive regulatory actions and erratic share price performance. In addition, unauthorized\ncommunications, such as press releases or posts on social media, purported to be issued by Sanofi, may contain information that\nis false or otherwise damaging and could have an adverse impact on our image and reputation and on our stock price. Negative\nor inaccurate posts or comments about Sanofi, our business, directors or officers on any social networking website could seriously\ndamage our reputation. In addition, our employees and partners may use social media and mobile technologies inappropriately,\nwhich may give rise to liability for Sanofi, or which could lead to breaches of data security, loss of trade secrets or other\nintellectual property or public disclosure of sensitive information. Such uses of social media and mobile technologies could have\nan adverse effect on our reputation, business, financial condition and results of operations.\n10 SANOFI FORM 20-F 2023\nPART I\nITEM 3. Key Information\nRisks relating to Sanofi’s structure and strategy\nWe may fail to successfully identify external business opportunities or realize\nthe anticipated benefits from our strategic investments or divestments\nWe pursue a strategy of selective acquisitions, in-licensing and collaborations in order to reinforce our pipeline and portfolio. We\nare also proceeding to selective divestments to focus on key business areas. The implementation of this strategy depends on our\nability to identify transaction opportunities, mobilize the appropriate resources in order to enter into agreements in a timely\nmanner, and execute these transactions on acceptable economic terms. Moreover, entering into in-licensing or collaboration\nagreements generally requires the payment of significant “milestones” well before the relevant products reach the market,\nwithout any assurance that such investments will ultimately become profitable in the long term (see Note D.21.1. to the\nconsolidated financial statements included at Item 18. of this annual report and also “— We rely on third parties for the discovery,\nmanufacture, marketing and distribution of some of our products” above). Once a strategic transaction is agreed upon with a\nthird party, we may not be able to complete the transaction in a timely manner or at all.\nFor newly acquired activities or businesses, our growth objectives could be delayed or ultimately not realized, and expected\nsynergies could be adversely impacted if, for example:\n• we are unable to integrate those activities or businesses quickly or efficiently;\n• key employees leave; or\n• we have higher than anticipated integration costs.\nThe Translate Bio acquisition (see in “— Our research and development efforts may not succeed in adequately renewing our\nproduct portfolio” above) which was completed in 2021 may not generate the expected results in terms of developing new\nmRNA-based products to meet existing or future needs, and the potential of Translate Bio’s mRNA platform may not be realized\nto its full extent or because of the difficulty of integrating the activity quickly and efficiently into the Group.\nWe may also miscalculate the risks associated with business development transactions at the time they are made or may lack the\nresources or ability to access all the relevant information to evaluate such risks properly, including regarding the potential of\nresearch and development pipelines, manufacturing issues, tax or accounting issues, compliance issues, or the outcome of\nongoing legal and other proceedings. It may also take a considerable amount of time and be difficult to implement a risk analysis\nand risk mitigation plan after the acquisition of an activity or business is completed due to lack of historical data. Acquired\nbusinesses may not always be in full compliance with legal, regulatory or Sanofi standards, including, for example, current Good\nManufacturing Practices (cGMP), which can be costly and time consuming to remedy. As a result, risk management and coverage\nof such risks, particularly through insurance policies, may prove to be insufficient or ill-adapted.\nWith respect to divestments, their financial benefit could be impacted if we face significant financial claims or significant post-\nclosing price adjustments. Furthermore, the value of the assets to be divested may deteriorate while we are in the process of\nexecuting our divestment strategy, with the risk that we do not realize the anticipated benefits.\nBecause of the active competition among pharmaceutical groups for business development opportunities, there can be no\nassurance of our success in completing these transactions when such opportunities are identified.\nThe globalization of our business exposes us to increased risks in specific areas\nAs part of the presentation of our strategy in December 2019, we identified our strong presence in China among our core drivers,\nwith revenue amounting to 6.8% of our net sales in 2023.\nNevertheless, the difficulties in operating in emerging markets, a significant decline in the anticipated growth rate or an\nunfavorable movement of the exchange rates of currencies against the euro could impair our ability to take advantage of growth\nopportunities and could adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition. For instance, if a long-lasting\nepidemic and prolonged or repeated restrictive measures to control the outbreak were to result in an economic slowdown in any\nof our targeted markets, it would reduce our sales due to lower healthcare spending on other diseases and fewer promotional\nactivities, and could significantly impact our business operations. Furthermore, it is not possible to predict if or how the current\nhealth crisis will impact any particular affected jurisdiction, or to what extent (see also “— Global economic conditions and an\nunfavorable financial environment could have negative consequences for our business” above).\nEmerging markets also expose us to more volatile economic conditions, political instability (including a backlash in certain areas\nagainst free trade), competition from multinational or locally based companies that are already well established in these markets,\nthe inability to adequately respond to the unique characteristics of emerging markets (particularly with respect to their\nunderdeveloped judicial systems and regulatory frameworks), difficulties in recruiting qualified personnel or maintaining the\nnecessary internal control systems, potential exchange controls, weaker intellectual property protection, higher crime levels\n(particularly with respect to counterfeit products), and compliance issues including corruption and fraud (see particularly\n“— Claims and investigations relating to ethics and business integrity, competition law, marketing practices, pricing, human rights\nof workers, data protection and other legal matters could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial\ncondition” above).\nSANOFI FORM 20-F 2023 11\nPART I\nITEM 3. Key Information\nWe may fail to develop or take advantage of digitalization and prioritizing data as an organizational asset\nWe have undertaken several digital initiatives, such as the implementation of artificial intelligence across the business. For\nexample, in research and development, we have built multiple artificial intelligence programs to reduce research times through\nimproved predictive modelling and we seek to automate time-consuming activities, enabling research and development teams to\nscale and accelerate research processes and improve potential target identification in therapeutic areas such as immunology,\noncology and neurology. In manufacturing and supply, we have developed an in-house artificial intelligence-enabled yield\noptimization solution, which enables consistently higher yield levels and optimizes usage of raw materials, contributing to our\nenvironmental objectives and supporting improved cost efficiency. Other examples include the opening in June 2022 of the\nArtificial Intelligence Centre of Excellence in Toronto, joining our global network of existing digital hubs in Paris, Boston, New York\nand Barcelona, which focuses on using leading technologies to develop world-class data and artificial intelligence products that\naccelerate research and development; the opening in March 2022 of our Accelerator, an internal unit that functions like a startup\nbusiness within Sanofi to develop products and solutions that will support our mission to transform the practice of medicine with\nthe use of digital, data and artificial intelligence; the Future4Care initiative of June 2021, where we joined a startup incubator\nalong with other CAC40 companies to help nurture emerging leaders in health tech; or our enabled manufacturing facility in\nthe US.\nOur success in these efforts will depend on many factors including data availability; technology architecture; entering into\nsuccessful partnerships and alliances with technology companies; a profound transformation of the organization, including a\ncultural change among our employees and the development of relevant skills; attracting and retaining employees with\nappropriate skills and mindsets in a tight labor market; and successfully innovating across a variety of technology fields. The\nCOVID-19 pandemic has accelerated our digital transformation, including in the ways we engage and interact with our\nstakeholders. However, there is no guarantee that our efforts toward a digital transformation will succeed. More generally, we\nmay fail to capture the benefits of digitalization and valuing data as an enterprise asset at an appropriate cost and/or in a timely\nmanner, and/or enter into appropriate partnerships. Competitors, including new entrants such as tech companies, may outpace\nus in this fast-moving area. If we fail to adequately integrate digital capabilities into our organization and business model, we\ncould lose patients and market share. This could have an adverse impact on our business, prospects and results of operations.\nThe success of digital initiatives will also depend on our ability to shift our culture to a data-driven culture. This calls for clear\naccountability for data and a collectively owned operating model with supporting tools and competencies to manage data as an\nasset, and for the definition of a robust life-cycle management process for data that is applied consistently across Sanofi. Good\noverall management of data supports our overall operations and the delivery of exponential capabilities, including artificial\nintelligence and machine learning to fulfil our innovation and efficiency ambitions. Failure to do so could result in business,\noperational and financial harm.\nWe may fail to accelerate our operational efficiency and perform our transformation program\nAs part of the presentation of the next chapter of our Play to Win strategy in October 2023, we announced our intent to improve\nour operating efficiencies to fund growth. We also announced savings of a total of up to €2 billion from 2024 to the end of 2025,\nmost of which will be reallocated to fund innovation and growth drivers. We further announced our intent to separate the CHC\nbusiness in the fourth quarter of 2024 at the earliest, most likely via the creation of a publicly listed entity headquartered in\nFrance. To deploy our strategy, we must also disrupt our normal course of business and transform our operations. Nevertheless,\nwe may not succeed in federating employees behind the transformation program, which may hamper our ability to execute such\norganizational changes. Besides, there is no guarantee that we will be able to fully deliver these operating efficiencies or separate\nthe CHC business within the targeted timeline, or at all, or generate the expected benefits.\nUnsuccessful management of sustainability (environmental, social and governance) matters could\nadversely affect our reputation and we may experience difficulties to meet the expectations of our\nstakeholders\nCompanies are increasingly expected to behave in a responsible manner on a variety of sustainability matters, by governmental\nand regulatory authorities, counterparties such as vendors and suppliers, customers, investors, the public at large and others. This\ncontext, driven in part by a rapidly changing regulatory framework in the US and in Europe, is raising new challenges and\ninfluencing strategic decisions that companies must take if they wish to optimize their positive impact and mitigate their negative\nimpact on sustainability matters.\nWe have adopted a sustainability strategy that aims at ensuring global access and affordability, addressing unmet needs with\ntransformative therapies, and minimizing the impact of our activities and products on the climate and the environment. The\nstrategy includes leveraging our personnel’s experience and making societal impact a key driver of our employees’ engagement.\nHowever, despite our strong commitment we could be unable to meet our sustainability or other strategic objectives in an\nefficient and timely manner, or at all.\nWe may also be unable to meet the ever more demanding criteria used by rating agencies in their sustainability assessments\nprocess, leading to a downgrading in our rating. Financial investments in companies which perform well in sustainability\nassessments are increasingly popular, and major institutional investors have made known their interest in investing in such\ncompanies. Depending on sustainability assessments and on the rapidly changing views on acceptable levels of action across a\nrange of sustainability topics from investors, we may be unable to meet society’s or investors’ expectations, our reputation may\nbe harmed, we may face increased compliance or other costs and demand for securities issued by us and our ability to participate\nin the debt and equity markets may decrease.\n12 SANOFI FORM 20-F 2023\nPART I\nITEM 3. Key Information\nOur success depends in part on our senior management team and other key employees and our ability to\nattract, integrate and retain key personnel and qualified individuals in the face of intense competition\nOur success depends on the expertise of our senior management team and other key employees. In 2023, there\nwere 2,264 “Senior Leaders” within Sanofi. In addition, we rely heavily on recruiting and retaining talented people to help us meet\nour strategic objectives. We face intense competition for qualified individuals for senior management positions, or in specific\ngeographic regions or in specialized fields such as clinical development, biosciences and devices, or digital and artificial\nintelligence. Our ability to hire qualified personnel also depends in part on our ability to reward performance, incentivize our\nemployees and pay competitive compensation. The inability to attract, integrate and/or retain highly skilled personnel, in\nparticular those in leadership positions, may weaken our succession plans, may materially adversely affect the implementation of\nour strategy and our ability to meet our strategic objectives, and could ultimately adversely impact our business or results of\noperations.\nEnvironmental and safety risks of our industrial activities\nRisks from manufacturing activities and the handling of hazardous materials could adversely affect our\nresults of operations and reputation\nManufacturing activities, such as the chemical manufacturing of the active ingredients in our products and the related storage\nand transportation of raw materials, products and waste, expose us to risks of industrial accidents that may lead to discharges or\nreleases of toxic or pathogenic substances or other events that can cause personal injury, property damage and environmental\ncontamination, and may result in additional operational constraints, including the shutdown of affected facilities and/or the\nimposition of civil, administrative, criminal penalties and/or civil damages, and affect Sanofi’s reputation.\nThe occurrence of an industrial accident may significantly reduce the productivity and profitability of a particular manufacturing\nfacility and adversely affect our operating results and reputation. Although we maintain property damage, business interruption\nand casualty insurance that we believe is in accordance with customary industry practices, this insurance may not be adequate to\nfully cover all potential hazards incidental to our business.\nManagement of the historical contamination related to our past industrial activities could adversely\nimpact our results of operations and reputation\nThe environmental laws of various jurisdictions impose actual and potential obligations on our Company to manage and/or\nremediate contaminated sites. These obligations may relate to sites:\n• that we currently own or operate;\n• that we formerly owned or operated; or\n• where waste from our operations was disposed.\nThese environmental remediation obligations could reduce our operating results. Sanofi accrues provisions for remediation when\nour management believes the need is probable and that it is reasonably possible to estimate the cost. See “Item 4. Information on\nthe Company — B. Business Overview — B.9. Health, Safety and Environment” for additional information regarding our\nenvironmental policies. In particular, our provisions for these obligations may be insufficient if the assumptions underlying these\nprovisions prove incorrect or if we are held responsible for additional, currently undiscovered contamination. These judgments\nand estimates may later prove inaccurate, and any shortfalls could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and\nfinancial condition. For more detailed information on environmental issues, see “Item 4. Information on the Company\n— B. Business Overview — B.9. Health, Safety and Environment and Notes B.12. and D.19.3. to the consolidated financial\nstatements”.\nWe are or may become involved in claims, lawsuits and administrative proceedings relating to environmental matters.\nSome current and former Sanofi subsidiaries have been named as “potentially responsible parties” or the equivalent under\nthe US Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980, as amended (CERCLA, also known\nas “Superfund”), and similar statutes or obligations in France, Germany, Italy, Brazil and elsewhere. As a matter of statutory or\ncontractual obligations, we and/or our subsidiaries may retain responsibility for environmental liabilities at some of the sites of our\npredecessor companies, or of subsidiaries that we demerged, divested or may divest. We have disputes outstanding regarding\ncertain sites no longer owned or operated by the Company. An adverse outcome in such disputes might have an adverse effect\non our operating results. See Note D.22.d to the consolidated financial statements included at Item 18. of this annual report and\n“Item 8. Financial Information — A. Consolidated Financial Statements and Other Financial Information — Information on Legal or\nArbitration Proceedings”.\nEnvironmental regulations are evolving. For example, in Europe, new or evolving regulatory regimes include the Registration,\nEvaluation, Authorization and Restriction of Chemicals Regulation (which would include, if passed, the restriction proposal on\nper- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) recently released by the European Chemicals Agency (ECHA)); the Classification and\nLabelling regulations applicable to hazardous chemicals; directives related to the control of major-accident hazards (the “Seveso”\ndirectives); the Industrial Emission regulations; the Waste Framework Directive; the Emission Trading Scheme Directive; the Water\nFramework Directive; the Directive on Taxation of Energy Products and Electricity; as well as other regulations aimed at\npreventing climate change. Stricter environmental, safety and health laws and enforcement policies could result in substantial\ncosts and liabilities to our Company and could subject our handling, manufacture, use, reuse or disposal of substances or\npollutants, site restoration and compliance to more rigorous scrutiny than is currently the case. Consequently, compliance with\nthese laws could result in capital expenditures as well as other costs and liabilities, thereby adversely affecting our business,\nresults of operations or financial condition.\nSANOFI FORM 20-F 2023 13\nPART I\nITEM 3. Key Information\nRisks related to financial markets(3)\nFluctuations in currency exchange rates could adversely affect our results of operations and financial\ncondition\nBecause we sell our products in numerous countries, our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected\nby fluctuations in currency exchange rates. We are particularly sensitive to movements in exchange rates between the euro and\nthe US dollar, the Japanese yen, the Chinese yuan, and currencies in emerging markets. In 2023, 43.0% of our net sales were\ngenerated in the United States, 24.1% in Europe, and 32.9% in the Rest of the World region (see the definition in\n“Item 5. Operating and Financial Review and Prospects — A/ Operating results”), including countries that are, or may in future\nbecome, subject to exchange controls (including 6.8% in China and 3.7% in Japan). While we incur expenses in those currencies,\nthe impact of currency exchange rates on these expenses does not fully offset the impact of currency exchange rates on our\nrevenues. As a result, currency exchange rate movements can have a considerable impact on our earnings. When deemed\nappropriate and when technically feasible, we enter into transactions to hedge our exposure to foreign exchange risks. These\nefforts, when undertaken, may fail to offset the effect of adverse currency exchange rate fluctuations on our results of operations\nor financial condition. For more information concerning our exchange rate exposure, see “Item 11. Quantitative and Qualitative\nDisclosures about Market Risk.”\nRisks relating to an investment in our shares or ADSs\nForeign exchange fluctuations may adversely affect the US dollar value of our ADSs and dividends\n(if any) regardless of our operating performance\nHolders of ADSs face exchange rate risks. Our ADSs trade in US dollars and our shares trade in euros. The value of the ADSs and\nour shares could fluctuate substantially as the exchange rates between these currencies fluctuate. If and when we pay dividends,\nthey would be denominated in euros. Fluctuations in the exchange rate between the euro and the US dollar will affect the\nUS dollar amounts received by owners of ADSs upon conversion by the depositary of cash dividends, if any. Moreover, these\nfluctuations may affect the US dollar price of the ADSs on the NASDAQ Global Select Market (NASDAQ) whether or not we pay\ndividends, in addition to any amounts that a holder would receive upon our liquidation or in the event of a sale of assets, merger,\ntender offer or similar transaction denominated in euros or any foreign currency other than US dollars.\nPersons holding ADSs rather than shares may have difficulty exercising certain rights as a shareholder\nHolders of ADSs may have more difficulty exercising their rights as a shareholder than if they directly held shares. For example, if\nwe issue new shares and existing shareholders have the right to subscribe for a pro rata portion of the new issuance, the\ndepositary is allowed, at its own discretion, to sell this right to subscribe for new shares for the benefit of the ADS holders instead\nof making that right available to such holders. In that case, ADS holders could be substantially diluted. Holders of ADSs must also\ninstruct the depositary how to vote their shares. Because of this additional procedural step involving the depositary, the process\nfor exercising voting rights will take longer for holders of ADSs than for holders of shares. ADSs for which the depositary does not\nreceive timely voting instructions will not be voted at any meeting. US investors may have difficulty in serving process or\nenforcing a judgment against us or our directors or executive officers.\nSales of our shares may cause the market price of our shares or ADSs to decline\nSales of large numbers of our shares, or a perception that such sales may occur, could adversely affect the market price for our\nshares and ADSs. To our knowledge, L’Oréal, our largest shareholder, is not subject to any contractual restrictions on the sale of\nthe shares it holds in our Company. L’Oréal does not consider its stake in our Company as strategic.\nOur largest shareholder owns a significant percentage of the share capital and voting rights of Sanofi\nAs of December 31, 2023, L’Oréal held approximately 9.35% of our issued share capital, accounting for approximately 16.77% of\nthe voting rights (excluding treasury shares) of Sanofi. See “Item 7. Major Shareholders and Related Party Transactions — A. Major\nShareholders”. Affiliates of L’Oréal currently serve on our Board of Directors. To the extent L’Oréal continues to hold a large\npercentage of our share capital and voting rights, it will remain in a position to exert greater influence in the appointment of the\ndirectors and officers of Sanofi and in other corporate actions that require shareholders’ approval.\n(3) The information in this section supplements the disclosures required under IFRS 7 as presented in Note B.8.7. to our consolidated financial statements,\nprovided at Item 18. of this annual report.\n14 SANOFI FORM 20-F 2023\nPART I\nITEM 4. Information on the company\nItem 4. Information on the Company\nIntroduction\nSanofi is a leading global healthcare company, focused on patient needs and engaged in the research, development,\nmanufacture and marketing of therapeutic solutions.\nIn the remainder of this section, a product is referred to either by its international non-proprietary name (INN) or its brand name,\nwhich is generally exclusive to the company that markets it. In most cases, the brand names of our products, which may vary from\ncountry to country, are protected by specific registrations. In this document, products are identified by their brand names used in\nFrance and/or in the US.\nIn 2022, Sanofi reported three operating segments: Pharmaceuticals, Vaccines and Consumer Healthcare. As a consequence of\n(i) progress on the “Play to Win” strategy leading to the creation of the standalone Consumer Healthcare Global Business Unit\n(GBU), and (ii) organizational changes to Sanofi’s Manufacturing & Supply global function (previously known as Industrial Affairs),\nwith effect from January 1, 2023, our operations have been split into two operating segments: Biopharma and Consumer\nHealthcare.\nThe Consumer Healthcare operating segment comprises commercial operations relating to our Consumer Healthcare products,\nand research, development and production activities and global support functions dedicated to the segment.\nThe Biopharma operating segment comprises commercial operations and research, development and production activities\nrelating to our Specialty Care, General Medicines and Vaccines franchises, for all geographical territories. The segment’s results\ninclude the costs of global support functions that are outside of the managerial responsibility of the Consumer Health Care GBU.\nOur internal reporting, our segment information, and the layout of this section have been adapted so as to reflect the new\norganizational structure of our operations in a coherent manner.\nA. History and development of the Company\nThe current Sanofi corporation was incorporated under the laws of France in 1994 as a société anonyme, a form of limited liability\ncompany, for a term of 99 years. Since May 2011, we have operated under the commercial name “Sanofi” (formerly known as\nSanofi-Aventis). Our registered office is located at 46, avenue de la Grande Armée – 75017 Paris – France, our main telephone\nnumber is +33 1 53 77 40 00, and our website (which contains information about the company and information filed with and\nprovided to the SEC) is www.sanofi.com. Our principal US subsidiary’s office is located at 55 Corporate Drive, Bridgewater,\nNJ 08807; telephone: +1 (908) 981 5000.\nThe SEC maintains an Internet site at http://www.sec.gov that contains reports, proxy and information statements, and other\ninformation regarding issuers that file electronically with the SEC.\nMain events over the last three years\nOn April 8, 2021, Sanofi acquired the entire share capital of Kymab, a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company developing fully\nhuman monoclonal antibodies with a focus on immune-mediated diseases and immuno-oncology therapeutics.\nOn September 14, 2021, Sanofi finalized the acquisition of Translate Bio, a clinical-stage mRNA therapeutics company.\nOn November 9, 2021, Sanofi completed the acquisition of Kadmon Holdings, Inc. a biopharmaceutical company that discovers,\ndevelops, and markets transformative therapies for disease areas of significant unmet medical need.\nOn February 8, 2022, Sanofi acquired the entire share capital of the immuno-oncology company Amunix Pharmaceuticals, Inc.\n(Amunix), thereby gaining access to Amunix’s innovative PRO-XTEN technology and a promising pipeline of immunotherapies.\nOn May 3, 2022, Sanofi’s General Meeting of Shareholders approved the decision to distribute approximately 58% of the\nshare capital of EUROAPI, a European leader in the development, manufacture, marketing and distribution of Active\nPharmaceutical Ingredients (APIs), in the form of an exceptional dividend in kind to Sanofi shareholders. On the dividend\npayment date of May 10, 2022 (further to the admission of EUROAPI shares to listing on the regulated market of Euronext Paris\non May 6, 2022), Sanofi divested control over EUROAPI and its subsidiaries, resulting in their deconsolidation from the Sanofi\nconsolidated financial statements as of that date. On June 17, 2022 (the date of delivery of the EUROAPI shares to the French\nState via the French Tech Souveraineté fund), EPIC Bpifrance acquired a 12% equity interest in EUROAPI. Following completion of\nthose transactions, Sanofi retains an equity interest of 30.1% in EUROAPI, which has been accounted for using the equity method\nsince the date of loss of control (see note D.6. to the consolidated financial statements).\nOn March 13, 2023, Sanofi and Provention Bio, Inc. (“Provention”), a US-based publicly-traded biopharmaceutical company\ndeveloping therapies to prevent and intercept immune-mediated diseases including type 1 diabetes, entered into an agreement\nunder which Sanofi acquired the outstanding shares of Provention common stock for $25.00 per share in an all-cash transaction\nvalued at approximately $2.8 billion. On April 27, 2023, Sanofi announced the completion of its acquisition of Provention. The\nacquisition adds TZIELD (teplizumab-mzwv), a therapy for type 1 diabetes, to Sanofi’s core General Medicines asset portfolio.\nOn July 28, 2023, Sanofi announced that it had entered into a definitive agreement to acquire ownership of QUNOL, a market-\nleading US-based health & wellness brand. This transaction was intended to strengthen Sanofi CHC in the Vitamin, Mineral and\nSupplements (VMS) category, one of the largest and fastest-growing consumer health categories in the US, focused on the\nSANOFI FORM 20-F 2023 15\nPART I\nITEM 4. Information on the company\ndynamic healthy aging segment. Sanofi’s acquisition of QRIB Intermediate Holdings, LLC was completed on September 29, 2023,\nat a purchase price of $1,419 million.\nMore detailed information about these changes is provided in Note D.1. to our consolidated financial statements, included at\nItem 18. of this annual report.\nB. Business overview\nSanofi’s activities are organized around the following categories: DUPIXENT, Neurology & Immunology, Rare Diseases, Oncology,\nRare Blood Disorders, General Medicines Core Assets and Non-Core Assets, Vaccines, and CHC. Except for CHC, which is a\nstandalone operating segment within the meaning of IFRS 8, all of those activities fall within the Biopharma operating segment.\nB.1. Strategy\nThe market context for Sanofi\nSeveral fundamental trends continue to point to a positive outlook for the pharmaceutical industry. The global population is\ngrowing, and aging, and unmet medical needs remain high. Health needs have further increased, strengthening the key roles of\ninnovation in R&D activities and cutting-edge manufacturing. The industry has taken steps to increase R&D productivity, with the\nobjective of launching a higher number of innovative medicines and vaccines. Patients around the world – including a rising\nmiddle class in emerging markets – are demanding better healthcare, empowered by access to more and more information. It is a\nparticularly exciting time scientifically and technologically: the promise of genomics is being realized, immuno-oncology is\ntransforming cancer treatments, and big data is generating new insights into how to diagnose and treat diseases. Digital\ntechnologies and advanced data analytics are having a transformative effect across sales and marketing activities, R&D and\nmanufacturing, and are acting as enablers for new businesses.\nAt the same time, increased geopolitical uncertainties, inflation, supply shortages, and issues around budget tightening will\ncontinue to put pressure on healthcare costs, and on the entire healthcare value chain. Although we believe that pharmaceuticals\nand vaccines will remain a fundamentally attractive business within that value chain, the bar for innovation will most likely\ncontinue to rise. Payers will continue to put scrutiny on prices and reimbursement criteria, and demand demonstration of real-life\noutcomes to confirm the efficacy of medicines and vaccines. This will be coupled with more innovative pricing and contracting\npractices, and more transparent policies. In view of growing concerns over increasing healthcare costs across global markets, the\npharmaceutical industry will be increasingly judged by its contribution to improved access for patients and to the development of\ninnovative, highly cost-effective medicines.\nStrategic framework\nThe Sanofi “Play to Win” strategy is organized around four key priorities: 1) focus on growth; 2) lead with innovation; 3) accelerate\nefficiency; and 4) reinvent how we work to drive innovation and growth.\n1) Focus on growth\n• DUPIXENT (dupilumab)(1) – By leveraging the product’s unique mechanism of action targeting the type 2 inflammation\npathway and its favorable safety profile, we have raised our DUPIXENT sales peak ambition.\n• Vaccines – Our Vaccines business is expected to deliver mid-to-high single digit net sales growth(2) through differentiated\nproducts, market expansions and launches. Contributors to growth are expected to be pediatric combinations; boosters;\ninfluenza vaccines; meningitis; and BEYFORTUS, which addresses Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV)(3). Sanofi has progressed\nin the field of mRNA technology with our Center of Excellence. At least five First in class / best in class vaccine candidates\nexpected in phase 3 by 2025 across diverse preventative and therapeutic areas.\n• Pipeline – We are focusing our investments on priority projects, including six potentially transformative therapies in\nimmunology, hematology, neurology, vaccines and oncology.\n2) Lead with innovation\nWe have been able to shift from a priority asset list to a steady flow of assets in a refocused, consistent pipeline. Our pipeline is\nshowing potential opportunities for market-leading products.\nTo continue fueling our promising pipeline and enhance our position in our core therapeutic areas, we have:\ni. entered into a strategic collaboration with Teva to co-develop and co-commercialize asset TEV’574, currently in Phase 2b\nclinical trials for the treatment of Ulcerative Colitis and Crohn’s Disease, two types of inflammatory bowel disease;\nii. established a strategic collaboration with Recludix Pharma to advance a novel oral STAT6 inhibitor in multiple immunological\nand inflammatory indications;\niii. expanded an existing collaboration with Scribe Therapeutics to access CRISPR X-Editing (XE) genome editing technologies to\nadvance in vivo genetic medicines for sickle cell and other genomic diseases;\niv. acquired Provention Bio, adding to our portfolio TZIELD, the first disease-modifying treatment for the delay of Stage 3 type 1\ndiabetes;\n(1) In partnership with Regeneron.\n(2) Cumulative Annual Growth Rate (CAGR), 2018-2025.\n(3) In partnership with AstraZeneca.\n16 SANOFI FORM 20-F 2023\nPART I\nITEM 4. Information on the company\nv. established a strategic collaboration with BioMap to co-develop Artificial Intelligence (AI) modules to accelerate drug\ndiscovery for biotherapeutics;\nvi. entered into an exclusivity agreement with Adocia for M1Pram, an innovative combination of insulin and pramlintide\ndeveloped by Adocia to become the reference rapid-acting insulin for people with diabetes and obesity;\nvii. entered into an agreement with Janssen Pharmaceuticals to develop and commercialize the vaccine candidate for\nextraintestinal pathogenic E. coli (9-valent) developed by Janssen, currently in Phase 3;\nviii. modified an existing collaboration agreement with AstraZeneca, giving Sanofi full commercial control of BEYFORTUS\n(nirsevimab) and enhanced agility in the US;\nix. out-licensed the Capeserod Phase 2 program to FirstWave Biopharma so it can be repurposed in gastrointestinal disorders\nwith significant unmet needs, enabled by AI-empowered analyses of the drug’s properties.\n3) Accelerate efficiency\nIn October 2023, we announced new Strategic Costs Initiatives. We are striving to accelerate our efforts to improve our cost\nstructure, launching efficiency initiatives across our Biopharma business that we expect to free operational resources to support\naccelerated R&D investment and unlock value-creation opportunities. This will include prioritizing our investments in R&D and\nmodernizing our approach to commercial delivery. Given our decision to support the full realization of our pipeline’s long-term\npotential, our ongoing investment around new launches as well as pricing headwinds in General Medicines, we are no longer\ntargeting 32% business operating income(4) margin for 2025, while maintaining our focus on long-term profitability.\nTo embrace the transformative effect offered by digital technologies and advanced data analytics, we are investing to become\nthe leading digital healthcare platform for employees, patients and providers. This is expected to help us discover, test and\ndeliver medicines faster, run our business more efficiently, and create engaging digital experiences. The digital transformation\nrequired to meet our ambition is under way. We are using advanced algorithms to harvest real world data to support our R&D\nefforts. We are also developing new go-to-market models by enhanced physician engagement through a variety of channels,\nbuilding precision marketing, and providing better e-commerce capabilities. And in parallel, we are investigating the possibility of\nintegrating drugs, devices, data and services, to bring innovative solutions to patients across many different disease areas such as\ndiabetes and atopic dermatitis.\nIn 2023, we made further progress regarding the implementation of AI across the business:\n• In partnership with Aily Labs, we rolled out plai, an application developed with AI, to more than 23,000 internal users. The\napplication delivers real-time, reactive data interactions and gives a 360° view across our activities, using AI to provide users\nwith timely insights and personalized “what if” scenarios to support informed decision making.\n• In Research, we have built multiple AI programs to reduce research times through improved predictive modelling and\nautomate time-sink activities. As a result, AI assists R&D teams to scale and accelerate research processes from a matter of\nweeks to hours and improve potential target identification in therapeutic areas like immunology, oncology or neurology.\n• In Manufacturing & Supply, we have developed an in-house AI-enabled yield optimization solution which learns from past and\ncurrent batch performance in an effort to enable consistently higher yield levels. This optimizes usage of raw materials,\ncontributes to our environmental objectives and supports improved cost efficiency.\n4) Reinvent how we work\nTransformation and simplification have started, with the aim of increasing empowerment and accountability. To drive\nimplementation of our new culture built on stronger focus, diversity and teamwork, we have streamlined our executive leadership\nteam from 15 to 12 members. Four new members were appointed to the executive leadership team: Madeleine Roach as Head of\nBusiness Operations; Houman Ashrafian as Head of Research & Development (succeeding Dr John Reed), Emmanuel Frenehard\nas Chief Digital Officer (succeeding Arnaud Robert), and Brian Foard as Head of Specialty Care (succeeding Bill Sibold). The\ncomplete Sanofi Executive Committee now includes the four managers who head up our global business units (Specialty Care,\nVaccines, General Medicines, and CHC) as well as the heads of each of the following support functions: Research and\nDevelopment, Manufacturing & Supply (previously named Industrial Affairs), Finance, People & Culture, Digital, Legal, Ethics,\nBusiness Integrity & Global Security and Business Operations.\nIn 2023, we progressed further in building and simplifying our stand-alone CHC organization. We have further reduced our\nportfolio, mainly through divestments, to 117 brands (47% fewer than in 2019). In September 2023 we announced the acquisition\nof QUNOL, a leading US health and wellness brand that strengthens our CHC operations in a key market, and within the\npromising Vitamins, Minerals and Supplements (VMS) segment.\nBy the end of 2023, all the CHC legal entities required to establish a standalone organization had been established, except in\nIndia, and staffed with dedicated teams. Sanofi has announced its intention to separate the CHC Business as it increases its focus\non innovative medicines and vaccines. The intended separation will seek to create two entities, each better equipped to pursue\nits own business strategy, resourcing and capital allocation and enabling each to focus on long-term growth in its respective\nmarkets. Sanofi believes that the separation will unlock further opportunities for CHC to leverage its portfolio of leading brands\nand continue to drive growth and shareholder value. Sanofi is reviewing potential separation scenarios, but believes that the most\nlikely path would be through a capital markets transaction, by creating a listed entity headquartered in France. The timing is\ndriven by the desire to maximize value creation and reward Sanofi shareholders. Subject to market conditions, the separation\ncould be achieved at the earliest in the fourth quarter of 2024, following consultation with social partners.\n(4) Non-IFRS financial measure: see definition in “Item 5 — A.1.5.

Dupilumab is jointly developed by Sanofi and Regeneron under\na global collaboration agreement. To date, dupilumab has been studied across more than 60 clinical trials involving more\nthan 10,000 patients with various chronic diseases driven in part by type 2 inflammation. The dupilumab development program\nhas shown significant clinical benefit and a decrease in type 2 inflammation in Phase 3 trials, establishing that IL-4 and IL-13 are\nkey and central drivers of the type 2 inflammation that plays a major role in multiple inflammatory diseases, such as atopic\ndermatitis (AD), asthma, chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis, eosinophilic esophagitis and prurigo nodularis. DUPIXENT\ncomes in either a pre-filled syringe for use in a clinic or at home by self-administration as a subcutaneous injection or in a pre-\nfilled pen for at-home administration, providing patients with a more convenient option. DUPIXENT is available in all major\nmarkets including the US (since April 2017), most European Union countries (the first launch was in Germany in December 2017),\nJapan (since April 2018), and China (since June 2020).\nAtopic Dermatitis\nModerate-to-severe AD, a form of eczema and a chronic inflammatory disease, is characterized by rashes that sometimes cover\nmuch of the body and can include intense, persistent itching and skin dryness, cracking, redness, crusting and oozing. Eighty-five\nto ninety percent of patients first develop symptoms before five years of age, which can often continue through adulthood.\nIn 2014 the FDA granted DUPIXENT Breakthrough Therapy designation and after a Priority Review evaluation: in March 2017 it\ngranted DUPIXENT marketing authorization for the treatment of adults with moderate-to-severe AD whose disease is not\nadequately controlled with topical prescription therapies, or when those therapies are not advisable. In 2016, the FDA granted\nDUPIXENT Breakthrough Therapy designation for adolescent patients aged 12 to 17 years and in March 2019, the FDA extended\nthe marketing authorization for this age group.\nIn 2016, the FDA granted Breakthrough Therapy designation for DUPIXENT for the treatment of severe AD in children aged\nsix months to 11 years. On May 26, 2020, DUPIXENT was approved as the first biologic medicine for children aged six to 11 years\nwith moderate-to-severe AD. Having accepted DUPIXENT for Priority Review in February 2022, the FDA approved DUPIXENT on\nJune 7, 2022 for children aged six months to five years with moderate-to-severe AD and whose disease is not adequately\ncontrolled with topical prescription therapies or when those therapies are not advisable, making DUPIXENT the first biologic\nmedicine to significantly reduce signs and symptoms in children as young as six months.\n18 SANOFI FORM 20-F 2023\nPART I\nITEM 4. Information on the company\nThe European Commission (EC) approved DUPIXENT in September 2017 for use in adults with moderate-to-severe AD who are\ncandidates for systemic therapy, and extended the marketing authorization in August 2019 to include adolescents aged 12 to\n17 years. On November 30, 2020, the EC extended the marketing authorization to children aged six to 11 years with severe AD and\non June 28, 2021, the DUPIXENT Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC) was updated with long-term data for up to\nthree years, reinforcing the product’s well-established safety profile in adults with moderate-to-severe AD. On January 27, 2023\nthe CHMP adopted a positive opinion for DUPIXENT, recommending expanded approval in the EU to treat severe AD in children\naged six months to five years who are candidates for systemic therapy. In March 2023, DUPIXENT was approved by the EC as the\nfirst and only targeted medicine for children as young as six months old with severe AD.\nOn June 19, 2020, the National Medical Products Administration (NMPA) in China approved DUPIXENT for adults for the\ntreatment of moderate-to-severe AD after identifying dupilumab as an overseas medicine regarded as urgently needed in clinical\npractice, leading to an expedited review and approval process. On December 28, 2020, the National Healthcare Security\nAdministration (NHSA) officially announced the results of the 2020 National Reimbursement Drug List (NRDL) negotiations, with\nDUPIXENT 300 mg included in the updated NRDL effective March 1, 2021. DUPIXENT was approved in China in September 2021\nfor adolescents aged 12-17 years with moderate-to-severe AD. The indication for children aged six years and over, along with the\nadolescent and adult AD indications, was included in the current NRDL reimbursement scope, which was reviewed during the\nDUPIXENT NRDL renewal in 2022 in accordance with the two-year cycle for the China access process. In May 2023, DUPIXENT\nwas approved in China to treat moderate to severe AD in infants and children aged six months and older.\nOn January 22, 2018, the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare (MHLW) in Japan granted marketing and manufacturing\nauthorization for DUPIXENT for the treatment of AD in adults not adequately controlled with existing therapies. More recently, on\nSeptember 25, 2023 DUPIXENT was approved in Japan to treat patients with moderate-to-severe AD aged six months and older.\nIn April 2023, new late-breaking abstract data from a long-term efficacy open-label study presented at the Revolutionizing\nAtopic Dermatitis (RAD) 2023 Spring Conference in Washington, DC showed that DUPIXENT demonstrated robust and sustained\nefficacy with progressive improvement of AD signs and symptoms in patients with moderate-to-severe AD who completed up to\nfive years of treatment: the longest duration of data for any biologic medicine in this disease. Additionally, the long-term safety\ndata from a 52-week open-label extension trial in children aged six months to five years reinforced the well-established safety\nprofile of DUPIXENT observed across all other approved age groups. This data is built on the existing evidence supporting the\nselective way DUPIXENT inhibits IL4/IL-13 pathways, both key and central drivers of the type 2 inflammation, thereby\nsignificantly improving itch and skin lesions and other important measures that impact a patient’s quality of life. In June 2023, the\ninclusion of the results from the five-year OLE Trial for Adults into the DUPIXENT label was approved in Europe, and in\nOctober 2023, by the FDA in the US.\nIn March 2023, positive results from the clinical trial assessing DUPIXENT in adults and adolescents with uncontrolled moderate-\nto-severe atopic hand and foot dermatitis were presented in a late-breaking session, one of more than 20 DUPIXENT scientific\npresentations, at the American Academy of Dermatology (AAD) 2023 Annual Meeting. The trial evaluating a biologic for this\ndifficult-to-treat population met its primary and key secondary endpoints. In August 2023, the clinical section of the DUPIXENT\nlabel in Europe was updated to include the hand and foot dermatitis population. In January 2024, the DUPIXENT US label was\nupdated with data further supporting use in atopic dermatitis with moderate-to-severe hand and foot involvement.\nThese Phase 3 data are from the first and only trial evaluating a biologic specifically for this difficult-to-treat population and have\nalso been added to the DUPIXENT label in the European Union, with regulatory submissions underway in additional countries.\nAsthma\nDUPIXENT was granted marketing authorization by the FDA in October 2018 as an add-on maintenance therapy in patients with\nmoderate-to-severe asthma aged 12 years and older with an eosinophilic phenotype or with oral corticosteroid-dependent\nasthma. In May 2019, the EC approved DUPIXENT for use as an add-on maintenance treatment in severe asthma patients aged\n12 years and older with type 2 inflammation whose symptoms are inadequately reduced by other treatments.\nIn September 2020, new long-term data from a Phase 3 open-label extension trial showed sustained improvement in lung\nfunction and reduction in severe exacerbations in adults and adolescents with moderate-to-severe asthma. On May 17, 2021,\ndetailed results from a Phase 3 trial showed DUPIXENT significantly reduced severe asthma attacks, and within two weeks rapidly\nimproved lung function in children aged six to 11 years with uncontrolled moderate-to-severe asthma with evidence of type 2\ninflammation. Moreover, DUPIXENT significantly improved overall asthma symptom control and reduced an airway biomarker of\ntype 2 inflammation, called fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO), that plays a major role in asthma.\nIn October 2021, the FDA approved DUPIXENT as an add-on maintenance treatment for patients aged six to 11 years with\nmoderate-to-severe asthma characterized by an eosinophilic phenotype or with oral corticosteroid-dependent asthma, thereby\nbringing a new treatment for children who may be suffering from life-threatening asthma attacks and poor lung function\naffecting their ability to breathe, which could potentially continue into adulthood. On April 7, 2022, the EC approved DUPIXENT\nfor use in children aged six to 11 years as an add-on maintenance treatment for severe asthma with type 2 inflammation\ncharacterized by raised blood eosinophils and/or raised FeNO, whose symptoms are inadequately reduced with medium to high\ndose inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) plus another medicinal product for maintenance treatment.\nIn March 2019, DUPIXENT was approved in Japan for treating patients aged 12 years and over with severe or refractory asthma\nand whose symptoms are inadequately controlled with existing therapies. In November 2023, DUPIXENT received approval in\nChina for treatment of moderate to severe asthma patients aged 12 years and over with T2 inflammation.\nSANOFI FORM 20-F 2023 19\nPART I\nITEM 4. Information on the company\nChronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis (CRSwNP)\nCRSwNP is a chronic disease of the upper airway that obstructs the sinuses and nasal passages. It can lead to breathing\ndifficulties, nasal congestion and discharge, reduced or loss of sense of smell and taste, and facial pressure.\nIn June 2019, the FDA approved DUPIXENT for use with other medicines to treat CRSwNP in adults whose disease is not\ncontrolled. In October 2019, the EC approved DUPIXENT for use as an add-on therapy with intranasal corticosteroids in adults\nwith severe CRSwNP for whom therapy with systemic corticosteroids and/or surgery do not provide adequate disease control. In\nMarch 2020, the Japanese Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Agency approved DUPIXENT as add-on maintenance treatment\nfor adults with inadequately controlled CRSwNP.\nEosinophilic esophagitis (EoE)\nEoE is a chronic and progressive inflammatory disease that damages the esophagus and prevents it from working properly;\nswallowing even small amounts of food can be a painful and worrisome choking experience. In severe cases, a feeding tube may\nbe the only option to ensure proper calorific intake and adequate nutrition. As the disease progresses, patients may continue to\nexperience symptoms despite multiple treatments.\nOn September 14, 2020, the FDA granted Breakthrough Therapy designation to DUPIXENT for the treatment of patients aged\n12 years and older with EoE, and subsequently accepted the file for Priority Review on April 4, 2022. On May 20, 2022, the FDA\napproved DUPIXENT to treat patients with EoE aged 12 years and older. With this approval, DUPIXENT became the first and only\nmedicine specifically indicated to treat EoE in the US.\nOn December 16, 2022, the EMA CHMP adopted a positive opinion, recommending the approval of dupilumab in the EU to treat\nadults and adolescents with EoE. On January 30, 2023, the EC expanded the marketing authorization for DUPIXENT in the EU to\ninclude the treatment of EoE in adults and adolescents aged 12 years and older.\nThere are currently no approved treatments specifically indicated for children under 12 years of age with EoE. On July 14, 2022, a\nDUPIXENT Phase 3 trial showed positive results in children aged 1 to 11 years with EoE, making this the fifth pediatric pivotal trial\nacross three type 2 inflammatory diseases to reinforce the well-established efficacy and safety profile of DUPIXENT. In\nJanuary 2024, DUPIXENT was approved for the treatment of adult and pediatric patients aged one year or older, weighting at\nleast 15 kg, with oesinophilic esophagitis (EoE). The EoE pediatric indication was submitted in the EU in the fourth quarter of 2023.\nPrurigo Nodularis (PN)\nPN is a chronic, debilitating skin disease with underlying type 2 inflammation and has one of the highest impacts on a patient’s\nquality of life among inflammatory skin diseases due to the extreme itch it causes. Those with prurigo nodularis experience\nintense, persistent itch, with thick skin lesions (called nodules) that can cover most of the body. The disease is often painful – with\nburning, stinging and tingling of the skin – and can negatively affect mental health, daily living activities and social interactions.\nHigh-potency topical steroids are commonly prescribed but are associated with safety risks if used long-term.\nThe FDA evaluated the DUPIXENT application for prurigo nodularis under Priority Review on May 31, 2022. On\nSeptember 29, 2022, the FDA approved DUPIXENT for the treatment of adult patients with prurigo nodularis. With this approval,\nDUPIXENT became the first and only medicine specifically indicated to treat prurigo nodularis in the US. The FDA approval\nwas based on data from two Phase 3 trials evaluating the efficacy and safety of DUPIXENT in adults with prurigo nodularis.\nEfficacy in these trials assessed the proportion of subjects with clinically meaningful reduction in itch, clearing of skin, or\nboth. On December 15, 2022, the EC expanded the marketing authorization for DUPIXENT in the EU to treat adults with\nmoderate-to-severe prurigo nodularis who are candidates for systemic therapy, after the previous positive recommendation\non November 11, 2022.\nThe DUPIXENT prurigo nodularis indication was approved in Japan on June 26, 2023, and in China on September 22, 2023.\nChronic Spontaneous Urticaria (CSU)\nCSU is a chronic inflammatory skin disease characterized by the sudden onset of hives on the skin and/or swelling deep under the\nskin. Despite standard-of-care treatment, people with CSU often experience symptoms including a persistent itch or burning\nsensation, which can be debilitating and significantly impact quality of life. Swelling often occurs on the face, hands and feet, but\ncan also affect the throat and upper airways. On July 29, 2021 a pivotal Phase 3 trial evaluating DUPIXENT in patients with\nmoderate-to-severe CSU met its primary endpoints and all key secondary endpoints at 24 weeks. Adding DUPIXENT to standard-\nof-care antihistamines significantly reduced itch and hives for biologic-naive patients, compared to those treated with\nantihistamines alone (placebo) in Study A (the first of two trials) of the LIBERTY CUPID clinical program.\nStudy B of the clinical trial evaluated DUPIXENT in adults and adolescents who remain symptomatic despite standard-of-care\ntreatment and are intolerant or incomplete responders to an anti-IgE therapeutic (omalizumab). Although positive numerical\ntrends in reducing itch and hives were observed, the study was stopped due to futility based on a pre-specified interim analysis.\nThe safety data were generally consistent with the known safety profile of DUPIXENT in its approved indications. In\nDecember 2022, CSU was submitted to the FDA. In October 2023 the FDA issued a Complete Response Letter (CRL) stating that\nadditional efficacy data are required to support approval; it did not identify any issues with safety or manufacturing. An ongoing\nclinical trial (Study C) continues to enroll patients; the results, due in late 2024, are expected to provide the additional efficacy\ndata.\nJapan's Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare granted marketing and manufacturing authorization for DUPIXENT for the\ntreatment of chronic spontaneous urticaria in February 2024.\n20 SANOFI FORM 20-F 2023\nPART I\nITEM 4.

Financial Presentation of Alliances — Alliance Arrangements\nwith Regeneron.”\nNeurology & Immunology\nMultiple Sclerosis (MS)\nMS is an autoimmune neurological disease in which a person’s immune system attacks the central nervous system, damaging\nmyelin, the protective sheath that covers nerve fibers. This causes a break in communication between the brain and the rest of\nthe body, ultimately destroying the nerves themselves, and causing irreversible damage. More than 2.5 million people suffer\nfrom MS worldwide.\nOur MS franchise consists of AUBAGIO (teriflunomide), a once-daily, oral immunomodulator, and LEMTRADA (alemtuzumab), a\nmonoclonal antibody. Both products treat patients with relapsing forms of MS.\nAUBAGIO\nAUBAGIO (teriflunomide), a small molecule immunomodulatory agent with anti-inflammatory properties, is a once-daily oral\ntherapy.\nAUBAGIO is approved in more than 80 countries around the world including the US (since September 2012) for the treatment of\npatients with relapsing forms of MS; the EU (since August 2013) for the treatment of adult patients with relapsing remitting MS;\nand China (since July 2018). In June 2021, the EC approved AUBAGIO for the treatment of pediatric patients aged 10 to 17 years\nwith relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS).\nIn 2017, Sanofi reached settlement with all 20 generic AUBAGIO ANDA first filers, granting each a royalty-free license to enter the\nUS market on March 12, 2023. In the European Union, the first generic competitors to AUBAGIO became available in the third\nquarter of 2023.\nLEMTRADA\nLEMTRADA (alemtuzumab) is a humanized monoclonal antibody targeting the CD52 antigen. LEMTRADA is administered by\nintravenous infusion as two short courses 12 months apart; for the majority of patients no further treatment is necessary, making\nLEMTRADA the only disease-modifying therapy (DMT) that can provide long term durable efficacy in the absence of continuous\ndosing.\nLEMTRADA is approved in more than 70 countries including the EU (since September 2013) and the US (since November 2014).\nBecause of its safety profile, the FDA approved the use of LEMTRADA in patients with relapsing forms of MS who have had an\ninadequate response to two or more drugs indicated for the treatment of MS, and included a black-box warning on potential side\neffects. In the US, LEMTRADA is only available through a restricted distribution program called the LEMTRADA Risk Evaluation\nand Mitigation Strategy (REMS) Program. In January 2020, the EMA updated the indication for LEMTRADA to include treatment\nof relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis if the disease is highly active despite treatment with at least one disease-modifying\ntherapy, or if the disease is worsening rapidly. The EMA also added new contra-indications for patients with certain heart,\ncirculation or bleeding disorders, and those who have autoimmune disorders other than MS.\nBayer Healthcare received contingent payments based on alemtuzumab global sales revenue through September 2023. For\nadditional information, see Note D.18. to our consolidated financial statements, included at Item 18. of this annual report.\nRheumatoid Arthritis\nRheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic inflammatory autoimmune disease causing inflammation, pain, and eventually joint damage\nand disability.\nKEVZARA\nKEVZARA (sarilumab) is a human monoclonal antibody that binds to the interleukin-6 receptor (IL-6R) and has been shown to\ninhibit IL-6R mediated signaling. IL-6 is a cytokine in the body that, in excess and over time, can contribute to the inflammation\nassociated with rheumatoid arthritis. KEVZARA is available in 20 countries, including the US.\nIn May 2017, the FDA approved KEVZARA for the treatment of adult patients with moderately to severely active RA who have had\nan inadequate response or intolerance to one or more disease modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs), such as methotrexate.\nIn June 2017, the European Commission granted marketing authorization for KEVZARA in combination with methotrexate for the\ntreatment of moderately to severely active RA in adult patients who have responded inadequately to – or who are intolerant to –\none or more DMARDs, such as methotrexate. In September 2017, KEVZARA obtained manufacturing and marketing approval in\nJapan as a treatment for rheumatoid arthritis not responding well to conventional treatments. In February 2023, the FDA\napproved KEVZARA for the treatment of adult patients with polymyalgia rheumatica (PMR) who have had an inadequate\nresponse to corticosteroids or who cannot tolerate a corticosteroid taper. In October 2023, the FDA accepted the filing for\npolyarticular Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis.\nKEVZARA is developed and commercialized in collaboration with Regeneron.

Information on the company\nRare diseases\nOur Rare Diseases business is focused on products for the treatment of rare genetic diseases and other rare chronic debilitating\ndiseases of high unmet medical need, including lysosomal storage disorders (LSDs), a group of metabolic disorders caused by\nenzyme deficiencies.\nCEREZYME\nCEREZYME (imiglucerase) is an enzyme replacement therapy used to treat Gaucher disease, a chronic, inherited, progressive and\npotentially life-threatening LSD. Gaucher disease is caused by deficiency of the enzyme glucocerebrosidase; this causes a fatty\nsubstance called glucosylceramide (also called GL-1) to build up in certain areas of the body including the spleen, liver, and bone.\nGaucher disease exhibits diverse manifestations, a broad range of age of onset of symptoms, and a wide clinical spectrum of\ndisease severity. It is estimated that Gaucher disease occurs in approximately one in 120,000 newborns in the general population\nand one in 850 in the Ashkenazi Jewish population worldwide, but incidence and patient severity vary among regions. CEREZYME\nhas been marketed in the US since 1994, in the EU since 1997, in Japan since 1998 and in China since 2008, and is approved to\ntreat Type 1 Gaucher disease in more than 85 countries. It has also been approved to treat the systemic symptoms of Type 3\nGaucher disease in most non-US markets, including the EU and Japan.\nCEREZYME is typically given by intravenous infusions for 1-2 hours every two weeks at an infusion center, a doctor’s office, or at\nhome as medically appropriate.\nCERDELGA\nCERDELGA (eliglustat) is the first and only first-line oral therapy for Gaucher disease Type 1 adult patients. A potent, highly\nspecific ceramide analog inhibitor of GL-1 synthesis with broad tissue distribution, CERDELGA has demonstrated efficacy in the\ntreatment of naive Gaucher disease patients and in patients who switch from enzyme replacement therapy. CERDELGA has been\napproved to treat type 1 Gaucher disease in the US (2014), and in the EU and Japan (2015). It is also in development for the\ntreatment of type 1 Gaucher disease in pediatric patients. See “— B.4. Global Research & Development.”\nMYOZYME and LUMIZYME\nMYOZYME (alglucosidase alfa) is an enzyme replacement therapy used to treat both Infantile Onset and Late Onset Pompe\ndisease (IOPD and LOPD). Pompe disease is an inherited, progressive and often fatal neuromuscular disease, caused by a genetic\ndeficiency or dysfunction of the lysosomal enzyme acid alpha-glucosidase (GAA) that results in the build-up of glycogen in the\nmuscles’ cells. For infantile-onset Pompe disease, symptoms begin within a few months of birth and there is impact to the heart in\naddition to skeletal muscle weakness. Other symptoms include difficulties breathing, frequent chest infections, problems feeding\nthat result in failure to gain weight as expected, and failure to meet certain developmental milestones. Patients with late-onset\nPompe disease typically present symptoms any time after the first year of life to late adulthood and rarely manifest cardiac\nproblems. The hallmark symptom of late-onset Pompe disease is skeletal muscle weakness, which often leads to walking disability\nand reduced respiratory function. Patients often require wheelchairs to assist with mobility and may require mechanical\nventilation to help with breathing. Pompe disease occurs in approximately one in 40,000 newborns worldwide, but incidence and\npatient severity vary among regions.\nMYOZYME was first approved in 2006 in the EU and has since been approved in more than 70 countries. In the US, alglucosidase\nalfa has been marketed as LUMIZYME since 2010.\nNEXVIAZYME\nNEXVIAZYME / NEXVIADYME (avalglucosidase alfa-ngpt) is a novel mannose-6-phosphate (M6P) enriched enzyme replacement\ntherapy (ERT) treatment designed as a monotherapy for the entire spectrum of infantile-onset and late-onset Pompe disease\n(IOPD, LOPD), for both switch and naive patients. NEXVIAZYME/NEXVIADYME is scientifically designed to specifically target the\nM6P receptor, the key pathway for ERT, to effectively clear glycogen build-up in muscle cells. It helps replace the GAA enzyme\nfor people whose bodies do not produce enough. Investment in the clinical development of NEXVIAZYME is continuing, with an\nongoing Phase 3 trial in treatment-naive IOPD patients aged less than 12 months. NEXVIAZYME/NEXVIADYME is administered as\na monotherapy enzyme replacement therapy every two weeks.\nNEXVIAZYME was first approved in the US by the FDA on August 6, 2021 for LOPD patients aged 1 and over. On June 24, 2022,\nthe EC granted marketing authorization for NEXVIADYME as a potential new standard of care for the long-term treatment of\nboth LOPD and IOPD. NEXVIAZYME/NEXVIADYME has successfully launched in 25 countries including the US, Japan and\nAustralia. In all launched markets, the vast majority of eligible patients have switched or will be switching to NEXVIAZYME/\nNEXVIADYME.\nFABRAZYME\nFABRAZYME (agalsidase beta) is an enzyme replacement therapy used to treat Fabry disease. Fabry disease (FD) is a\nmultisystemic, progressive, X-linked inherited disorder of glycosphingolipid metabolism due to deficient or absent lysosomal α-\ngalactosidase A activity resulting in progressive globotriaosylceramide (GL-3) accumulation in the lysosomes of various tissues.\nFabry disease affects both genders. With age, progressive organ damage develops, leading to potentially life-threatening renal,\ncardiac and/or cerebrovascular complications. Fabry disease is characterized by different symptom severities and rates of\nprogression, ranging from classic disease with early symptom onset to late onset disease with cardiac and/or renal complications\nlater in life. Fabry disease is seen in all racial and ethnic groups and is an under-diagnosed condition. Prevalence estimates vary\nacross regions. Classic Fabry disease mutations are estimated to be approximately 1:40,000 in males with more wide-ranging\nestimates for atypical presentations of Fabry in both males and females. FABRAZYME has been marketed in the EU since 2001\nand in the US since 2003 and is approved in more than 70 countries.\n22 SANOFI FORM 20-F 2023\nPART I\nITEM 4.

Some\nproducts in Rare Diseases and Oncology may also be sold directly to physicians. With the exception of Consumer Healthcare\nproducts, our drugs are ordinarily dispensed to patients by pharmacies upon presentation of a doctor’s prescription. Our\nConsumer Healthcare products are also sold and distributed through e-commerce, which is a growing trend in consumer\nbehavior. Our vaccines are sold and distributed through multiple channels including physicians, pharmacies, hospitals, private\ncompanies and distributors in the private sector, and governmental entities and non-governmental organizations in the public\nand international donor markets.\nWe use a range of channels from in-person to digital to disseminate information about and promote our products among\nhealthcare professionals, ensuring that the channels not only cover our latest therapeutic advances but also our established\nprescription products, which satisfy patient needs in some therapy areas. We regularly exhibit at major medical congresses. In\nsome countries, products are also marketed directly to patients by way of television, radio, newspapers and magazines, and\ndigital channels (such as the Internet). National education and prevention campaigns can be used to improve patients’\nknowledge of their conditions.\nOur sales representatives, who work closely with healthcare professionals, use their expertise to promote and provide information\non our drugs. They represent our values on a day-to-day basis and are required to adhere to a code of conduct and to internal\npolicies on which they receive training.\nAlthough we market most of our products through our own sales forces, we have entered into and continue to form partnerships\nto co-promote/co-market certain products in specific geographical areas. Our major alliances are detailed at “Item 5. Operating\nand Financial Review and Prospects — Financial Presentation of Alliances.” See also “Item 3. Key Information — D.

Competition\nThe pharmaceutical industry continues to experience significant changes in its competitive environment.\nThere are four primary types of competition in the prescription pharmaceutical market:\n• competition among pharmaceutical companies to research and develop new patented products or address unmet medical\nneeds;\n• competition among different patented pharmaceutical products for the same therapeutic indication;\n• competition among original and generic products or original biological products and biosimilars, at the end of regulatory\nexclusivity or patent protection; and\n• competition among generic or biosimilar products.\nGenerics manufacturers who have received all necessary regulatory approvals for a product may decide to launch a generic\nversion before the patent expiry date, even in cases where the owner of the original product has already commenced patent\ninfringement litigation against the generics manufacturer. Such launches are said to be “at risk” for the promoter of the generic\nproduct because it may be required to pay damages to the owner of the original product in the context of patent infringement\nlitigation; however, such launches may also significantly impair the profitability of the pharmaceutical company whose product\nis challenged.\nDrug manufacturers may also face intra-product competition through parallel trading, or parallel importation or reimportation,\nwhere permitted. This may take place when drugs sold in a foreign market under the same brand name as in a domestic market\nare permitted to be imported into that domestic market by parallel traders or importers, who may repackage or resize the original\nproduct or sell it through alternative channels such as mail order or the Internet. This situation is of particular relevance to the EU\nwith its common market, where such practices have been encouraged by the current regulatory framework. Parallel traders or\nimporters take advantage of the price differentials between markets arising from factors including sales costs, market conditions\n(such as intermediate trading stages), tax rates, or national regulation of prices.\nFinally, pharmaceutical companies face illegal competition from substandard and falsified drugs. The WHO estimates that\nfalsified products account for 10% in low- and middle-income countries. All therapeutic areas are affected, including vaccines.\nWorldwide, falsified products are an issue in part due to the exponential increase in Internet connectivity of those engaged in the\nmanufacture, distribution and supply of substandard and falsified medical products.\nSimilar types of competition apply in CHC.\nIn Vaccines, there are two primary types of competition:\n• competition among vaccine companies to research and develop new patented products, including new vaccines originated\nfrom disruptive technologies (such as the emergence of mRNA vaccines to fight the COVID virus in 2020), or address unmet\nmedical needs; and\n• competition among different patented (or non-patented) vaccine products marketed for the same therapeutic indication.\nGenerics and biosimilars are not an issue in vaccines at present, since vaccines are still mostly produced from proprietary viral or\nbacterial strains. As with pharmaceutical drugs, vaccine manufacturers can face competition through parallel trading. However,\nthe extent of such practices is limited by the need for cold chain distribution of vaccines, and by the fact that vaccines are sold\nand administered through pharmacies or dispensing physicians.\nB.5.3. Regulatory framework\nThe pharmaceutical and health-related biotechnology sectors are highly regulated. National and supranational health authorities\nadminister a vast array of legal and regulatory requirements that dictate pre-approval testing (including testing in human\nsubjects) and quality standards to maximize the safety and efficacy of a new medical product. These authorities also regulate\nproduct labeling, manufacturing, importation/exportation, safety reporting and marketing, as well as mandatory post-approval\nrequirements and commitments.\nThe submission of an application to a regulatory authority does not guarantee that a license or approval to market will be\ngranted. Furthermore, each regulatory authority may impose its own requirements during product development or during the\napplication review. It may refuse to grant approval or require additional data before granting approval, even in circumstances in\nwhich the same product has already been approved in other countries. Regulatory authorities also have the authority to request\nproduct recalls and product withdrawals, to impose penalties for violations of regulations, and ultimately the ability to revoke\nproduct licensure or approval.\nProduct review and approval can vary from six months or less to several years from the date of application submission depending\nupon the country and regulatory jurisdiction. Factors such as the quality of data and evidence, the review procedures, the nature\nof the product and the condition to be treated, play a major role in the length of time a product is under review, and whether or\nnot the product is ultimately licensed or approved.\nIn the EU, there are three main procedures for applying for marketing authorization:\n• the centralized procedure is mandatory for drugs derived from biotechnologies; new active substances designed for human\nuse to treat HIV, viral diseases, cancer, neurodegenerative diseases, diabetes and auto-immune diseases; orphan drugs; and\ninnovative products for veterinary use. When an application for human use is submitted to the EMA, the scientific evaluation\nof the application is carried out by the EMA’s CHMP and a scientific opinion is prepared. This opinion is sent to the EC, which\nadopts the final decision and grants an EU marketing authorization. Such a marketing authorization is valid throughout the\nEU, and the drug may be marketed within all EU Member States;\nSANOFI FORM 20-F 2023 37\nPART I\nITEM 4. Information on the company\n• if a company is seeking a national marketing authorization in more than one Member State, two procedures are available to\nfacilitate the granting of harmonized national authorizations across Member States: the mutual recognition procedure or the\ndecentralized procedure. Both procedures are based on the recognition by national competent authorities of a first\nassessment performed by the regulatory authority of one Member State; and\n• national authorizations are still possible, but are only for products intended for commercialization in a single EU Member State\nor for line extensions to existing national product licenses.\nIn the EU, vaccines are treated as pharmaceutical products, and therefore have to obtain marketing authorization under the\ncentralized procedures described above.\nGeneric products are subject to the same marketing authorization procedures. A generic product must contain the same active\nmedicinal substance as a reference product approved in the EU. Generic applications are abridged: generic manufacturers only\nneed to submit quality data and demonstrate that the generic drug is “bioequivalent” to the originator product (i.e., performs in\nthe same manner in the patient’s body), but do not need to submit safety or efficacy data since regulatory authorities can refer to\nthe reference product’s dossier.\nAnother relevant aspect in the EU regulatory framework is the “sunset clause” under which any marketing authorization ceases to\nbe valid if it is not followed by marketing within three years, or if marketing is interrupted for a period of three consecutive years.\nIn the US, the FDA has broad regulatory jurisdiction over all pharmaceutical and biological products that are intended for sale and\nmarketing in the US. To commercialize a new drug or biologic in the US, an applicant must submit to the FDA a New Drug\nApplication (NDA) under the Food, Drug and Cosmetic (FD&C) Act or a Biologics License Application (BLA) under the Public\nHealth Service (PHS) Act, respectively, for filing and pre-market review. Specifically, the FDA must decide whether the product is\nsafe and effective for its proposed use; if the benefits of the product outweigh its risks; whether the product labeling is adequate;\nand if the manufacturing of the product and the controls used for maintaining quality are adequate to preserve the product’s\nidentity, strength, quality and purity. Based upon this review, the FDA can stipulate post-approval commitments and\nrequirements. Changes to an approved product, including but not limited to a new indication, require submission of a\nsupplemental NDA (sNDA) for a drug or a supplemental BLA (sBLA) for a biological product.\nThe FD&C Act provides another option for NDA product approval via the 505(b)(2) pathway. This 505(b)(2) application contains\nfull reports of investigations of safety and effectiveness but at least some of the information required for approval comes from\nstudies not conducted by or for the applicant and for which the applicant has not obtained a right of reference. For example,\nunder the 505(b)(2) pathway an applicant may seek to rely on literature or earlier FDA findings of safety and effectiveness for\napproved drugs.\nSponsors wishing to market a generic drug or biosimilar product can file an Abbreviated NDA (ANDA) under 505(j) of the FD&C\nAct or abbreviated BLA (aBLA) under 351(k) of the PHS Act, respectively.\n• ANDA applications are “abbreviated” because they are generally not required to include data to establish safety and efficacy\nbut need to demonstrate that their product is bioequivalent (i.e., performs in humans in the same manner as the originator’s\nproduct) to a reference product. Consequently, the length of time and cost required for development of generics can be\nconsiderably less than for the innovator’s drug. The ANDA pathway in the US can only be used for generics of drugs that can\nbe referenced as having been approved under the FD&C Act.\n• aBLA applications contain evidence that the potential product is biosimilar to a reference product already approved by the\nFDA. A biosimilar is highly similar to and has no clinically meaningful differences in terms of safety, purity, and potency (i.e.,\nsafety and effectiveness) from an FDA-approved reference product. The abbreviated approval pathway for biosimilars was\ncreated to help reduce the time and cost of development of biologics without compromising safety and effectiveness.\nConsequently, the length of time and cost required for development of biosimilars may be less than for the innovator’s\nreference product.\nIn Japan, the entire process of approval review from review-related inspections and clinical trial consultation to review for the\ndrugs approved by the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare (MHLW) is undertaken by the Pharmaceuticals and Medical\nDevices Agency (PMDA). The PMDA conducts first scientific review of the NDA submitted, assessing particularly the safety,\nefficacy and quality of the product or medical device proposed. Results of this primary evaluation are then submitted to the\nPMDA’s external experts. After a second evaluation based on the external experts’ feedback, a report is provided; the\nPharmaceutical Affairs and Foods Sanitation Council (PAFSC) – one of the councils organized under the MHLW as advisory\ncommission – is consulted, and advises the MHLW on final approvability.\nFor Japanese registrations, clinical data for Japanese patients are necessary. The regulatory authorities can require local clinical\nstudies, though they also accept multi-regional studies including Japan. In some cases, bridging studies have been conducted to\nverify extrapolability of foreign clinical data to Japanese patients and to obtain data to determine the appropriateness of the\ndosages for Japanese patients.\nThe MHLW may require additional post-approval studies (Phase 4) for some specific cases, to further evaluate safety and/or to\ngather information on the use of the product under specified conditions. In approval of new drugs, new indications, new dosages\nor new administrations, the re-examination period is determined by the MHLW. Post-marketing information on a drug for the\npredetermined period after approval is collected to reconfirm its efficacy, safety and quality at the end of the period. This\ncollection process involves both post-marketing surveillance (PMS), which is a non-interventional study, and post-marketing\nclinical trials.\nFor generic products, the data necessary for filing are similar to EU and US requirements. Companies only need to submit quality\ndata, and data demonstrating bioequivalence to the originator product, unless the drug is biopharmaceutical. Common Technical\nDocument (CTD) submission for generics has been mandatory since March 2017.\n38 SANOFI FORM 20-F 2023\nPART I\nITEM 4. Information on the company\nThe International Council for Harmonization of Technical Requirements for Pharmaceuticals for Human Use (ICH) was created\nin 1990 and reformed in 2015.\nThe ICH currently includes 21 Members and 37 Observers. Harmonization is achieved through the development of ICH Guidelines\nvia a process of scientific consensus with regulatory and industry experts working side-by-side.\nIn addition to the joint efforts, Free Trade Agreements (FTAs) have proven to be one of the best ways to open up foreign markets\nto exporters and to allow for discussions on harmonization topics for regulatory authorities. Some agreements, such as the\nAgreement on Trade Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS), are international in nature, while others are between\nspecific countries. The requirements of many countries (including Japan and several EU Member States) to negotiate selling\nprices or reimbursement rates for pharmaceutical products with government regulators significantly extend the time to market\nentry beyond the initial marketing approval. While marketing authorizations for new pharmaceutical products in the EU have\nbeen largely centralized within the EC in collaboration with the EMA, pricing and reimbursement remain a matter of national\ncompetence.\nFor a description of risks relating to the regulatory environment in which we operate, refer to “— Item 3.D. Risk Factors\n— Product liability claims could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.”\nB.5.4. Pricing & reimbursement\nWe are operating in a highly volatile and competitive market access and launch environment globally. The pharmaceuticals and\nhealth biotech industries are highly regulated (see “— Item 3. Key information — D. Risk Factors — Our activities (including our\nproducts and manufacturing activities) are subject to significant government regulations and regulatory approvals, which are\noften costly and could result in adverse consequences to our business if we fail to anticipate the regulations, comply with them,\nmaintain the required approvals, and/or adapt to changes in applicable regulations”).\nFaced with mounting budget pressure, governments and payers are using several drug price control policies such as price\nreferencing for imported drugs, increased patient co-payments, restrictive formularies, prescribing guidelines, tendering\nprocedures, generic and biosimilar substitution, and medico-economic evaluations of healthcare products.\nIn addition, companies are required to demonstrate the value and cost-effectiveness of their products throughout their life cycle\n(e.g. comparative efficacy studies, real-world patient data, budget modelling) to meet diverse and stringent payer evidence\nrequirements, raising the bar for market entry in many countries.\nDespite numerous pricing and reimbursement challenges, payers and regulators remain committed to providing access to new\ninnovative therapies, with greater emphasis on real-world evidence (RWE).\nThese trends are likely to continue in the coming year amid macroeconomic and geopolitical headwinds.\nUnited States\nOverview of the US health insurance system:\nCommercial insurance is offered widely as part of employee benefit packages and is the main source of employee access to\nsubsidized healthcare. Some individuals purchase private health plans directly or through marketplaces established under the\nAffordable Care Act, while publicly subsidized programs provide coverage for retirees, the indigent, the disabled, uninsured\nchildren, and serving or retired military personnel. Double coverage can occur.\nCommercial insurance includes:\n• Managed Care Organizations (MCOs), which combine the functions of health insurance, delivery of care, and administration.\nMCOs use specific provider networks and specific services and products. There are four primary types of managed care plans:\nHealth Maintenance Organizations (HMOs), Preferred Provider Organizations (PPOs), Exclusive Provider Organizations (EPOs),\nand Point of Service (POS) plans; and\n• Pharmacy Benefit Managers (PBMs), which serve as intermediaries between insurance companies, pharmacies and\nmanufacturers to negotiate rebates and discounts on formulary placement for commercial health plans, self-insured\nemployer plans, Medicare Part D plans, and federal and state government employee plans.\nGovernment insurance includes:\n• Medicare, which provides health insurance for people aged 65 and older and for people with permanent disabilities. The basic\nMedicare scheme (Part A) provides hospital insurance only, and the vast majority of beneficiaries purchase additional\ncoverage through Part B, Part C and/or Part D. Part D enables Medicare beneficiaries to obtain outpatient drug coverage.\nAlmost two-thirds of all Medicare beneficiaries have enrolled in Part D plans;\n• Medicaid, which provides health insurance for low-income families, certain qualified pregnant women and children,\nindividuals receiving supplemental security income, and other eligible persons determined on a state-by-state basis; and\n• TRICARE, which provides health insurance for uniformed service members, retirees, and their families including\ncomprehensive healthcare, prescription and dental coverage.\nIn August 2022, the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) was signed into law by President Biden. This legislation contains three core\nprovisions related to drug pricing which are to be phased between 2022 and 2026: Medicare drug price negotiation, inflation\npenalties on list price increases, and Medicare Part D redesign. Importantly, all of the policy changes enacted under the IRA apply\nto the two Medicare programs that cover separately reimbursable prescription drugs: Part B (physician-administered outpatient\nmedicines) and Part D (self-administered medicines).\nSANOFI FORM 20-F 2023 39\nPART I\nITEM 4. Information on the company\nUnder the IRA, for the first time ever, the federal government will negotiate the prices of selected drugs with high budget impact\non Medicare Part B and Part D, starting with 10 drugs with high Part D expenditures, whose negotiated pricing will take effect in\n2026; up to 15 more high-Part D expenditure drugs, whose negotiated pricing will take effect in 2027; and up to 15 more drugs\nwith high expenditures under Parts B and/or D drugs; whose negotiated pricing will take effect in 2028. Up to 20 more drugs with\nhigh Part B and/or Part D expenditures will be selected for negotiated pricing with effect in 2029 and each subsequent year. No\nSanofi product is among the initial 10 drugs that the government has identified for negotiations in 2023 and 2024 and for which\nnegotiated pricing will take effect in 2026.\nThe IRA also imposes inflation penalties applied to Medicare Parts B and D if prices rise faster than inflation (based on the\nconsumer price index, CPI), beginning in October 2022 for Part D and January 2023 for Part B.\nOther measures of the Act redesign the Medicare Part D benefit, including a monthly $35 insulin cap in 2023 and an annual\n$2,000 out-of-pocket (OOP) spending cap in 2025 for Medicare beneficiaries.\nAltogether, the IRA’s prescription drug-related provisions are expected to reduce the federal deficit by about $237 billion\nthrough 2031 according to estimates from the Congressional Budget Office (CBO). The new legislation is also likely to have a\nnegative impact on industry revenue growth and future innovation, though significant uncertainties remain over the process and\nmethods of Medicare price negotiations.\nIn addition to the IRA, the industry is exposed to increased price pressure from the continuing vertical integration and\nconsolidation within the US health insurance market. With the three largest PBM group purchasing organizations (GPOs) (i.e.\nAscent, Zinc and Emisar) now covering over 85% of US prescription drug claims, consolidation has led to more aggressive\nformulary utilization management controls, resulting in the GPOs having strong bargaining power for negotiating discounted\nprices, thereby adversely impacting manufacturer’s revenues.\nChina\nChina continues to pursue reforms towards Healthy China 2030. Healthcare is one of the growth priorities under the country’s\nfourteenth Five-Year Plan (2021-2025), with policies aimed at addressing a large and increasing burden of disease (especially\ncancer, diabetes and cardiovascular diseases), while balancing access to innovation and costs.\nChina continues to improve regulatory timelines. For example, DUPIXENT received approval for the treatment of adults with\nmoderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis in June 2020, within six months of filing through an accelerated review process.\nPricing pressure is expected to continue and further intensify as a growing number of products are subject to National\nReimbursement Drug List (NRDL) price negotiations and volume-based procurement (VBP) tenders, with the lowest price\nprevailing to compete with local champions.\nAccess to innovative therapies has been accelerating in the last five years, fueled by annual NRDL updates, albeit with steep price\ncuts across therapy areas. According to the National Healthcare Security Administration (NHSA), 126 new drugs were added to\nthe National Reimbursement Drug List (NRDL) in December 2023, with an average price reduction of 61.7% in line with recent\nyears. Over the past six years, 744 drugs have been added to the NRDL, bringing the total number of covered medicines to 3,088\n(1,698 Western drugs and 1,390 traditional Chinese medicines).\nFurther expansion of the VBP policy will drive down the prices of a growing number of products, with more than 500 drugs\ntargeted for inclusion by 2025.\nEurope\nIn Europe, health systems have been under mounting budget pressures. These remain high in the wake of COVID-19, with rising\ninflation and slow economic growth translating into an acceleration of cost-containment policies in major EU markets.\nThe industry is also facing high uncertainty in the context of the new Pharmaceutical Strategy for Europe, including numerous\npolicy changes to EU pharmaceutical legislation, health technology assessment (HTA) and joint procurement, among others.\nThese reforms will have a far-reaching impact on the pricing and market access landscape in Europe and will likely pose\nadditional challenges for industry.\nOn April 26, 2023, the EC adopted a proposal for a new Directive and a new Regulation, which represent the largest\npharmaceutical reform in over 20 years. The most concerning proposals under review relate to the potential reduction of market\nexclusivity for orphan medicines; greater transparency of R&D costs; faster availability of generics and biosimilars; and more\nstringent obligations for the supply of medicines. If passed in its current form, the legislation could have a detrimental impact on\naccess, innovation and competitiveness in Europe.\nThe Commission also adopted the new EU Health Technology Assessment (HTA) regulation in December 2021, after years of joint\nwork between Member States. The regulation will introduce EU-level joint scientific consultations (JSCs) and joint clinical\nassessments (JCAs) that will serve as the basis for national value assessments and price negotiations. The joint HTA process will\nbe implemented in a phased approach starting in January 2025 with oncology medicines and advanced therapy medicinal\nproducts (ATMPs), before expanding to include orphan drugs in 2028 and all EMA centrally authorized medicinal products by\n2030.\nAdditional uncertainty is caused by the evolving joint procurement approaches of vaccines and medicines at EU level, building on\nthe lessons learned during the COVID-19 pandemic. The Commission may promote the use of EU joint procurement as a means to\nimprove affordability and security of supply, which is already occurring to some extent with existing cross-country collaboration\ninitiatives such as the BeNeLuxA alliance, the FINOSE collaboration and the Nordic Pharmaceutical Forum.\n40 SANOFI FORM 20-F 2023\nPART I\nITEM 4. Information on the company\nPricing and reimbursement pressures are being felt in other regions and countries around the globe.\nTo overcome these challenges, we are developing tailored market access strategies early in the drug development process,\nengaging in dialogue with payers and multiple stakeholders throughout the lifecycle, based on a thorough understanding of\nevolving market dynamics.\nB.6. Patents, intellectual property and other rights\nB.6.1. Patents\nPatent protection\nWe own a broad portfolio of patents, patent applications and patent licenses worldwide. These patents are of various types and\nmay cover: active ingredients; pharmaceutical formulations; product manufacturing processes; intermediate chemical\ncompounds; therapeutic indications/methods of use; technology platforms; delivery systems; digital applications; and enabling\ntechnologies, such as assays.\nPatent protection for individual products typically extends for 20 years from the patent filing date in countries where we seek\npatent protection. A substantial part of the 20-year life span of a patent on a new molecule (small molecule or biologic) has\ngenerally already passed by the time the related product obtains marketing authorization. As a result, the effective period of\npatent protection for an approved product’s active ingredient is significantly shorter than 20 years. In some cases, the period of\neffective protection may be extended by procedures established to compensate regulatory delay in Europe (via Supplementary\nProtection Certificate or SPC), in the US (via Patent Term Extension or PTE), and in Japan (PTE).\nThe protection a patent provides to the related product depends upon the type of patent and its scope of coverage, and may\nalso vary from country to country.\nIn Europe, applications for new patents may be submitted to the European Patent Office (EPO). A European Patent (EP) may\ncover 39 European Patent Convention Member States, including all Member States of the EU. The granted EP establishes\ncorresponding national patents with uniform patent claims among the Member States. Since June 1, 2023, it has been possible to\nobtain a Unitary Patent, currently covering 17 states, which are all Member States of the EU and of the European Patent\nConvention.\nWe monitor our competitors and vigorously seek to challenge patent infringers when such infringement would negatively impact\nour business objectives. See “Item 8. — A. Consolidated Financial Statements and Other Financial Information — Information on\nLegal or Arbitration Proceedings — Patents” of this annual report.\nThe expiration or loss of a patent covering a new molecule, typically referred to as a compound patent, may result in significant\ncompetition from generic or biosimilar products and can result in a dramatic reduction in sales of the original branded product\n(see “Item 3. Key Information — D. Risk Factors”). In some cases, it is possible to continue to benefit from a commercial\nadvantage through product manufacturing trade secrets or other types of patents. Certain categories of products, such as\ntraditional vaccines and insulin, were historically relatively less reliant on patent protection and may in many cases have no patent\ncoverage. It is nowadays increasingly frequent for novel vaccines also to be patent protected.\nRegulatory exclusivity\nIn some markets, including the EU and the US, many of our pharmaceutical products may also benefit from multi-year regulatory\nexclusivity periods, during which a generic or biosimilar competitor may not rely on our clinical trial and safety data in its drug\napplication. This exclusivity operates independently of patent protection and may protect the product from generic or biosimilar\ncompetition even if there is no patent covering the product.\nIn the US, the FDA may not grant final marketing authorization to a generic competitor for a New Chemical Entity (NCE) until the\nexpiration of the regulatory exclusivity period (five years) that commences upon the first marketing authorization of the reference\nlisted drug. Significant new uses of existing NCEs, including new indications, may qualify for an additional three years of\nregulatory exclusivity if certain conditions are met. In the US, a different regulatory exclusivity paradigm applies to biological\ndrugs. The BPCIA (Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act) provides that the FDA may not approve a biosimilar\napplication until 12 years after the date on which the reference product was first licensed.\nIn the EU, regulatory exclusivity is available in two forms: data exclusivity and marketing exclusivity. Generic or biosimilar drug\napplications will not be accepted for review until eight years after the first marketing authorization (data exclusivity). This eight-\nyear period is followed by a two-year period during which generics or biosimilars cannot be marketed (marketing exclusivity). The\nmarketing exclusivity period can be extended to three years if, during the first eight-year period, the marketing authorization\nholder obtains an authorization for one or more new therapeutic indications which are deemed to provide a significant clinical\nbenefit over existing therapies. This is known as the “8+2+1” rule.\nIn Japan, the regulatory exclusivity period varies. In general, the regulatory exclusivity period is of four to six years for drugs for a\nspecific use, and for medicinal products with new indications or with new dosages; eight years for drugs containing a new\nchemical entity; ten years for orphan drugs, and for new drugs requiring pharmaco-epidemiological study; six to eight years for\nInnovative drugs (“SAKIGAKE” products), and for orphan drugs with a new ethical combination or new mode of administration;\nand six years for other medicinal products, such as new prescription combination drugs or drugs requiring a new mode of\nadministration.\nSANOFI FORM 20-F 2023 41\nPART I\nITEM 4. Information on the company\nPediatric extension\nIn the US and the EU, under certain conditions, it is possible to extend a product’s regulatory exclusivity for an additional period of\ntime by providing data on pediatric studies.\nIn the US, under certain conditions of the Hatch-Waxman Act, it may result in the FDA extending regulatory exclusivity and\npatent life by six months, to the extent these protections have not already expired (the so-called “pediatric exclusivity”).\nIn Europe, a regulation on pediatric medicines provides for pediatric research obligations with potential associated rewards\nincluding extension of supplementary patent protection and six-month regulatory exclusivity for pediatric marketing\nauthorization (for off-patent medicinal products).\nIn Japan, there is no pediatric research extension of patent protection for patented medicinal products. However, regulatory\nexclusivity may be extended from eight to ten years.\nOrphan drug exclusivity\nUnder certain conditions, orphan drug exclusivity may be granted in the US to drugs intended to treat rare diseases or conditions.\nOrphan drug exclusivities also exist in the EU and Japan.\nEmerging markets\nOne of the main limitations on our operations in emerging market countries is the lack of effective intellectual property protection\nor enforcement for our products, which frequently do not provide non-patent exclusivity for innovative products. While the\nsituation has gradually improved, the lack of protection for intellectual property rights or the lack of robust enforcement poses\ndifficulties in certain countries. Additionally, in recent years and especially during the pandemic, a number of countries have\nwaived or threatened to waive intellectual property protection for specific products, for example through compulsory licensing of\ngenerics. See “Item 3. Key Information — D. Risk Factors — Risks Relating to Sanofi’s Structure and Strategy — The globalization\nof our business exposes us to increased risks in specific areas”.\nProduct overview\nWe summarize below the intellectual property coverage (in some cases through licenses) of our most significant marketed\nproducts in terms of sales, in our major markets. In the discussion of patents below, we focus on active ingredient patents\n(compound patents) and, in the case of NCEs, on any later filed patents listed as applicable in the FDA’s list of Approved Drug\nProducts with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations (the “Orange Book”) or in its foreign equivalents. For biologics, the Orange\nBook listing does not apply.\nThese patents or their foreign equivalents tend to be the most relevant in the event of an application by a competitor to produce\na generic or a biosimilar version of one of our products (see “— Challenges to Patented Products” below). In some cases, products\nmay also benefit from pending patent applications or from patents not eligible for Orange Book listing (in the case of NCEs for\nexample, patents claiming industrial processes). In each case below, we specify whether the active ingredient is claimed by an\nunexpired patent. Where patent terms have been extended to compensate for US Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) delays\nin patent prosecution (Patent Term Adjustment – PTA) or for other regulatory delays, the extended dates are indicated below.\nThe US patent expirations presented below reflect USPTO dates, and also reflect six-month pediatric extensions when applicable.\nWhere patent terms have expired we indicate such information and mention whether generics or biosimilars are on the market.\nWe do not provide later filed patent information relating to formulations already available as an unlicensed generic. References\nbelow to patent protection in Europe indicate the existence of relevant patents in most major markets in the EU. Specific\nsituations may vary by country.\nWe additionally set out any regulatory exclusivity from which these products continue to benefit in the US, EU or Japan.\nRegulatory exclusivities presented below incorporate any pediatric extensions obtained. While EU regulatory exclusivity is\nintended to be applied throughout the EU, in some cases Member States have taken positions prejudicial to our exclusivity rights.\n42 SANOFI FORM 20-F 2023\nPART I\nITEM 4.

For example, notwithstanding the presence of unexpired patents, competitors launched\ngeneric versions of ALLEGRA in the US (prior to the product being switched to over-the-counter status) and MULTAQ in the EU.\nWe caution the reader that there can be no assurance that we will prevail when we assert a patent in litigation and that there may\nbe instances in which Sanofi determines that it does not have a sufficient basis to assert one or more of the patents mentioned in\nthis report, for example in cases where a competitor proposes a formulation not appearing to fall within the claims of our\nformulation patent; a salt or crystalline form not claimed by our composition of matter patent; or an indication not covered by our\nmethod of use patent. See “Item 3. Key Information — D. Risk Factors — Risks Relating to Legal and Regulatory Matters — We\nrely on our patents and other proprietary rights to provide exclusive rights to market certain of our products, and if such patents\nand other rights were limited, invalidated or circumvented, our financial results could be materially and adversely affected.”\nAs disclosed in Item 8. of this annual report, we are involved in significant litigation concerning the patent protection of a number\nof our products.\nChallenges to patented products\n— Abbreviated New Drug Applications (ANDAs)\nIn the US, generic companies have filed Abbreviated New Drug Applications (ANDAs) containing challenges to patents related to\na number of our small molecule products. An ANDA is an application by a drug manufacturer to receive authority to market a\ngeneric version of another company’s approved product, by demonstrating that the purportedly generic version has the same\nproperties (safety and other technical data) as the original approved product. As a result of regulatory protection of our safety\nand other technical data, ANDA applications are generally four years after FDA approval, and include a challenge to a patent\nlisted in the FDA’s Orange Book. If the patent holder or licensee brings suit in response to the patent challenge\nwithin the statutory window, the FDA is barred from granting final approval to an ANDA during the 30 months following\nthe expiry of the 5-year regulatory exclusivity (this bar is referred to in our industry as a “30-month stay”) unless, before the end\nof the 30 months, the parties reach settlement or a court decision has determined either that the ANDA does not infringe the\nlisted patent or that the listed patent is invalid and/or unenforceable.\nFDA approval of an ANDA after this 30-month period does not resolve outstanding patent disputes, but it does remove the\nregulatory impediments to a product launch by a generic manufacturer willing to take the risk of later being ordered to pay\ndamages to the patent holder.\nAccelerated ANDA-type procedures are potentially applicable to many, but not all, of the products we manufacture. See\n“— B.5.3. Regulatory Framework” and “- Regulation” above. We seek to defend our patent rights vigorously in these cases.\nSuccess or failure in the assertion of a given patent against a competing product is not necessarily predictive of the future\nsuccess or failure in the assertion of the same patent. See “Item 3. Key Information — D. Risk Factors — Risks Relating to Legal\nand Regulatory Matters — We rely on our patents and other proprietary rights to provide exclusive rights to market certain of our\nproducts, and if such patents and other rights were limited, invalidated or circumvented, our financial results could be materially\nand adversely affected.”\n— Section 505(b)(2) New Drug Applications in the US\nOur products and patents are also subject to challenge by competitors via another abbreviated approval pathway, under\nsection 505(b)(2) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. This pathway allows for approval for a wide range of products,\nespecially for those products that represent only a limited change from an existing approved drug. The 505(b)(2) pathway is\ndistinct from the ANDA pathway, which allows for approval of a generic product based on a showing that it is equivalent to a\npreviously approved product.\nSimilarly, entities wishing to market a generic biologic can utilize an abbreviated approval pathway established in the PHS Act.\nThis §351(k) pathway enables an applicant to rely on a reference product sponsor’s data when seeking approval of a biological\nproduct shown to be biosimilar (highly similar with no clinically meaningful differences) or interchangeable with an FDA-licensed\nreference BLA product.\n44 SANOFI FORM 20-F 2023\nPART I\nITEM 4. Information on the company\n— Europe\nIn the EU, a generic drug manufacturer may only reference the data of the regulatory file for the original approved product after\ndata exclusivity has expired. However, there is no patent listing system in Europe comparable to the Orange Book, which would\nallow the patent holder to prevent the competent authorities from granting marketing authorization by bringing patent\ninfringement litigation prior to approval. As a result, generic products may be approved for marketing following the expiration of\nmarketing exclusivity without regard to the patent holder’s rights. Nevertheless, in most of these jurisdictions once the competing\nproduct is launched, and in some jurisdictions even prior to launch (once launch is imminent), the patent holder may seek an\ninjunction against such marketing if it believes its patents are infringed. See Item 8. of this annual report.\nB.6.2. Trademarks – Domain names – Copyright\nOur products are sold around the world under trademarks that we consider to be of material importance in the aggregate. Our\ntrademarks help to identify our products and to protect the sustainability of our growth. We generate new assets (trademarks,\ndomain names, service marks) when creating global brands for new, innovative products. We support the development of the\nproduct, from the branding of biotech platforms to the protection of service marks for patient support programs.\nTrademarks are particularly important to the commercial success of our products and services in a competitive marketplace,\nproviding a strong visibility and assuring patients of the origin of the products.\nDomain names are essential to inform a range of communities about what we do. We also pay close attention to ensuring that no\ndamage is done to our reputation online.\nWe aim to ensure that the product trademarks we submit to healthcare authorities to obtain marketing authorizations are\navailable, and are protected. In certain cases, we may enter into a coexistence agreement with a third party that owns potentially\nconflicting rights in order to avoid any risk of confusion and to secure our rights.\nOngoing digitization emphasizes the importance of securing copyright protection for software and web layouts.\nWe monitor and defend our trademarks based on a specific policy designed to prevent counterfeiting, trademark infringement\nand/or unfair competition.\nB.7. Production and raw materials\nWe have opted to manufacture the majority of our products in-house. There are three principal stages in our production process:\nthe manufacture of active ingredients, the transformation of those ingredients into drug products or vaccines, and the final\npackaging.\nOur general policy is to produce our key active ingredients and main drug products at our own plants in order to reduce our\ndependence on external suppliers. We also rely on third parties for the manufacture and supply of specific active ingredients,\ndrug products and medical devices. Active ingredients are manufactured using raw materials sourced from suppliers who have\nbeen subject to rigorous selection and approval procedures, in accordance with international standards and our own internal\ndirectives. We have outsourced some of our production under supply contracts associated with acquisitions of products or\nbusinesses or with Sanofi plant divestitures, or to establish a local presence to capitalize on growth in emerging markets. Our\npharmaceutical subcontractors follow our general quality and logistics policies, as well as meeting other criteria.\nOur manufacturing activities require significant amounts of energy, the costs of which increased in 2022 and 2023 as a result of\ninflationary pressures and supply constraints due to the war in Ukraine. The Group uses supply contracts and hedging to mitigate\nthose risks and costs. See “Item 3. Key Information — D. Risk Factors — Risks Relating to Our Business.”\nWe also obtain active ingredients from third parties under collaboration agreements. This applies in particular to the monoclonal\nantibodies developed with Regeneron.\nOur production sites are divided into three categories:\n• global sites, which serve all markets: located mainly in Europe, these facilities are dedicated to the manufacture of our active\ningredients, injectable products, and a number of our main solid-form products;\n• regional sites, which serve markets at regional level, giving us a strong industrial presence in emerging markets; and\n• local sites, which serve their domestic market only.\nVaccines produces vaccines at various sites, with the main locations situated in France, the United States, Canada, India, Mexico\nand China. The pharmaceutical site at Le Trait (France) also contributes to Vaccines’ industrial operations by making its sterile\nfilling facilities available for vaccine manufacturing.\nAll of our production facilities are good manufacturing practice (GMP) compliant, in line with international regulations.\nOur main sites are approved by the FDA:\n• the Specialty Care facilities in the United States (Framingham MA and Northborough MA), France (Lyon Gerland, Vitry-sur-\nSeine, Le Trait), Germany (Frankfurt), Ireland (Waterford) and Belgium (Geel);\n• the General Medicines facilities in Germany (Frankfurt), France (Aramon, Sisteron, Ploermel, Ambarès and Tours), Italy (Anagni\nand Scoppito), Singapore (Jurong) and the United States (Ridgefield NJ);\n• the CHC facilities in France (Compiègne) and the United States (Chattanooga TN); and\n• the Vaccines facilities in France (Marcy l’Étoile, Le Trait, Val-de-Reuil and Neuville-sur-Saône), the United States (Swiftwater\nPA) and Canada (Toronto).\nSANOFI FORM 20-F 2023 45\nPART I\nITEM 4. Information on the company\nWherever possible, we seek to have multiple plants approved for the production of key active ingredients and our strategic\nfinished products (this is the case with LOVENOX and DUPIXENT, for example).\nMore details about our manufacturing sites are given below at section “— D. Property, Plant and Equipment”.\nB.8. Insurance and risk coverage\nWe are protected by five main insurance programs, relying not only on the traditional corporate insurance and reinsurance\nmarket but also on our direct insurance company, Carraig Insurance DAC (Carraig).\nThese five key programs cover Property & Business Interruption; General & Product Liability; Stock & Transit; loss and liability\narising from cyber and digital risks; and Directors & Officers Liability.\nCarraig participates in our coverage for various lines of insurance including Property, Stock & Transit, Cyber/Digital, and General\n& Product Liability. Carraig is run under the supervision of the Irish and European regulatory authorities, is wholly owned by\nSanofi, and has sufficient resources to meet those portions of our risks that it has agreed to cover.\nCarraig sets premiums for our entities at market rates. Claims are assessed using the traditional models applied by insurance and\nreinsurance companies, and the company’s reserves are regularly verified and confirmed by independent actuaries.\nOur Property & Business Interruption program covers all our entities worldwide, in all territories where it is possible to use a\ncentralized program operated by Carraig. By sharing risk between our entities, this approach enables us to set deductibles and\ncover appropriate to the needs of local entities before the market attachment point. It also incorporates a prevention program,\nincluding a comprehensive site visit schedule covering our production, storage, research and distribution facilities and\nstandardized repair and maintenance procedures across all sites.\nThe Stock & Transit program protects all goods owned by Sanofi while they are in transit nationally or internationally whatever the\nmeans of transport, and all our inventories wherever they are located. Sharing risk between our entities through Carraig means\nthat we can set deductibles at appropriate levels, for instance differentiating between goods that require temperature controlled\ndistribution and those that do not. We have developed a prevention program with assistance from experts, implementing best\npractices in this area at our distribution sites.\nOur Cyber/Digital insurance program protects our operations against loss originating from various sources, and against liability in\nrespect of data security. Centralized through Carraig, the program enables us to set deductibles and cover appropriate to the\nneeds of local entities before the market attachment point.\nOur General & Product Liability program was renewed in 2023 for all our subsidiaries worldwide in all territories where it was\npossible to do so. For several years, insurers have been reducing product liability cover because of the difficulty of transferring\nrisk for some products that have been subject to numerous claims.\nThe principal risk exposure for our pharmaceutical products is covered with low deductibles at country level, with a greater\nproportion of risk being retained. The level of risk self-insured by Sanofi (including via Carraig) before the market attachment\npoint enables us to retain control over the management and prevention of risk. Our negotiations with third-party insurers and\nreinsurers are tailored to our specific risks. In particular, they allow for differential treatment of products in the development\nphase; for discrepancies in risk exposure between European countries and the United States; and for specific issues arising in\ncertain jurisdictions. Coverage is adjusted every year to take account of the relative weight of new product liability risks such as\nthose arising out of biotechnologies and new technology platforms.\nOur cover for risks that are not specific to the pharma-biotech industry (general liability) is designed to address the potential\nimpacts of our operations.\nFor all the insurance programs handled by Carraig, outstanding claims are covered by provisions for the estimated cost of settling\nall claims incurred but not paid at the balance sheet date, whether reported or not, together with all related claims handling\nexpenses. Where there is sufficient data history from Sanofi or from the market for claims made and settled, management – with\nassistance from independent actuaries – prepares an actuarial estimate of our exposure to unreported claims for the risks\ncovered. The actuaries perform an actuarial valuation of the company’s IBNR (Incurred But Not Reported) and ALAE (Allocated\nLoss Adjustment Expense) liabilities at year end. Two ultimate loss projections (based upon reported losses and paid losses,\nrespectively) are computed each year using various actuarial methods including the Bornhuetter-Ferguson method; those\nprojections form the basis for the provisions set.\nThe Directors & Officers Liability program protects all legal entities under our control, and their directors and officers. Carraig is\nnot involved in this program.\nWe also operate other insurance programs, but these are of much lesser importance than those described above.\nAll our insurance programs are backed by highly-rated insurers and reinsurers and are intented to be designed in such a way that\nwe can integrate most newly acquired businesses without interruption of cover. Our insurance cover has been designed to reflect\nour risk profile and the capacity available in the insurance market. By centralizing our major programs, we are able to provide\nwhat we believe to be excellent, cost effective protection.\n46 SANOFI FORM 20-F 2023\nPART I\nITEM 4. Information on the company\nB.9. Health, Safety and Environment\nOur manufacturing and research operations are subject to increasingly stringent health, safety and environmental (HSE) laws and\nregulations. These laws and regulations are complex and rapidly changing, and Sanofi invests the necessary sums in order to\ncomply with them. This investment, which aims to respect health, safety and the environment, varies from year to year.\nApplicable environmental laws and regulations may require us to eliminate or reduce the effects of chemical substance discharge\nat our various sites. The sites in question may belong to Sanofi, and may be currently operational, or may have been owned or\noperational in the past. In this regard, Sanofi may be held liable for the costs of removal or remediation of hazardous substances\non, under or in the sites concerned, or on sites where waste from activities has been stored, without regard to whether the owner\nor operator knew of or under certain circumstances caused the presence of the contaminants, or at the time site operations\noccurred the discharge of those substances was authorized.\nAs is the case for a number of companies in the pharmaceutical, chemical and intense agrochemical industries, soil and\ngroundwater contamination has occurred at some of our sites in the past, and may still occur or be discovered at others. In\nSanofi’s case, such sites are mainly located in the United States, Germany, UK and France. As part of a program of environmental\nsurveys conducted over the last few years, detailed assessments of the risk of soil and groundwater contamination have been\ncarried out at current and former Sanofi sites. In cooperation with national and local authorities, Sanofi regularly assesses the\nrehabilitation work required and carries out such work when appropriate. Remediation works have just been completed at\nDagenham in the United Kingdom and Neuville in France. Long-term rehabilitation work is in progress or planned in Mount\nPleasant, Portland in the United States; Frankfurt in Germany; Valernes and Limay in France; and on a number of sites divested to\nthird parties and covered by contractual environmental guarantees granted by Sanofi.\nWe may also have potential liability for investigation and cleanup at several other sites. We have established provisions for the\nsites already identified and to cover contractual guarantees for environmental liabilities for sites that have been divested. In\nFrance specifically, we have provided the financial guarantees to the authorities as required under French regulations for\nenvironmental protection in connection with the operation of activities on French sites.\nPotential environmental contingencies arising from certain business divestitures are described in Note D.22.d. to the consolidated\nfinancial statements. In 2023, Sanofi spent €33 million on rehabilitating sites previously contaminated by soil or groundwater\npollution.\nDue to changes in environmental regulations governing site remediation, our provisions for remediation obligations may not be\nadequate due to the multiple factors involved, such as the complexity of operational or previously operational sites, the nature of\nclaims received, the rehabilitation techniques involved, the planned timetable for rehabilitation, and the outcome of discussions\nwith national regulatory authorities or other potentially responsible parties, as in the case of multiparty sites. Given the long\nindustrial history of some of our sites and the legacy obligations arising from the past involvement of Aventis in the chemical and\nagrochemical industries, it is impossible to quantify the future impact of these laws and regulations with precision.\nSee “Item 3.D. Risk Factors — Environmental and safety risks of Our Industrial Activities.”\nWe have established, in accordance with our current knowledge and projections, provisions for cases already identified and to\ncover contractual guarantees for environmental liabilities relating to sites that have been divested. In accordance with\nSanofi standards, a comprehensive review is carried out once a year on the legacy of environmental pollution. In light of\ndata collected during this review, we adjusted our provisions to €493 million as of December 31, 2023 versus €526 million as\nof December 31, 2022. The terms of certain business divestitures, and the environmental obligations and retained environmental\nliabilities relating thereto, are described in Note D.22. to our consolidated financial statements.\nTo our knowledge, Sanofi did not incur any liability in 2023 for non-compliance with current HSE laws and regulations that could\nbe expected to significantly jeopardize its activities, financial situation or operating income. We also believe that we are in\nsubstantial compliance with current HSE laws and regulations and that all the environmental permits required to operate our\nfacilities have been obtained.\nRegular HSE audits are carried out by Sanofi in order to assess compliance with standards (which implies compliance with\nregulations) and to initiate corrective measures (36 internal audits performed in 2023). Moreover, more than 100 specific visits\nwere performed jointly with experts representing our insurers.\nSanofi has implemented a worldwide master policy on health, safety and environment to promote the health and well-being of\nthe employees and contractors working on its sites and respect for the environment. We consider this master policy to be an\nintegral part of our commitment to social responsibility. In order to implement this master policy, Sanofi key requirements have\nbeen drawn up in the key fields of HSE management, HSE leadership, safety in the workplace, process safety, occupational\nhygiene, health in the workplace and protection of the environment. However, despite these efforts, Sanofi may be unsuccessful\nin the implementation of its policy to reduce and mitigate the harmful effects of its activities on the health and safety of its\nemployees, customers or the general public and on the environment more generally. See “Item 3.B. Risk Factors” for further\ninformation.\nSANOFI FORM 20-F 2023 47\nPART I\nITEM 4. Information on the company\nHealth\nFrom the development of compounds to the commercial launch of new drugs, Sanofi research scientists continuously assess the\neffect of products on human health. This expertise is made available to employees through two committees responsible for\nchemical and biological risk assessment. Sanofi’s COVALIS (Comité des Valeurs Limites Internes Sanofi) Committee is responsible\nfor the hazard determination and classification of all active pharmaceutical ingredients and synthesis intermediates handled at\nSanofi facilities. This covers all active ingredients handled in production at company sites or in processes sub-contracted for\nmanufacture. Any important issues involving raw materials or other substances that lack established occupational exposure limits\nmay also be reviewed. The COVALIS Committee determines the occupational exposure limits required within Sanofi. Our TRIBIO\nCommittee is responsible for classifying all biological agents according to their degree of pathogenicity, and applies rules for their\ncontainment and the preventive measures to be respected throughout Sanofi. See “Item 3. Key Information — D. Risk Factors\n— Environmental and safety risks of Our Industrial Activities — Risks from manufacturing activities and the handling of hazardous\nmaterials could adversely affect our results of operations and reputation.”\nAppropriate occupational hygiene practices and programs are defined and implemented in each site. These practices consist\nessentially of containment measures for collective and individual protection against chemical and biological exposure in all\nworkplaces where chemical substances or biological agents are handled. All personnel are monitored with an appropriate medical\nsurveillance program, based on the results of professional risk evaluations linked to their duties.\nIn addition, dedicated resources have been created to implement the European Regulation on Registration, Evaluation,\nAuthorization and Restriction of Chemicals (REACH) and the European Regulation on Classification, Labeling and Packaging of\nchemicals (CLP). To fully comply with REACH, Sanofi has registered the relevant hazardous chemical substances with the\nEuropean Chemicals Agency (ECHA).\nSafety\nSanofi has rigorous policies to identify and evaluate safety risks and to develop preventive safety measures, and methods for\nchecking their efficacy. Additionally, Sanofi invests in training that is designed to instill in all employees a sense of concern for\nsafety, regardless of their duties. These policies are implemented on a worldwide scale to ensure the safety of all employees and\nto protect their health. Each project, whether in research, development or manufacturing, is subject to evaluation procedures,\nincorporating the chemical substance and process data communicated by the COVALIS and TRIBIO Committees described\nabove. The preventive measures are designed primarily to reduce the number and seriousness of work accidents and to minimize\nexposures involving permanent and temporary Sanofi employees as well as our sub-contractors.\nThe French chemical manufacturing sites in Aramon and Sisteron are listed Seveso III (from the name of the European directive\nthat deals with potentially dangerous establishments where dangerous substances may be present in quantities exceeding\ncertain thresholds to prevent major accidents and limit their consequences). In accordance with French law on technological risk\nprevention, the French sites are also subject to heightened security inspections due to the toxic or flammable materials stored on\nthe sites and used in the operating processes.\nRisk assessments of processes and installations are drawn up according to standards and internal guidelines incorporating the\nbest state of the art benchmarks for the industry. These assessments are used to fulfill regulatory requirements and are regularly\nupdated. Particular attention is paid to any risk-generating changes such as process or installation changes, as well as changes in\nproduction scale and transfers between industrial or research units.\nWe are using specialized process safety-testing laboratories that are fully integrated into our chemical development activities,\napply methods to obtain the physico-chemical parameters of manufactured chemical substances (intermediate chemical\ncompounds and active ingredients) and apply models to measure the effect of potentially leachable substances in the event of a\nmajor accident. In these laboratories the parameters for qualifying hazardous reactions are also determined, in order to define\nscale-up process conditions while transferring from development stage to industrial scale. We use these data to enhance the\nrelevance of our risk assessments.\nWe believe that the safety management systems implemented at each site, the hazard studies carried out and the risk\nmanagement methods implemented, as well as our third-party property insurance policies covering any third-party physical\ndamage, are consistent with legal requirements and the best practices in the industry, although no guarantee can be given that\nthey will prevent accidents of various kinds.\nEnvironment\nBeyond healthcare, we have developed an ambitious policy aimed at minimizing the environmental impacts of our products and\nactivities while strengthening our resilience in the face of environmental changes. We have identified six major environmental\nchallenges relating to our businesses: greenhouse gas emissions and climate disruption; eco-design; water; pharmaceuticals in\nthe environment; waste; and biodiversity.\nThe initiatives already implemented since 2010 are continuing, and we have been keen to give them fresh impetus through the\nPlanet Care program. Reflecting our environment strategy out to 2030 and 2045, the program sets more ambitious targets for\nreducing environmental impacts across the entire value chain. Planet Care is a global project that involves all of the Company’s\nresources in defining objectives and engaging with external partners.\nCompared with 2019 figures, we are undertaking to reduce our carbon emissions by 55% (scope 1 and 2) by the end of 2030,\nbuilding the path to carbon-neutral status by 2030 on our scope 1, 2 & 3 (direct and indirect emissions for all activities), and net\nzero by 2045. We have also set ourselves the target of achieving sustainable water resource management, especially at sites\nwhich are under hydric stress. On this new scope, by the end of 2023 we had reduced CO emissions by 38% (scope 1 and 2) and\n2\nwater withdrawals by 18%.\n48 SANOFI FORM 20-F 2023\nPART I\nITEM 4. Information on the company\nOverall waste valorization at sites is already above 88% and is expected to be more than 90% by the end of 2025. The landfill rate\nhad dropped to 2.3% at the end of 2023 and we have committed to move towards no more than 1% by 2025. Biodiversity\nmanagement at our sites is also a priority, with the aim of making all employees aware of this challenge and implementing risk\nassessment and management plans at priority sites by 2025.\nFinally, we are pursuing the policy we began in 2010 of managing pharmaceutical products in the environment throughout their\nlife cycles. At the end of 2023, all priority production sites had initiated specific risk-based programs to monitor, manage and\nreduce emissions of pharmaceuticals in waste water (where needed).\nIn line with this approach, we are engaged in the Industry Roadmap for Progress on Combating Antimicrobial Resistance.\nTogether with the other AMR roadmap signatories we have co-developed reference guides and methodologies for producing\nantibiotics responsibly. The initiative includes a specific commitment with respect to antibiotic production sites that are operated\nby signatories or their suppliers, involving the deployment of a shared framework and safe-discharge targets for managing\npotential emissions of antibiotics. See “Cautionary statement regarding forward-looking statements” and “Item 3.D. Risk\nFactors.”\nC. Organizational Structure\nC.1.

Information on the company\nD.2. Description of our sites\nSanofi industrial sites\nAs part of the process of transforming Sanofi and creating Global Business Units, we are continuing to adapt the organization of\nthe Manufacturing & Supply department in support of our new business model.\nThe Manufacturing & Supply department focuses on customer needs and service quality; the sharing of “Sanofi Manufacturing\nSystem” good manufacturing practices; and the development of a common culture committed to quality.\nThe organizational structure of Manufacturing & Supply is aligned on our corporate structure and our four Global Business Units:\nSpecialty Care, General Medicines, Vaccines and CHC.\nEUROAPI is a standalone business created by Sanofi and dedicated to the production, development and marketing of active\npharmaceutical ingredients (API) in Europe. EUROAPI houses the activities of six manufacturing sites (located in Italy, Germany,\nthe UK, France and Hungary), and was first listed on Euronext Paris on May 6, 2022. Following that initial listing, Sanofi no longer\ncontrols EUROAPI, and now accounts for its residual interest (29.8 % at December 31, 2023) using the equity method.\nThe Manufacturing & Supply department is also responsible for Sanofi Global HSE and Global Supply Chain.\nAt the end of 2023, we were carrying out industrial production at 54 sites in 24 countries:\n• 8 sites for our Specialty Care operations;\n• 22 sites for our General Medicines operations;\n• 10 sites for the industrial operations of Vaccines; and\n• 13 sites for our CHC operations.\nThe quantity of units sold in 2023, including in-house and outsourced production, was 4.3 billion. This comprised:\n• Biopharma: 2.3 billion units; and\n• CHC: 2.0 billion units.\nWe believe that our production facilities are in compliance with all material regulatory requirements, are properly maintained and\nare generally suitable for future needs. We regularly inspect and evaluate those facilities with regard to environmental, health,\nsafety and security matters, quality compliance and capacity utilization. For more information about our property, plant and\nequipment, see Note D.3. to our consolidated financial statements, included at Item 18. of this annual report, and\nsection “B.7.

Information on the company\nAs of December 31, 2023, our firm commitments in respect of future capital expenditures amounted to €638 million. The principal\nlocations involved are: for the Biopharma segment, the industrial facilities at Frankfurt (Germany); Le Trait, Maisons-Alfort,\nCompiègne, and Ambares (France); Cambridge (United States); Geel (Belgium); Origgio, Anagni, Brindisi, and Scoppito (Italy); and\nfor the Vaccines segment, the facilities at Swiftwater (United States), Toronto (Canada), Marcy-l’Étoile, Neuville-sur-Saône and\nVal-de-Reuil (France), and Singapore.\nIn the medium term and assuming no changes in the scope of consolidation, we expect to invest on average approximately\n€1.5 billion a year in property, plant and equipment. We believe that our own cash resources and the undrawn portion of our\nexisting credit facilities will be sufficient to fund these expenditures.\nOur principal ongoing capital expenditures are described below.\nSpecialty Care\nOur Specialty Care industrial operations are organized around two end-to-end clusters. We have four dedicated biotechnology\nhubs: Paris/Lyon (France), Frankfurt (Germany), Geel (Belgium) and Boston Area (United States). Exploiting the innovative\ntechniques on which biotech relies, including cell and microbiological culture and the development of viral vectors, our Specialty\nCare operations call for highly specific knowledge and expertise backed by dedicated production platforms to support global\nproduct launches.\nThe Waterford and Le Trait sites manufacture pre-filled DUPIXENT syringes.\nGeneral Medicines\nOur General Medicines industrial operations are organized through end-to-end clusters, with chemistry, pharmaceutical and\ninjectable sites organized through a network of 22 regional and local industrial sites in 14 countries, supporting growth in those\nmarkets.\nThis new organization encompasses a dedicated Launch Sites cluster from API manufacturing to finished goods packaging\n(Sisteron, Aramon, Ambarès, Scoppito).\nThe Frankfurt facility is our principal site for the manufacture of diabetes treatments.\nVaccines\nThe industrial operations of our Vaccines business are in a major investment phase, preparing for the upcoming growth of our\ninfluenza and Polio/Pertussis/Hib franchises, plus the mid-term growth linked to our mRNA roadmap and New Vaccines pipeline.\nMajor investments were announced in 2020 and 2021 with a new Evolutive Facility in France (Neuville-Sur-Saone) and a new\nfacility in Singapore for our New Vaccines pipeline. Other major investments are under way in France (including construction of a\nnew influenza vaccine building at Val-de-Reuil), Canada (a new pertussis vaccine building), the US and Mexico.\nConsumer Healthcare\nThe pharmaceutical industrial operations of our Consumer Healthcare (CHC) business are spread across a dedicated network.\nGlobal markets are supplied from our facilities at Compiègne (France), Cologne (Germany) and Origgio (Italy). We have recently\ninvested in new production capacities in Narita (Japan), Origgio (Italy) and Lisieux (France).\nInnovation and culture of industrial excellence\nThe ambition of our Manufacturing & Supply department is to continue to raise safety, quality and operating standards in Sanofi’s\nproduction activities, and to remain a world leader and a benchmark in the global pharmaceutical industry. To achieve this goal,\nall our activities share a common culture of industrial excellence, enshrined in the Sanofi Manufacturing System. This sets out a\nseries of priorities (such as customer service, constant improvement, site network optimization and transverse optimization) that\nconstitute our industrial vision and will be crucial to our mutual success.\nIn terms of operational excellence, we continue to build on our Top Decile performance program, focused on core sites and fully\nleveraging digital opportunities and technology innovations. We are also reinforcing the Sanofi Manufacturing System to drive\nmore improvement directly from the sites and reach our performance goals, while creating a culture of best practices shared\nacross the industrial network.\nD.4. Office space\nWe continue to evolve our roadmap to ensure our sites reflect the best-in-class experience and reinforce connections between\npeople, no matter where they are based.\nIn addition, we have enhanced our services to provide even more productivity, wellbeing, collaboration, innovation and ultimately\nfoster greater employee engagement.\nA number of projects are currently under way to deliver the next generation of work experience and hybrid work.\nWe continue to actively revisit our real estate footprint to ensure we are taking the right steps in the carbon neutrality race.\n52 SANOFI FORM 20-F 2023\nPART I\nITEM 4.

Significant operating information\nA.1.1. 2023 Overview\nDuring 2023, Sanofi continued to implement its “Play to Win” strategy, initiating the second phase which aims to launch major\ninnovations, redeploy resources and develop leading innovative R&D. For further information about our strategy, refer to “Item 4.\nInformation on the Company — B. Business Overview — B.1. Strategy.” Other significant events of the year are described below.\nOn January 11, 2023, Sanofi Ventures announced an additional multi-year commitment from Sanofi, which will increase the capital\nof the evergreen venture fund to more than $750 million. In addition to serving as a financial partner to top-tier early-to-mid-\nstage portfolio companies, the fund supports future efforts for business development and M&A opportunities within Sanofi. The\nadditional capital, confirmed by our Executive Committee, will also be allocated to advance the expansion and investment\ncapacity of the Sanofi Ventures investment team on a global scale.\nOn March 13, 2023, Sanofi and Provention Bio, Inc. (Provention), a US-based publicly-traded biopharmaceutical company\ndeveloping therapies to prevent and intercept immune-mediated diseases including type 1 diabetes, entered into an agreement\nunder which Sanofi acquired the outstanding shares of Provention common stock for $25.00 per share in an all-cash transaction\nvalued at approximately $2.8 billion. On April 27, 2023, Sanofi announced the completion of its acquisition of Provention. The\nacquisition added TZIELD (teplizumab-mzwv), a therapy for type 1 diabetes, to Sanofi’s core General Medicines asset portfolio,\nand further drives our strategic shift toward products with a differentiated profile.\nOn April 9, 2023, Sanofi and AstraZeneca simplified their contractual agreements for the development and commercialization of\nBEYFORTUS (nirsevimab) in the US. Sanofi thereby obtained control of all commercial rights to BEYFORTUS (nirsevimab) in the\nUS, and ended the sharing of commercial profits between the two partners in that territory. In line with the terms of the revised\nagreements and in accordance with IAS 38, Sanofi recognized an intangible asset of €1.6 billion for the fair value of the additional\nUS rights. On the same date, AstraZeneca and Sobi ended their participation agreement, signed in 2018, which transferred the\neconomic rights for the US territory to Sobi.\nSanofi simultaneously entered into an agreement with Sobi relating to direct royalties on US net sales of BEYFORTUS\n(nirsevimab). In line with the terms of that agreement, on April 9, 2023 Sanofi recognized a financial liability of €1.6 billion. That\nliability is classified as a financial liability at amortized cost under IFRS 9. Other than royalty payments, subsequent movements in\nthe liability comprise (i) the effects of the unwinding of discount and (ii) changes in estimates of future cash outflows for royalty\npayments. Those movements are recognized in the income statement within Net financial income/(expenses) in accordance\nwith paragraph B5.4.6 of IFRS 9. As of December 31, 2023 the liability was remeasured by an amount of €541 million, reflecting\nthe strong success of the US launch of BEYFORTUS (nirsevimab), which led to sales forecasts being revised upward from the\ninitial estimate.\nFor territories other than the US (except for China, which is now considered a “major market,” with profits/losses shared 50/50\nwith AstraZeneca), the existing agreement between AstraZeneca and Sanofi continues to govern the principal terms of the\ncollaboration: Sanofi recognizes the sales and cost of sales, and shares the Alliance’s commercial profits with AstraZeneca.\n54 SANOFI FORM 20-F 2023\nPART I\nITEM 5. Operating and financial review and prospects\nOn June 20, 2023, Sanofi announced that in a dispute referred to the International Chamber of Commerce arbitration panel, the\npanel had dismissed an indemnification claim against Sanofi from Boehringer Ingelheim and confirmed that Sanofi will not be\nliable for any potential losses in relation to the ongoing ZANTAC litigation in the US. This decision is final and non-appealable.\nOn July 28, 2023, Sanofi announced that it had entered into an agreement to acquire QRIB Intermediate Holdings, LLC (QRIB),\nthe owner of QUNOL, a market-leading US-based health & wellness brand. The deal reflects Sanofi’s ongoing drive to pursue\ngrowth opportunities and value creation for its CHC business. Sanofi’s acquisition of QRIB was completed on September 29,\n2023, at a purchase price of $1,419 million.\nOn October 3, 2023, Sanofi announced that it had entered into an agreement with Janssen Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Janssen), a\nJohnson & Johnson company, to develop and commercialize the vaccine candidate for extra-intestinal pathogenic E. coli (9-\nvalent) developed by Janssen, currently in Phase 3. The deal was closed on November 9, 2023. Under the terms of the\nagreement, both parties will co-fund current and future research and development costs. Sanofi paid $175 million upfront to\nJanssen, and may pay to Janssen milestone payments contingent on the attainment of certain development and commercial\nobjectives.\nOn October 4, 2023, Sanofi entered into a collaboration with Teva Pharmaceuticals to co-develop and co-commercialize asset\nTEV’574, currently in Phase 2b clinical trials for the treatment of Ulcerative Colitis and Crohn’s Disease, two types of inflammatory\nbowel disease. Under the terms of the new collaboration agreement, Teva received an upfront payment of €469 million\n($500 million) and may receive up to €940 million ($1 billion) in milestone payments, depending on the achievement of\ndevelopment and commercialization goals.\nOn October 23, 2023 Sanofi, along with WhiteLab Genomics (a specialist in applying AI to genomic medicine), the TaRGeT lab at\nthe University of Nantes (INSERM UMR 1089, one of France’s leading gene therapy labs) and Imagine Institute (AP-HP, INSERM,\nParis Cité University, Europe’s leading center for research, education and care in the field of genetic diseases), collectively\nlaunched the WIDGeT (Viral Vector Intelligent Design for Gene Therapy) consortium to accelerate the development of adeno-\nassociated virus (AAV) based gene therapies for the treatment of rare-to-frequent diseases (especially kidney and eye diseases)\nby using AI to develop next-generation AAVs. The consortium receives financial support from the Santé de France (Healthy\nFrance) 2030 tranche of the Innovation Santé (Health Innovation) Plan, overseen by the French Healthcare Innovation Agency\nand operated by Bpifrance, the French public investment bank.\nOn October 27, 2023, Sanofi provided a comprehensive update regarding its Play to Win strategy. This strategy continues to\nfocus on the critical goals of executing transformative medicine and vaccine launches, driving agile and efficient resource\ndeployment and enhancing R&D productivity. To that end, Sanofi announced plans to increase its R&D investments in an effort to\nfully realize its pipeline potential, drive long-term growth and enhance shareholder value. Sanofi also announced its intention to\nseparate its Consumer Healthcare (CHC) business, to enable greater management focus and resource allocation to the needs of\nthe Biopharma business, where value-creating opportunities and longer-term operational levers have been identified to support\nthe accelerated R&D investments. The intended separation would be completed at the earliest in the fourth quarter of 2024,\nmost likely through a capital markets transaction, via the creation of a listed entity headquartered in France.\nOn December 5, 2023, Sanofi announced the signature of a major research collaboration agreement with Aqemia to use artificial\nintelligence to accelerate the discovery of future medicines. This new collaboration dovetails with the discovery process, from\nidentifying initial active ingredients through to selection of preclinical candidates.\nIn 2023, various health authorities granted marketing approvals to several Sanofi products, paving the way for innovative new\ntreatments.\nIn Europe and China, DUPIXENT (dupilumab) was approved for the treatment of severe atopic dermatitis in children aged six\nmonths to five years who are candidates for systemic therapy. DUPIXENT was also approved in the European Union for the\ntreatment of eosinophilic esophagitis in adults and adolescents aged 12 and over.\nIn the US and Taiwan, the FDA and the Taiwan Food and Drug Administration approved ALTUVIIIO (efanesoctocog alfa), the first\nsustained-acting replacement factor VIII in its pharmacotherapeutic class, indicated for routine prophylaxis and on-demand\ntreatment and control of bleeding episodes, as well as for perioperative management, in adults and children with hemophilia A.\nNirsevimab (marketed as BEYFORTUS) was approved in Canada and the United States during 2023. It has also been accepted for\npriority review in China, and submitted in Japan.\nIn Europe, the EMA issued a positive opinion on Fexinidazole Winthrop as the first oral treatment of the acute form of sleeping\nsickness (rhodesiense) found in East and Southern Africa.\nOn December 21, 2023, Sanofi announced that the program evaluating tusamitamab ravtansine had ended after a Phase 3 trial\nas a second-line treatment in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) failed to meet a primary endpoint.\nFor further information about the biopharma products we sell, and about our research and development portfolio, refer\nto “Item 4. Information on the Company — B. Business Overview.”\nOur net sales for 2023 amounted to €43,070 million, an increase of 0.2% from 2022. At constant exchange rates (CER)(1), net\nsales rose by 5.3%, mainly reflecting strong growth for DUPIXENT and increased sales for our Vaccines business, more than\noffsetting lower sales for our Non Core Assets franchise.\n(1) Non-IFRS financial measure: see definition in “— Presentation of Net Sales” below.\nSANOFI FORM 20-F 2023 55\nPART I\nITEM 5. Operating and financial review and prospects\nNet income attributable to equity holders of Sanofi amounted to €5,400 million for 2023, compared with €8,371 million in\n2022, a €2,971 million decrease. Earnings per share was €4.31 in 2023, compared with €6.69 in 2022. Business net income(2)\nwas €10,155 million, down 1.8% on 2022, while business earnings per share (business EPS(2)) was 1.8% lower than in 2022 at €8.11.\nAt the Annual General Meeting on April 30, 2024, we will ask our shareholders to approve a dividend of €3.76 per share for the\n2023 financial year, representing a payout of 46.3% of our Business net income (see “— Consolidated balance sheet and debt.”).\nA.1.2. Impacts of competition from generics and biosimilars\nSome of our flagship products continued to suffer sales erosion in 2023 under the impact of competition from generics and\nbiosimilars. We do not believe it is possible to state with certainty what level of net sales would have been achieved in the\nabsence of generic competition. A comparison of our consolidated net sales for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022\n(see “— Results of Operations — Year Ended December 31, 2023 Compared with Year Ended December 31, 2022” below) for the\nmain products affected by generic and biosimilar competition shows a loss of €651 million of net sales on a reported basis.\nHowever, other parameters can also contribute to the loss of sales, such as a fall in the average selling price of certain products.\nThe table below sets forth the change by product.\nChange on a Change on a\n(€ million) 2023 2022 reported basis reported basis (%)\nAPROVEL Europe 78 82 (4) -4.9 %\nLANTUS Europe 357 426 (69) -16.2 %\nLOVENOX Europe 622 658 (36) -5.5 %\nPLAVIX Europe 96 101 (5) -5.0 %\nJEVTANA Europe 12 33 (21) -63.6 %\nLANTUS United States 281 757 (476) -62.9 %\nLOVENOX United States 7 17 (10) -58.8 %\nAPROVEL Japan 16 22 (6) -27.3 %\nLANTUS Japan 9 13 (4) -30.8 %\nPLAVIX Japan 33 53 (20) -37.7 %\nTotal 1,511 2,162 (651) -30.1 %\nWe expect the erosion caused by generic competition to continue in 2024, with a negative impact on our net income. The\nproducts likely to be impacted in 2024 include those that already faced generic competition in 2023, but whose sales can\nreasonably be expected to be subject to further sales erosion in 2024 (see products listed in the table above). In addition, we\nhave experienced generic competition in the United States for AUBAGIO since March 2023 and for MOZOBIL since July 2023,\nfollowing expiry of exclusivity in that country. In Europe, AUBAGIO generic competition began in in the fourth quarter of 2023\nand will intensify in 2024, while generic competition for MOZOBIL is expected to begin between February and August 2024.\nIn 2023, aggregate consolidated net sales of those products in Europe, the United States and Japan amounted to €1,511 million;\nthis comprised €288 million in the United States (including €281 million in net sales of LANTUS); €1,165 million in Europe; and\n€58 million in Japan. The negative impact on our 2024 net sales is likely to represent a substantial portion of those sales, but the\nactual impact will depend on a number of factors, such as the impact of generics and biosimilars on our molecules, but also the\nmarket entry of generics of molecules that are in competition with our products.\nIn China, the authorities have implemented a range of healthcare cost containment measures, including the Volume Based\nProcurement (VBP) reverse auction that particularly impacts our insulin-based products, PLAVIX, APROVEL, and LOVENOX (see\nalso “Item 4. Information on the Company — B. Business Overview — B.5.4. Pricing & Reimbursement”). A large number of\nmolecules were selected to submit tenders under successive waves of the VBP program, with the successful bidders being\nawarded a high level of market share in return for offering lower prices. We participated in a number of VBP bids and were\nselected for only part of the volumes awarded for 2022, 2023 and 2024 in respect of insulins (TOUJEO and LANTUS), PLAVIX and\nAPROVEL, in return for a considerable reduction in unit prices. Sanofi was not among the nine companies selected to supply\nenoxaparin sodium based products in the latest VBP allocation, which covers 50% of volumes for the 2024-25 period.\n(2) Non-IFRS financial measure: see definition in “— Segment Information — Business Net Income” below.\n56 SANOFI FORM 20-F 2023\nPART I\nITEM 5. Operating and financial review and prospects\nA.1.3. Purchase accounting effects\nOur results of operations and financial condition for the years ended December 31, 2023, and 2022 have been significantly\naffected by our past acquisitions (acquisition of Aventis in August 2004, acquisition of Genzyme in April 2011, exchange of our\nAnimal Health business (Merial) for Boehringer Ingelheim’s CHC business in January 2017, acquisition of Bioverativ in 2018, and\ncertain other transactions). See “— Critical accounting and reporting policies — Business combinations” below for an explanation\nof the impact of business combinations on our results of operations.\nThe Genzyme business combination has generated significant amortization of intangible assets (€405 million in 2023,\nand €513 million in 2022). The exchange of Merial for Boehringer Ingelheim’s CHC business has generated amortization of\nintangible assets (€184 million in 2023, and €188 million in 2022). The Bioverativ business combination has generated significant\namortization of intangible assets (€633 million in 2023, and €375 million in 2022). The Kadmon acquisition has generated\namortization of intangible assets (€156 million in 2023, and €160 million in 2022). The Provention acquisition has generated\namortization of intangible assets (€144 million in 2023).\nIn order to isolate the purchase accounting effects of all acquisitions and certain other items, we use a non-IFRS financial\nmeasure that we refer to as “business net income” (see definition and discussion of reconciliation to the IFRS financial measure\nOperating income in “— Segment Information and Business Net Income —Business Net Income” below).\nA.1.4. Sources of revenues and expenses\nRevenues. Revenue arising from the sale of goods is presented in the income statement within Net sales. Net sales comprise\nrevenue from sales of biopharma products, consumer healthcare products, and active ingredients, net of sales returns, of\ncustomer incentives and discounts, and of certain sales-based payments paid or payable to the healthcare authorities. Returns,\ndiscounts, incentives and rebates are recognized in the period in which the underlying sales are recognized, as a reduction of\nsales revenue. See Note B.13.1. to our consolidated financial statements included at Item 18. of this annual report. We sell\nbiopharma products directly, through alliances, and by licensing arrangements throughout the world. When we sell products\ndirectly, we record sales revenues as part of our consolidated net sales. When we sell products through alliances, the revenues\nreflected in our consolidated financial statements are based on the contractual arrangements governing those alliances. For\nmore information about our alliances, see “— Financial Presentation of Alliances” below.\nThe line item Other revenues is used to recognize all revenue that falls within the scope of IFRS 15 but does not relate to sales of\nSanofi products. It mainly comprises (i) royalties received from licensing intellectual property rights to third parties; (ii) VaxServe\nsales of products sourced from third-party manufacturers; and (iii) revenue received under agreements for Sanofi to provide\nmanufacturing services to third parties. Royalties received under licensing arrangements are recognized over the period during\nwhich the underlying sales are recognized. VaxServe is a Biopharma segment entity whose operations include the distribution\nwithin the United States of vaccines and other products manufactured by third parties.\nCost of Sales. Our cost of sales consists primarily of the cost of purchasing raw materials and active ingredients, labor and other\ncosts relating to our manufacturing activities, packaging materials, payments made under licensing agreements and distribution\ncosts. We have license agreements under which we manufacture, sell and distribute products that are patented by other\ncompanies. When we pay royalties, we record them in Cost of sales.\nOperating Income. Our operating income reflects our revenues, our cost of sales and the remainder of our operating expenses,\nthe most significant of which are research and development expenses and selling and general expenses. For our operating\nsegments, we also measure our results of operations through an indicator referred to as “Business Operating Income,” which we\ndescribe below under “— Segment Information and Business Net Income — Business Operating Income.”\nA.1.5. Segment information and Business net income\n1/ Operating segments\nIn accordance with IFRS 8 (Operating Segments), the segment information reported by Sanofi is prepared on the basis of internal\nmanagement data provided to our Chief Executive Officer, who is the chief operating decision maker of Sanofi. The performance\nof those segments is monitored individually using internal reports and common indicators. The operating segment disclosures\nrequired under IFRS 8 are provided in Note D.35. to the consolidated financial statements included at Item 18. of this annual\nreport.\nIn 2022, Sanofi reported three operating segments (Pharmaceuticals, Vaccines and CHC). The costs of the global support\nfunctions (Corporate Affairs, Finance, People & Culture, Legal, Ethics, Business Integrity & Global Security, Information Solutions &\nTechnology, Sanofi Business Services, etc.), which are mainly managed centrally at group-wide level, were presented within the\n“Other” category.\nIn 2023, Sanofi reviewed the presentation of its segment information following adjustments to its internal reporting systems in\norder to reflect (i) progress on the “Play to Win” strategy leading to the creation of the standalone CHC Global Business Unit\n(GBU) which, in addition to integrated research, development and production functions now also has its own dedicated global\nsupport functions (including Finance, People & Culture, Legal, Ethics, Business Integrity & Global Security, Information Solutions &\nTechnology, Global Business Services, etc.); and (ii) organizational changes to Sanofi’s Manufacturing & Supply global function\n(previously known as Industrial Affairs).\nSANOFI FORM 20-F 2023 57\nPART I\nITEM 5. Operating and financial review and prospects\nConsequently, with effect from January 1, 2023, Sanofi reports two operating segments: Biopharma and CHC (3).\nThe Biopharma operating segment comprises commercial operations and research, development and production activities\nrelating to the Specialty Care, General Medicines and Vaccines franchises, for all geographical territories. The segment’s results\ninclude the costs of global support functions that are not within the managerial responsibility of the CHC GBU.\nThe CHC operating segment comprises commercial operations relating to CHC products, and research, development and\nproduction activities and global support functions (as listed above) dedicated to the segment, for all geographical territories. The\nCHC GBU segment’s results reflect all incurred costs of global support functions attributable to its business.\nThe “Other” category comprises reconciling items, primarily but not limited to (i) gains and losses on centralized foreign exchange\nrisk hedging transactions that cannot be allocated to the operating segments and (ii) gains and losses on retained commitments\nin respect of previously divested operations.\n2/ Business operating income (non-IFRS financial measure)\nWe report segment results on the basis of “Business operating income.” This non-IFRS indicator is used internally by Sanofi’s chief\noperating decision maker to measure the performance of each operating segment and to allocate resources. For a definition of\n“Business operating income,” and a reconciliation between that indicator and IFRS Income before tax and investments\naccounted for using the equity method, refer to Note D.35. to our consolidated financial statements included at Item 18. of this\nannual report.\nAt Group level, “Business operating income” is a non-IFRS financial measure which is reconciled with IFRS Operating income.\nIFRS Operating income for 2023 amounted to €7,875 million versus €10,656 million for 2022; refer to Note D.35. to our\nconsolidated financial statements included at Item 18. of this annual report. Our ratio of Operating Income to Net Sales was\n18.3% in 2023 versus 24.8% in 2022.\nOur “Business operating income” for 2023 amounted to €12,670 million, versus €13,040 million for 2022, while our “Business\noperating income margin” was 29.4%, versus 30.3% for 2022. “Business operating income margin” is a non-IFRS financial\nmeasure, which we define as the ratio of our “Business operating income” to IFRS Net sales.\nBecause our “Business operating income” and “Business operating income margin” are not standardized measures, they may not\nbe directly comparable with the non-IFRS financial measures of other companies using the same or similar non-IFRS financial\nmeasures. Although management uses those non-IFRS measures to set goals and measure performance, they have no\nstandardized meaning prescribed by IFRS. These non-IFRS measures are presented solely to permit investors to more fully\nunderstand how Sanofi’s management assesses underlying performance. These non-IFRS measures are not, and should not be\nviewed as, a substitute for IFRS measures, and should be viewed in conjunction with our IFRS financials and performance\nmeasures. As a result, such measures have limits in their usefulness to investors.\n3/ Business net income (non-IFRS financial measure)\nWe believe that the understanding of our operational performance by our management and our investors is enhanced by\nreporting “Business net income.” This non-IFRS financial measure represents “Business operating income,” less (i) net financial\nexpenses (except those related to financial liabilities accounted for at amortized cost and subject to periodic remeasurement in\naccordance with paragraph B5.4.6 of IFRS 9) and (ii) income tax expense related to “Business operating income”.\n“Business net income” is a non-IFRS financial measure; it is reconciled with IFRS Net income attributable to equity holders of\nSanofi, which amounted to €5,400 million for 2023 versus €8,371 million for 2022.\nOur “Business net income” for 2023 was €10,155 million, 1.8% lower than in 2022 (€10,341 million). That represents 23.6% of our\nnet sales, compared with 24.1 % in 2022.\nWe also report “Business earnings per share” (“Business EPS”), a non-IFRS financial measure we define as “Business net income”\ndivided by the weighted average number of shares outstanding. “Business EPS” was €8.11 for 2023, 1.8% lower than the 2022\nfigure of €8.26, based on an average number of shares outstanding of 1,251.7 million for 2023 and 1,251.9 million for 2022.\nThe table below reconciles our “Business operating income” to our “Business net income”:\n(€ million) December 31, 2023 December 31, 2022\nBusiness operating income 12,670 13,040\nFinancial income and expenses (except those related to financial liabilities accounted for at amortized cost (181) (234)\nand subject to periodic remeasurement in accordance with paragraph B5.4.6 of IFRS 9)\nIncome tax expense on business operating income (2,334) (2,465)\nBusiness net income 10,155 10,341\nWe define “Business net income” as Net income attributable to equity holders of Sanofi determined under IFRS, excluding the\nfollowing items:\n• amortization and impairment losses charged against intangible assets (other than software and other rights of an industrial or\noperational nature);\n• fair value remeasurements of contingent consideration relating to business combinations (IFRS 3), or to business divestments;\n(3) Due to a lack of available data and the complex adjustments that would be required (particularly for our reporting tools), the 2021 figures have not been\nrestated to reflect changes arising from our new organizational structure.\n58 SANOFI FORM 20-F 2023\nPART I\nITEM 5.

The amount of the loss recognized was based on the share price as of December 31, 2023 (€5.73), as used in determining the recoverable\namount of the equity interest as of that date.\nSANOFI FORM 20-F 2023 59\nPART I\nITEM 5. Operating and financial review and prospects\nThe most significant reconciling items between “Business net income” and Net income attributable to equity holders of Sanofi\nrelate to (i) the purchase accounting effects of our acquisitions of groups of assets and business combinations, particularly the\namortization and impairment of intangible assets (other than software and other rights of an industrial or operational nature);\n(ii) the impacts of restructurings or transactions regarded as non-recurring, where the amounts involved are particularly\nsignificant; and (iii) remeasurements recognized through profit or loss in respect of (a) amounts receivable in respect of business\ndivestments and accounted for at fair value, (b) liabilities arising from business combinations (IFRS 3) and accounted for at fair\nvalue, and (c) liabilities accounted for at amortized cost and subject to periodic remeasurement under IFRS 9. We believe that\nexcluding those impacts enhances an investor’s understanding of our underlying economic performance, because it gives a\nbetter representation of our recurring operating performance.\nWe believe that eliminating charges related to the purchase accounting effects of our acquisitions and business combinations\n(particularly amortization and impairment of some intangible assets) enhances comparability of our ongoing operating\nperformance relative to our peers. Those intangible assets (principally rights relating to research and development, technology\nplatforms and commercialization of products) are accounted for in accordance with IAS 38 (Intangible Assets) and IFRS 3\n(Business Combinations).\nWe also believe that eliminating the other effects of business combinations (such as the incremental cost of sales arising from the\nworkdown of acquired inventories remeasured at fair value in business combinations) gives a better understanding of our\nrecurring operating performance.\nEliminating restructuring costs and similar items enhances comparability with our peers because those costs are incurred in\nconnection with reorganization and transformation processes intended to optimize our operations.\nWe believe that eliminating the effects of transactions that we regard as non-recurring and that involve particularly significant\namounts (such as major gains and losses on disposals, and costs and provisions associated with major litigation and other major\nnon-recurring items) improves comparability from one period to the next.\nFinally, remeasurements recognized in profit or loss during the period in respect of (i) assets or liabilities accounted for at fair\nvalue and recognized in the balance sheet in connection with business acquisitions or divestments or (ii) liabilities accounted for\nat amortized cost and subject to periodic remeasurement, generally determined on the basis of revised sales forecasts, are not\nreflective of our operating performance.\nWe remind investors, however, that “Business net income” should not be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, Net\nincome attributable to equity holders of Sanofi reported in accordance with IFRS. In addition, we strongly encourage investors\nand potential investors not to rely on any single financial measure but to review our financial statements, including the notes\nthereto, carefully and in their entirety.\nWe compensate for the material limitations described above by using “Business net income” only to supplement our IFRS\nfinancial reporting and by ensuring that our disclosures provide sufficient information for a full understanding of all adjustments\nincluded in “Business net income.”\nBecause our “Business net income” and “Business EPS” are not standardized measures, they may not be directly comparable with\nthe non-IFRS financial measures of other companies using the same or similar non-IFRS financial measures.\nA.1.6. Presentation of net sales\nIn the discussion below, we present our consolidated net sales for 2023 and 2022. We analyze our net sales by various categories\nincluding segment, franchise, product, and geographical region. In addition to reported net sales, we analyze non-IFRS financial\nmeasures designed to isolate the impact on our net sales of currency exchange rates and changes in the structure of our group.\nWhen we refer to changes in our net sales at constant exchange rates (CER), that means that we have excluded the effect of\nexchange rates by recalculating net sales for the relevant period using the exchange rates that were used for the previous period.\nA presentation of consolidated net sales for 2022 compared with 2021 is available in our annual report filed on February 24, 2023,\nin “Item 5. Operating and Financial Review and Prospects — A. Operating Results — A.2.1. Net Sales.”\nA.1.7. Financial presentation of alliances\nWe have entered into a number of alliances for the development, co-promotion and/or co-marketing of our products. We believe\nthat a presentation of our two principal alliances is useful to an understanding of our financial statements.\n1/ Alliance arrangements with Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc. (Regeneron)\nCollaboration agreements on human therapeutic antibodies\nIn November 2007, Sanofi and Regeneron signed two agreements (amended in November 2009) relating to human therapeutic\nantibodies: (i) the Discovery and Preclinical Development Agreement, and (ii) the License and Collaboration Agreement, relating\nto clinical development and commercialization. Under the License and Collaboration Agreement, Sanofi had an option to develop\nand commercialize antibodies discovered by Regeneron under the Discovery and Preclinical Development Agreement.\n60 SANOFI FORM 20-F 2023\nPART I\nITEM 5. Operating and financial review and prospects\nDiscovery and development\nBecause Sanofi decided not to exercise its option to extend the Discovery and Preclinical Development Agreement, that\nagreement expired on December 31, 2017.\nAs a result of Sanofi’s exercise of an option with respect to an antibody under the Discovery and Preclinical Development\nAgreement, such antibody became a “Licensed Product” under the License and Collaboration Agreement, pursuant to which\nSanofi and Regeneron co-develop the antibody with Sanofi initially being wholly responsible for funding the development\nprogram. On receipt of the first positive Phase 3 trial results for any antibody being developed under the License and\nCollaboration Agreement, the subsequent development costs for that antibody are split 80% Sanofi, 20% Regeneron. Amounts\nreceived from Regeneron under the License and Collaboration Agreement are recognized by Sanofi as a reduction in the line\nitem Research and development expenses. Co-development with Regeneron of the antibodies DUPIXENT, KEVZARA and\nREGN3500 (SAR440340 - itepekimab) is ongoing under the License and Collaboration Agreement as of December 31, 2023.\nOnce a product begins to be commercialized, and provided that the share of quarterly results under the agreement represents a\nprofit, Sanofi is entitled to an additional portion of Regeneron’s profit-share (capped at 20% of Regeneron’s share of quarterly\nprofits since April 1, 2022, and at 10% until March 31, 2022) until Regeneron has paid 50% of the cumulative development costs\nincurred by the parties in the collaboration (see Note D.21.1.).\nOn the later of (i) 24 months before the scheduled launch date or (ii) the first positive Phase 3 trial results, Sanofi and Regeneron\nshare the commercial expenses of the antibodies co-developed under the License and Collaboration Agreement.\nCommercialization\nSanofi is the lead party with respect to the commercialization of all co-developed antibodies, and Regeneron has certain option\nrights to co-promote the antibodies. Regeneron has exercised its co-promotion rights in the United States and in certain other\ncountries. Sanofi recognizes all sales of the antibodies. Profits and losses arising from commercial operations in the United States\nare split 50/50. Outside the United States, Sanofi is entitled to between 55% and 65% of profits depending on sales of the\nantibodies, and bears 55% of any losses. The share of profits and losses due to or from Regeneron under the agreement is\nrecognized within the line items Other operating income or Other operating expenses, which are components of Operating\nincome.\nIn addition, Regeneron is entitled to receive payments contingent on the attainment of specified levels of aggregate sales on all\nantibodies outside the United States, on a rolling twelve-month basis. A liability for those payments is recognized on the balance\nsheet when it is probable that the specified level of aggregate sales will be met. The opposite entry for that liability is capitalized\nwithin Other intangible assets on the balance sheet. Two payments of $50 million each were made in 2022, following\nattainment first of $2.0 billion and then of $2.5 billion in sales of all antibodies outside the United States on a rolling twelve-month\nbasis. The final milestone payment of $50 million, payable to Regeneron in the event that $3.0 billion in sales on a rolling twelve-\nmonth basis is attained, was made in 2023.\nAmendments to the collaboration agreements\nIn January 2018, Sanofi and Regeneron signed a set of amendments to their collaboration agreements, including an amendment\nthat allowed for the funding of additional programs on DUPIXENT and REGN3500 (SAR440340 – itepekimab) with an intended\nfocus on extending the current range of indications, finding new indications, and improving co-morbidity between multiple\npathologies.\nEffective April 1, 2020, Sanofi and Regeneron signed a Cross License and Commercialization Agreement for PRALUENT, whereby\nSanofi obtained sole ex-US rights to PRALUENT, and Regeneron obtained sole US rights to PRALUENT along with a right to 5%\nroyalties on Sanofi’s sales of PRALUENT outside the United States. Each party is solely responsible for funding the development,\nmanufacturing and commercialization of PRALUENT in their respective territories. Although each party has sole responsibility for\nsupplying PRALUENT in its respective territory, Sanofi and Regeneron entered into agreements to support manufacturing needs\nfor each other.\nEffective September 30, 2021, Sanofi and Regeneron signed an amendment to their collaboration agreement in order to specify\nallocations of responsibilities and associated resources between the two parties in connection with the co-promotion\nof DUPIXENT in certain countries. The terms of the collaboration relating to REGN3500 (SAR440340 – itepekimab) are\nunchanged.\nEffective July 1, 2022, Sanofi and Regeneron signed an amendment to their collaboration agreement in order to increase the\nadditional portion of Regeneron’s quarterly profit-share attributable to Sanofi from 10% to 20% with retroactive impact as of\nApril 1, 2022.\nImmuno-oncology (IO) collaboration agreements\nOn July 1, 2015, Sanofi and Regeneron signed two agreements – the IO Discovery and Development Agreement and the IO\nLicense and Collaboration Agreement (IO LCA) – relating to new antibody cancer treatments in the field of immuno-oncology.\nThe Amended IO Discovery Agreement, effective from December 31, 2018, was terminated through a Letter Amendment dated\nMarch 16, 2021 in which Sanofi formalized its opt-out from the BCMAxCD3 and MUC16xCD3 programs.\nSANOFI FORM 20-F 2023 61\nPART I\nITEM 5. Operating and financial review and prospects\nLIBTAYO (cemiplimab)\nUnder the 2015 IO LCA as amended in January 2018, Sanofi and Regeneron committed funding of no more than $1,640 million,\nsplit on a 50/50 basis ($820 million per company), for the development of REGN2810 (cemiplimab, trademark LIBTAYO), a PD-1\ninhibitor antibody. The funding was raised to $1,840 million by way of amendment effective on September 30, 2021. Regeneron\nwas responsible for the commercialization of LIBTAYO in the United States, and Sanofi in all other territories. Sanofi has exercised\nits option to co-promote LIBTAYO in the United States. In 2021, Regeneron exercised its option to co-promote LIBTAYO in\ncertain other countries.\nThe IO LCA also provided for a one-time milestone payment of $375 million by Sanofi to Regeneron in the event that sales of a\nPD-1 product were to exceed, in the aggregate, $2 billion in any consecutive 12-month period.\nUnder the IO LCA Sanofi and Regeneron shared equally in profits and losses generated by the commercialization of collaboration\nproducts, except that Sanofi was entitled to an additional portion of Regeneron’s profit-share (capped at 10% of Regeneron’s\nshare of quarterly profits) until Regeneron had paid 50% of the cumulative development costs incurred by the parties under the\nIO Discovery Agreement, as amended.\nLIBTAYO is approved in the United States and Europe for the treatment of two types of locally advanced or metastatic skin\ncancer (cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma and basal cell carcinoma) and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). It is also approved\nin Brazil and Canada as a second line treatment for recurring or metastatic cervical cancer. In the fourth quarter of 2022, it was\napproved in the United States in association with chemotherapy for the treatment of NSCLC, and in Europe and Japan as a\nsecond line treatment for recurring or metastatic cervical cancer. LIBTAYO is currently approved in more than 30 countries.\nIn June 2022, Sanofi and Regeneron restructured their IO LCA. Under the terms of the Amended and Restated IO LCA,\nRegeneron holds exclusive worldwide licensing rights to LIBTAYO with effect from July 1, 2022.\nIn July 2022, Sanofi received as consideration an upfront payment of $900 million (€856 million), which was recognized within\nOther operating income on the date of receipt. The same line item also includes a regulatory milestone payment of $100 million\n(€96 million) following the US FDA approval in November 2022 of LIBTAYO in combination with chemotherapy as a first line\ntreatment for NSCLC. In addition, Sanofi is entitled to royalties of 11% and to milestone payments (€116 million in 2023, €111 million\nin 2022) linked to global net sales of LIBTAYO; those royalties are recognized within Other operating income in line with the\npattern of sales. All of the cash inflows relating to the above items (€196 million in 2023, €952 million in 2022) are presented\nwithin Net cash provided by/(used in) operating activities in the consolidated statement of cash flows.\nThe amendment to the terms of the IO LCA resulted in Sanofi recognizing an accelerated amortization charge of €226 million\nin 2022; this was allocated to the LIBTAYO product rights included within the residual carrying amount of the intangible asset\nrecognized in July 2015 to reflect rights to an antibody targeting the immune checkpoint receptor PD-1 (programmed cell death\nprotein-1) under the Sanofi/Regeneron alliance.\nThe transaction also includes a time-limited transitional services agreement with Regeneron which includes manufacturing,\ndistribution (for which Sanofi acts as agent), and promotion.\nInvestor agreement\nIn 2014 and 2020, Sanofi and Regeneron amended the investor agreement entered into by the two companies in 2007. Under\nthe terms of the amendments, Sanofi accepted various restrictions, including “standstill” provisions that contractually prohibit\nSanofi from seeking to directly or indirectly exert control of Regeneron or acquiring more than 30% of Regeneron’s capital stock\n(consisting of the outstanding shares of common stock and the shares of Class A stock). This prohibition remains in place until the\nearlier of (i) the later of the fifth anniversaries of the expiration or earlier termination of the ZALTRAP collaboration agreement\nwith Regeneron (related to the development and commercialization of ZALTRAP) or the collaboration agreement with Regeneron\non monoclonal antibodies (see “Collaboration agreements on human therapeutic antibodies” above), each as amended or\n(ii) other specified events.\nStarting in 2018 Sanofi began to sell shares of Regeneron stock and announced on May 29, 2020 the closing of its sale of\n13 million shares of Regeneron common stock in a registered offering and a private sale to Regeneron (see Note D.2.).\nPursuant to subsequent sales in 2022, Sanofi no longer holds any shares of Regeneron stock, as of December 31, 2023.\n2/ Agreements on the commercialization of BEYFORTUS (nirsevimab, previously MEDI8897) in the US\nOn March 1, 2017, Sanofi and AstraZeneca entered into an agreement to develop and commercialize a monoclonal antibody\n(MEDI8897, nirsevimab) for the prevention of Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) associated illness in newborns and infants.\nUnder the terms of the agreement, Sanofi made an upfront payment of €120 million in March 2017, a development milestone\npayment of €30 million in the third quarter of 2019, a regulatory milestone payment of €25 million associated with the approval of\nBEYFORTUS (nirsevimab) by the EMA in Europe in November 2022, and a regulatory milestone payment of €65 million associated\nwith the approval of BEYFORTUS (nirsevimab) by the US FDA in July 2023. In addition, Sanofi could pay up to €375 million if sales\nobjectives are met. Those amounts are recognized as a component of the value of the intangible asset when payment becomes\nprobable. During 2023, an amount of €25 million was recognized as an accrued expense further to a contractual threshold being\npassed.\n62 SANOFI FORM 20-F 2023\nPART I\nITEM 5. Operating and financial review and prospects\nThe agreement also specifies that AstraZeneca is responsible for development and manufacturing, and Sanofi for\ncommercialization. Sanofi recognizes the sales and cost of sales (purchases of finished products from AstraZeneca) and shares\nthe Alliance’s commercial profits (i) 50/50 in major territories and (ii) based on 25% of net sales in other territories. The share of\ncommercial profits and losses due to or from AstraZeneca is recognized as a component of operating income, within the line\nitems Other operating income or Other operating expenses. In addition, Sanofi and AstraZeneca share development costs\n50/50, with Sanofi’s portion recognized within the income statement line item Research and development expenses.\nOn April 9, 2023, Sanofi and AstraZeneca simplified their contractual agreements for the development and commercialization of\nBEYFORTUS (nirsevimab) in the US. Sanofi thereby obtained control of all commercial rights to BEYFORTUS (nirsevimab) in the\nUS, and ended the sharing of commercial profits between the two partners in that territory. In line with the terms of the revised\nagreements and in accordance with IAS 38, Sanofi recognized an intangible asset of €1.6 billion for the fair value of the additional\nUS rights. On the same date, AstraZeneca and Sobi ended their participation agreement, signed in 2018, which transferred the\neconomic rights for the US territory to Sobi.\nSanofi simultaneously entered into an agreement with Sobi relating to direct royalties on US net sales of BEYFORTUS\n(nirsevimab). In line with the terms of that agreement, on April 9, 2023 Sanofi recognized a financial liability amounting to\n€1.6 billion. That liability is classified as a financial liability at amortized cost under IFRS 9. Other than royalty payments,\nsubsequent movements in the liability comprise (i) the unwinding of discount and (ii) changes in estimates of future cash outflows\nfor royalty payments. Those movements will be recognized in the income statement within Net financial income/(expenses) in\naccordance with paragraph B.5.4.6 of IFRS 9.\nAs of December 31, 2023 the liability was remeasured by an amount of €541 million, reflecting the strong success of the US launch\nof BEYFORTUS (nirsevimab), which led to sales forecasts being revised upward from the initial estimate. The resulting adjustment\nwas recognized within Financial expenses.\nFor territories other than the US (except for China, which is now considered a “major market,” with profits/losses shared 50/50\nwith AstraZeneca), the existing agreement between AstraZeneca and Sanofi continues to govern the principal terms of the\ncollaboration: Sanofi recognizes the sales and cost of sales and shares the Alliance’s commercial profits with AstraZeneca.\nIn May 2023, data from the HARMONIE Phase 3b study confirmed that nirsevimab prevents infant hospitalizations due to RSV\nwith consistent and high efficacy.\nBEYFORTUS (nirsevimab) was approved in Europe in November 2022, and in the United States on July 17, 2023.\nA.1.8. Impact of exchange rates\nWe report our consolidated financial statements in euros. Because we earn a significant portion of our revenues in countries\nwhere the euro is not the local currency, our results of operations can be significantly affected by exchange rate movements\nbetween the euro and other currencies, primarily the US dollar and, to a lesser extent, the Japanese yen, and currencies in\nemerging countries. We experience these effects even though certain of these countries do not account for a large portion of our\nnet sales. In 2023, we earned 43.0% of our net sales in the United States. An increase in the value of the US dollar against the euro\nhas a positive impact on both our revenues and our operating income. A decrease in the value of the US dollar against the euro\nhas a negative impact on our revenues, which is not offset by an equal reduction in our costs and therefore negatively affects our\noperating income. A variation in the value of the US dollar has a particularly significant impact on our operating income, which is\nhigher in the United States than elsewhere.\nFor a description of arrangements entered into to manage operating foreign exchange risks as well as our hedging policy,\nsee “Item 11. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk,” and “Item 3. Key Information — D. Risk Factors — Risks\nRelated to Financial Markets — Fluctuations in currency exchange rates could adversely affect our results of operations and\nfinancial condition.”\nA.1.9. Divestments\nReserved.\nA.1.10. Acquisitions\nOn July 28, 2023, Sanofi agreed to acquire QRIB Intermediate Holdings, LLC (QRIB), the owner of QUNOL, a market-leading US-\nbased health & wellness brand. The acquisition strengthened Sanofi’s CHC operations in the Vitamin, Mineral and Supplements\n(VMS) category. The acquisition of QRIB by Sanofi was completed on September 29, 2023, at a purchase price of $1,419 million.\nThe impact of this acquisition is reflected in Acquisitions of consolidated undertakings and investments accounted for using\nthe equity method in the consolidated statement of cash flows and represents a net cash outflow of $1,410 million.\nOn March 13, 2023, Sanofi entered into a merger agreement with Provention Bio, Inc. (Provention), a US-based publicly traded\nbiopharmaceutical company developing therapies to prevent and intercept immune-mediated diseases including type 1 diabetes.\nUnder the terms of the agreement, Sanofi acquired the outstanding shares of Provention common stock for $25.00 per share in\nan all-cash transaction valued at approximately $2.8 billion. The acquisition of Provention was completed on April 27, 2023, with\nSanofi holding all of the shares of Provention on expiration of the tender offer. The impact of this acquisition as reflected within\nthe line item Acquisitions of consolidated undertakings and investments accounted for using the equity method in the\nconsolidated statement of cash flows is a net cash outflow of $2,722 million.\nSANOFI FORM 20-F 2023 63\nPART I\nITEM 5. Operating and financial review and prospects\nOn February 8, 2022, Sanofi acquired the entire share capital of the immuno-oncology company Amunix Pharmaceuticals, Inc.\n(Amunix), thereby gaining access to Amunix’s innovative PRO-XTEN technology and a promising pipeline of immunotherapies.\nThe acquisition price of Amunix comprised a fixed payment of €970 million, plus contingent consideration in the form of\nmilestone payments based on attainment of certain future development objectives of up to $225 million, the fair value of which\nas of the acquisition date was €156 million. The impact of this acquisition was reflected within the line item Acquisitions of\nconsolidated undertakings and investments accounted for using the equity method in the consolidated statement of cash\nflows is a net cash outflow of €852 million.\nFor further information about the acquisitions mentioned above, see Notes D.1. and D.2. to our consolidated financial statements\nincluded at Item 18. of this annual report.\nA.1.11. Critical accounting and reporting policies\nOur consolidated financial statements are affected by the accounting and reporting policies that we use. Certain of our\naccounting and reporting policies are critical to an understanding of our results of operations and financial condition, and in some\ncases the application of these critical policies can be significantly affected by the estimates, judgments and assumptions made\nby management during the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. The accounting and reporting policies that we\nhave identified as fundamental to a full understanding of our results of operations and financial condition are the following:\n1/ Revenue recognition\nOur policies with respect to revenue recognition are discussed in Note B.13. to our consolidated financial statements included\nat Item 18. of this annual report. Revenue arising from the sale of goods is presented in the income statement within Net sales.\nNet sales comprise revenue from sales of pharmaceutical products, consumer healthcare products, active ingredients and\nvaccines, net of sales returns, of customer incentives and discounts, and of certain sales-based payments paid or payable to the\nhealthcare authorities. In accordance with IFRS 15 (Revenue from Contracts with Customers), such revenue is recognized when\nSanofi transfers control over the product to the customer. Control refers to the ability to direct the use of, and obtain\nsubstantially all of the remaining benefits from, the products. For the vast majority of contracts, revenue is recognized when the\nproduct is physically transferred, in accordance with the delivery and acceptance terms agreed with the customer.\nFor contracts entered into by Sanofi Pasteur, transfer of control is usually determined by reference to the terms of release\n(immediate or deferred) and acceptance of batches of vaccine.\nAs regards contracts with distributors, Sanofi does not recognize revenue when the product is physically transferred to the\ndistributor in case of products sold on consignment, or if the distributor acts as an agent. In such cases, revenue is recognized\nwhen control is transferred to the end customer, and the distributor’s commission is presented within the line item Selling and\ngeneral expenses in the income statement.\nWe offer various types of price reductions on our products. In particular, products sold in the United States are covered by\nvarious programs (such as Medicare and Medicaid) under which products are sold at a discount. Rebates are granted to\nhealthcare authorities, and under contractual arrangements with certain customers. Some wholesalers are entitled to chargeback\nincentives based on the selling price to the end customer, under specific contractual arrangements. Cash discounts may also be\ngranted for prompt payment. The discounts, incentives and rebates described above are estimated on the basis of specific\ncontractual arrangements with our customers or of specific terms of the relevant regulations and/or agreements applicable for\ntransactions with healthcare authorities, and of assumptions about the attainment of sales targets. We also estimate the amount\nof sales returns, on the basis of contractual sales terms and reliable historical data. Discounts, incentives, rebates and sales\nreturns are recognized in the period in which the underlying sales are recognized within Net Sales, as a reduction of gross sales.\nFor additional details regarding the financial impact of discounts, incentives, rebates and sales returns, see Note D.23. to our\nconsolidated financial statements included at Item 18. of this annual report.\nRevenues from non-Sanofi products, mainly comprising royalty income from license arrangements and sales of non-Sanofi\nproducts by our US-based entity VaxServe, are presented within Other revenues. This line item also includes revenues arising\nfrom the distribution of ELOCTATE and ALPROLIX under Sanofi’s agreements with Swedish Orphan Biovitrum AB (Sobi) and\nrevenue received under agreements for Sanofi to provide manufacturing services to third parties.\n2/ Business combinations\nAs discussed in Note B.3. “Business combinations and transactions with non-controlling interests” to our consolidated financial\nstatements included at Item 18. of this annual report, business combinations are accounted for by the acquisition method.\nThe acquiree’s identifiable assets and liabilities that satisfy the recognition criteria of IFRS 3 (Business Combinations) are\nmeasured initially at their fair values as at the acquisition date, except for (i) non-current assets classified as held for sale, which\nare measured at fair value less costs to sell and (ii) assets and liabilities that fall within the scope of IAS 12 (Income Taxes)\nand IAS 19 (Employee Benefits). Business combinations completed on or after January 1, 2010 are accounted for in accordance\nwith the revised IFRS 3 and IFRS 10 (Consolidated Financial Statements). In particular, contingent consideration payable to former\nowners agreed in a business combination, e.g. in the form of payments upon the achievement of certain R&D milestones, is\nrecognized as a liability at fair value as of the acquisition date irrespective of the probability of payment. If the contingent\nconsideration was originally recognized as a liability, subsequent adjustments to the liability are recognized in profit or loss\n(see Note D.18. “Liabilities related to business combinations and non-controlling interests” to our consolidated financial\nstatements included at Item 18. of this annual report).\n64 SANOFI FORM 20-F 2023\nPART I\nITEM 5. Operating and financial review and prospects\n3/ Impairment of goodwill and intangible assets\nAs discussed in Note B.6. “Impairment of property, plant and equipment, intangible assets, and investments accounted for using\nthe equity method” and in Note D.5. “Impairment of intangible assets and property, plant and equipment” to our consolidated\nfinancial statements included at Item 18. of this annual report, we test our intangible assets for impairment periodically or when\nthere is any internal or external indication of impairment. Such indicators could include primarily but not exclusively (i) increased\nmarket competition resulting from (for example) the introduction of a competitor’s product; (ii) earlier than expected loss of\nexclusivity; (iii) increased pricing pressure; (iv) restrictions imposed by regulatory authorities on the manufacture or sale of a\nproduct; (v) delay in the projected launch of a product; (vi) different from expected clinical trial results; (vii) higher than expected\ndevelopment costs or (viii) lower than expected economic performance.\nWe test for impairment on the basis of the same objective criteria that were used for the initial valuation. Our initial valuation and\nongoing tests are based on the relationship of the value of our projected future cash flows associated with the asset to either the\npurchase price of the asset (for its initial valuation) or the carrying amount of the asset (for ongoing tests for impairment).\nSignificant underlying assumptions requiring the exercise of considerable judgement are applied in the future cash flow\nprojections used to determine the recoverability of intangible assets, including primarily but not exclusively (i) therapeutic class\nmarket growth drivers; (ii) expected impacts from competing products (including but not exclusively generics and biosimilars);\n(iii) projected pricing and operating margin levels; (iv) likely changes in the regulatory, legal or tax environment; and\n(v) management’s estimates of terminal growth or attrition rates.\nThe recoverable amounts of intangible assets related to research and development projects are determined based on future net\ncash flows, which reflect the development stage of the project and the associated probability of success of marketization of the\ncompound.\nThe projected cash flows are discounted to present value using a discount rate, which factors in the risks inherent in cash flow\nprojections.\nChanges in facts and circumstances, assumptions and/or estimates may lead to future additional impairment losses or reversal of\nimpairment previously recorded.\nKey assumptions relating to goodwill impairment are the perpetual growth rate and the post-tax discount rate. A sensitivity\nanalysis to the key assumptions is disclosed in Note D.5. “Impairment of intangible assets and property, plant and equipment” to\nour consolidated financial statements included at Item 18. of this annual report.\n4/ Pensions and post-retirement benefits\nAs described in Note B.23. “Employee benefit obligations” to our consolidated financial statements included at Item 18. of this\nannual report, we recognize our pension and retirement benefit commitments as liabilities on the basis of an actuarial estimate of\nthe rights vested in employees and retirees at the end of the reporting period, net of the fair value of plan assets held to meet\nthose obligations. We prepare this estimate at least on an annual basis taking into account financial assumptions (such as\ndiscount rates) and demographic assumptions (such as life expectancy, retirement age, employee turnover, and the rate of salary\nincreases).\nWe recognize all actuarial gains and losses (including the impact of a change in discount rate) immediately through equity.\nDepending on the key assumptions used, the pension and post-retirement benefit expense could vary within a range of\noutcomes and have a material effect on reported earnings. A sensitivity analysis to these key assumptions is set forth\nin Note D.19.1. “Provisions for pensions and other benefits” to our consolidated financial statements included at Item 18. of this\nannual report.\n5/ Taxes\nAs discussed in Note B.22. “Income tax expense” to our consolidated financial statements included at Item 18. of this annual\nreport, we recognize deferred income taxes on tax loss carry-forwards and on temporary differences between the tax base and\ncarrying amount of assets and liabilities. We calculate our deferred tax assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates applicable for\nthe years during which we estimate that the temporary differences are expected to reverse. We do not recognize deferred tax\nassets when it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The recognition of deferred tax assets is\ndetermined on the basis of profit forecasts for each tax group, and of the tax consequences of the strategic opportunities\navailable to Sanofi.\nThe positions adopted by Sanofi in tax matters are based on its interpretation of tax laws and regulations. Some of those positions\nmay be subject to uncertainty. In such cases, Sanofi assesses the amount of the tax liability on the basis of the following\nassumptions: that its position will be examined by one or more tax authorities on the basis of all relevant information; that a\ntechnical assessment is carried out with reference to legislation, case law, regulations, and established practice; and that each\nposition is assessed individually (or collectively where appropriate), with no offset or aggregation between positions. Those\nassumptions are assessed on the basis of facts and circumstances existing at the end of the reporting period. When an uncertain\ntax liability is regarded as probable, it is measured on the basis of Sanofi’s best estimate and recognized as a liability; uncertain tax\nassets are not recognized.\nSANOFI FORM 20-F 2023 65\nPART I\nITEM 5. Operating and financial review and prospects\n6/ Provisions for risks\nSanofi and its subsidiaries and affiliates may be involved in litigation, arbitration or other legal proceedings. These proceedings\ntypically are related to product liability claims, intellectual property rights, compliance and trade practices, commercial claims,\nemployment and wrongful discharge claims, tax assessment claims, waste disposal and pollution claims, and claims under\nwarranties or indemnification arrangements relating to business divestitures. As discussed in Note B.12. “Provisions for risks” to\nour consolidated financial statements included at Item 18. of this annual report, we record a provision where we have a present\nobligation, whether legal or constructive, as a result of a past event; it is probable that an outflow of resources embodying\neconomic benefits will be required to settle the obligation; and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the outflow of\nresources. We also disclose a contingent liability in circumstances where we are unable to make a reasonable estimate of the\nexpected financial effect that will result from the ultimate resolution of the proceeding, or a cash outflow is not probable.\nFor additional details regarding the financial impact of provisions for risks see Notes D.19.3. “Other provisions” and D.22. “Legal\nand Arbitral Proceedings” to our consolidated financial statements included at Item 18. of this annual report.\n7/ Provisions for restructuring costs\nProvisions for restructuring costs include collective redundancy or early retirement benefits, compensation for early termination\nof contracts, and rationalization costs relating to restructured sites. Refer to Note D.19.2. to our consolidated financial statements\nincluded at Item 18. of this annual report.\nProvisions are estimated on the basis of events and circumstances related to present obligations at the end of the reporting\nperiod and of past experience, and to the best of management’s knowledge at the date of preparation of the financial\nstatements. The assessment of provisions can involve a series of complex judgments about future events and can rely heavily on\nestimates and assumptions. Given the inherent uncertainties related to these estimates and assumptions, the actual outflows\nresulting from the realization of those risks could differ from our estimates.\nA.2.

Operating and financial review and prospects\n3/ Net sales – Biopharma segment\nSince 2023, our new Biopharma segment comprises our Specialty Care, General Medicines and Vaccines businesses (see “Item\n5.A.1.5, Segment Information” for detailed disclosures about our operating segments and Note D.35. to our consolidated financial\nstatements included at Item 18. of this annual report).\nIn 2023, net sales for the Biopharma segment amounted to €37,890 million, up 0.2% on a reported basis and 5.1% at CER. The\nyear-on-year reported-basis increase of €78 million reflects adverse exchange rate effects amounting to €1,858 million, and the\nfollowing principal effects at CER:\n• a solid performance from DUPIXENT (+€2,822 million) and the launches of NEXVIAZYME (+ €247 million) and ALTUVIIIO\n(+€168 million), which more than offset a drop in sales of AUBAGIO (-€1,069 million);\n• a 16.5% decrease in sales of Non-Core Assets within the General Medicines franchise (-€1,176 million);\n• the launch of BEYFORTUS (+€572 million).\nComments on the performances of our major Biopharma segment products are provided below.\nSpecialty Care\nDUPIXENT (developed in collaboration with Regeneron) generated net sales of €10,715 million in 2023, up 29.2% on a reported\nbasis and 34.0% at CER. In the United States, sales of DUPIXENT reached €8,145 million in 2023, up 32.6% CER, boosted by\ncontinuing strong demand in the product's approved indications: atopic dermatitis, asthma, nasal polyps, eosinophilic\nesophagitis, and prurigo nodularis. In Europe, the product posted 2023 net sales of €1,224 million, up 30.9% CER, driven by\ncontinuing growth in atopic dermatitis, asthma and nasal polyps. In the Rest of the World region, DUPIXENT posted net sales of\n€1,346 million (+46.1% CER), driven mainly by Japan and China.\nNet sales of AUBAGIO fell by 52.6% CER in 2023 to €955 million, mainly due to the arrival of generics. In the United States, where\ngenerics came on the market on March 12, 2023, AUBAGIO fell by -67.8% CER at €460 million. In Europe, generic competition for\nAUBAGIO began at the end of September 2023.\nNet sales of the Pompe disease franchise (MYOZYME/LUMIZYME and NEXVIAZYME/NEXVIADYME) were up 8.8% CER in 2023 at\n€1,208 million. Sales of NEXVIAZYME/NEXVIADYME reached €425 million, including €272 million in the United States, reflecting\nswitches of eligible Pompe patients (advanced stage) from MYOZYME/LUMIZYME and increased uptake by new patients. Sales of\nMYOZYME/LUMIZYME were down year-on-year (-15.1% CER at €783 million) as patients switched to NEXVIAZYME. In 2023, sales\nof NEXVIAZYME/NEXVIADYME represented 35.2% of total sales for the Pompe disease franchise.\nNet sales of the Fabry disease treatment FABRAZYME in 2023 were €991 million (+11.2% CER), driven by the Rest of the World\nregion (+18.8% CER at €247 million) followed by the United States (+9.8% CER at €503 million). The year-on-year increase reflects\nmore patients adopting the product across all three regions.\nNet sales for the Gaucher disease franchise (CEREZYME and CERDELGA) reached €985 million in 2023, up 8.4% CER. CEREZYME\nsales were up 9.1% CER at €687 million on a solid performance in the Rest of the World region (+25.9% CER at €269 million),\ndriven by new patients on therapy and favorable pricing. In parallel, sales of CERDELGA rose by 6.9% CER to €298 million, with\ngrowth reported in the United States (+5.6% CER at €164 million), Europe (+6.3% CER at €118 million), and the Rest of the World\nregion (+23.5% CER at €16 million) as new patients adopted the product or switched treatment.\nELOCTATE generated net sales of €471 million in 2023, down 15.5% CER, due to the adoption of ALTUVIIIO and competitive\npressures.\nALTUVIIIO , a first-in-class, once-weekly factor VIII replacement therapy that confers significant protection against bleeds for\nhemophilia A patients, was launched in the United States at the end of March 2023 and generated sales of €159 million in 2023.\nIn 2023, net sales of ALPROLIX were €540 million, up 11.3% CER, driven by the United States where sales of the product reached\n€440 million, up 11.6% CER.\nNet sales of SARCLISA in 2023 were €381 million, up 37.1% CER, with good performances in all three regions: €165 million (+33.9%\nCER) in the United States, €111 million (+27.3% CER) in Europe, and in Japan (€77 million, up 28.8% CER).\nJEVTANA posted net sales of €320 million in 2023 (-14.8% CER), reflecting the launch of generics in Europe in March 2021 and\ncompetitive pressures in the United States.\nCABLIVI posted net sales of €227 million in 2023, up 10.0% CER, reflecting increased awareness of acquired thrombotic\nthrombo-cytopenic purpura (aTTP), and treatment in line with guidelines from the International Society on Thrombosis and\nHaemostasis (ISTH) recommending first-line use of CABLIVI for all aTTP patients. Sales reached €112 million in the United States\n(+4.5% CER), and in Europe net sales were up 4.3% CER at €98 million, mainly due to greater market penetration as a result of\nincreased product awareness.\nXENPOZYME reported net sales of €91 million, mainly in the United States (€52 million) and Europe (€31 million).\nNet sales of ENJAYMO reached €72 million, with sales being generated primarily in the United States and Japan.\nSANOFI FORM 20-F 2023 69\nPART I\nITEM 5. Operating and financial review and prospects\nGeneral Medicines\nIn 2023, General Medicines GBU net sales reached €12,376 million, down 12.4% on a reported basis and 7.1 % at CER. Industrial\nsales were €582 million, down 6.1% o reported basis and 5.5% at CER.\nCore Assets\nIn 2023, Core Assets sales were €6,270 million, down 1.9% on a reported basis but up 3.3% at CER. The main drivers were a solid\nperformance from REZUROCK and strong contributions from TOUJEO, THYMOGLOBULIN, PRALUENT and PLAVIX, partly offset\nby lower sales of LOVENOX (due to strong competition from biosimilars) and MOZOBIL (due to loss of US exclusivity). Core Assets\naccounted for 50.7% of total General Medicines sales in 2023, compared with 45.2% in 2022.\nBy geography, Core Assets sales reported growth in the Rest of the World region (+9.3% CER) and Europe (+4.2% CER), though\nthe impact was partly offset by the effect of insulin price erosion in the United States, where sales were down 7.7% CER.\nNet sales of REZUROCK reached €310 million, a significant increase of 54.6% CER. Since its launch, approximately 4,000 patients\nhave been treated, with strong persistency rates. Sanofi recently reacquired rights to be the sole marketing authorization holder\nfor REZUROCK in China, where in August 2023 the China National Medical Products Administration (NMPA) approved\nbelumosudil (REZUROCK) for the treatment of patients aged 12 years and older with chronic Graft Versus Host Disease (cGVHD)\nwho have an inadequate response to corticosteroids or other systemic treatments.\nIn the second quarter of 2023, Sanofi acquired Provention, adding TZIELD , an innovative first-in-class treatment for people with\ntype 1 diabetes, to the Core Assets portfolio. In 2023, TZIELD sales were €25 million, in line with the expected gradual ramp-up as\na result of early patient identification programs.\nTOUJEO net sales were €1,123 million in 2023, up 6.2% CER. Growth was driven mainly by the Rest of the World region (+26.9%\nCER), due to the Value Based Procurement program in China and the associated acceleration in sales volumes. The impact was\npartly offset by lower sales in the United States (-23.0% CER) due to price erosion.\nNet sales of SOLIQUA amounted to €217 million (+5.6% CER), driven by growth in the Rest of the World region (+40.3% CER) and\nEurope (+24.3% CER). SOLIQUA was launched in China in May 2023, where it was added to the National Reimbursement Drug List\n(NRDL) in December 2023.\nPRALUENT posted net sales of €422 million, up 15.2% CER. Growth was reported in Europe (+30.6% CER) and the Rest of the\nWorld region (+46.7% CER, due mainly due to China), though the effect was partly offset by lower sales in the United States\nfollowing the release of a glyceryl trinitrate.\nPLAVIX net sales reached €948 million in 2023, up 4.4% CER, in line with consistent volume growth in China.\nNet sales of LOVENOX were €1,125 million in 2023, down 8.7% CER, reflecting strong biosimilar competition across all\ngeographies.\nMOZOBIL sales were €220 million in 2023, down 14.6% CER, due to loss of exclusivity in the United States and China. In Europe,\nthe European Patent Office Technical Board of Appeal invalidated the SPC (Supplementary Protection Certificate) which\nprotected MOZOBIL until August 2024.\nNon-Core Assets\nIn 2023, net sales of Non-Core Assets were €5,524 million, down 22.4% on a reported basis and 16.5% at CER, due mainly to\ndivestments (negative impact 1.3% on total General Medicines net sales) as portfolio streamlining gathered pace. The General\nMedicines GBU has achieved its objective of reducing its Non-Core Assets portfolio from around 300 products to 100, generating\ntotal divestment proceeds of approximately €2 billion between 2020 and the end of 2023 (two years ahead of schedule).\nThe other main factor in the decrease in Non-Core Assets sales was a decline in sales of LANTUS to €1,420 million in 2023 (-32.3%\nCER), mainly in the United States (-62.6% CER, due to lower net selling prices reflecting a higher proportion of sales through\ngovernment channels) and China (due to the Value Based Procurement rollout).\nVaccines\nIn 2023, the Vaccines segment posted net sales of €7,474 million, up 3.4% on a reported basis and 8.3% CER. The main driver was\nthe launch of BEYFORTUS, which more than offset slow sales of influenza vaccines.\nThe BEYFORTUS launch began in late September 2023, in the United States and Europe. Sales of the product reached\n€547 million in 2023, reflecting strong demand through All Infant Protection Programs rolled out in United States, Spain and\nFrance.\nSales of influenza vaccines decreased by 5.5% CER in 2023 to €2,669 million, due to a slight reduction in vaccine uptake and\nincreased competition in the United States.\nPolio/Pertussis/Hib (PPH) vaccines posted net sales of €2,165 million in 2023 (-0.1% CER), reflecting the ongoing expansion of\nVAXELIS in the United States at the expense of pentavalent vaccines in the first series of infant vaccinations. In the US, VAXELIS\nbecame market leader at the end of 2023 in the three-dose primary series market. As a reminder, sales of VAXELIS in the United\nStates are not consolidated, and the profits are shared equally between Sanofi and Merck & Co.\n70 SANOFI FORM 20-F 2023\nPART I\nITEM 5. Operating and financial review and prospects\nNet sales of Meningitis, Travel and Endemics vaccines for 2023 reached €1,170 million, up 0.5% CER, with 41% growth in Europe\nmore than offsetting lower sales in the Rest of the World region (-8.1 %) and the United States (-0.7% CER at €650 million),\nreflecting a favorable pattern in the US while the divestment of the Japanese Encephalitis vaccine in 2022 impacted the Rest of\nthe World region.\nIn 2023, sales of Booster vaccines advanced by 5.1% CER to €598 million, driven by strong growth in Europe.\nNet sales of other vaccines were €325 million (+96.4% CER), and include sales of the monovalent recombinant-protein COVID-19\nbooster vaccine VIDPREVTYN Beta.\n4/ Net sales – Consumer Healthcare segment/GBU\nIn 2023, net sales for the CHC segment fell by 0.1% to €5,180 million on a reported basis but rose by 6.3% at CER, driven by\ndouble-digit growth in the Rest of the World region. Divestments of non-core products had a negative impact of 1.7 percentage\npoint. CHC therefore achieved organic growth of 9.6% in 2023 excluding divestments.\nSanofi announced its intention to separate the CHC Business as it increases its focus on innovative medicines and vaccines. The\nintended separation will seek to create two entities, each better equipped to pursue its own business strategy, resourcing and\ncapital allocation and enabling each to focus on long-term growth in its respective markets. Sanofi believes that the separation\nwill unlock further opportunities for CHC to leverage its portfolio of leading brands and continue to drive growth and shareholder\nvalue. Sanofi is reviewing potential separation scenarios, but believes that the most likely path would be through a capital markets\ntransaction, by creating a listed entity headquartered in France. The timing is driven by the desire to maximize value creation and\nreward Sanofi shareholders. Subject to market conditions, the intended separation could be achieved at the earliest in the fourth\nquarter of 2024, following consultation with social partners.\nIn the United States, CHC net sales amounted to €1,247 million in 2023, down 0.9% CER, mainly on lower sales in the Personal\nCare, Pain Care and Allergy categories.\nIn Europe, CHC net sales were up 3.9% CER in 2023 at €1,557 million, mainly reflecting growth in the Digestive Wellness and\nCough & Cold categories.\nIn the Rest of the World region, CHC net sales were up 11.7% CER at €2,376 million in 2023, driven by growth in Digestive\nWellness, Allergy, and Pain Care.\nOn September 29, 2023, Sanofi completed the acquisition of QRIB Intermediate Holdings, LLC (QRIB), the owner of QUNOL, a\nleading US health and wellness brand. Sales of QUNOL are consolidated within the Physical Wellness category.\n5/ Net sales by geographical region\nThe table below sets forth our net sales for 2023 and 2022 by geographical region:\nChange\nChange on at constant\n(€ million) 2023 2022 a reported basis exchange rates\nUnited States 18,512 18,275 +1.3 % +4.8 %\nEurope 10,392 9,999 +3.9 % +4.3 %\nRest of the World 14,166 14,723 -3.8 % +6.5 %\nof which China 2,912 3,123 -6.8 % +0.4 %\nTotal net sales 43,070 42,997 +0.2 % +5.3 %\nIn 2023, net sales in the United States reached €18,512 million, up 1.3% on a reported basis and 4.8% at CER, reflecting a strong\nperformance from DUPIXENT (+32.6% CER at €8,145 million) and the launches of BEYFORTUS (€407 million) and ALTUVIIOTM,\n(€155 million) partly offsetting by the impact of generics of AUBAGIO and lower sales of LANTUS and influenza vaccines .\nIn Europe, net sales advanced by 3.9% on a reported basis and 4.3% at CER in 2023 to €10,392 million. The performance of\nDUPIXENT (+30.9% CER at €1,224 million) and the launch of BEYFORTUS (€140 million) more than offset lower sales for the Non-\nCore Assets franchise (-14.4% CER).\nIn the Rest of the World region, net sales for 2023 decreased by 3.8% on a reported basis but rose by 6.5% at CER\nto €14,166 million, due to exceptional performances from DUPIXENT (+46.1% CER at €1,346 million) and CHC (+11.7% CER at\n€2,376 million).\nA.2.2. Other income statement items\n1/ Other revenues\nOther revenues increased by 41.1% to €3,374 million in 2023 (versus €2,392 million in 2022). This line item mainly comprises\nVaxServe sales of non-Sanofi vaccines (€2,167 million in 2023 versus €1,567 million in 2022, recorded within the Biopharma\nsegment). The year-on-year increase also reflects higher revenues from manufacturing services contracts and revenues from the\nCOVID-19 vaccine (in particular, €411 million received from the US government in connection with the supply contract for the\nrecombinant COVID-19 vaccine candidate).\nSANOFI FORM 20-F 2023 71\nPART I\nITEM 5. Operating and financial review and prospects\n2/ Gross profit\nGross profit for 2023 amounted to €32,208 million compared with €31,694 million in 2022, an increase of 1.6%. Gross margin (the\nratio of gross profit to net sales) also rose, reaching 74.8% in 2023, versus 73.7% in 2022. The year-on-year increase in gross\nmargin reflects in particular stronger gross margin for the Biopharma segment, which reached 76.4% in 2023 versus 75.0% in\n2022, driven largely by a favorable product mix in Specialty Care and revenues related to the COVID-19 vaccine, which more than\noffset the effects of generic competition for AUBAGIO and unfavorable pricing effects for LANTUS in the United States.\n3/ Research and development expenses\nResearch and development (R&D) expenses amounted to €6,728 million in 2023, versus €6,706 million in 2022, an increase\nof 0.3%, as investment stabilized. R&D expenses represented 15.6% of net sales in 2023, the same as in 2022.\n4/ Selling and general expenses\nSelling and general expenses amounted to €10,692 million in 2023 (24.8% of net sales), versus €10,492 million in 2022 (24.4% of\nnet sales); the 1.9% increase was a result of increased marketing spend in the Biopharma segment and commercial spend in CHC.\n5/ Other operating income and expenses\nOther operating income amounted to €1,292 million in 2023 (versus €1,969 million in 2022), and other operating expenses\nto €3,516 million (versus €2,531 million in 2022).\nOverall, this represented a net expense of €2,224 million in 2023, compared with a net expense of €562 million in 2022.\n(€ million) 2023 2022 Change\nOther operating income 1,292 1,969 (677)\nOther operating expenses (3,516) (2,531) (985)\nOther operating income/(expenses), net (2,224) (562) (1,662)\nThe increase of €1,662 million mainly reflects an increase in the share of profits generated by the monoclonal antibody alliance\nwith Regeneron under the collaboration agreement (see Note C.1. to our consolidated financial statements, included at Item 18 of\nthis annual report), the principal factors being (i) increased sales of DUPIXENT and (ii) the impact in 2022 of the recognition of the\nproceeds arising from the restructuring of the immuno-oncology (IO) collaboration agreement between Sanofi and Regeneron\n(see Note C.1. to our consolidated financial statements, included at Item 18. of this annual report).\nThe net contribution of items related to Regeneron to this line item is as follows:\n(€ million) 2023 2022\nIncome & expense related to (profit)/loss sharing under the Monoclonal Antibody Alliance (3,321) (2,325)\nAdditional share of profit paid by Regeneron towards development costs(a) 668 434\nReimbursement to Regeneron of selling expenses incurred (543) (476)\nTotal: Monoclonal Antibody Alliance (3,196) (2,367)\nImmuno-Oncology Alliance — 16\nOther (mainly ZALTRAP and LIBTAYO)(b) 217 1,120\nOther operating income/(expenses), net related to Regeneron (2,979) (1,231)\n(a) As of December 31, 2023, the commitment received by Sanofi in respect of the additional profit share payable by Regeneron towards development costs\namounted to €2.1 billion, compared with €2.7 billion as of December 31, 2022 (see note D.21.to our consolidated financial statements included at Item 18.\nof this annual report).\n(b) Following the restructuring of the Immuno-Oncology collaboration agreement between Sanofi and Regeneron effective July 1, 2022 (see Note C.1. to our\nconsolidated financial statements, included at Item 18. of this annual report).\n6/ Amortization of intangible assets\nAmortization charged against intangible assets amounted to €2,172 million in 2023, compared with €2,053 million in 2022.\nThis €119 million increase was mainly due to (i) increased amortization expense in 2023 against ELOCTATE franchise assets\nfurther to FDA approval for ALTUVIIIO (€206 million) and (ii) the acquisition of Provention Bio, Inc., which led to €144 million of\namortization being charged from the acquisition date against the intangible asset related to TZIELD product; those effects were\npartly offset by the non-recurrence of the €226 million accelerated amortization charge taken in 2022 against LIBTAYO rights\nfollowing the restructuring of the IO LCA with Regeneron (see Note C.1. to our consolidated financial statements, included at\nItem 18 of this annual report).\n7/ Impairment of intangible assets, net of reversals\nFor 2023, this line shows a net loss of €896 million, mainly comprising an impairment loss of €833 million reflecting the impact of\nthe strategic decision to de-prioritize certain R&D programs, in particular those related to the NK Cell and PRO-XTEN technology\nplatforms.\n72 SANOFI FORM 20-F 2023\nPART I\nITEM 5. Operating and financial review and prospects\nFor 2022, this line item shows a net gain of €454 million, mainly comprising:\n• a reversal of €2,154 million relating to ELOCTATE franchise assets, following FDA approval of ALTUVIIIO (the commercial\nname of efanesoctocog alpha, corresponding to the BIVV001 project); and\n• an impairment loss of €1,586 million relating to the development project for SAR444245 (non-alpha interleukin-2), based on\nrevised cash flow projections reflecting unfavorable developments in the launch schedule.\n8/ Fair value remeasurement of contingent consideration\nFair value remeasurements of contingent consideration assets and liabilities recognized in business combinations represented a\nnet expense of €93 million in 2023, versus a net gain of €27 million in 2022. For 2023, this line item mainly comprises a change in\nthe amount of contingent consideration payable to Shire as a result of a transaction carried out by Translate Bio, Inc. prior to the\nacquisition of that entity by Sanofi (expense of €74 million in 2023, versus €2 million in 2022).\n9/ Restructuring costs and similar items\nRestructuring costs and similar items represented a total charge of €1,490 million in 2023, versus a charge of €1,336 million in\n2022.\nRestructuring costs and similar items increased by €154 million year-on-year. For 2023 they include the impact of French pension\nreforms on future annuities under the rules of each severance plan, while for 2022 they mainly comprised severance costs\nrecognized further to the announcements made during that period. Also included in restructuring costs are the impacts of\nongoing transformational projects, primarily those associated with the creation of the standalone CHC entity and the\nimplementation of Sanofi’s new digital strategy.\n10/ Other gains and losses, and litigation\nFor 2023, this line item showed an expense of €38 million, comprising costs arising on the settlement of litigation with Bioverativ\nformer shareholders.\nFor 2022, this line item showed an expense of €370 million, comprising (i) the pre-tax loss arising on the deconsolidation of\nEUROAPI (see Note D.2. to our consolidated financial statements, included at Item 18 of this annual report) and (ii) costs\nassociated with major litigation.\n11/ Operating income\nOperating income amounted to €7,875 million in 2023, versus €10,656 million in 2022.\nThe year-on-year decrease was largely due to the movements in impairment allowances against intangible assets.\n12/ Financial income and expenses\nNet financial expenses were €722 million in 2023, versus €234 million in 2022, a increase of €488 million.\nThe cost of our net debt (see the definition in “— Liquidity and Capital Resources” below and Note D.29. to our consolidated\nfinancial statements, included at Item 18. of this annual report) was €22 million in 2023, compared with €124 million in 2022; the\nreduction of €102 million was largely due to an increased return on cash, cash equivalents and associated derivatives\n(€533 million in 2023 versus €241 million in 2022, an increase of €292 million).\nIn addition, a financial expense of €541 million was recognized in 2023 in respect of the liability recognized in the balance sheet\nfor estimated future royalties on US sales of BEYFORTUS, which was remeasured as of December 31, 2023 to reflect the very\nsuccessful US launch of the product (see Notes C.2. and D.29. to our consolidated financial statements, included at Item 18. of\nthis annual report).\n13/ Income before tax and investments accounted for using the equity method\nIncome before tax and investments accounted for using the equity method reached €7,153 million in 2023, versus €10,422 million\nin 2022.\n14/ Income tax expense\nIncome tax expense represented €1,602 million in 2023, versus €2,006 million in 2022, giving an effective tax rate based on\nconsolidated net income of 22.4% in 2023, compared with 19.2% in 2022. The reduction in income tax expense was mainly due to\na year-on-year increase in net amortization and impairment losses charged against intangible assets (impact of €563 million in\n2023 and €268 million in 2022). In addition, a deferred tax asset of €133 million was recognized on the remeasurement of the\nfinancial liability recognized in the balance sheet to reflect estimated future royalties on US sales of BEYFORTUS. Those effects\nwere partly offset by the deferred tax expense arising on investments in consolidated subsidiaries, which Sanofi expects will\nreverse as a result of the proposed separation of the CHC business as announced in October 2023 (€365 million impact in 2023).\nIn 2022, income tax expense included taxation of income from the out-licensing of LIBTAYO (€246 million impact in 2022) and\nthe effect of the reversal of impairment losses relating to ALTUVIIIO (€503 million impact in 2022) following FDA approval.\nThe effective tax rate based on business net income is a non-IFRS financial measure (see definition under “— Segment\ninformation — Business Net Income” above). It is calculated on the basis of business operating income, minus net financial\nexpenses and before (i) the share of profit/loss from investments accounted for using the equity method and (ii) net income\nattributable to non-controlling interests. We believe the presentation of this measure, used by our management, is also useful for\ninvestors as it provides a means to analyze the effective tax cost of our current business activities. It should not be seen as a\nsubstitute for the effective tax rate based on consolidated net income.\nSANOFI FORM 20-F 2023 73\nPART I\nITEM 5.

Liquidity and capital resources\nOur operations generate significant positive cash flows. We fund our day-to-day investments (with the exception of significant\nacquisitions) primarily with operating cash flow, and pay regular dividends on our shares.\n“Net debt” is a non-IFRS financial indicator which is reviewed by our management, and which we believe provides useful\ninformation to measure our overall liquidity and capital resources. We define “net debt” as (i) the sum total of long-term debt,\nshort-term debt and current portion of long-term debt, and interest rate and currency derivatives used to manage debt, minus\n(ii) the sum total of cash and cash equivalents and interest rate and currency derivatives used to manage cash and cash\nequivalents. Lease liabilities are not included in net debt.\nAs of December 31, 2023 our net debt was €7,793 million, compared with €6,437 million as of December 31, 2022. For an\nexplanation of the increase in our net debt, refer to section “B.2. Consolidated Balance Sheet and Debt” below.\nIn order to assess our financing risk, we also use the “gearing ratio\", a non-IFRS financial measure (see table in section\n“— B.2. Consolidated Balance Sheet and Debt” below). We define the gearing ratio as the ratio of net debt to total equity. As\nof December 31, 2023, our gearing ratio was 10.5%, compared with 8.6% as of December 31, 2022.\nBecause our net debt and gearing ratio are not standardized measures, they may not be directly comparable with the non-IFRS\nfinancial measures of other companies using the same or similar non-IFRS financial measures. Despite the use of non-IFRS\nmeasures by management in setting goals and measuring performance, these are non-IFRS measures that have no standardized\nmeaning prescribed by IFRS.\n74 SANOFI FORM 20-F 2023\nPART I\nITEM 5. Operating and financial review and prospects\nB.1. Consolidated statement of cash flows\nGenerally, factors that affect our earnings – for example, pricing, volume, costs and exchange rates – flow through to cash from\noperations.

The year-on-year decrease was due mainly to a lower level of operating cash flow before changes in\nworking capital (€9,494 million in 2023, versus €11,233 million in 2022) and a net increase of €764 million in the working capital\nrequirement in 2023 (versus a net decrease of €707 million in 2022).\nNet cash provided by/used in investing activities represented a net cash outflow of €6,200 million in 2023, compared with a\nnet outflow of €2,075 million in 2022. The net outflow in 2023 was mainly a result of the acquisitions of Provention Bio, Inc.\n($2,722 million) and QRIB Intermediate Holdings, LLC ($1,410 million). For 2022, the net cash outflow was mainly due to the\nacquisition of Amunix Pharmaceuticals, Inc (€852 million), partly offset by the proceeds of €150 million from the sale of a 12%\nequity interest in EUROAPI to EPIC Bpifrance.\nAcquisitions of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets amounted to €3,024 million, versus €2,201 million in 2022.\nThere were €1,719 million of acquisitions of property, plant and equipment (versus €1,606 million in 2022), most of which\n(€1,619 million) related to the Biopharma segment, primarily in industrial facilities. Acquisitions of intangible assets (€1,305 million,\nversus €595 million in 2022) mainly comprised contractual payments for intangible rights under license and collaboration\nagreements.\nAfter-tax proceeds from disposals (€1,015 million in 2023, €1,488 million in 2022) exclude proceeds from divestments of\ninvestments in consolidated undertakings and investments accounted for using the equity method, and mainly comprised\ndivestments of assets and activities related to the streamlining of the portfolio, and disposals of equity and debt instruments.\nNet cash provided by/used in financing activities represented a net cash outflow of €8,052 million in 2023, compared with a\nnet cash outflow of €5,821 million in 2022. The 2023 figure includes the redemption of bond issues totaling €3,664 million. Other\nmovements included (i) the dividend payout to our shareholders of €4,454 million (versus €4,168 million in 2022; and (ii) the\neffect of changes in our share capital (repurchases of our own shares, net of capital increases), representing a net cash outflow\nof €398 million in 2023 versus a net cash outflow of €309 million in 2022.\nThe net change in cash and cash equivalents in 2023 was a decrease of €4,026 million, versus an increase of €2,638 million\nin 2022.\n“Free cash flow,” a non-IFRS measure, for the year ended December 31, 2023 was €8,478 million, virtually unchanged from the\n2022 figure of €8,483 million.

It also includes net changes in working capital, capital\nexpenditures and other asset acquisitions(3) net of disposal proceeds(3), and payments related to restructuring and similar items.\n“Free cash flow” is not defined by IFRS, and is not a substitute for Net cash provided by operating activities as reported under\nIFRS. Management recognizes that the term “Free cash flow” may be interpreted differently by other companies and under\ndifferent circumstances.\n(1) Above a cap of €500 million per transaction.\n(2) Non-IFRS financial measure, as defined in “— Segment Information — Business Net income” above.\n(3) Not exceeding a cap of €500 million per transaction.\nSANOFI FORM 20-F 2023 75\nPART I\nITEM 5.

The increase in\n2023 mainly reflects cash outflows of €3,915 million on the acquisitions of the newly-consolidated entities Provention Bio, Inc.\nand QRIB Intermediate Holdings, LLC and of €4,454 million for the dividend payout to our shareholders, less the €8,478 million of\nfree cash flow generated in the year.\n“Net debt” is a non-IFRS financial measure which is reviewed by our management, and which we believe provides useful\ninformation to measure our overall liquidity and capital resources.

The financing\narrangements in place as of December 31, 2023 at the Sanofi parent company level are not subject to covenants regarding\nfinancial ratios and do not contain any clauses linking fees to Sanofi’s credit rating.\nAs of December 31, 2023, we held 13.5 million of our own shares, recorded as a deduction from equity and representing 1.06% of\nour share capital.\n76 SANOFI FORM 20-F 2023\nPART I\nITEM 5. Operating and financial review and prospects\nGoodwill and Other intangible assets (€73,723 million in total) rose by €2,191 million. The year-on-year increase takes account\nof (i) the purchase price allocations relating to the acquisitions during the year of Provention Bio, Inc. and QRIB Intermediate\nHoldings, LLC on April 27, 2023 and September 29, 2023, respectively (see Note D.1. to our consolidated financial statements,\nincluded at Item 18. of this annual report on Form 20-F) and (ii) the recognition of an asset corresponding to the additional US\nrights to BEYFORTUS (nirsevimab) acquired under the terms of the agreement reached between Sanofi and AstraZeneca in April\n2023 (see Note C.2. to our consolidated financial statements, included at Item 18. of this annual report on Form 20-F). Those\nupward movements were partly offset by amortization and impairment charged during the period, and by movements in\ncurrency translation differences.\nInvestments accounted for using the equity method (€424 million) decreased by €253 million, mainly reflecting an impairment\nloss taken against the equity-accounted investment in EUROAPI to reflect the drop in the quoted market price of EUROAPI\nshares since March 2023.\nOther non-current assets amounted to €3,218 million, a year-on-year increase of €123 million.\nNet deferred tax assets amounted to €4,570 million as of December 31, 2023, versus €3,540 million as of December 31, 2022, a\nyear-on-year increase of €1,030 million. This mainly reflects deferred taxes arising on the spread tax deduction of R&D expenses,\npartly offset by deferred taxes arising from temporary differences related to investments in consolidated entities dedicated to\nour CHC business.\nNon-current provisions and other non-current liabilities (€7,602 million) showed an increase of €1,261 million, mainly due to\nthe recognition of the financial liability in respect of royalties payable to Sobi on net sales of BEYFORTUS (nirsevimab) in the\nUnited-States (see Note C.2. to our consolidated financial statements).\nLiabilities related to business combinations and to non-controlling interests were €70 million lower year-on-year, at\n€709 million.\nB.3. Liquidity\nWe expect that our existing cash resources and cash from operations will be sufficient to finance our foreseeable working capital\nrequirements, in both the short term (i.e. the 12 months following the year ended December 31, 2023) and the long term\n(i.e. beyond such additional 12-month period). At year-end 2023, we held cash and cash equivalents amounting to €8,710 million,\nsubstantially all of which were held in euros (see Note D.13. to our consolidated financial statements, included at Item 18. of this\nannual report). As at December 31, 2023, €476 million of our cash and cash equivalents were held by captive insurance and\nreinsurance companies in accordance with insurance regulations.\nWe run the risk of delayed payments or even non-payment by our customers, who consist principally of wholesalers, distributors,\npharmacies, hospitals, clinics and government agencies (see “Item 3. Key information — D. Risk Factors — 2. Risks Relating to Our\nBusiness — We are subject to the risk of non-payment by our customers”). Deteriorating credit and economic conditions and\nother factors in some countries have resulted in, and may continue to result in an increase in the average length of time taken to\ncollect our accounts receivable in these countries. Should these factors continue, it may require us to re-evaluate the\ncollectability of these receivables in future periods. We carefully monitor sovereign debt issues and economic conditions and\nevaluate accounts receivable in these countries for potential collection risks. We have been conducting an active recovery policy,\nadapted to each country and including intense communication with customers, negotiations of payment plans, charging of\ninterest for late payments, and legal action. Over our business as a whole, the amount of trade receivables overdue by more than\n12 months (which primarily consists of amounts due from public sector bodies) increased from €51 million as of December 31,\n2022 to €81 million as of December 31, 2023 (see Note D.10. to our consolidated financial statements included at Item 18. of this\nannual report).\nAt year-end 2023, we had no commitments for capital expenditures that we consider to be material to our consolidated financial\nposition. Undrawn confirmed credit facilities amounted to a total of €8,000 million at December 31, 2023. For a discussion of our\ntreasury policies, see “Item 11. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk.”\nWe expect that cash from our operations will be sufficient to repay our debt. For a discussion of our liquidity risks,\nsee “Item 11. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk.”\nB.4. Off balance sheet arrangements/Contractual obligations and other commercial commitments\nWe have various contractual obligations and other commercial commitments arising from our operations. Our contractual\nobligations and our other commercial commitments as of December 31, 2023 are shown in Notes D.3., D.17., D.18., and D.21. to our\nconsolidated financial statements, included at Item 18. of this annual report.

The table above does not include ongoing annual\nemployer’s contributions to plan assets, estimated at €86 million for 2023.\nWe may have payments due to our current or former research and development partners under collaboration agreements. These\nagreements typically cover multiple products, and give us the option to participate in development on a product-by-product\nbasis. When we exercise our option with respect to a product, we pay our collaboration partner a fee and receive intellectual\nproperty rights to the product in exchange. We are also generally required to fund some or all of the development costs for the\nproducts that we select, and to make payments to our partners when those products reach development milestones.\nWe have entered into collaboration agreements under which we have rights to acquire products or technology from third parties\nthrough the acquisition of shares, loans, license agreements, joint development, co-marketing and other contractual\narrangements. In addition to upfront payments on signature of the agreement, our contracts frequently require us to make\npayments contingent upon the completion of development milestones by our alliance partner or upon the granting of approvals\nor licenses.\nBecause of the uncertain nature of development work, it is impossible to predict (i) whether Sanofi will exercise further options for\nproducts, or (ii) whether the expected milestones will be achieved, or (iii) the number of compounds that will reach the relevant\nmilestones. It is therefore impossible to estimate the maximum aggregate amount that Sanofi will actually pay in the future under\nexisting collaboration agreements.\nGiven the nature of its business, it is highly unlikely that Sanofi will exercise all options for all products or that all milestones will be\nachieved.\nThe main collaboration agreements relating to development projects are described in Note D.21.1. to our consolidated financial\nstatements, included at Item 18. of this annual report. Milestone payments relating to development projects under these\nagreements included in the table above exclude projects still in the research phase (€16.8 billion in 2023, and €18.0 billion in\n2022) and payments contingent upon the attainment of sales targets once a product is on the market (€17.9 billion in 2023,\nand €18.5 billion in 2022).\nC. Research and development, patents and licenses, etc.\nOur research and development teams utilize our deep expertise to contribute to the growth of our business. As of December 31,\n2023, we had 11,660 employees engaged in research and development activities. In the years ended December 31, 2021, 2022\nand 2023 we spent €5,692, €2022 and €6,728 respectively, on research and development.

Directors, senior management and employees\nItem 6. Directors, Senior Management and Employees\nA. Directors and Senior Management\nSince January 1, 2007, Sanofi has separated the offices of Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. Annual evaluations conducted\nsince that date have indicated that this governance structure is appropriate to Sanofi’s current configuration. When the term of\noffice of Serge Weinberg as Chairman ended, our Board of Directors decided to continue separating the offices of Chairman and\nChief Executive Officer. The Board believes this governance structure is still appropriate to the current context in which Sanofi\noperates and its share ownership structure, as well as protecting the rights of all of its stakeholders.\nThe Chairman organizes and directs the work of the Board, and is responsible for ensuring the proper functioning of the\ncorporate decision-making bodies in compliance with good governance principles. The Chairman coordinates the work of the\nBoard of Directors with that of its Committees. He ensures that the Company’s management bodies function properly, and in\nparticular that the directors are able to fulfil their duties. The Chairman is accountable to the Shareholders’ General Meeting,\nwhich he chairs.\nIn addition to these roles conferred by law, the Chairman:\n• in coordination with the Chief Executive Officer, liaises between the Board of Directors and the shareholders of the Company;\n• is kept regularly informed by the Chief Executive Officer of significant events and situations affecting the affairs of the\nCompany, and may request from the Chief Executive Officer any information useful to the Board of Directors;\n• may, in close collaboration with the Chief Executive Officer, represent the Company in high-level dealings with governmental\nbodies and with key partners of the Company and/or of its subsidiaries, both nationally and internationally;\n• seeks to prevent any conflict of interest and manages any situation that might give rise to a conflict of interest. He also gives\nrulings, in the name of the Board, on requests to take up external directorships of which he may become aware or that may be\nsubmitted to him by a director;\n• may interview the statutory auditors in preparation for the work of the Board of Directors and the Audit Committee; and\n• strives to promote in all circumstances the values and image of the Company.\nThe Chairman is also required to develop and maintain a proper relationship of trust between the Board and the Chief Executive\nOfficer, so as to ensure that the latter consistently and continuously implements the orientations determined by the Board.\nIn fulfilling his remit, the Chairman may meet with any individual, including senior executives of the Company, while avoiding any\ninvolvement in directing the Company or managing its operations, which are exclusively the responsibility of the Chief Executive\nOfficer.\nFinally, the Chairman reports to the Board on the fulfilment of his remit.\nThe Chairman carries out his duties during the entire period of his term of office, subject to the caveat that a director who is a\nnatural person may not be appointed or reappointed once that director has reached the age of 70.\nThe Chief Executive Officer manages the Company, and represents it in dealings with third parties within the limit of the\ncorporate purpose. The Chief Executive Officer has the broadest powers to act in all circumstances in the name of the Company,\nsubject to the powers that are attributed by law to the Board of Directors and to the Shareholders’ General Meeting and within\nthe limits set by the Board of Directors.\nThe Chief Executive Officer must be less than 65 years old.\nSANOFI FORM 20-F 2023 79\nPART I\nITEM 6. Directors, senior management and employees\nLimitations on the powers of the Chief Executive Officer set by the Board\nThe limitations on the powers of the Chief Executive Officer are specified in the Board Charter. Without prejudice to legal\nprovisions regarding authorizations that must be granted by the Board (regulated agreements, guarantees, divestments of equity\nholdings or real estate, etc.), prior approval from the Board of Directors is required for transactions or decisions resulting in an\ninvestment or divestment, or an expenditure or guarantee commitment, made by the Company and its subsidiaries, in excess of:\n• a cap of €500 million (per transaction) for transactions, decisions or commitments pertaining to a previously approved\nstrategy; and\n• a cap of €150 million (per transaction) for transactions, decisions or commitments not pertaining to a previously approved\nstrategy.\nWhen such transactions, decisions or commitments give rise to installment payments to the contracting third party (or parties)\nthat are contingent upon future results or objectives, such as the registration of one or more products, attainment of the caps is\ncalculated by aggregating the various payments due from the signing of the contract until (and including) the filing of the first\napplication for marketing authorization in the United States or in Europe.\nAttainment of the above caps is also assessed after taking into account all commitments to make payments upon exercising a\nfirm or conditional option with immediate or deferred effect, and all guarantees or collateral to be provided to third parties over\nthe duration of such commitments.\nThe prior approval procedure does not apply to transactions and decisions that result in the signature of agreements that solely\ninvolve subsidiaries and the Company itself.\nRemit of the Board of Directors\nThe Board of Directors establishes the orientation of the Company’s activities and ensures that they are implemented, paying\ndue consideration to social and environmental issues. Subject to those powers expressly attributed to Shareholders’ General\nMeetings and within the limits set by the corporate purpose, the Board addresses any issue of relevance to the proper conduct of\nthe Company’s affairs and, through its deliberations, settles matters concerning the Company.\nFrench law, Articles of Association and Board Charter\nThe rules and operating procedures of our Board of Directors are defined by French law, by our Articles of Association, and by our\nBoard Charter (English language versions of which are reproduced in full as Exhibit 1.1 and Exhibit 1.2 to this annual report).\nOur Board Charter describes the rights and obligations of Board members; the composition, role and operating procedures of the\nBoard of Directors and Board Committees; and the roles and powers of the Chairman and the Chief Executive Officer. It is\nprepared in accordance with the French Commercial Code and our Articles of Association.\n80 SANOFI FORM 20-F 2023\nPART I\nITEM 6.

Directors, senior management and employees\nTerm of Office\nThe term of office of directors is four years. Directors are required to seek reappointment by rotation, such that members of the\nBoard are required to seek reappointment on a regular basis in the most equal proportions possible. Exceptionally, the\nShareholders’ Ordinary General Meeting may appoint a director to serve for a term of one, two or three years, in order to ensure\nan adequate rotation of Board members. Each director standing down is eligible for reappointment. Should one or more\ndirectorships fall vacant as a result of death or resignation, the Board of Directors may make provisional appointments in the\nperiod between two Shareholders’ General Meetings, in accordance with applicable laws.\nDirectors may be removed from office at any time by a Shareholders’ General Meeting.\nA natural person cannot be appointed or reappointed as a director once he or she reaches the age of 70. As soon as the number\nof directors over the age of 70 represents more than one-third of the directors in office, the oldest director shall be deemed to\nhave resigned; his or her term of office shall end at the date of the next Shareholders’ Ordinary General Meeting.\nChanges in the composition of the Board of Directors during 2022 and 2023\nThe table below shows changes in the composition of the Board of Directors during 2022 and 2023:\nAnnual General Meeting Annual General Meeting\nof May 3, 2022 of May 25, 2023\nEnd of term of office Melanie Lee(a) Serge Weinberg(b)\nCarole Piwnica(a)\nRenewal of term of office Paul Hudson None\nChristophe Babule\nPatrick Kron\nGilles Schnepp\nProposed new appointments Carole Ferrand Frédéric Oudéa(b)\nEmile Voest\nAntoine Yver\nCo-opted None None\nOther None None\n(a) Melanie Lee and Carole Piwnica left the Board of Directors before the General Meeting of May 3, 2022.\n(b) The term of office of Serge Weinberg expired at the Annual General Meeting held to approve the financial statements for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2022, and could not be renewed (see below). Acting on a recommendation from the Appointments, Governance and CSR Committee, the\nBoard of Directors appointed Frédéric Oudéa as a non-voting member of the Board on September 2, 2022. The Board meeting of February 22, 2023\ndecided to ask the Annual General Meeting of May 25, 2023 to approve the appointment of Frédéric Oudéa as an independent director, to replace\nSerge Weinberg.\nThe term of office of Serge Weinberg expired at the Annual General Meeting of May 25, 2023, which approved the appointment\nof Frédéric Oudéa as his successor. The Board then appointed Frédéric Oudéa as Chairman.\nThat appointment brought to the Board Frédéric Oudéa’s:\n• experience from senior executive roles in international groups;\n• experience from Board membership in international groups; and\n• competencies in finance and accounting.\nFollowing his appointment, the proportion of independent directors increased from 71% to 79%.\nFor further information about the career of Frédéric Oudéa, refer to his biographical details later in this section.\nChanges in Board membership to be submitted for shareholder approval at the Annual General\nMeeting on April 30, 2024\nExpiry of term of office Diane Souza(a)\nThomas Südhof\nReappointments Rachel Duan\nLise Kingo\nProposed appointments Clotilde Delbos\nAnne-Françoise Nesmes\nJohn Sundy\nCo-opted None\nOther None\n(a) Diane Souza's term of office cannot be renewed because she will be over the age limit set in our Articles of Association.\n82 SANOFI FORM 20-F 2023\nPART I\nITEM 6. Directors, senior management and employees\nThe terms of office of Rachel Duan, Lise Kingo, Diane Souza and Thomas Sudhöf will expire at the Annual General Meeting to be\nheld on April 30, 2024.\nThe Annual General Meeting will be asked to:\n• renew the terms of office of:\n– Rachel Duan – refer to “— Detailed Information about Members of the Board of Directors” for her biographical details, and\nto “— Competencies of Board Members” below for details of what she brings to the Board,\n– Lise Kingo – refer to “— Detailed Information about Members of the Board of Directors” for her biographical details, and to\n“— Competencies of Board Members” below for details of what she brings to the Board;\n• appoint three independent directors, who would bring the following competencies to the Board:\n– Clotilde Delbos: Senior executive role in international groups, Board membership in international groups, International\nexperience, Mergers & acquisitions, Finance & accounting;\n– Anne-Françoise Nesmes: Healthcare/pharmaceutical industry experience, Senior executive role in international groups,\nBoard membership in international groups, International experience, Mergers & acquisitions, Finance & accounting; and\n– John Sundy: Scientific training, Board membership in international groups.\nIn order to optimize preparations for the expiry in 2025 of the term of office of Fabienne Lecorvaisier, Chair of the Audit\nCommittee, our Board of Directors would temporarily have 17 members with effect from the Annual General Meeting of\nApril 30, 2024.\nRules relating to the composition of the Board and its Committees\nEach year, the Board of Directors conducts a review to ensure that there is an appropriate balance in its composition and in the\ncomposition of its Committees. In particular, the Board seeks gender balance and a broad diversity of competencies,\nexperiences, nationalities and ages, reflecting our status as a diversified global business. The Board investigates and evaluates not\nonly potential candidates, but also whether existing directors should seek reappointment. Above all, the Board seeks directors\nwho show independence of mind and are competent, dedicated and committed, with compatible and complementary\npersonalities.\nActing on proposals from the Chief Executive Officer and in liaison with the Appointments, Governance and CSR Committee, the\nBoard sets objectives for gender balance on Sanofi’s executive bodies, and more generally ensures that an inclusion (non-\ndiscrimination) and diversity policy is applied within the Company. That policy is fully embedded in our Play to Win strategy. As of\nDecember 31, 2023, 25% of the 12 Executive Committee members were women, and 67% were non-French nationals.\nThe Board of Directors is also kept informed, in particular on the occasion of its annual discussion on its equal opportunity and\nequal pay policy, on how Sanofi’s inclusion and diversity policy is cascaded down to “Senior Leaders” and “Executives” (the\npositions in Sanofi with the highest level of responsibility).\nSANOFI FORM 20-F 2023 83\nPART I\nITEM 6. Directors, senior management and employees\nCompetencies of Board members\nThe Board of Directors, in liaison with the Appointments, Governance and CSR Committee, must ensure that the composition of\nthe Board is balanced, diverse and fit for purpose.\nIn assessing its composition, the Board takes account of the new challenges facing Sanofi and our corporate strategy, and\ndetermines whether the qualities and skills of serving directors are sufficient for the Board to deliver on its remit.\nIn recent years, the Board has adapted its composition in line with its roadmap by bringing additional scientific expertise onto the\nBoard and maintaining the level of other key competencies, especially in finance and accounting.\nThe Board has completed an overview of the Board’s current competencies.

CSR is a broad field that\nencompasses a wide variety of knowledge, competencies and experience, some of which is highly technical; thus it was not\npracticable to attribute overall competence in CSR to one or more of our directors. All members of our Board are in practice\nengaged with CSR issues, and have complementary skills and experience in the field, for example (non-exhaustive list):\n• Christophe Babule, as CFO of L’Oréal, is in charge of financing the L’Oréal group’s sustainable transition. He is also a director\nof the L’Oréal for Women endowment fund;\n• Lise Kingo holds a Master's degree in Responsibility & Business Practice from the University of Bath in the United Kingdom.\nShe was Professor of Sustainability and Innovation at the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam (The Netherlands) from 2006 to 2015,\nand in parallel held various CSR-related positions including Director of Environmental Affairs at Novozymes and Executive\nVice President, Corporate Relations at Novo Nordisk, before becoming CEO & Executive Director of the United Nations Global\nCompact from 2015 to 2020 – a key role at the Paris COP21 climate change conference in 2015;\n• Barbara Lavernos was appointed Vice-Chair of the L'Oréal Climate Emergency Fund, to support vulnerable communities to\ndevelop greater resilience in the face of climate disasters created in September 2023;\n• Fabienne Lecorvaisier has experience as Executive Vice President of Air Liquide with responsibility for sustainable\ndevelopment, public and international affairs, along with experience acquired through her involvement in societal programs\nsuch as the Air Liquide Foundation and Inclusive Business; and\n• Gilles Schnepp led Legrand’s CSR policy as Chairman and CEO from 2006 to 2018, and since March 2021 has been Chairman\nof the Board of Directors of Danone, a société à mission (social purpose company). He also chaired the Ecological and\nEconomic Transition Commission of MEDEF (the French employer’s federation) from 2018 to 2021.\n84 SANOFI FORM 20-F 2023\nPART I\nITEM 6. Directors, senior management and employees\nSince 2018, when the remit of our Appointments and Governance Committee was extended to include CSR, our in-house CSR\nteam has been updating Committee members on specific CSR issues on an as-needed basis. In addition, a progress report on our\nCSR strategy (established in 2021) is included as a Board agenda item on an annual basis. The report is presented by our Head of\nCSR, who is available to answer questions – including on technical issues – and inform the Board about each of the key CSR\nissues specific to Sanofi.\nThe number of meetings of the Appointments, Governance and CSR Committee has increased from 2023 onwards (five meetings\nin the year, versus three in 2022), so that the Committee can look in greater depth at each pillar of our CSR strategy; a CSR\nupdate is included on the agenda for every meeting. There are also regular updates on extra-financial ratings and regulatory\nchanges.\nDirector Training\nNo training was provided to Board members during 2023.\nThe Board meeting of October 26, 2023 considered the training needs of directors and agreed on a training plan for 2024 that\nwill include modules on CSR, cybersecurity, and AI.\nIndependence of Board Members\nUnder the terms of the AFEP-MEDEF Code, a director is independent when he or she has no relationship of any kind whatsoever\nwith the Company, its group or its senior management that may color his or her judgment. More specifically, a director can only\nbe regarded as independent if he or she:\n• is not (and has not been during the past five years):\n– an employee or executive officer of the Company,\n– an employee, executive officer or director of an entity consolidated by the Company, or\n– an employee, executive officer or director of the Company’s parent, or of an entity consolidated by that parent\n(criterion 1);\n• is not an executive officer of an entity in which (i) the Company directly or indirectly holds a directorship or (ii) an employee of\nthe Company is designated as a director or (iii) an executive officer of the Company (currently, or who has held office within\nthe past five years) holds a directorship (criterion 2);\n• is not a customer, supplier, investment banker or corporate banker that is material to the Company or its group, or for whom\nthe Company or its group represents a significant proportion of its business (criterion 3);\n• has no close family ties with a corporate officer of the Company (criterion 4);\n• has not acted as an auditor for the Company over the course of the past five years (criterion 5);\n• has not been a director of the Company for more than 12 years (criterion 6);\n• does not receive variable compensation in cash or in the form of shares or any compensation linked to the performance of the\nCompany or its group (criterion 7); or\n• does not represent a shareholder that has a significant or controlling interest in the Company (criterion 8).\nThe influence of other factors such as the ability to understand challenges and risks, and the courage to express ideas and form a\njudgment, is also evaluated before it is decided whether a director can be regarded as independent.\nIn accordance with our Board Charter and pursuant to the AFEP-MEDEF Code, the Board of Directors’ meeting of\nFebruary 22, 2024 discussed the independence of the current directors. Of the 16 directors in office on that date, 11 were deemed\nto be independent directors by reference to the independence criteria used by the Board of Directors pursuant to the AFEP-\nMEDEF Code: Frédéric Oudéa, Rachel Duan, Carole Ferrand, Lise Kingo, Patrick Kron, Fabienne Lecorvaisier, Gilles Schnepp,\nDiane Souza, Thomas Südhof, Emile Voest and Antoine Yver.\nIn accordance with the rules described above, Paul Hudson (who is an executive director of Sanofi), and Barbara Lavernos and\nChristophe Babule (who were appointed on the recommendation of L’Oréal, a major shareholder of Sanofi), are not deemed\nindependent.\nConsequently, the proportion of independent directors is 79%. This complies with the AFEP-MEDEF recommendation of at\nleast 50% in companies with dispersed ownership and no controlling shareholder (which is the case for Sanofi). In accordance\nwith the recommendations of the AFEP-MEDEF Code, directors representing employees and elected by trade unions are\nexcluded when calculating the proportion of independent directors.\nSANOFI FORM 20-F 2023 85\ncirédérF aéduO\nnosduH\nluaP\nehpotsirhC\nelubaB\nnauD\nlehcaR eloraC dnarreF\nogniK\nesiL\nnorK\nkcirtaP arabraB sonrevaL enneibaF\nreisiavroceL\nselliG ppenhcS\nazuoS\nenaiD samohT fohdüS\ntseoV\nelimE\nrevY\neniotnA\nPART I\nITEM 6.

However, Christophe Babule is independent for the purposes of the\nNASDAQ Listing Rules and Rule 10A-3 under the Exchange Act.\nFailure to fulfil one of the criteria does not automatically disqualify a director from being independent.\nIn assessing the criterion related to significant business relationships (criterion 3), the Board of Directors took into account the\nvarious relationships between directors and Sanofi and concluded that no relationships were of a kind that might undermine their\nindependence. The Board of Directors noted that the Company and its subsidiaries had, in the normal course of business, over\nthe past three years, sold products and provided services to, and/or purchased products and received services from, companies\nin which certain of the Company’s directors who are classified as independent (or their close family members) were senior\nexecutives or employees during 2023. In each case, the amounts paid to or received from such companies over the past three\nyears were determined on an arm’s length basis and not at amounts that the Board regarded as undermining the independence\nof the directors in question.\n86 SANOFI FORM 20-F 2023\nPART I\nITEM 6. Directors, senior management and employees\nSelection Process for Board members\nThe Appointments, Governance and CSR Committee has a remit to organize a procedure for selecting future independent\ndirectors. Once the desired profile and skillset for a new director has been defined, a search for potential candidates is conducted\nby external consultants.\nOnce a shortlist has been established, the Committee interviews two or three candidates. The candidates also meet with the\nChairs of the other Board committees, and in some cases the other Committee members as well. In all cases, they meet with the\nChairman of the Board of Directors and the Chief Executive Officer. After completing the interviews, the Committee makes a\nrecommendation to the Board on the candidate with the best fit for the profile, supporting that recommendation with an\nexplanation of how the interviews were conducted and giving reasons why a candidate was selected. Before recommending a\ncandidate to the Board, the Committee obtains assurance as to their availability, in particular as regards any other executive\nposts or offices the candidate may hold.\nOverview of selection process for Board members\nDefinition of profile and\nskillset\nPre-selection Selection Appointment\nAppointments,\nAppointments, Governance & CSR Some or all Committee Appointments, Governance &\nIndependent Governance & CSR Committee pre-selects members interviews two CSR Committee recommends a\nthree potential candidate, and explains the\ndirectors Committee defines the candidates from a long- or three short-listed reasons for its\nprofile and skillset list suggested by external candidates recommendation\nconsultants\n• One Director representing\nemployees is designated by\nthe trade union body which\nis the most representative,\nin the Company and those\nDirectors of its direct or indirect\nrepresenting subsidiaries that have their\nemployees registered office in French\nterritory,\n• One Director representing\nemployees is designated\nby the European Works\nCouncil\nSuccession planning\nGeneral principles\nThe remit of the Appointments, Governance and CSR Committee includes preparing for the future of the Company’s executive\nbodies, in particular through the establishment of a succession plan for executive officers.\nThe succession plan, which is reviewed at meetings of the Appointments, Governance and CSR Committee, addresses various\nscenarios:\n• unplanned vacancy due to prohibition, resignation or death;\n• forced vacancy due to poor performance, mismanagement or misconduct; and\n• planned vacancy due to retirement or expiration of term of office.\nThrough its work and discussions, the Committee seeks to devise a succession plan that is adaptable to situations arising in the\nshort, medium or long term, but which also builds in diversity – in all its facets – as a key factor.\nTo fulfill its remit, the Appointments, Governance and CSR Committee:\n• provides the Board with progress reports, in particular at executive sessions;\n• co-ordinates with the Compensation Committee. In that regard, having a director that sits on both Committees is a great\nadvantage;\n• works closely with the Chief Executive Officer to (i) ensure the succession plan is consistent with the Company’s own\npractices and market practices, (ii) ensure high-potential internal prospects receive appropriate support and training, and\n(iii) check there is adequate monitoring of key posts likely to fall vacant;\n• meets with key executives as needed; and\n• involves the Chairman and the Chief Executive Officer insofar as each has a key role in planning for his own successor, though\nwithout them directing the process.\nSANOFI FORM 20-F 2023 87\nPART I\nITEM 6. Directors, senior management and employees\nIn fulfilling their remit, Committee members are acutely conscious of confidentiality issues.\nAlthough aware that separating the offices of Chairman and Chief Executive Officer provides continuity of power, the Committee\nnonetheless assesses the situation of the Chairman as well as that of the executive team.\nSuccession planning for the Chief Executive Officer is also reviewed regularly by the Appointments, Governance and CSR\nCommittee.\nEvaluation of the Board and its Committees\nUnder the terms of the Board Charter, and in accordance with the AFEP-MEDEF code, a discussion of the operating procedures\nof the Board and its committees must be included on the agenda of one Board meeting every year. The Charter also requires a\nformal evaluation to be performed at least every three years under the direction of the Appointments, Governance and CSR\nCommittee, with assistance from an independent consultant.\nIn practice, even in years when the three-yearly formal evaluation procedure (assisted by an independent consultant) is not\nconducted, an annual internal evaluation is conducted using a detailed questionnaire sent to directors by the Secretary to the\nBoard, and covering the composition and the operation of the Board and its committees. Each director is allowed a few weeks to\ncomplete the questionnaire using a secure digital platform. At the end of that period, the responses (which are confidential) are\nanalyzed by the Secretary to the Board. The results are then presented and discussed at a meeting of the Appointments,\nGovernance and CSR Committee; the detailed report prepared for that meeting is then submitted to a Board meeting at the start\nof the following year.\nIn addition, as reported in our annual report for 2022, from 2023 onwards the evaluation procedure also includes one-on-one\ninterviews with each director (including the Chief Executive Officer), intended to measure the contribution of each director to the\nwork of the Board and its committees and to record any suggestions they may have. The interviews are conducted by the\nChairman of the Board, and a summary of the key points is provided to each director.\nThe most recent “formal” evaluation conducted with the assistance of an independent consultant took place in 2021 under the\ndirection of the Appointments, Governance and CSR Committee.\nIn 2023, the evaluation was conducted internally via questionnaire (as described above).\nThe results of the 2023 evaluation were presented and discussed at a meeting of the Appointments, Governance and CSR\nCommittee. The detailed report prepared for that meeting was then submitted to the Board meeting of February 22, 2024.\nDetailed information about Board members\nThe following pages provide key information about each director individually:\n• directorships and appointments held during 2023 (directorships in listed companies are indicated by an asterisk, and each\ndirector’s principal position is indicated in bold);\n• other directorships held during the last five years;\n• training and professional experience; and\n• competencies.\n88 SANOFI FORM 20-F 2023\nPART I\nITEM 6.

Compensation\nCompensation and other arrangements for corporate officers\nProcess for determining the compensation policy for corporate officers\nThe compensation policy for corporate officers is established by the Board of Directors, acting on the recommendation of the\nCompensation Committee. The Board of Directors applies the AFEP-MEDEF Code when determining the compensation and\nbenefits awarded to our executive and non-executive corporate officers.\nAll members of the Compensation Committee are independent, and were chosen for their technical competencies and their\ngood understanding of current standards, emerging trends and Sanofi’s practices.\nTo fulfill their remit, the Committee regularly invites Sanofi’s Chief People Officer and Head of Reward and Performance to attend\ntheir meetings, although the latter absent themselves when the Committee deliberates. Committee members also work with the\nChairman and the Secretary of the Board, who have contacts with our principal institutional shareholders ahead of the Annual\nGeneral Meeting.\nIn addition, the Chairman of the Committee:\n• discusses the financial, accounting and tax impacts of the proposed compensation policy with the Chairman of the Audit\nCommittee;\n• plays an active role at meetings of the Appointments, Governance and CSR Committee and the Strategy Committee (to both\nof which he belongs), thereby gaining assurance that the proposed performance criteria are consistent and appropriate in\nlight of Sanofi’s strategic ambitions.\nThe compensation policy is not subject to annual review, although some arrangements for implementing the policy – such as the\nperformance criteria applicable to the Chief Executive Officer’s annual variable compensation, for example – are defined by the\nBoard of Directors on an annual basis.\n110 SANOFI FORM 20-F 2023\nPART I\nITEM 6. Directors, senior management and employees\nAfter consulting the Compensation Committee and as the case may be the other Board Committees, the Board of Directors may,\nunder the second paragraph of item III of Article L. 22-10-8 of the French Commercial Code, temporarily derogate from the\napproved compensation policy for the Chief Executive Officer in exceptional circumstances and to the extent that the changes\nare aligned with the corporate interest and necessary to safeguard the continuity or viability of Sanofi. Derogations from the\napproved policy are possible in respect of the performance conditions applied to the Chief Executive Officer’s compensation,\nand may result in either an increase or a decrease in compensation. The circumstances in which it is possible to apply such a\nderogation are a change in the structure of the Sanofi group or major events affecting the markets. Such derogation may only be\ntemporary and must be properly substantiated, and will remain subject to a binding vote at the next General Meeting of Sanofi\nshareholders.\nCompensation policy for corporate officers\nThis section describes the compensation policy for corporate officers of Sanofi, as established pursuant to Article L. 22-10-8 of\nthe French Commercial Code. That policy describes all the components of compensation awarded to corporate officers of Sanofi\nas consideration for holding office, and explains the process by which it is determined, divided, reviewed and implemented.\nOur compensation policy for corporate officers has three distinct elements: (i) the compensation policy for directors; (ii) the\ncompensation policy for the Chairman of the Board; and (iii) the compensation policy for the Chief Executive Officer.\nEach of those policies is submitted for approval by our shareholders at the Annual General Meeting, in accordance with\nArticle L. 22-10-8 II of the French Commercial Code. The compensation policy approved in any given year applies to any person\nholding corporate office in that year. When a corporate officer is appointed between two Annual General Meetings, their\ncompensation is defined by applying the terms of the compensation policy approved by the most recent Annual General Meeting\nof shareholders.\nGeneral principles and objectives\nOur compensation policy is based on the following general principles:\n• the policy must be simple;\n• the policy must prioritize long-term performance;\n• the level of compensation must be competitive, so that we can attract and retain talent; and\n• there must be a fair balance between the corporate interest, the challenges of delivering on our strategy, and the\nexpectations of our stakeholders.\nThe Compensation Committee must ensure that trends in the compensation of corporate officers over the medium term are not\nuncorrelated with trends in the compensation of all our employees. In terms of annual variable compensation and equity-based\ncompensation, the Compensation Committee aims to achieve convergence between the performance criteria applied to our\nSenior Leaders and those applied to the Chief Executive Officer.\nOur equity-based compensation policy, which aims to align employee and shareholder interests and reinforce loyalty to Sanofi, is\na critical tool for our worldwide attractiveness as an employer.\nGrantees of equity-based compensation plans (including our Chief Executive Officer) can only be awarded performance shares.\nAwarding performance shares reduces the dilutive effect of equity-based compensation plans while maintaining the same level\nof motivation for grantees.\nActing on the recommendation of the Compensation Committee, the Board of Directors determines the performance conditions\nattached to equity-based compensation for all beneficiaries at Sanofi and its subsidiaries worldwide, thereby furthering the\nattainment of our objectives.\nThe Board of Directors makes any grant of performance shares contingent on multiple, exacting multi-year performance criteria\nin order to ensure that our equity-based compensation plans incentivize overall performance. Failure to achieve those criteria\nover the entire performance measurement period results in a reduction or loss of the initial grant.\nIn order to align equity-based compensation with our long-term performance, performance is measured over three financial\nyears (the “vesting period”). Awards of performance shares are also contingent on continued employment in the Sanofi group\nduring the vesting period, followed by stringent lock-up obligations in the case of the Chief Executive Officer (see below).\nThe terms of prior awards cannot be reset subsequently, for instance with less exacting performance conditions.\nCompensation policy for directors\nDirectors hold office for a four-year term, as specified in our Articles of Association. They may be removed from office by a\nshareholders’ meeting, at any time and without restriction.\nThe maximum annual amount of overall compensation allocated to the directors is capped at €2,500,000 (the cap was raised to\nthat level in 2023 to reflect the increasing number of Board and committee meetings in recent years and the growing proportion\nof Board members resident outside Europe). The arrangements for allocating the overall annual amount set by the Annual\nGeneral Meeting between the directors are determined by the Board of Directors, acting on a recommendation from the\nCompensation Committee. Directors’ compensation comprises an annual fixed amount of €30,000, apportioned on a time basis\nfor directors who assumed or left office during the year, and a variable amount, allocated by the Board according to actual\nattendance at Board and Committee meetings. As required by the AFEP-MEDEF Code, directors’ compensation is allocated\npredominantly on a variable basis.\nSANOFI FORM 20-F 2023 111\nPART I\nITEM 6. Directors, senior management and employees\nThe table below shows how the variable amount payable to directors for attendance at Board and committee meetings is\ndetermined.\nThe Board meeting of February 22, 2024, acting on a recommendation from the Compensation Committee, amended the\nallocation rules for that variable amount as follows, with effect from 2024 onwards:\n• the amounts payable to (i) members of the Audit Committee resident outside France, (ii) members of the Appointments,\nGovernance and CSR Committee resident outside Europe and (iii) the Chairman/Chairwoman of the Audit Committee, the\nAppointments, Governance and CSR Committee and the Compensation Committee were increased; and\n• when a director residing outside France attends a Board meeting and one or more Committee meetings and/or strategic\nseminars during the same trip, he will receive a lower amount than the scale for attendance at certain Committee meetings\nand/or strategic seminars, except for Committee Chairmen/Chairwomen, whose usual compensation is unchanged.\nCompensation per meeting\nDirectors resident\nDirectors outside France but Directors resident\nresident in France within Europe outside Europe Chairman/Chairwoman\nBoard of Directors €5,500 €8,250 €11,000 N/A\nAudit Committee €8,250 €11,000 €13,750 €13,750\nCompensation Committee €5,500 €8,250 €11,000 €11,000\nAppointments, Governance and CSR Committee €5,500 €8,250 €11,000 €11,000\nStrategy Committee €5,500 €8,250 €11,000 N/A\nScientific Committee €5,500 €8,250 €11,000 €11,000\nThe introduction of a separate compensation scale depending on whether or not the director is a European resident is intended\nto take into account the significantly longer travel time required to attend Board meetings in person.\nDirectors who take part via videoconference receive compensation equivalent to that paid to a director resident in France\nattending in person. Committee Chairs continue to receive the usual compensation in respect of the Committee they chair.\nAs an exception, in certain cases two meetings held on the same day give entitlement only to a single payment:\n• if on the day of a Shareholders’ General Meeting, the Board of Directors meets both before and after the Meeting, only one\npayment is made for the two Board meetings; and\n• if on the same day a director participates in a meeting of the Compensation Committee and a meeting of the Appointments,\nGovernance and CSR Committee, only the higher of the two payments is made to cover both meetings.\nDirectors do not receive any exceptional compensation or equity-based compensation and have no entitlement to a top-up\npension plan.\nNeither the Chairman of the Board nor the Chief Executive Officer receives any compensation for serving as a director.\nCompensation policy for the Chairman of the Board of Directors\nThe term of office of the Chairman of the Board is the same as that of the other directors (four years), and the Chairman’s term is\naligned with his term of office as a director. He may be removed from office at any time by the Board of Directors.\nThe compensation policy for the Chairman of the Board of Directors is discussed by the Compensation Committee, which then\nmakes a recommendation to the Board of Directors. The Chairman of the Board is not a member of the Committee, and does not\nattend meetings where his compensation is discussed.\nThe compensation of the Chairman of the Board of Directors (where the office of Chairman is separate from that of Chief\nExecutive Officer, as is currently the case) consists solely of fixed compensation and benefits in kind and excludes any variable or\nexceptional compensation, any awards of stock options or performance shares, and any compensation for serving as a director.\nThe annual fixed compensation awarded to the Chairman of the Board of Directors is €880,000 gross; that amount was set at\nthe Board meeting of February 22, 2023, and became applicable with effect from May 25, 2023, date on which the current\nChairman took office.\nThis amount takes account of the specific remit of the Chairman of the Board of Directors as described in the Sanofi Board\nCharter, and of his membership of three Board Committees (the Strategy Committee, which he chairs, the Appointments,\nGovernance and CSR Committee; and the Scientific Committee).\nThe compensation of the Chairman of the Board of Directors is not subject to annual review.\nWhere the office of Chairman is separate from that of Chief Executive Officer, the Chairman of the Board is not entitled to the\nSanofi top-up defined-contribution pension plan.\nNor is he entitled to a termination benefit or a non-compete indemnity.\n112 SANOFI FORM 20-F 2023\nPART I\nITEM 6. Directors, senior management and employees\nCompensation policy for the Chief Executive Officer\nGeneral principles\nOur Chief Executive Officer is not appointed for a fixed term of office. He may be removed from office on legitimate grounds at\nany time by the Board of Directors.\nThe compensation policy for the Chief Executive Officer is established by the Board of Directors, acting on the recommendation\nof the Compensation Committee. The compensation structure is not subject to annual review and is applicable for as long as it\nremains unchanged. The arrangements for implementing the policy may vary from year to year; a table showing the changes\nmade to those arrangements in 2024 and 2023 is provided at the end of the present section.\nThe compensation of the Chief Executive Officer is determined with reference to compensation awarded to the chief executive\nofficers of the following 12 leading global pharmaceutical companies(1): Amgen, AstraZeneca plc, Bayer AG, Bristol-Myers\nSquibb Inc., Eli Lilly and Company Inc., GlaxoSmithKline plc, Johnson & Johnson Inc., Merck Inc., Novartis AG, Novo Nordisk,\nPfizer Inc., and Roche Holding Ltd. This panel comprises companies that are comparable to Sanofi, with no limitation as to\ngeographical region given that Sanofi operates in a particularly competitive international environment. Consistency with market\npractice is fundamental in order to attract and retain the talents necessary to our success. In 2023, on the basis of information\npublished as of the date of this annual report, the median fixed compensation of the chief executive officers of the\naforementioned 12 leading global pharmaceutical companies was in the region of €1,619,000; the median of the annual variable\ncompensation awarded was in the region of €2,523,000; and the median of the long-term compensation awarded (whether\nequity-based or in cash) represented around 861% of fixed compensation. Within this peer group, Paul Hudson’s overall\ncompensation (fixed, variable and equity-based compensation) lies in the low range of the second quartile of the compensation\npaid by the panel companies. The practices of the main CAC 40 companies are also taken into account.\nOn taking up office\nWhen the Chief Executive Officer is an outside appointment, the Board of Directors may decide, acting on a recommendation\nfrom the Compensation Committee, to compensate the appointee for some or all of the benefits he may have forfeited on\nleaving his previous employer. In such a case, the terms on which the Chief Executive Officer is hired aim to replicate the diversity\nof what was forfeited, with a comparable level of risk (variable portion, medium-term equity-based or cash compensation).\nDuring the term of office\nCompensation structure\nOur policy aims at achieving and maintaining a balance in the compensation structure between fixed compensation, benefits in\nkind, short-term variable cash compensation, and medium-term variable equity-based compensation.\nThe compensation policy for the Chief Executive Officer is designed to motivate and reward performance by ensuring that a\nsignificant portion of compensation is contingent on the attainment of financial, operational and extra-financial criteria that\nreflect Sanofi’s objectives, and are aligned with the corporate interest and with the creation of shareholder value. Variable cash\ncompensation and equity-based compensation are the two principal levers for action, and are intended to align the interests of\nthe Chief Executive Officer with those of our shareholders and stakeholders.\nDuring the meeting that follows the Board meeting held to close off the financial statements for the previous year, the\nCompensation Committee examines the levels of attainment of variable compensation for that year. In advance of that meeting,\nthe Chief Executive Officer presents the Committee with a report containing narrative and quantitative information necessary to\nmeasure attainment of the objectives. The members of the Compensation Committee then discuss the information provided and\nreport to the Board on those discussions, giving an evaluation of the Chief Executive Officer’s performance against each of the\ncriteria (determining the level of attainment for quantitative objectives, and evaluating the level of attainment for qualitative\nobjectives compared to the objectives set at the beginning of the year).\nAnnual fixed compensation\nThe annual fixed compensation of the Chief Executive Officer has been set at €1,400,000 gross since 2022. It had previously\nremained unchanged since 2019.\nThe amount of fixed compensation is not subject to annual review. It may however be changed, provided that such changes are\nnot material:\n• on the appointment of a new Chief Executive Officer, to reflect the new appointee’s competencies and/or then current\nmarket practice; and\n• in exceptional circumstances, to take account of changes in (i) the role or responsibilities of the Chief Executive Officer, for\nexample in terms of market conditions or the size of the Sanofi group or (ii) the performance level of Sanofi over a given\nperiod.\n(1) Survey conducted on the basis of data supplied by Pay Governance and Baracay.\nSANOFI FORM 20-F 2023 113\nPART I\nITEM 6. Directors, senior management and employees\nAnnual variable compensation\nAnnual variable compensation is in a range between 0% and 250% of fixed compensation, with a target of 150%. It is subject to\na range of varied and exacting performance criteria, both quantitative and qualitative. The criteria are reviewed annually in light\nof the strategic objectives determined by Sanofi. The Board of Directors sets the criteria for each year at the start of that year\non the recommendation of the Compensation Committee.\nFor 2024, the criteria are:\n• 60% based on financial indicators published by Sanofi: sales growth, free cash flow (FCF) and business earnings per share\n(business EPS), each accounting for 20%; and\n• 40% based on specific individual objectives: transformation (15%), R&D pipeline (15%), and corporate social responsibility\n(10%). The individual objectives set for variable remuneration for 2024 are described in “— Compensation and benefits of all\nkinds awardable to corporate officers in respect of 2024” below.\nThe Board of Directors has decided, acting on a proposal from the Compensation Committee, to streamline the annual variable\ncompensation structure by refocusing it on three key financial indicators. The “business net income”, \"business operating income\nmargin\" and \"new asset growth\" criteria have been replaced by the business EPS) criterion, chosen so as to align more closely\nwith key industry-standard indicators in the pharmaceutical sector and with guidance communicated to the markets. The Board\nalso decided to increase the weighting of financial criteria from 50% to 60%. This change takes into account actual market\npractices, and comments from investors who wished to see the weighting of financial objectives increased. Although for each of\nthese financial objectives, the Board of Directors – acting on a proposal from the Compensation Committee – has set specific\nobjectives, they cannot be disclosed for confidentiality reasons.\nThe percentage of variable compensation linked to the attainment of quantitative criteria may be scaled down regardless of\nactual performance, in order to give greater weight to the attainment of qualitative criteria. This flexibility can only operate to\nreduce the amount of variable compensation, and cannot compensate for underperformance on quantitative criteria.\nPayment of annual variable compensation in a given year in respect of the previous year is contingent on a favorable shareholder\nvote at the Annual General Meeting.\nEquity-based compensation\nThe Chief Executive Officer’s equity-based compensation, which can only be in the form of performance shares, may not\nexceed 250% of his target short-term compensation (fixed plus variable).\nThe Chief Executive Officer’s equity-based compensation is contingent upon attainment of exacting performance conditions, all\nof them quantitative, measured over a three-year-period. Such awards are contingent upon both:\n• internal criteria based upon:\n– business earnings per share (business EPS), free cash flow (FCF), and development of the R&D pipeline;\n– Affordable Access and Planet Care – extra-financial criteria; and\n• an external criterion based upon the change in total shareholder return (TSR) relative to a benchmark panel of 12 leading\nglobal pharmaceutical companies: Amgen, AstraZeneca plc, Bayer AG, Bristol-Myers Squibb Inc., Eli Lilly and Company Inc.,\nGlaxoSmithKline plc, Johnson & Johnson Inc., Merck Inc., Novartis AG, Novo Nordisk, Pfizer Inc., and Roche Holding Ltd.\nThe Board of Directors, acting on a proposal from the Compensation Committee, has decided (i) to replace the \"business net\nincome\" criterion by \"business earnings per share (business EPS)\", which is a central element of Sanofi's financial communication\nreflecting a significant part of the Company's performance, and (ii) to add an R&D-linked criterion, to demonstrate Sanofi’s\ncommitment to building a robust pipeline of products in line with the Company's strategy.\nActing on a proposal from the Compensation Committee, the Board of Directors sought to maintain common criteria for annual\nvariable compensation and equity-based compensation, in order to ensure that short-term performance does not come at the\nexpense of long-term performance.\nMeasurable, material extra-financial criteria aligned with Sanofi’s CSR strategy were introduced into equity-based compensation\nplans in 2023 following discussions with investors, who were supportive of the criteria selected.\nThe valuation of performance shares is calculated at the date of grant, weighted between (i) fair value determined using the\nMonte Carlo model and (ii) the market price of Sanofi shares at the date of grant, adjusted for dividends expected during the\nvesting period.\nEach award to our Chief Executive Officer takes into account previous awards and his overall compensation. In any event, the\nmaximum number of shares to be delivered may not be more than the number of performance shares initially awarded.\nFor details of the proposed award to the Chief Executive Officer in respect of 2024, refer to “— Compensation and benefits of all\nkinds awardable to corporate officers in respect of 2024” below.\nShare ownership and lock-up obligation of the Chief Executive Officer\nThe Chief Executive Officer is bound by the same obligations regarding share ownership specified in our Articles of Association\nand Board Charter as our other corporate officers.\nIn addition, until he ceases to hold office the Chief Executive Officer is required to retain a quantity of Sanofi shares equivalent\nto 50% of any gain (net of taxes and social contributions) arising on the vesting of performance shares, calculated as of the date\non which those shares vest. Those shares must be retained in registered form until he ceases to hold office.\nIn compliance with the AFEP-MEDEF Code and our Board Charter, the Chief Executive Officer must undertake to refrain from\nentering into speculative or hedging transactions.\n114 SANOFI FORM 20-F 2023\nPART I\nITEM 6. Directors, senior management and employees\nMulti-year variable compensation\nThe Chief Executive Officer does not receive multi-year variable compensation.\nCompensation for serving as a director\nExecutive officers of Sanofi do not receive any compensation for serving as directors. Consequently, the Chief Executive Officer\ndoes not receive compensation in his capacity as a director or as a member of the Strategy Committee.\nExceptional compensation\nNo exceptional compensation can be awarded to the Chief Executive Officer.\nOn leaving office\nThe Chief Executive Officer is entitled to a top-up defined-contribution pension plan, a termination benefit, and a non-compete\nindemnity.\nSuch arrangements are part of the overall compensation package generally awarded to executive officers; in line with the\nrecommendations of the AFEP-MEDEF code, there are very strict rules about how they are implemented. The termination benefit\nand non-compete indemnity are intended to compensate for the fact that the Chief Executive Officer may be dismissed at any\ntime.\nEach of those benefits is taken into account by the Board of Directors when fixing the overall compensation of the Chief\nExecutive Officer.\nPension arrangements\nThe Chief Executive Officer is entitled to benefits under the top-up defined-contribution pension plan introduced within Sanofi\non January 1, 2020. This is a collective plan falling within the scope of Article 82 of the French General Tax Code. It is also offered\nto members of our Executive Committee and to all senior executives whose position is classified within the Sanofi grade scale\nas “Executive Level 1 or 2”. The Chief Executive Officer’s entitlement under this plan may be withdrawn by a decision of the Board\nof Directors, but not retroactively.\nUnder the terms of the plan, the Chief Executive Officer receives an annual contribution the amount of which (subject to\nattainment of a performance condition) may be up to 25% of his reference compensation (annual fixed and variable cash-based\ncompensation only; all other compensation is excluded). The rights accruing under the plan are those that are generated by the\ncapitalization contract taken out with the insurer, and vest even if the Chief Executive Officer does not remain with Sanofi until\nretirement. The Chief Executive Officer may elect for the rights to be transferable as a survivor’s pension.\nThe performance condition is as follows:\n• if the level of attainment for variable compensation is equal to or greater than the target (i.e. 150% of fixed compensation),\n100% of the contribution is paid;\n• if the level of attainment for variable compensation is less than 100% of fixed compensation, no contribution is paid; and\n• between those two limits, the contribution is calculated on a pro rata basis.\nBecause this performance condition is linked to the attainment of the performance criteria for annual variable compensation\n(which itself is determined with reference to the strategic objectives of Sanofi), it ensures that no pension contributions could be\nmade in the event that the Chief Executive Officer fails to deliver.\nThe plan is wholly funded by Sanofi, which pays the full amount of the gross contributions. Because it is treated as equivalent to\ncompensation, the contribution is subject to payroll taxes and employer’s social security charges, and to income tax in the hands\nof the Chief Executive Officer; all of the above are charged on the basis of the bands, rates and other conditions applicable to\ncompensation, and paid and declared on his pay slips for the contribution period.\nSubject to (i) formal confirmation by the Board of Directors that the performance condition for the previous year has been met\nand (ii) approval of the Chief Executive Officer’s compensation package for that year by the Annual General Meeting of our\nshareholders, the annual gross contribution is paid as follows:\n• 50% as a gross insurance premium to the fund manager; and\n• 50% to the Chief Executive Officer, to indemnify him for the social security and tax charges for which he will become\nimmediately liable.\nIn accordance with Article 39,5 bis of the French General Tax Code, deferred compensation as defined in section 4 of\nArticle L. 22-10-9,4 of the French Commercial Code can be offset against corporate profits as a taxable expense up to a limit set\nat three times the annual social security ceiling per beneficiary.\nThe pension entitlement is not cumulative with (i) any termination benefit paid in the event of forced departure or (ii) any non-\ncompete indemnity.\nSANOFI FORM 20-F 2023 115\nPART I\nITEM 6. Directors, senior management and employees\nTermination arrangements\nThe termination benefit only becomes payable if the departure of the Chief Executive Officer is forced, i.e. in the event of\nremoval from office or resignation linked to a change in strategy or control of the Company. Compensation for non-renewal of\nthe term of office is irrelevant in the case of the Chief Executive Officer, because this office is held for an indefinite term.\nIn addition, no termination benefit is payable and the arrangement is deemed to have been rescinded in the following\ncircumstances:\n• removal from office for gross or serious misconduct (faute grave ou lourde);\n• if the Chief Executive Officer elects to leave Sanofi to take up another position;\n• if the Chief Executive Officer is assigned to another position within Sanofi; or\n• if the Chief Executive Officer takes his pension.\nPayment of the termination benefit is contingent upon fulfillment of a performance condition, which is deemed to have been met\nif the attainment rate for the individual variable compensation objectives exceeded 90% of the target; that condition is assessed\nover the three financial years preceding the Chief Executive Officer leaving office.\nThe amount of the termination benefit is capped at 24 months of the Chief Executive Officer’s most recent total compensation\non the basis of (i) the fixed compensation effective on the date of leaving office and (ii) the last variable compensation received\nprior to that date subject to fulfilment of the performance condition.\nThe amount of the termination benefit is reduced by any amount received as consideration for the non-compete undertaking,\nsuch that the aggregate amount of those two benefits may never exceed two years of total fixed and variable compensation.\nNon-compete undertaking\nIn the event of his departure from Sanofi, the Chief Executive Officer undertakes, during the 12-month period following his\ndeparture, not to join a competitor of Sanofi as an employee or corporate officer, or to provide services to or cooperate with such\na competitor.\nIn return for this undertaking, he receives an indemnity corresponding to one year’s total compensation, based on his fixed\ncompensation effective on the day he leaves office and on the last individual variable compensation he received prior to that\ndate. This indemnity is payable in 12 monthly instalments.\nHowever, the Board of Directors reserves the right to release the Chief Executive Officer from that undertaking for some or all of\nthat 12-month period. In such cases, the non-compete indemnity would not be due for the period of time waived by the\nCompany.\nConsequences of the Chief Executive Officer’s departure for equity-based compensation\nIf the Chief Executive Officer leaves Sanofi for reasons other than resignation or removal from office for gross or serious\nmisconduct (in which case any award of equity-based compensation is forfeited in full), the overall allocation percentage is\nprorated to reflect the amount of time the Chief Executive Officer remained with Sanofi during the vesting period.\nIf at any time prior to the expiration of the vesting period of his performance shares the Chief Executive Officer joins a competitor\nof Sanofi as an employee or corporate officer, or provides services to or cooperates with such a competitor, he irrevocably loses\nthose performance shares regardless of any full or partial discharge by the Board of Directors of the non-compete undertaking\nrelating to his office as Chief Executive Officer.\nSince 2021, if the Chief Executive Officer retires at the statutory retirement age prior to the expiration of the vesting period of his\nperformance shares, the overall allocation rate will be apportioned on a pro rata basis to reflect the amount of time for which the\nChief Executive Officer remained in the employment of Sanofi during the vesting period.\n116 SANOFI FORM 20-F 2023\nPART I\nITEM 6.

Directors, senior management and employees\nEquity-based compensation\nUsing the authorizations granted by our shareholders via the twenty-fourth resolution at the Annual General Meeting\nof April 30, 2021, and acting on the recommendations of the Compensation Committee, the Board of Directors meeting\nof May 25, 2023 decided to award Paul Hudson 82,500 performance shares in respect of 2023. The valuation of that award as\nof May 25, 2023, determined in accordance with IFRS and incorporating a market-related condition, was €6,779,025, equivalent\nto 4.84 times his fixed compensation.\nThe entire amount of the award is contingent upon the achievement of performance objectives based on (i) internal criteria\nbased upon BNI, FCF and CSR, and (ii) an external criterion based on improvement in TSR relative to that of a benchmark panel of\n12 leading global pharmaceutical companies (plus Sanofi): Amgen, AstraZeneca plc, Bayer AG, Bristol-Myers Squibb Inc., Eli Lilly\nand Company Inc., GlaxoSmithKline plc, Johnson & Johnson Inc., Merck Inc., Novartis AG, Novo Nordisk, Pfizer Inc., and Roche\nHolding Ltd.\nTo align equity-based compensation on our medium-term performance, a three-year period (2023-2025) is used to measure\nperformance.\nThe above criteria were selected because they align medium-term equity-based compensation on the strategy adopted by\nSanofi.\nThe arrangements relating to these awards are as follows:\n• the performance criterion based on BNI accounts for 45% of the award. That criterion corresponds to the ratio, at constant\nexchange rates, of actual BNI to budgeted BNI. It represents the average actual-to-budget ratio attained over the entire\nperiod. Budgeted BNI is derived from the budget as approved by the Board of Directors at the beginning of each financial\nyear. The BNI objective may not be lower than the bottom end of the full-year guidance range publicly announced by Sanofi\nat the beginning of each year. If the attainment level is less than 95%, the corresponding performance shares are forfeited.\nBNI actual-to-budget attainment level (B) BNI allocation rate\nIf B < 95% 0%\nIf B = 95% 50%\nIf B is > 95% but < 98% (50 + [(B - 95) x 16])%\nIf B is ≥ 98% but ≤ 105% B%\nIf B is > 105% but < 110% (105 + [(B - 105) x 3])%\nIf B is ≥ 110% 120%\n• the FCF criterion accounts for 25% of the award. This criterion was selected because it is aligned with Sanofi’s current\nstrategic objectives, and is transparent both within and outside the company.\nThe FCF criterion represents the average actual-to-budget FCF ratio attained over the entire period. The award is based on a\ntarget FCF, below which some or all of the performance shares are forfeited.\nFCF actual-to-budget attainment level (F) FCF allocation rate\nIf F is ≤ 70% 0%\nIf F is > 70% but < 80% [(F - 70) x 5]%\nIf F = 80% 50%\nIf F is > 80% but < 100% (50 + [(F – 80) x 2.5])%\nIf F = 100% 100%\nIf F is > 100% but < 120% F%\nIf F is ≥ 120% 120%\n• the criterion based on TSR Rank Improvement accounts for 20% of the award. It corresponds to the change in rank of Sanofi’s\nTSR when compared to the TSR of peer companies included in a panel. The TSR corresponds to the trading price of Sanofi\nshares increased by the dividends per share during the measurement periods, without reinvestment. Sanofi TSR Rank\nImprovement is determined by comparing the Endpoint Sanofi TSR rank to the Baseline Sanofi TSR rank.\n– The Baseline Sanofi TSR is equal to the following formula: (average prices of 2022 – average prices of 2021 + dividends per\nshare 2022)/average prices of 2021.\n– The Endpoint Sanofi TSR is equal to the following formula: (average prices of 2025 – average prices of 2022 + dividends\nper share 2023 to 2024)/average prices of 2022.\n128 SANOFI FORM 20-F 2023\nPART I\nITEM 6. Directors, senior management and employees\nOur TSR is compared with the benchmark panel of 12 companies listed above, so as to determine the ranking of Sanofi within\nthe panel.

This performance condition has been added to our equity-based\ncompensation plans with effect from 2023, and equates to the attainment over a three-year period of annual objectives plus\na \"stretch\" objective, linked to the following pillars of Sanofi’s CSR strategy:\n1. Affordable Access: providing essential medicines to non-communicable disease patients through Sanofi Global Health,\n2. Planet Care: Carbon Footprint Reduction, scopes 1 & 2 (% reduction in CO emissions vs 2019).\n2\nAttainment of each annual CSR objective will earn one performance point; a maximum of three points, plus one extra point\nlinked to the \"stretch\" objective, can be earned for each CSR pillar.

The Board of Directors, at its meeting of February 22, 2024, ascertained whether that performance\ncondition had been met, noting that the attainment level for the variable portion of Paul Hudson’s compensation for the 2023\nfinancial year was 2,379,300%, i.e. 169.9% of his fixed compensation.\nThe annual gross contribution is paid as follows:\n• 50% as a gross insurance premium to the fund manager – the amount due to the fund manager with respect to 2023 is\n€472,412.50; and\n• 50% to Paul Hudson, to indemnify him for the social security and tax charges for which he will become immediately liable. The\namount due to Paul Hudson with respect to 2023 was set by the Board of Directors at its meeting of February 22, 2024\nat €472,412.50.\nPayment of those amounts is contingent on approval of the Chief Executive Officer’s compensation package by the shareholders\nin an Ordinary General Meeting, on the terms stipulated in Article L. 22-10-34 II of the French Commercial Code.\nSocial welfare and health insurance\nPaul Hudson is subject to, benefits from and contributes to the same health cover, and death and disability plans as are applicable\nto other employees of Sanofi based in France. He also benefits from an unemployment insurance scheme.\nBenefits in kind\nThe benefits in kind received by Paul Hudson in 2023 were valued at €13,497, and correspond to a company car with a driver.\n130 SANOFI FORM 20-F 2023\nPART I\nITEM 6. Directors, senior management and employees\nCompensation and benefits for other Executive Committee members\nCompensation\nThe compensation of Executive Committee members other than the Chief Executive Officer is reviewed by the Compensation\nCommittee, taking into consideration the practices of leading global pharmaceutical companies.\nIn addition to fixed compensation, they receive variable compensation. Their target variable compensation depends on their\nposition, and can represent up to 100% of their fixed compensation. The target amount of individual variable compensation is\ndetermined in line with market practice. It rewards the joint contribution of all Executive Committee members to Sanofi’s\nperformance.\nFor 2023, the variable component consisted of two elements:\n• attainment of quantitative objectives (accounting for 50%) which are measured at consolidated level: sales growth 30%, ratio\nof BOI to net sales (“BOI margin”) 35%, research and development outcomes 20%, and FCF 15%; and\n• attainment of quantitative and qualitative objectives both individually (30%) and collectively (20%) within the Executive\nCommittee (together accounting for 50%).\nThe indicators used are intended to measure Sanofi’s annual performance objectives; individual objectives; and the attainment of\npeople objectives, individual career development plans, transformation of the corporate culture to align with the “Play to Win”\nstrategy, and reducing Sanofi's carbon footprint.\nIn addition, Executive Committee members may be awarded performance shares.\nFor 2023, the total gross compensation paid and accrued in respect of members of the Executive Committee (excluding the\nChief Executive Officer) was €21 million, including €8 million in fixed compensation.\nA total of 190,648 performance shares were awarded in 2023 to members of the Executive Committee (excluding the award to\nthe Chief Executive Officer). No stock options were awarded to members of the Executive Committee or the Chief Executive\nOfficer in 2023.\nIn compliance with the AFEP-MEDEF Code, these entire awards are contingent upon three internal criteria, based on business net\nincome (BNI)(1), free cash flow (FCF)(2), and Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) indicators; and on an external criterion, based on\nTSR. Those criteria were selected because they align equity-based compensation with the strategy adopted by Sanofi. The Board\nbelieves that the performance conditions applied are good indicators of shareholder value creation in terms of the quality of\ninvestment decisions and the commitment to deliver exacting financial results in a difficult economic environment.\nThe arrangements relating to these awards are as follows:\n• the BNI performance criterion accounts for 45% of the award. This criterion corresponds to the ratio, at constant exchange\nrates, of actual BNI to budgeted BNI. It represents the average actual-to-budget ratio attained over the entire period.\nBudgeted BNI is derived from the budget as approved by the Board of Directors at the beginning of each financial year. The\nBNI objective may not be lower than the bottom end of the full-year guidance range publicly announced by Sanofi at the\nbeginning of each year. If the ratio is less than 95%, the corresponding performance shares are forfeited.\nBNI actual-to-budget attainment level (B) BNI allocation rate\nIf B is < 95% 0 %\nIf B = 95% 50%\nIf B is > 95% but < 98% (50 + [(B –95) x 16])%\nIf B is ≥ 98% but ≤ 105% B%\nIf B is > 105% but < 110% (105 + [(B –105) x 3])%\nIf B is ≥ 110% 120%\n• the FCF criterion accounts for 25% of the award. It represents the average actual-to-budget ratio of FCF attained over the\nentire period. The award is based on a target FCF, below which some or all performance shares are forfeited.\nFCF actual-to-budget attainment level (F) FCF allocation rate\nIf F is ≤ 70% 0 %\nIf F is > 70% but < 80% [(F – 70) x 5]%\nIf F = 80% 50%\nIf F is > 80% but < 100% (50 + [(F – 80) x 2.5])%\nIf F = 100% 100%\nIf F is > 100% but < 120% F%\nIf F is > 120% 120%\n(1) Non-IFRS financial measure.

Directors, senior management and employees\n• the criterion based on Total Shareholder Return (“TSR”) Rank Improvement accounts for 20% of the award.\nThe TSR Rank Improvement corresponds to the change in Sanofi’s TSR rank relative to the TSR of a panel of Sanofi\nplus 12 peer companies (Amgen, AstraZeneca plc, Bayer AG, Bristol-Myers Squibb Inc., Eli Lilly and Company Inc.,\nGlaxoSmithKline plc, Johnson & Johnson Inc., Merck Inc., Novartis AG, Novo Nordisk, Pfizer Inc., and Roche Holding Ltd).\nTSR corresponds to the market performance of Sanofi shares uplifted by dividends per share during the measurement\nperiods, without reinvestment.\nFor the plan applicable to Executive Committee members, the TSR Rank Improvement is determined by comparing the\nEndpoint Sanofi TSR rank (measured over a three-year period) with the Baseline Sanofi TSR rank (measured over a one-year\nperiod). The TSR payment would amount to 50% for an improvement of one place in the rankings, 100% for two places in the\nrankings, and 150% for three places in the rankings;\n• the criterion based on CSR accounts for 10% of the award. This performance criterion is linked to attainment of (i) annual\nobjectives over a three-year period and (ii) a \"stretch\" objective, linked to the following pillars:\n1. Affordable Access: providing essential medicines to non-communicable disease patients through Sanofi Global Health,\n2. Planet Care - Carbon Footprint Reduction, scopes 1 & 2 (% CO emissions reduction vs 2019).\n2\nAttainment of each annual CSR objective will generate one performance point; a maximum of three points (plus one bonus\npoint for the \"stretch\" objective) may be obtained for each pillar. For each criterion, attainment of the 2025 objectives will\ngenerate three points, even if the annual objectives are not attained;\n• the number of performance shares vesting depends on the overall allocation rate, which for each period is the weighted\naverage of the BNI allocation rate (45%), the FCF allocation rate (25%), the TSR allocation rate for the period (20%), and the\nCSR allocation rate;\n• a multiplier is applied that will uplift the number of performance shares vesting by 10% if (i) the maximum TSR allocation rate is\nattained and (ii) Sanofi ranks greater than or equal to the median for the TSR benchmark panel at the endpoint;\n• in order to align equity-based compensation with medium-term performance, performance is measured over three financial\nyears;\n• vesting is subject to a non-compete clause;\n• the entire award is forfeited in the event of resignation, or dismissal for gross or serious misconduct;\n• in the event of (i) individual dismissal other than for gross or serious misconduct, (ii) retirement before the age of 60, (iii) the\nbeneficiary’s employer ceasing to be part of the Sanofi group or (iv) termination of employment contract under the terms of a\ncollective separation plan initiated by the employer in accordance with locally applicable legislation or other measures\napproved by local authorities, the overall allocation percentage is apportioned on a pro rata time basis to reflect the amount\nof time the person remained with the Sanofi group during the vesting period;\n• if any of the following events occur, full rights to the award are retained: (i) retirement on or after reaching the statutory\nretirement age, or early retirement under a statutory or contractual early retirement plan implemented by the relevant Sanofi\nentity and duly approved by the Chief Executive Officer of Sanofi; (ii) disability classified in the second or third categories\nstipulated in Article L. 314-4 of the French Social Security Code; or (iii) death of the beneficiary.\nPension arrangements\nThe total amount accrued as of December 31, 2023 in respect of corporate pension plans for persons who have held an executive\nposition during the year 2023 was €10 million. That amount includes an expense of €1 million recognized in profit or loss\nduring 2023.\nPay ratio between compensation of executive officers and average/median compensation of Sanofi\nemployees – changes in compensation of executive officers and employees relative to the performance\nof Sanofi\nThis information is disclosed in accordance with Article L. 22-10-9 6° of the French Commercial Code, further to the enactment\nof the “Pacte” law.\nSanofi has referred to the guidance on compensation multiples issued by AFEP (version issued February 2021) in establishing the\ncalculation methods used for the ratios presented.\nExplanations of calculation methods and of year-on-year changes in the executive pay ratio:\n• the scope includes Sanofi SA (the parent company) and all of its direct and indirect subsidiaries located in France, and hence\ncovers more than 80% of total payroll of permanent employees in France. No separate ratios are published for Sanofi SA (the\nparent company), as the low headcount at Sanofi SA means that such ratios would not be representative of our total\nheadcount in France;\n• the employee compensation used in the calculation is the full time equivalent (FTE) compensation of permanent employees\nwith at least two financial years of uninterrupted employment;\n• compensation includes fixed compensation awarded during the reference year, and variable compensation related to the\nprevious year and paid during the reference year. All compensation amounts are gross amounts;\n• in order to maintain consistency, we have excluded from the numerator (i) compensation items not included in the\ndenominator and (ii) non-recurring compensation items. This applies in particular to accommodation expenses related to the\nrelocation to France of the Chief Executive Officer (Paul Hudson) in 2020, and to expenses related to unemployment\ninsurance;\n132 SANOFI FORM 20-F 2023\nPART I\nITEM 6.

The Social Charter addresses our key ambitions vis-à-vis our workforce: equal\nopportunity for all people without discrimination, the right to health and safety, respect for privacy, the right to information and\nprofessional training, social protection for employees and their families, freedom of association and the right to collective\nbargaining, and respect for the principles contained in the Global Compact on labor relations and ILO conventions governing the\nphysical and emotional well-being and safety of children.\nOur labor relations are based on respect and dialogue. In this spirit, management and employee representatives meet regularly to\nexchange views, negotiate, sign agreements and ensure that agreements are being implemented.\nEmployee dialogue takes place in different ways from country to country, as dictated by specific local circumstances. Depending\non the circumstances, employee dialogue relating to information, consultation and negotiation processes may take place at\nnational, regional or company level. It may be organized on an interprofessional or sectorial basis, or both. Employee dialogue\nmay be informal or implemented through a specific formal body, or a combination of both methods. Whatever the situation,\nSanofi encourages employees to voice their opinions, help create a stimulating work environment and take part in decisions\naiming to improve the way we work. These efforts reflect one of the principles of the Social Charter, whereby improving working\nconditions and the necessary adaptation to our business environment go hand-in-hand.\nProfit-sharing Schemes, Employee Savings Schemes and Employee Share Ownership\nProfit-sharing schemes\nAll employees of our French companies belong to voluntary and statutory profit-sharing schemes.\nVoluntary schemes\nVoluntary schemes (intéressement des salariés) are collective schemes that are optional for the employer and contingent upon\nperformance. The aim is to give employees an interest in the growth of the business and improvements in its performance.\nThe amount distributed by our French companies during 2023 in respect of the voluntary scheme for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2023 represented 1.05% of total payroll.\nSANOFI FORM 20-F 2023 141\nPART I\nITEM 6. Directors, senior management and employees\nIn April 2020, we entered into a new fixed-term statutory profit-sharing agreement for the 2020, 2021 and 2022 financial years,\nwhich applies to all employees of our French companies. Under the agreement, Sanofi pays collective variable compensation\ndetermined on the basis of the more favorable of (i) growth in consolidated net sales (at constant exchange rates and on a\nconstant structure basis) or (ii) BOI margin. For each of those criteria, a matrix determines what percentage of total payroll is to\nbe allocated to the scheme. An additional sum may be distributed, based on a CSR-related performance condition reflecting\nprogress in environmental matters (reduction in greenhouse gas emissions) and capped at 0.5% of total payroll.\nThis overall allocation is reduced by the amount required by law to be transferred to a special profit-sharing reserve. The balance\nis then distributed between the employees unless the transfer to the reserve equals or exceeds the maximum amount determined\nunder the specified criteria, in which case no profit share is paid to the employees.\nIn June 2023, we entered into a new fixed-term statutory profit-sharing agreement for the 2023, 2024 and 2025 financial years,\nwhich applies to all employees of our French companies.\nStatutory scheme\nThe statutory scheme (participation des salariés aux résultats de l’entreprise) is a French legal obligation for companies with\nmore than 50 employees that made a profit in the previous financial year.\nThe amount distributed by our French companies during 2023 in respect of the statutory scheme for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2022 represented 9.95% of total payroll.\nDistribution formula\nIn order to favor lower-paid employees, the voluntary and statutory profit-sharing agreements entered into since 2005 split the\nbenefit between those entitled as follows:\n• 60% prorated on the basis of time spent in the Company’s employment in the year; and\n• 40% prorated on the basis of gross annual salary received during the year, subject to a lower limit equal to the social security\nceiling and an upper limit of three times the social security ceiling.\nEmployee savings schemes and collective retirement savings plan\nThe employee savings arrangements operated by Sanofi are based on a collective savings scheme (Plan d’Épargne Groupe) and a\ncollective retirement savings scheme (Plan d’Épargne pour la Retraite Collectif). Those schemes reinvest the sums derived from\nthe statutory and voluntary profit-sharing schemes, plus voluntary contributions from employees.\nIn 2023, 90% of the employees who benefited from the profit-sharing schemes opted to invest in the collective savings scheme,\nand nearly 80% opted to invest in the collective retirement savings scheme.\nSanofi supplements the amount invested by employees in these schemes by making a top-up contribution.\nIn 2023, €143.5 million and €157.6 million were invested in the collective savings scheme and the collective retirement savings\nscheme respectively through the voluntary and statutory schemes for 2022, and through top-up contributions.\nEmployee share ownership\nAs of December 31, 2023, shares held under the collective savings scheme or in registered form by employees of Sanofi,\nemployees of related companies and former employees amounted to 2.58% of our share capital.\nFor more information about our most recent employee share ownership plan, refer to “Item 10. Additional Information — Changes\nin Share Capital — Increases in Share Capital”.\nE. Share Ownership\nSenior Management\nMembers of the Executive Committee hold shares of our Company amounting in the aggregate to less than 1% of our share\ncapital.\nExisting Option Plans as of December 31, 2023\nIn 2019, the Board of Directors reviewed Sanofi’s compensation policy and decided that stock options would no longer be\nawarded from 2020 onwards. That decision was taken to standardize the terms of equity-based compensation awards within\nSanofi, and in response to feedback from some shareholders and proxy advisors who had concerns about stock options given\ntheir dilutive effect and potential unintended consequences.\nShare Purchase Option Plans\nAs of December 31, 2023 there were no stock purchase option plans outstanding.\n142 SANOFI FORM 20-F 2023\nPART I\nITEM 6.

Vesting is subject to a non-compete clause.\nThe number of shares awarded to the Chief Executive Officer in 2023 represents 0.4% of the total limit approved by our\nshareholders at the Annual General Meeting of April 30, 2021 (1.5% of our share capital) and 2.18% of the total amount awarded to\nall beneficiaries in 2023.\nThe 2023 awards represent a dilution of approximately 0.19% of our undiluted share capital as of December 31, 2023.\nNot all of our employees were awarded performance shares, but a new voluntary profit-sharing agreement was signed\nin April 2020 which gives all of our employees an interest in Sanofi’s performance (for more details refer to “— Profit-Sharing\nSchemes, Employee Savings Schemes and Employee Share Ownership”, above).\nPerformance Share Plans\nto the 10 Number of\nTotal employees Number of rights\nDate of number of to awarded the Start date of shares canceled Number of\nshareholder Date of shares corporate most vesting Vesting End of lock- vested as of as of shares not yet\nSource authorization award awarded officers(a) shares(b) period(c) date up period 12/31/2023 12/31/2023(d) vested\nApril 28, April 28, May 01,\nSanofi April 30, 2019 2020 75,000 75,000 — 2020 2023 May 02, 2023 65,205 9,795 0\nApril 28, April 28, May 01,\nSanofi April 30, 2019 2020 328,113 — 120,951 2020 2023 May 02, 2023 245,789 82,324 —\nApril 28, April 28, May 01,\nSanofi April 30, 2019 2020 400,495 — 151,761 2020 2023 May 02, 2023 212,753 187,742 —\nApril 28, April 28, May 01,\nSanofi April 30, 2019 2020 753,720 — 19,027 2020 2023 May 02, 2023 717,595 36,125 —\nApril 28, April 28, May 01,\nSanofi April 30, 2019 2020 1,783,173 — 26,542 2020 2023 May 02, 2023 1357661 425512 —\nOctober 28, October 28, October 29, October 30,\nSanofi April 30, 2019 2020 73,027 — 73,027 2020 2023 2023 57,745 15,282 —\nApril 30, May 01,\nSanofi April 30, 2021 2021 1,614,023 — 19,407 April 30, 2021 2024 May 01, 2024 2,489 314,691 1,296,843\nApril 30, May 01,\nSanofi April 30, 2021 2021 701,824 — 163,877 April 30, 2021 2024 May 01, 2024 — 202,582 499,242\nApril 30, May 01,\nSanofi April 30, 2021 2021 595,878 — 10,918 April 30, 2021 2024 May 01, 2024 469 36,618 558,791\nApril 30, May 01,\nSanofi April 30, 2021 2021 497,695 — 150,339 April 30, 2021 2024 May 01, 2024 — 43,973 453,722\nApril 30, May 01,\nSanofi April 30, 2021 2021 75,000 75,000 — April 30, 2021 2024 May 01, 2024 — — 75,000\nOctober 27, October 27, October 28, October 28,\nSanofi April 30, 2021 2021 13,521 — 13,521 2021 2024 2024 — 3,706 9,815\nMay 03, May 03, May 04,\nSanofi April 30, 2021 2022 2,000,627 — 25,882 May 03, 2022 2025 2025 1,145 183,551 1,815,931\nMay 03, May 03, May 04,\nSanofi April 30, 2021 2022 1,146,431 — 192,542 May 03, 2022 2025 2025 — 170,559 975,872\nMay 03, May 03, May 04,\nSanofi April 30, 2021 2022 82,500 82,500 — May 03, 2022 2025 2025 — — 82,500\nDecember December 14, December December 15,\nSanofi April 30, 2021 14, 2022 90,580 — 77,111 2022 14, 2025 2025 — — 90,580\nDecember December 14, December December 15,\nSanofi April 30, 2021 14, 2022 10,335 — 10,335 2022 14, 2025 2025 — — 10,335\nMay 25, May 25,\nSanofi April 30, 2021 2023 2,425,047 — 25,417 May 25, 2023 2026 May 25, 2026 620 71,695 2,352,732\nMay 25, May 25,\nSanofi April 30, 2021 2023 1,209,790 — 192,417 May 25, 2023 2026 May 25, 2026 — 50,735 1,159,055\nMay 25, May 25,\nSanofi April 30, 2021 2023 82,500 82,500 — May 25, 2023 2026 May 25, 2026 — — 82,500\nDecember December 13, December December 14,\nSanofi April 30, 2021 13, 2023 58,347 — 58,347 2023 14, 2026 2026 — — 58,347\nDecember December 13, December December 14,\nSanofi April 30, 2021 13, 2023 944 — 944 2023 14, 2026 2026 — — 944\n(a) Comprises the Chief Executive Officer, and any Deputy Chief Executive Officers or members of the Management Board in office at the date of grant.\n(b) In office at the date of grant.\n(c) Subject to the conditions set.\n(d) 87,416 rights were cancelled due to partial non-fulfilment of performance conditions.\nAs of December 31, 2023, 9,522,209 shares had not yet vested pending fulfilment of performance conditions.\n144 SANOFI FORM 20-F 2023\nPART I\nITEM 6.

All of our\nshareholders may benefit from double voting rights if these conditions are met, and no shareholder benefits from specific voting\nrights. For more information relating to our shares, see “Item 10. Additional Information — B. Memorandum and Articles of\nAssociation.”\nNeither L’Oréal nor BlackRock holds different voting rights from those of our other shareholders.\nTo the best of our knowledge, no other shareholder currently holds, directly or indirectly and acting alone or in concert, more\nthan 5% of our share capital or voting rights. Furthermore, we believe that we are not directly or indirectly owned or controlled by\nanother corporation or government, or by any other natural or legal persons. To our knowledge, there are no arrangements that\nmay result in a change of control.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2023 we received one share ownership declaration informing us that a legal threshold had\nbeen passed, as required under Article L. 233-7 of the French Commercial Code. Dodge & Cox, acting on behalf of its clients and\nfunds under its management, declared that on June 23, 2023 it had passed below the 5% threshold in terms of share capital, and\nholds, on behalf of its clients and funds, 4.99% of the share capital and 4.43% of the voting rights.\nIn addition to the statutory requirement to inform the Company and the Autorité des marchés financiers (AMF, the French\nFinancial Markets Regulator) that they hold a number of shares (or of securities equivalent to shares or of voting rights\npursuant to Article L. 233-9 of the French Commercial Code) representing more than one-twentieth (5%), one-tenth (10%),\nthree-twentieths (15%), one-fifth (20%), one-quarter (25%), three-tenths (30%), one-third (1/3), one-half (50%), two-thirds (2/3),\nnine-tenths (90%) or nineteen-twentieths (95%) of the share capital or theoretical voting rights within four trading days after\ncrossing any such ownership threshold (Article L. 233-7 of the French Commercial Code), any natural or legal person who directly\nor indirectly comes to hold a percentage of the share capital, voting rights or securities giving future access to the Company’s\ncapital that is equal to or greater than 1% or any multiple of that percentage, is obliged to inform the Company thereof by\nregistered mail, return receipt requested, indicating the number of securities held, within five trading days following the date on\nwhich each of the thresholds was crossed.\nIf such declaration is not made, the shares in excess of the fraction that should have been declared will be stripped of voting\nrights at shareholders’ meetings, if on the occasion of such meeting, the failure to declare has been formally noted and one or\nmore shareholders collectively holding at least 5% of the Company’s share capital or voting rights so request at that meeting.\nAny natural or legal person is also required to inform the Company, in the forms and within the time limits stipulated above for\npassing above a specified threshold, if their direct or indirect holding passes below any of the aforementioned thresholds.\nSince January 1, 2024 Sanofi has only received share ownership declarations of statutory threshold.\n146 SANOFI FORM 20-F 2023\nPART I\nITEM 7.

The\nproposed 2023 dividend equates to a distribution of 46.3% of our business net income. For information on the non-IFRS financial\nmeasure “business earnings per share” see “Item 5.

Any declaration will depend on our results\nof operations, financial condition, cash requirements, future prospects and other factors deemed relevant by our shareholders.\nAccordingly, we cannot assure you that we will pay dividends in the future on a continuous and regular basis. Under French law,\nwe are required to pay dividends approved by an ordinary general meeting of shareholders within nine months following the\nmeeting at which they are approved.\nDisclosure pursuant to Section 13(r) of the United States Exchange Act of 1934\nSanofi engages in limited business activities with Iran related to human health products – namely, sales of bulk and branded\npharmaceuticals and vaccines. These activities, which are disclosed pursuant to Section 13(r) of the United States Exchange Act\nof 1934, as amended, are not financially material to Sanofi and contributed well under 1% of Sanofi’s consolidated net sales\nin 2023.\nSanofi’s US affiliates and non-US affiliates owned or controlled by Sanofi’s US affiliates either do not engage in Iran-related\nactivities or act under licenses issued by the US Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC).\nSanofi and certain non-US Sanofi affiliates engage in limited business activities that neither are expressly authorized by OFAC nor\nrequire such authorization.\nIn 2016, Sanofi and the Iran Food and Drug Administration (IFDA), an entity affiliated with the Iranian Ministry of Health and\nMedical Education, signed a Memorandum of Cooperation (MOC) regarding: (i) potential future projects to reinforce current\npartnerships with reputable Iranian manufacturers (in particular, to enhance industrial quality standards); (ii) collaborating with\nthe Ministry of Health and Medical Education on programs for the prevention and control of certain chronic and non-\ncommunicable diseases (in particular, diabetes); and (iii) potential future collaboration on epidemiological studies. In 2023,\nactivities conducted under the MOC did not generate any revenue or net profits.\nCertain non-US Sanofi affiliates engage in limited business with Iranian counterparties associated with the Iranian Ministry of\nHealth, such as public hospitals or distributors. In 2023, those business activities generated approximately €27.1 million in gross\nrevenue and contributed no more than €3.9 million in net profits.\nFinally, a representative office in Tehran incurs incidental expenses from state-owned utilities.\nSanofi believes that it and its affiliates’ activities are compliant with applicable law, and in light of the nature of the activities\nconcerned, Sanofi and its affiliates intend to continue their ongoing activities in Iran.\n148 SANOFI FORM 20-F 2023\nPART I\nITEM 8. Financial information\nInformation on Legal or Arbitration Proceedings\nThis Item 8. incorporates by reference the disclosures found in Note D.22. to the consolidated financial statements at\nItem 18. of this annual report; material updates thereto as of the date of this annual report are found below under the\nheading “— B. Significant Changes — Updates to Note D.22.”.\nSanofi and its subsidiaries are involved in litigation, arbitration and other legal proceedings. These proceedings typically are\nrelated to product liability claims, intellectual property rights (particularly claims against generic companies seeking to limit the\npatent protection of Sanofi products), competition law and trade practices, commercial claims, employment and wrongful\ndischarge claims, tax assessment claims, waste disposal and pollution claims, and claims under warranties or indemnification\narrangements relating to business divestitures. As a result, we may become subject to substantial liabilities that may not be\ncovered by insurance and could affect our business and reputation. While we do not currently believe that any of these legal\nproceedings will have a material adverse effect on our financial position, litigation is inherently unpredictable. As a consequence,\nwe may in the future incur judgments or enter into settlements of claims that could have a material adverse effect on results of\noperations, cash flows and/or our reputation.\nGovernment Investigations and Related Litigation\nFrom time to time, subsidiaries of Sanofi are subject to governmental investigations and information requests from regulatory\nauthorities inquiring as to the practices of Sanofi with respect to the sales, marketing, and promotion of its products.\nFrom 2017 through 2023, several government agencies issued Civil Investigative Demands (CIDs) or other discovery requests\ncalling for the production of documents and information relating to Sanofi’s trade and pricing practices for its insulin products\nand/or LANTUS-related litigation. Sanofi US is cooperating with each of the previously reported investigations (including those\nconducted by the State Attorney General’s offices in Washington, California, Colorado and Vermont), and reached a resolution\nwith the New York State Attorney General in April 2023. In addition, Sanofi US is cooperating with investigations initiated by\nthe US Federal Trade Commission in June 2022; by the Texas State Attorney General’s office in August 2022; and by the Ohio\nAttorney General’s office in October 2022.\nIn September 2019, Sanofi US received a CID from the US Department of Justice concerning DUPIXENT, KEVZARA, PRALUENT\nand ZALTRAP. In June 2021, the government declined to intervene in the underlying complaint which was filed in November 2018.\nThe government investigation into this matter is now closed. Relators, however, filed their First Amended Complaint\nin October 2021, which the Court dismissed with prejudice in August 2023.\nIn February 2020, Genzyme Corporation received a CID from the US Department of Justice. The CID requests documents and\ninformation relating to Genzyme Corporation’s payments made to vendors or developers of electronic health record technology.\nGenzyme Corporation is cooperating with this investigation.\nIn October 2022, Sanofi US received a CID from the Ohio State Attorney General’s office, seeking documents and information\nabout the pricing, sale, and distribution of pharmaceuticals and pharmacy benefit manager services in the State of Ohio.\nSanofi US is cooperating with this investigation.\nIn November 2023, Sanofi US received a CID from the US Department of Justice regarding an investigation into Sanofi’s pricing\nsubmissions for ADMELOG. Sanofi US is cooperating with this investigation.\nInsulin-Related Litigation\nIn December 2016 and January 2017, two putative class actions were filed against Sanofi US and Sanofi GmbH in the US Federal\nCourt in Massachusetts on behalf of direct purchasers of LANTUS alleging certain antitrust violations. Sanofi GmbH was later\ndismissed from the actions. In January 2018, the Court dismissed Plaintiffs’ consolidated amended complaint against Sanofi US.\nPlaintiffs appealed that order to the Court of Appeals for the First Circuit, which issued its decision on February 13, 2020 reversing\nand remanding to the district court. In January 2021, Sanofi-Aventis Puerto Rico, Inc. (Sanofi PR) was added as a defendant.\nIn October 2022, plaintiffs informed Sanofi US and Sanofi PR that they would proceed via joinder rather than move for class\ncertification. Consistent with the Court's joinder deadline, new plaintiffs moved to intervene on January 3, 2023.\nThere are a number of insulin-related litigation matters pending in the US federal and state courts. These include cases\nbrought on behalf of putative classes of consumers, wholesale purchasers of insulin, and state and local governments. The cases,\nwhich have been filed against Sanofi US along with other insulin manufacturers and, in some cases, pharmacy benefit\nmanagers, challenge those entities’ insulin pricing practices (including Sanofi’s pricing practices for LANTUS, APIDRA, TOUJEO\nand/or SOLIQUA). The suits allege some combination of: violations of the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act\n(“RICO Act”); violations of various state unfair/deceptive trade practices statutes; unjust enrichment; common-law fraud; and civil\nconspiracy. The status of these matters varies from initial motions to dismiss the complaints to active discovery. In August 2023,\nthe vast majority of the insulin-related litigation was consolidated in an MDL (Multi-District Litigation - MDL) in federal court in\nNew Jersey. On January 24, 2024, the District Court for the District of New Jersey issued a decision denying plaintiffs’ motion for\nclass certification. Plaintiffs have appealed that decision.\nMylan vs Sanofi antitrust complaint\nIn May 2023, Mylan Pharmaceuticals Inc., Mylan Specialty LP and Mylan Inc. (Mylan) filed suit against Sanofi-Aventis US LLC,\nSanofi SA, Aventis Pharma SA and Sanofi-Aventis Puerto Rico (Sanofi) in the Western District of Pennsylvania for alleged antitrust\nviolations related to Mylan’s insulin product SEMGLEE. Sanofi has moved to dismiss the complaint.\nSANOFI FORM 20-F 2023 149\nPART I\nITEM 8. Financial information\nB. Significant Changes\nUpdates to Note D.22.\nTAXOTERE - Mississippi Attorney General Litigation in the United States\nIn February 2024, Sanofi reached a settlement to resolve this case, which now fully concludes the matter.\nOther Changes\nOn January 23, 2024 Sanofi announced the entry into a merger agreement with Inhibrx, Inc. (Inhibrx), a publicly traded, clinical-\nstage biopharmaceutical company focused on developing a broad pipeline of novel biologic therapeutic candidates in oncology\nand orphan diseases (the Merger Agreement), pursuant to which Sanofi has agreed to acquire Inhibrx following the spin-off of\nInhibrx's non-INBRX-101 assets and liabilities into a new publicly traded company (\"New Inhibrx\"). Under the terms of the Merger\nAgreement, Sanofi has agreed to: (i) provide Inhibrx's stockholders with consideration of $30 per share of Inhibrx common stock\nat the closing of the merger (approximately $1.7 billion), and to additionally issue one non-transferable contingent value right per\nshare of Inhibrx common stock, which will entitle its holder to receive a deferred cash payment of $5, conditioned upon the\nachievement of a regulatory milestone (approximately $0.3 billion, if the regulatory milestone is achieved); (ii) pay off Inhibrx’s\noutstanding third-party debt (approximately $0.2 billion); and (iii) provide a capital contribution to New Inhibrx (up to $0.2 billion).\nAt the closing of the merger, Sanofi will acquire 100% of the equity interests in Inhibrx, which will become a 100% wholly owned\nsubsidiary of Sanofi. In addition, Inhibrx will retain a minority stake (approximately 8% equity interest) in New Inhibrx. INBRX-101 is\na human recombinant protein that holds the promise of allowing Alpha-1 Antitrypsin Deficiency (AATD) patients to achieve\nnormalization of serum AAT levels with less frequent (monthly vs. weekly) dosing.

Extraordinary corporate\nactions include:\n• changing our Company’s name or corporate purpose;\n• increasing or decreasing our share capital;\n• creating a new class of equity securities;\n• authorizing the issuance of:\n– shares giving access to our share capital or giving the right to receive debt instruments, or\n– other securities giving access to our share capital;\n• establishing any other rights to equity securities;\n• selling or transferring substantially all of our assets; and\n• the voluntary liquidation of our Company.\nSpecial meetings of shareholders of a certain category of shares or shares with certain specific rights (such as shares with double\nvoting rights) are required for any modification of the rights derived from that category of shares. The resolutions of the\nshareholders’ general meeting affecting these rights are effective only after approval by the relevant special meeting.\nSANOFI FORM 20-F 2023 153\nPART I\nITEM 10. Additional information\nAnnual ordinary meetings\nThe French Commercial Code requires the Board of Directors to convene an annual ordinary general shareholders’ meeting to\napprove the annual financial statements. This meeting must be held within six months of the end of each fiscal year.\nThe Board of Directors may also convene an ordinary or extraordinary general shareholders’ meeting upon proper notice at any\ntime during the year. If the Board of Directors fails to convene a shareholders’ meeting, our independent auditors may call the\nmeeting. In case of bankruptcy, the liquidator or court-appointed agent may also call a shareholders’ meeting in some instances.\nIn addition, any of the following may request the court to appoint an agent for the purpose of calling a shareholders’ meeting:\n• one or several shareholders holding at least 5% of our share capital;\n• duly qualified associations of shareholders who have held their shares in registered form for at least two years and who\ntogether hold at least 1% of our voting rights;\n• the works council in cases of urgency; or\n• any interested party in cases of urgency.\nUnder our Articles of Association, the Board of Directors may take decisions by written consultation under the conditions\npermitted by law and as specified in the Board Charter (an English language version of which is reproduced in full as Exhibit 1.2 to\nthis annual report), including the possibility to convene an ordinary or extraordinary general meeting.\nNotice of shareholders’ meetings\nAll prior notice periods provided for below are minimum periods required by French law and cannot be shortened, except in case\nof a public tender offer for our shares.\nWe must announce general meetings at least thirty-five days in advance by means of a preliminary notice (avis de réunion), which\nis published in the Bulletin des Annonces Légales Obligatoires, or BALO. The preliminary notice must first be sent to the French\nFinancial markets authority (Autorité des marchés financiers, the “AMF”), with an indication of the date on which it will be\npublished in the BALO. It must be published on our website at least twenty-one days prior to the general meeting. The\npreliminary notice must contain, among other things, the agenda, a draft of the resolutions to be submitted to the shareholders\nfor consideration at the general meeting and a detailed description of the voting procedures (proxy voting, electronic voting or\nvoting by mail), the procedures permitting shareholders to submit additional resolutions or items to the agenda and to ask written\nquestions to the Board of Directors. The AMF also recommends that, prior to or simultaneously with the publication of the\npreliminary notice, we publish a summary of the notice indicating the date, time and place of the meeting in a newspaper of\nnational circulation in France and on our website.\nAt least fifteen days prior to the date set for a first convening, and at least ten days prior to any second convening, we must send\na final notice (avis de convocation) containing the final agenda, the date, time and place of the meeting and other information\nrelated to the meeting. Such final notice must be sent by mail to all registered shareholders who have held shares in registered\nform for more than one month prior to the date of the final notice and by registered mail, if shareholders have asked for it and\npaid the corresponding charges. The final notice must also be published in a newspaper authorized to publish legal\nannouncements in the local administrative department (département) in which our Company is registered as well as in the BALO,\nwith prior notice having been given to the AMF for informational purposes. Even if there are no proposals for new resolutions or\nitems to be submitted to the shareholders at the meeting, we must publish a final notice in a newspaper authorized to publish\nlegal announcements in the local administrative department (département) in which our Company is registered as well as in\nthe BALO.\nOther issues\nIn general, shareholders can only take action at shareholders’ meetings on matters listed on the agenda. As an exception to this\nrule, shareholders may take action with respect to the appointment and dismissal of directors even if this action has not been\nincluded on the agenda.\nAdditional resolutions to be submitted for approval by the shareholders at the shareholders’ meeting may be proposed to the\nBoard of Directors, for recommendation to the shareholders at any time from the publication of the preliminary notice in\nthe BALO until twenty-five days prior to the general meeting and in any case no later than twenty days following the publication\nof the preliminary notice in the BALO by:\n• one or several shareholders together holding a specified percentage of shares;\n• a duly qualified association of shareholders who have held their shares in registered form for at least two years and who\ntogether hold at least 1% of our voting rights; or\n• the works council.\nWithin the same period, the shareholders may also propose additional items (points) to be submitted and discussed during the\nshareholders’ meeting, without a shareholders’ vote. The shareholders must substantiate the reasons for their proposals of\nadditional items.\nThe resolutions and the list of items added to the agenda of the shareholders’ meeting must be promptly published on\nour website.\nThe Board of Directors must submit the resolutions to a vote of the shareholders after having made a recommendation thereon.\nThe Board of Directors may also comment on the items that are submitted to the shareholders’ meeting.\n154 SANOFI FORM 20-F 2023\nPART I\nITEM 10. Additional information\nFollowing the date on which documents must be made available to the shareholders (including documents to be submitted to the\nshareholders’ meeting and resolutions proposed by the Board of Directors, which must be published on our website at least\ntwenty-one days prior to the general meeting), shareholders may submit written questions to the Board of Directors relating to\nthe agenda for the meeting until the fourth business day prior to the general meeting. The Board of Directors must respond to\nthese questions during the meeting or may refer to a Q&A section located on our website in which the question submitted by a\nshareholder has already been answered.\nAttendance at shareholders’ meetings; proxies and votes by mail\nIn general, all shareholders may participate in general meetings either in person or by proxy. Shareholders may vote in person, by\nproxy or by mail.\nThe right of shareholders to participate in general meetings is subject to the recording (inscription en compte) of their shares on\nthe second business day, 12:00 a.m. (Paris time), preceding the general meeting:\n• for holders of registered shares: in the registered shareholder account held by the Company or on its behalf by an agent\nappointed by it; and\n• for holders of bearer shares: in the bearer shareholder account held by the accredited financial intermediary with whom such\nholders have deposited their shares; such financial intermediaries shall deliver to holders of bearer shares a shareholding\ncertificate (attestation de participation) enabling them to participate in the general meeting.\nAttendance in person\nAny shareholder may attend ordinary general meetings and extraordinary general meetings and exercise its voting rights subject\nto the conditions specified in the French Commercial Code, the French Civil Code and our Articles of Association.\nAn attendance sheet and written minutes are established for each shareholders’ meeting; failure to do so could lead to\ncancellation of the decisions at the shareholders’ meeting.\nProxies and votes by mail\nProxies are sent to any shareholder upon a request received between the publication of the final notice of meeting and six days\nbefore the general meeting and must be made available on our website at least twenty-one days before the general meeting. In\norder to be counted, such proxies must be received at our registered office, or at any other address indicated on the notice of the\nmeeting or by any electronic mail indicated on the notice of the meeting, prior to the date of the meeting (in practice, we request\nthat shareholders return proxies at least three business days prior to the meeting; electronic proxies must be returned\nbefore 3 p.m. Paris time, on the day prior to the general meeting). A shareholder may grant proxies to any natural person or legal\nentity. The agent may be required to disclose certain information to the shareholder or to the public.\nA proxy is only valid for one meeting (or by way of exception for two meetings, one being ordinary and the other extraordinary,\nheld on the same day or within a single 15-day period); it remains valid in the event such meeting is convened multiple times for\nthe same agenda, and may be revoked by written statement of the shareholder granting the proxy.\nAlternatively, the shareholder may send us a blank proxy without nominating any representative. In this case, the chairman of the\nmeeting will vote the blank proxies in favor of all resolutions proposed or approved by the Board of Directors and against\nall others.\nWith respect to votes by mail, we must send shareholders a voting form upon request or must make available a voting form on our\nwebsite at least twenty-one days before the general meeting. The completed form must be returned to us at least three days\nprior to the date of the shareholders’ meeting. For holders of registered shares, in addition to traditional voting by mail,\ninstructions may also be given via the Internet.\nQuorum\nThe French Commercial Code requires that shareholders holding in the aggregate at least 20% of the shares entitled to vote\nmust be present in person, or vote by mail or by proxy, in order to fulfill the quorum requirement for:\n• an ordinary general meeting; and\n• an extraordinary general meeting where the only resolutions pertain to either (a) a proposed increase in our share capital\nthrough incorporation of reserves, profits or share premium, or (b) the potential issuance of free share warrants in the event of\na public tender offer for our shares (Article L. 233-32 of the French Commercial Code).\nFor any other extraordinary general meeting the quorum requirement is at least 25% of the shares entitled to vote, held by\nshareholders present in person, voting by mail or by proxy.\nFor a special meeting of holders of a certain category of shares, the quorum requirement is one third of the shares entitled to\nvote in that category, held by shareholders present in person, voting by mail or by proxy.\nIf a quorum is not present at a meeting, the meeting is adjourned. However, only questions that were on the agenda of the\nadjourned meeting may be discussed and voted upon once the meeting resumes.\nWhen an adjourned meeting is resumed, there is no quorum requirement for meetings cited in the first paragraph of this\n“Quorum” section. In the case of any other reconvened extraordinary general meeting or special meeting, the quorum\nrequirement is 20% of the shares entitled to vote (or voting shares belonging to the relevant category for special meetings of\nholders of shares of such specific category), held by shareholders present in person or voting by mail or by proxy. If a quorum is\nnot met, the reconvened meeting may be adjourned for a maximum of two months with the same quorum requirement. No\ndeliberation or action by the shareholders may take place without a quorum.\nSANOFI FORM 20-F 2023 155\nPART I\nITEM 10. Additional information\nC. Material Contracts\nIn the ordinary course of our business, we enter into agreements for licensing or collaboration in the development and\ncommercialization of products. Certain of the agreements which have led to successful commercialization to date are\nsummarized in “Item 5. Operating and financial review and prospects — A.1.7 Financial presentation of alliances.”\nD. Exchange Controls\nFrench exchange control regulations currently do not limit the amount of payments that we may remit to non-residents of\nFrance. Laws and regulations concerning foreign exchange controls do require, however, that all payments or transfers of funds\nmade by a French resident to a non-resident be handled by an accredited intermediary.\nE. Taxation\nGeneral\nThe following generally summarizes the material French and US federal income tax consequences to US holders (as defined\nbelow) of purchasing, owning and disposing of our ADSs and ordinary shares (collectively the “Securities”). This discussion is\nintended only as a descriptive summary and does not purport to be a complete analysis or listing of all potential tax effects of the\npurchase, ownership or disposition of our Securities. All of the following is subject to change. Such changes could apply\nretroactively and could affect the consequences described below.\nThis summary does not constitute a legal opinion or tax advice. Holders are urged to consult their own tax advisers regarding\nthe tax consequences of the purchase, ownership and disposition of Securities in light of their particular circumstances,\nincluding the effect of any US federal, state, local or other national tax laws.\nA set of tax rules is applicable to French assets that are held by or in foreign trusts. These rules provide inter alia for the inclusion\nof trust assets in the settlor’s net assets for purpose of applying the French real estate wealth tax, for the application of French\ngift and death duties to French assets held in trust, for a specific tax on capital on the French assets of foreign trusts not already\nsubject to the French real estate wealth tax and for a number of French tax reporting and disclosure obligations. The following\ndiscussion does not address the French tax consequences applicable to Securities held in trusts. If Securities are held in trust, the\ngrantor, trustee and beneficiary are urged to consult their own tax adviser regarding the specific tax consequences of acquiring,\nowning and disposing of Securities.\nThe description of the French and US federal income tax consequences set forth below is based on the laws (including, for\nUS federal income tax purposes, the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”), final, temporary and proposed\nUS Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder and administrative and judicial interpretations thereof) in force as of the date\nof this annual report, the Convention Between the Government of the United States of America and the Government of the\nFrench Republic for the Avoidance of Double Taxation and the Prevention of Fiscal Evasion with Respect to Taxes on Income and\nCapital of August 31, 1994 (the “Treaty”), which entered into force on December 30, 1995 (as amended by any subsequent\nprotocols, including the protocol of January 13, 2009), and the tax regulations issued by the French tax authorities within the\nBulletin Officiel des Finances Publiques-Impôts (the “Regulations”) in force as of the date of this report. US holders are advised to\nconsult their own tax advisers regarding their eligibility for Treaty benefits, especially with regard to the “Limitations on\nBenefits” provision, in light of their own particular circumstances.\nNo advance ruling has been obtained with respect to the tax consequences of the acquisition, ownership or disposition of the\nSecurities from either the French or US tax authorities. Thus, there can no assurances that either or both of such authorities will\nnot take a position concerning said tax consequences different from that set out herein or that such a position would not be\nsustained by a court.\nFor the purposes of this discussion, a US holder is a beneficial owner of Securities that is (i) an individual who is a US citizen or\nresident for US federal income tax purposes, (ii) a US domestic corporation created or organized in or under the laws of the\nUnited States or any state thereof, including the District of Columbia, or (iii) certain estates or trusts that are subject to US tax\njurisdiction. A non-US holder is a person other than a US holder.\nIf a partnership holds Securities, the tax treatment of a partner generally will depend upon the status of the partner and the\nactivities of the partnership. If a US holder is an estate or trust or partner in a partnership that holds Securities, the holder is\nurged to consult its own tax adviser regarding the specific tax consequences of acquiring, owning and disposing of Securities.\nThis discussion is intended only as a general summary and does not purport to be a complete analysis or listing of all potential tax\neffects of the acquisition, ownership or disposition of the Securities to any particular investor, and does not discuss tax\nconsiderations that arise from rules of general application or that are generally assumed to be known by investors. The discussion\napplies only to investors that hold our Securities as capital assets that have the US dollar as their functional currency, that are\nentitled to Treaty benefits under the “Limitation on Benefits” provision contained in the Treaty, and whose ownership of the\nSecurities is not effectively connected to a permanent establishment or a fixed base in France. Certain holders (including, but not\nlimited to, US expatriates, partnerships or other entities classified as partnerships for US federal income tax purposes, banks,\ninsurance companies, regulated investment companies, tax-exempt organizations, financial institutions, persons subject to the\nalternative minimum tax, persons who acquired the Securities pursuant to the exercise of employee stock options or otherwise as\ncompensation, persons that own (directly, indirectly or by attribution) 5% or more of our voting stock or 5% or more of our\noutstanding share capital, dealers in securities or currencies, persons that elect to mark their securities to market for US federal\nincome tax purposes, persons that acquire ADSs in “pre-release” transactions (i.e. prior to deposit of the relevant ordinary shares,\n156 SANOFI FORM 20-F 2023\nPART I\nITEM 10. Additional information\nalthough our depositary has indicated that such transactions have been halted) and persons holding Securities as a position in a\nsynthetic security, straddle or conversion transaction) may be subject to special rules not discussed below. Holders of Securities\nare advised to consult their own tax advisers with regard to the application of French tax law and US federal tax law to their\nparticular situations, as well as any tax consequences arising under the laws of any state, local or other foreign jurisdiction.\nFrench taxes\nEstate and gift taxes and transfer taxes\nIn general, a transfer of Securities by gift or by reason of death of a US holder that would otherwise be subject to French gift or\ninheritance tax, respectively, will not be subject to such French tax by reason of the Convention between the Government of the\nUnited States of America and the Government of the French Republic for the Avoidance of Double Taxation and the Prevention\nof Fiscal Evasion with Respect to Taxes on Estates, Inheritances and Gifts, dated November 24, 1978, unless the donor or the\ntransferor is domiciled in France at the time of making the gift or at the time of his or her death, or the Securities were used in, or\nheld for use in, the conduct of a business through a permanent establishment or a fixed base in France.\nPursuant to Article 235 ter ZD of the French General Tax Code, purchases of Securities are subject to a 0.3% French tax on\nfinancial transactions (the “FTFF”) provided that Sanofi’s market capitalization exceeds €1 billion as of December 1 of the year\npreceding the taxation year. A list of companies whose market capitalization exceeds €1 billion as of December 1 of the year\npreceding the taxation year used to be published annually by the French Ministry of Economy. It is now published by the\nFrench tax authorities, and could be amended at any time. Pursuant to Regulations BOI-ANNX-000467-20/12/2023 issued\non December 20, 2023, purchases of Sanofi’s Securities in 2024 should be subject to the FTFF as the market capitalization of\nSanofi exceeded €1 billion as of December 1, 2023. In accordance with Article 726-II-d of the French General Tax Code, purchases\nwhich are subject to the FTFF should however not be subject to transfer taxes (droits d’enregistrement) in France.\nWealth tax\nThe French wealth tax (impôt de solidarité sur la fortune) has been replaced with a French real estate wealth tax (impôt sur la\nfortune immobilière) with effect from January 1, 2018. French real estate wealth tax applies only to individuals and does not\ngenerally apply to the Securities if the holder is a US resident, as defined pursuant to the provisions of the Treaty, provided that\nthe individual does not own directly or indirectly a shareholding exceeding 10% of the financial rights and voting rights.\nUS taxes\nOwnership of the securities\nDeposits and withdrawals by a US holder of ordinary shares in exchange for ADSs, will not be taxable events for US federal\nincome tax purposes. For US tax purposes, holders of ADSs will be treated as owners of the ordinary shares represented by such\nADSs. Accordingly, the discussion that follows regarding the US federal income tax consequences of acquiring, owning and\ndisposing of ordinary shares is equally applicable to ADSs.\nInformation reporting and backup withholding tax\nDistributions made to holders and proceeds paid from the sale, exchange, redemption or disposal of Securities may be subject to\ninformation reporting to the Internal Revenue Service. Such payments may be subject to backup withholding taxes unless the\nholder (i) is a corporation or other exempt recipient or (ii) provides a taxpayer identification number and certifies that no loss of\nexemption from backup withholding has occurred. Holders that are not US persons generally are not subject to information\nreporting or backup withholding. However, such a holder may be required to provide a certification of its non-US status in\nconnection with payments received within the United States or through a US-related financial intermediary to establish that it is\nan exempt recipient. Backup withholding is not an additional tax. Amounts withheld as backup withholding may be credited\nagainst a holder’s US federal income tax liability. A holder may obtain a refund of any excess amounts withheld under the backup\nwithholding rules by filing the appropriate claim for refund with the Internal Revenue Service and furnishing any required\ninformation.\nForeign asset reporting\nIn addition, a US holder that is an individual or certain entities may be subject to reporting obligations with respect to ordinary\nshares and ADSs if the aggregate value of these and certain other “specified foreign financial assets” exceeds $50,000 on\nthe last day of the tax year or more than $75,000 at any time during the tax year. If required, this disclosure is made by\nfiling Form 8938 with the US Internal Revenue Service. Significant penalties can apply if holders are required to make this\ndisclosure and fail to do so. In addition, a US holder should consider the possible obligation to file online a FinCEN Form 114 –\nForeign Bank and Financial Accounts Report as a result of holding ordinary shares or ADSs. Holders are encouraged to consult\ntheir US tax advisors with respect to these and other reporting requirements that may apply to their acquisition of ordinary shares\nand ADSs.\nState and local taxes\nIn addition to US federal income tax, US holders of Securities may be subject to US state and local taxes with respect to such\nSecurities.

Additional information\nADSs-Ordinary Shares\nFrench taxes\nTaxation of dividends\nUnder French law, dividends paid by a French corporation, such as Sanofi, to non-residents of France are generally subject to\nFrench withholding tax at a rate of (i) 25% for payments benefiting legal persons who are not French tax residents (and 15% for\ndistributions made to not-for-profit organizations with a head office in a Member State of the European Economic Area which\nwould be subject to the tax regime set forth under Article 206 paragraph 2 of the French General Tax Code if its head office were\nlocated in France and which meet the criteria set forth in the Regulations BOI-RPPM-RCM-30-30-10-70-24/12/2019, No. 130),\nand (ii) 12.8% for payments benefiting individuals who are not French tax residents. Dividends paid by a French corporation, such\nas Sanofi, towards non-cooperative States or territories, as defined in Article 238-0 A of the French General Tax Code, will\ngenerally be subject to French withholding tax at a rate of 75%, irrespective of the tax residence of the beneficiary of the\ndividends if the dividends are received in such States or territories; however, eligible US holders entitled to Treaty benefits under\nthe “Limitation on Benefits” provision contained in the Treaty who are US residents, as defined pursuant to the provisions of the\nTreaty and who receive dividends in non-cooperative States or territories, will not be subject to this 75% withholding tax rate.\nUnder the Treaty, the rate of French withholding tax on dividends paid to an eligible US holder who is a US resident as defined\npursuant to the provisions of the Treaty and whose ownership of the ordinary shares or ADSs is not effectively connected with a\npermanent establishment or fixed base that such US holder has in France, is reduced to 15%, or to 5% if such US holder is a\ncorporation and owns directly or indirectly at least 10% of the share capital of the issuing company; such US holder may claim a\nrefund from the French tax authorities of the amount withheld in excess of the Treaty rates of 15% or 5%, if any. For US holders\nthat are not individuals but are US residents, as defined pursuant to the provisions of the Treaty, the requirements for eligibility\nfor Treaty benefits, including the reduced 5% or 15% withholding tax rates contained in the “Limitation on Benefits” provision\nof the Treaty, are complicated, and certain technical changes were made to these requirements by the protocol of\nJanuary 13, 2009. US holders are advised to consult their own tax advisers regarding their eligibility for Treaty benefits in light of\ntheir own particular circumstances.\nDividends paid to an eligible US holder may immediately be subject to the reduced rates of 5% or 15% provided that such holder\nestablishes before the date of payment that it is a US resident under the Treaty by completing and providing the depositary with\na treaty form (Form 5000). Dividends paid to a US holder that has not filed the Form 5000 before the dividend payment date will\nbe subject to French withholding tax at the rate of 25% and then reduced at a later date to 5% or 15%, provided that such holder\nduly completes and provides the French tax authorities with the treaty forms Form 5000 and Form 5001 before December 31 of\nthe second calendar year following the year during which the dividend is paid. Pension funds and certain other tax-exempt\nentities are subject to the same general filing requirements as other US holders except that they may have to supply additional\ndocumentation evidencing their entitlement to these benefits.\nThe depositary agrees to use reasonable efforts to follow the procedures established, or that may be established, by the French\ntax authorities (i) to enable eligible US holders to qualify for the reduced withholding tax rate provided by the Treaty, if available\nat the time the dividends are paid, or (ii) to recover any excess French withholding taxes initially withheld or deducted with\nrespect to dividends and other distributions to which such US holders may be eligible from the French tax authorities and (iii) to\nrecover any other available tax credits. In particular, associated forms (including Form 5000 and Form 5001, together with their\ninstructions), will be made available by the depositary to all US holders registered with the depositary, and are also generally\navailable from the US Internal Revenue Service.\nThe withholding tax refund, if any, ordinarily is paid within 12 months of filing the applicable French Treasury Form, but not before\nJanuary 15 of the year following the calendar year in which the related dividend is paid.\nTax on sale or other disposition\nIn general, under the Treaty, a US holder who is a US resident for purposes of the Treaty will not be subject to French tax on any\ncapital gain from the redemption (other than redemption proceeds characterized as dividends under French domestic law), sale\nor exchange of ordinary shares or ADSs unless the ordinary shares or the ADSs form part of the business property of a permanent\nestablishment or fixed base that the US holder has in France. Special rules apply to holders who are residents of more than\none country.\nUS Taxes\nTaxation of dividends\nFor US federal income tax purposes, the gross amount of any distribution paid to US holders (that is, the net distribution received\nplus any tax withheld therefrom) will be treated as ordinary dividend income to the extent paid or deemed paid out of the current\nor accumulated earnings and profits of Sanofi (as determined under US federal income tax principles). Dividends paid by Sanofi\nwill not be eligible for the dividends-received deduction generally allowed to corporate US holders.\nSubject to certain exceptions for short-term and hedged positions, the US dollar amount of dividends received by an individual\nUS holder with respect to the ADSs or our ordinary shares is currently subject to taxation at a maximum rate of 20% if the\ndividends are “qualified dividends”. Dividends paid on the ordinary shares or ADSs will be treated as qualified dividends if (i) the\nissuer is eligible for the benefits of a comprehensive income tax treaty with the United States that the Internal Revenue Service\nhas approved for the purposes of the qualified dividend rules and (ii) the issuer was not, in the year prior to the year in which the\ndividend was paid, and is not, in the year in which the dividend is paid, a passive foreign investment company (PFIC). The Treaty\n158 SANOFI FORM 20-F 2023\nPART I\nITEM 10. Additional information\nhas been approved for the purposes of the qualified dividend rules. Based on our financial statements and relevant market and\nshareholder data, we believe Sanofi was not a PFIC for US federal income tax purposes with respect to its 2023 taxable year. In\naddition, based on its current expectations regarding the value and nature of its assets, the sources and nature of its income, and\nrelevant market and shareholder data, we do not anticipate that Sanofi will become a PFIC for its 2024 taxable year. Holders of\nordinary shares and ADSs should consult their own tax advisers regarding the availability of the reduced dividend tax rate in\nlight of their own particular circumstances.\nIf you are a US holder, dividend income received by you with respect to ADSs or ordinary shares generally will be treated as\nforeign source income for foreign tax credit purposes. The limitation on foreign taxes eligible for credit is calculated separately\nwith respect to specific classes of income. Distributions out of earnings and profits with respect to the ADSs or ordinary shares\ngenerally will be treated as “passive category” income (or, in the case of certain US holders, “general category” income). Subject\nto certain limitations, French income tax withheld in connection with any distribution with respect to the ADSs or ordinary shares\nmay be claimed as a credit against the US federal income tax liability of a US holder if such US holder elects for that year to\ncredit all foreign income taxes. Alternatively, such French withholding tax may be taken as a deduction against taxable income.\nForeign tax credits will not be allowed for withholding taxes imposed in respect of certain short-term or hedged positions in\nSecurities and may not be allowed in respect of certain arrangements in which a US holder’s expected economic profit is\ninsubstantial. Further, recently issued Treasury regulations that apply to taxes paid or accrued in taxable years beginning on or\nafter December 28, 2021 impose additional requirements for foreign taxes to be eligible for a foreign tax credit, and there can be\nno assurance that those requirements will be satisfied. The IRS has indicated that taxpayers may defer the application of many of\nthe additional requirements until further notice. The US federal income tax rules governing the availability and computation of\nforeign tax credits are complex. US holders should consult their own tax advisers concerning the implications of these rules in\nlight of their particular circumstances.\nTo the extent that an amount received by a US holder exceeds the allocable share of our current and accumulated earnings and\nprofits, such excess will be applied first to reduce such US holder’s tax basis in its ordinary shares or ADSs and then, to the extent\nit exceeds the US holder’s tax basis, it will constitute capital gain from a deemed sale or exchange of such ordinary shares or ADSs\n(see “— Tax on Sale or Other Disposition”, below).\nThe amount of any distribution paid in euros will be equal to the US dollar value of the euro amount distributed, calculated by\nreference to the exchange rate in effect on the date the dividend is received by a US holder of ordinary shares (or by the\ndepositary, in the case of ADSs) regardless of whether the payment is in fact converted into US dollars on such date. US holders\nshould consult their own tax advisers regarding the treatment of foreign currency gain or loss, if any, on any euros received by a\nUS holder that are converted into US dollars on a date subsequent to receipt.\nDistributions to holders of additional ordinary shares (or ADSs) with respect to their ordinary shares (or ADSs) that are made as\npart of a pro rata distribution to all ordinary shareholders generally will not be subject to US federal income tax. However, if a\nUS holder has the option to receive a distribution in shares (or ADSs) or to receive cash in lieu of such shares (or ADSs), the\ndistribution of shares (or ADSs) will be taxable as if the holder had received an amount equal to the fair market value of the\ndistributed shares (or ADSs), and such holder’s tax basis in the distributed shares (or ADSs) will be equal to such amount.\nTax on sale or other disposition\nIn general, for US federal income tax purposes, a US holder that sells, exchanges or otherwise disposes of its ordinary shares\nor ADSs will recognize capital gain or loss in an amount equal to the US dollar value of the difference between the amount realized\nfor the ordinary shares or ADSs and the US holder’s adjusted tax basis (determined in US dollars and under US federal income tax\nrules) in the ordinary shares or ADSs. Such gain or loss generally will be US-source gain or loss, and will be treated as long-term\ncapital gain or loss if the US holder’s holding period in the ordinary shares or ADSs exceeds one year at the time of disposition. If\nthe US holder is an individual, any capital gain generally will be subject to US federal income tax at preferential rates (currently a\nmaximum of 20%) if specified minimum holding periods are met. The deductibility of capital losses is subject to significant\nlimitations.\nMedicare tax\nCertain US holders who are individuals, estates or trusts are required to pay a Medicare tax of 3.8% (in addition to taxes they\nwould otherwise be subject to) on their “net investment income” which would include, among other things, dividends and capital\ngains from the ordinary shares and ADSs.\nSANOFI FORM 20-F 2023 159\nPART I\nITEM 10.

Where it is not possible to manage those risks centrally – in\nparticular due to regulatory restrictions (such as foreign exchange controls) or local tax restrictions – credit facilities and/or\ncurrency lines, guaranteed whenever necessary by the parent company, are contracted by our subsidiaries locally with banks,\nunder the supervision of the central treasury team.\nOur financing and investment strategies, and our interest rate and currency hedging strategies, are reviewed monthly by the\nGroup Finance Department.\nOur policy prohibits the use of derivatives for speculative purposes.\nCounterparty risk\nOur financing and investing transactions, and our currency and interest rate hedges, are contracted with leading counterparties.\nWe set limits for investment and derivative transactions with individual financial institutions, depending on the rating of each\ninstitution. Compliance with these limits, which are based on the notional amounts of the investments and the fair value of the\nhedging instruments, is monitored on a daily basis.\nThe table below shows our total exposure as of December 31, 2023 by rating and in terms of our percentage exposure to the\ndominant counterparty.\nCash and cash Notional Notional General\nequivalents amounts of Fair value of amounts of Fair value of corporate\n(excluding mutual currency currency interest rate interest rate purpose\n(€ million) funds) (a) hedges (b) hedges hedges (b) hedges credit facilities\nAA 318 1,050 (6) 45 — 500\nAA- 663 7,277 11 1,165 (47) 1,000\nA+ 728 12,403 43 1,145 (65) 3,500\nA 246 5,676 19 673 (27) 2,500\nA- 20 1,283 8 377 (25) 500\nBBB+ — — — — — —\nUnallocated 324 — — — — —\nTotal 2,299 27,689 75 3,405 (165) 8,000\n%/rating of dominant counterparty 26.2%/AA- 14.9%/A+ 19.3%/AA- 6%/A\n(a) Cash equivalents include mutual fund investments of €5,321 million.\n(b) The notional amounts are translated into euros at the relevant closing exchange rate as of December 31, 2023.\nAs of December 31, 2023, we held investments in euro and US dollar denominated money-market mutual funds.

Quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk\nForeign exchange risk\nA. Operating foreign exchange risk\nA substantial portion of our net sales is generated in countries where the euro, which is our reporting currency, is not the\nfunctional currency. In 2023, for example, 43.0% of our net sales were generated in the United States; 24.1% in Europe; and 32.9%\nin the Rest of the World region (see the definition in “Item 5. Operating and Financial Review and Prospects — A/ Operating\nresults), including countries that are, or may in the future become, subject to exchange controls, of which 6.8% was generated in\nChina and 3.7% in Japan. Although we also incur expenses in those countries, the impact of those expenses is not enough wholly\nto offset the impact of exchange rates on our net sales. Consequently, our operating income may be materially affected by\nfluctuations in exchange rates between the euro and other currencies. Sanofi operates a foreign exchange risk hedging policy to\nreduce the exposure of operating income to exchange rate movements. That policy involves regular assessments of Sanofi’s\nworldwide foreign currency exposure, based on foreign currency transactions carried out by the parent company and its\nsubsidiaries. Those transactions mainly comprise sales, purchases, research costs, co-marketing and co-promotion expenses, and\nroyalties. To reduce the exposure of those transactions to exchange rate movements, Sanofi contracts hedges using liquid\nderivative instruments, mainly forward currency purchases and sales, and also foreign exchange swaps.\nThe table below shows operating currency hedging instruments in place as of December 31, 2023, with the notional amount\ntranslated into euros at the relevant closing exchange rate (see Note D.20. to the consolidated financial statements for the\naccounting classification of those instruments as of December 31, 2023).\nOperating foreign exchange derivatives as of December 31, 2023\n(€ million) Notional amount Fair value\nForward currency sales 6,112 30\nof which US dollar 2,981 35\nof which Chinese yuan renminbi 788 7\nof which Singapore dollar 419 (1)\nof which Japanese yen 339 (6)\nof which Korean won 192 (4)\nForward currency purchases 4,246 (8)\nof which US dollar 2,022 (12)\nof which Singapore dollar 876 —\nof which Chinese yuan renminbi 364 (1)\nof which Korean won 137 2\nof which Japanese yen 123 1\nTotal 10,358 22\nThe above positions mainly hedge future material foreign-currency cash flows arising after the end of the reporting period in\nrelation to transactions carried out during the year ended December 31, 2023 and recognized in the balance sheet at that date.\nGains and losses on hedging instruments (forward contracts) are calculated and recognized in parallel with the recognition of\ngains and losses on the hedged items. Due to this hedging relationship, the commercial foreign exchange profit or loss on these\nitems (hedging instruments and hedged transactions) was immaterial in 2023.\nB. Financial foreign exchange risk\nThe cash pooling arrangements for foreign subsidiaries outside the euro zone, and some of Sanofi’s financing activities, expose\ncertain Sanofi entities to financial foreign exchange risk (i.e. the risk of changes in the value of borrowings and loans denominated\nin a currency other than the functional currency of the borrower or lender). That foreign exchange exposure is hedged using\nderivative instruments (foreign exchange swaps, forward contracts or currency swaps) that alter the currency split of Sanofi’s net\ndebt once those instruments are taken into account.\nThe table below shows financial currency hedging instruments in place as of December 31, 2023, with the notional amounts\ntranslated into euros at the relevant closing exchange rate (see also Note D.20. to the consolidated financial statements for the\naccounting classification of these instruments as of December 31, 2023).\n162 SANOFI FORM 20-F 2023\nPART I\nITEM 11.

As of\nDecember 31, 2023, the fair value of these forward contracts represented an asset of €54 million; the opposite entry was recognized in “Other\ncomprehensive income,\" with the impact on financial income and expense being immaterial.\n(b) Includes forward purchases with a notional amount of $1,000 million expiring in 2024, designated as a fair value hedge of the exposure of $1,000 million\nof bond issues to fluctuations in the EUR/USD spot rate. As of December 31, 2023, the fair value of the contracts represented a liability of €31 million, the\nopposite entry for €2.7 million of which was credited to \"Other comprehensive income\" under the cost of hedging accounting treatment.\n(c) Includes forward purchases with a notional amount of $1,044 million expiring in 2024, designated as a fair value hedge of the exposure of $1,044 million\nof commercial paper. As of December 31, 2023, the fair value of these forward contracts swaps represented a liability of €3 million, the opposite entry\nfor €0.7 million of which was credited to \"Other comprehensive income\" under the cost of hedging accounting treatment.\nThese hedging instruments generate a net financial gain or loss arising from the interest rate differential between the hedged\ncurrency and the euro, given that the foreign exchange gain or loss on the foreign-currency borrowing and loans is offset by the\nchange in the intrinsic value of the hedging instruments. The interest rate differential is recognized within cost of net debt\n(see Note D.29. to our consolidated financial statements). We may also hedge some future foreign-currency investment or\ndivestment cash flows.\nC. Other foreign exchange risks\nA significant proportion of our net assets is denominated in US dollars (see Note D.35. to the consolidated financial statements).\nAs a result, any fluctuation in the exchange rate of the US dollar against the euro automatically impacts the amount of our equity\nas expressed in euros.\nIn addition, we use the euro as our reporting currency. Consequently, if one or more European Union Member States were to\nabandon the euro as a currency, the resulting economic upheavals – in particular, fluctuations in exchange rates – could have a\nsignificant impact on the terms under which we can obtain financing and on our financial results, the extent and consequences of\nwhich are not currently foreseeable.\nLiquidity risk\nWe operate a centralized treasury platform whereby all surplus cash and financing needs of our subsidiaries are invested with or\nfunded by the parent company (where permitted by local legislation). The central treasury department manages our current and\nprojected financing, and ensures that Sanofi is able to meet its financial commitments by maintaining sufficient cash and\nconfirmed credit facilities for the size of our operations and the maturity of our debt (see Notes D.17.1.c. and D.17.1.g. to the\nconsolidated financial statements).\nWe diversify our short-term investments with leading counterparties using money-market products with instant access or with a\nmaturity of less than three months.\nAs of December 31, 2023, cash and cash equivalents amounted to €8,710 million, and short-term investments predominantly\ncomprised:\n• collective investments in euro and US dollar denominated money-market mutual funds. All such funds can be traded on a\ndaily basis and the amount invested in each fund may not exceed 10% of the aggregate amount invested in such funds; and\n• amounts invested directly with banks and non-financial institutions in the form of instant access deposits, term deposits, and\nNegotiable European Commercial Paper with a maturity of no more than three months.\nAs of December 31, 2023 we also had €8 billion of undrawn general corporate purpose confirmed credit facilities, half of which\nexpires in December 2027 and half in March 2029. Those credit facilities are not subject to financial covenant ratios.\nOur policy is to diversify our sources of funding through public or private issuances of debt securities, in the United States (shelf\nregistration statement) and Europe (Euro Medium Term Note program). In addition, our A-1+/P-1 short-term rating gives us access\nto commercial paper programs in the United States, and to Negotiable European Commercial Paper programs in France. The\naverage maturity of our total debt was 4.45 years as of December 31, 2023, compared with 4.71 years as of December 31, 2022.\nAverage drawdowns under the Negotiable European commercial paper program during 2023 were €0.2 billion (with a maximum\nof €0.8 billion); the average maturity of those drawdowns was three months. As of December 31, 2023, drawdowns under the\nprogram amounted to €40 million.\nSANOFI FORM 20-F 2023 163\nPART I\nITEM 11.

As of December 31, 2023, drawdowns under the program amounted\nto €0.9 billion.\nIn the event of a liquidity crisis, we could be exposed to difficulties in calling up our available cash, a scarcity of sources of funding\nincluding the above-mentioned programs, and/or a deterioration in their terms. This situation could damage our capacity to\nrefinance our debt or to issue new debt on reasonable terms.\nInterest rate risk\nSanofi issues debt in two currencies, the euro and the US dollar, and also invests its cash and cash equivalents in those currencies.\nSanofi also operates cash pooling arrangements to manage the surplus cash and short-term liquidity needs of foreign subsidiaries\nlocated outside the euro zone.\nTo optimize the cost of debt or reduce the volatility of debt and manage its exposure to financial foreign exchange risk, Sanofi\nuses derivative instruments (interest rate swaps, currency swaps, foreign exchange swaps and forward contracts) that alter the\nfixed/floating rate split and the currency split of its net debt.\nThe projected full-year sensitivity to interest rate fluctuations of our debt, net of cash and cash equivalents for 2024 is as follows:\nImpact on pre-tax\nincome/(expense)\nImpact on pre-tax recognized directly\nnet income in equity\nChange in short-term interest rates (€ million) (€ million)\n+100 bp 48 —\n+25 bp 12 —\n-25 bp (12) —\n-100 bp (48) —\nStock market risk\nIt is our policy not to trade on the stock market for speculative purposes.\n164 SANOFI FORM 20-F 2023\nPART I\nITEM 12.

Pursuant to a letter agreement dated October 4, 2022 (the “letter\nagreement”), JPMorgan as our ADS depositary has agreed to make (i) an initial contribution to Sanofi, within 30 days of the\ncommencement date of the letter agreement and (ii) with respect to each 12-month period beginning on the anniversary of the\neffective date of the agreement (each such 12-month period, a “Contract Year”), a contribution, paid at the end of such Contract\nYear quarter, equal to the aggregate of the program share (equal to 100% of routine program revenues and 50% of non-routine\nprogram revenues) of any program revenues, less the aggregate of any program costs for the applicable Contract Year and any\ninvoiced supplementary costs not paid within 60 days of the date of the applicable invoice.\nTo the extent in any given Contract Year the depositary does not collect/recoup the entirety of the program costs and unpaid\nsupplementary costs, no contribution shall be payable to Sanofi and such excess will, at the discretion of the depositary, either be\ndeducted from future contributions or be payable to the depositary by Sanofi promptly upon invoicing as supplementary costs\nunder the letter agreement.\nJPMorgan has further agreed to waive the $0.05 per ADS issuance fees that would normally be owed by Sanofi in connection\nwith our deposits of shares as part of our employee stock purchase plans. Sanofi is responsible for reimbursing JPMorgan for all\ntaxes and governmental charges in connection with payments to JPMorgan under the letter agreement.\nFrom January 1, 2023 to December 31, 2023, we received a total amount of $24,020,797.28 from JPMorgan pursuant to the letter\nagreement.\n166 SANOFI FORM 20-F 2023\nPART II\nITEM 13.

Report of Management on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting.\nManagement of the Company is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial\nreporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f). Management assessed the effectiveness of internal\ncontrol over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023 based on the framework in “Internal Control — Integrated\nFramework” (2013 framework) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).\nQunol (QRIB Intermediate Holdings, LLC and its affiliates) that was acquired in 2023 has been excluded from the scope of\nmanagement’s assessment and conclusion on internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023. Qunol (QRIB\nIntermediate Holdings, LLC and its affiliates) is included in the 2023 consolidated financial statements of the Company and\nrepresents less than 1% of total assets as of December 31, 2023 and less than 1% of net sales for the year then ended.\nBased on that assessment, management has concluded that the Company’s internal control over financial reporting was\neffective as of December 31, 2023 to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of its financial reporting and the\npreparation of its financial statements for external purposes, in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.\nDue to its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements, and can only\nprovide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements. Also,\nprojections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate\nbecause of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nThe effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers\nAudit (PCAOB ID 1347) and Ernst & Young et Autres (PCAOB ID 1704) independent registered public accounting firms, as\nstated in their report on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023, which is included\nherein.

Audit Committee Financial Expert\nThe Audit Committee is composed of Fabienne Lecorvaisier, Christophe Babule, Carole Ferrand and Diane Souza.\nOur Board of Directors has determined that all directors are independent financial experts within the meaning of Section 407 of\nthe Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002.\nThe Board of Directors deemed Fabienne Lecorvaisier to be a financial expert based on her education and experience in\ncorporate finance in various international banks and as Chief Financial Officer of Essilor and Air Liquide. She is now Executive Vice\nPresident, in charge of Sustainable Development, Public and International Affairs as well as the supervision of the Social Programs\nand the General Secretariat of Air Liquide Group.\nThe Board of Directors deemed Christophe Babule to be a financial expert based on his education and experience in audit and\ncorporate finance in major corporations and as Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of L’Oréal. He has also served\nas a director of L’Oréal US Inc.\nThe Board of Directors deemed Carole Ferrand to be a financial expert based on her education and experience in audit at\nPricewaterhouseCoopers and as Chief Financial Officer of Sony France, EuropaCorp and Groupe Artémis. She was Chief Financial\nOfficer of Capgemini until end of 2023.\nThe Board of Directors deemed Diane Souza to be a financial expert based on her education (she is a certified public accountant)\nand experience in audit and tax in major international corporations, as Chief Financial Officer of Aetna’s Guaranteed Products\nbusiness, and as Chief Executive Officer of the UnitedHealthcare Specialty Benefits.\nThe Board of Directors has determined that all four directors meet the independence criteria of US Securities and Exchange\nCommission Rule 10A-3, although only Fabienne Lecorvaisier, Carole Ferrand and Diane Souza meet the French AFEP-MEDEF\nCode criteria of independence applied by the Board of Directors for general corporate governance purposes\n(see Item 16G., below).\nItem 16B.

Then, the Company was authorized to repurchase up to €18,912,535,950 of shares for a period of\neighteen months (i.e. through November 25, 2024) by the Annual Shareholders’ Meeting held on May 25, 2023.\n(b) Million of euros.\nFor more information see “Exhibit 2.2. \"Description of Securities\" of this annual report”.\nItem 16F. Change in Registrant’s Certifying Accountant\nThe term of office of Ernst & Young et Autres, joint statutory auditor of the Company since 1986, will expire at the end of the\nAnnual Shareholders’ Meeting called in 2024. Ernst & Young et Autres’ term of office cannot be extended because it reached the\nmaximum legal duration.\nThe selection procedure of the auditors to be appointed by the Annual Shareholders’ Meeting in 2024 was overseen by the Audit\nCommittee, following which a recommendation to the Board of Directors was issued.\nThe Board of Directors, at its meeting of October 27, 2022 approved the Audit Committee’s recommendation and decided to\npropose the appointment of Mazars as statutory auditor. Consequently, the Board of Directors will propose to the Annual\nShareholders’ Meeting to be held in 2024 to appoint Mazars as new joint statutory auditor for a 6-year term, i.e. until the Annual\nShareholders’ Meeting to be held in 2030, which will approve the financial statements for the year 2029.\nThe report of Ernst & Young et Autres on the consolidated financial statements for each of the years ended December 31, 2023\nand 2022 did not contain an adverse opinion or a disclaimer of opinion and was not qualified or modified as to uncertainty, audit\nscope or accounting principles. During each of the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022:\n• there were no “disagreements” (as that term is described in Item 16F.(a)(1)(iv) of the Instructions to Form 20-F and the\ninstructions to Item 16F.) between Sanofi and Ernst & Young et Autres on any matters of accounting principles or practices,\nfinancial statement disclosure, or auditing scope or procedures, which disagreement(s), if not resolved to Ernst & Young et\nAutres’ satisfaction, would have caused Ernst & Young et Autres to make reference to the subject matter of the\ndisagreement(s) in connection with its report; and\n• there were no “reportable events” (as that term is defined in Item 16F.(a)(1)(v) of the Instructions to Form 20-F).\nA copy of Ernst & Young et Autres’ letter, dated February 23, 2024, is filed as Exhibit 15.3 to this annual report.\nItem 16G. Corporate Governance\nSanofi is incorporated under the laws of France, with securities listed on regulated public markets in the United States (Nasdaq\nGlobal Select Market – NASDAQ) and France (Euronext Paris). Consequently, as described further in this annual report, our\ncorporate governance framework reflects the mandatory provisions of French corporate law, the securities laws and regulations\nof France and the United States and the rules of the aforementioned public markets.\nAs a “foreign private issuer,” as defined in the rules promulgated under the US Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, (the\n“Exchange Act”), Sanofi is permitted, pursuant to NASDAQ Listing Rule 5615(a)(3), to follow its home country practice in lieu of\ncertain NASDAQ corporate governance requirements applicable to US corporations listed on the NASDAQ. Sanofi has informed\nNASDAQ that it intends to follow corporate governance standards under French law to the extent permitted by the NASDAQ\nlisting rules and US securities laws, as further discussed below.\nWe generally follow the “AFEP-MEDEF” corporate governance recommendations for French listed issuers (hereafter referred to\nas the “AFEP-MEDEF Code”). As a result, our corporate governance framework is similar in many respects to, and provides\ninvestor protections that are comparable to – or in some cases, more stringent than – the corresponding rules of the NASDAQ.\nNevertheless, there are certain important differences.\nSANOFI FORM 20-F 2023 169\nPART II\nItem 16G. Corporate Governance\nIn line with NASDAQ listing rules applicable to domestic issuers, a majority of Sanofi’s Board of Directors is comprised of\nindependent directors. Sanofi evaluates the independence of members of our Board of Directors using the standards of the\nFrench AFEP-MEDEF Code as the principal reference. We believe that AFEP-MEDEF’s overarching criteria for independence –\nthat Board members have no relationship of any kind whatsoever with the Company, its group or the management of either such\nas to color a Board member’s judgment – is on the whole consistent with the goals of the NASDAQ's listing rules; however, the\nspecific tests proposed under the two standards may vary on some points. Our Audit Committee complies with\nthe independence and other requirements of Rule 10A-3 under the Exchange Act, adopted pursuant to the Sarbanes-Oxley\nAct of 2002. Our Audit Committee includes one member, Christophe Babule, who is considered non-independent under the\nAFEP-MEDEF Code, and which is permitted under the AFEP-MEDEF Code. Three out of the four members of our Compensation\nCommittee meet the independence standards of the AFEP-MEDEF Code (the Director representing employees is not considered\nas independent) and the independence requirements of NASDAQ’s listing rules.\nSanofi follows the recommendation of the AFEP-MEDEF Code that at least one meeting of the Board of Directors not attended\nby the company’s executive officers be organized each year. Accordingly, Sanofi’s Board Charter provides that the Board of\nDirectors shall organize at least two meetings a year without its executive officers, thereby providing the Chairman with the\noption of whether to include directors representing employees or any other Group employee, as the case may require, depending\non the agenda of the meeting. Sanofi’s practice in that respect departs from NASDAQ Listing Rule 5605(b)(2), which provides\nthat independent directors must have regularly scheduled meetings at which only independent directors are present.\nUnder French law, the committees of our Board of Directors are advisory only, and where the NASDAQ Listing Rule 5600 series\nwould vest certain decision-making powers with specific committees by delegation (e.g. the appointment of Sanofi’s auditors by\nthe Audit Committee), under French law, our Board of Directors remains the only competent body to take such decisions, albeit\ntaking into account the recommendation of the relevant committees. Additionally, under French corporate law, it is the\nshareholders of Sanofi voting at the Shareholders’ General Meeting that have the authority to appoint our auditors upon\nconsideration of the proposal of our Board of Directors, although our Board Charter provides that the Board of Directors will\nmake its proposal on the basis of the recommendation of our Audit Committee. We believe that this requirement of French law,\ntogether with the additional legal requirement that two sets of statutory auditors be appointed, is in line with the NASDAQ's\nunderlying goal of ensuring that the audit of our accounts be conducted by auditors independent from company management.\nNASDAQ Listing Rule 5635 requires a NASDAQ listed company to obtain shareholder approval prior to certain issuances of\nsecurities, including: (a) issuances in connection with the acquisition of the stock or assets of another company if upon issuance\nthe issued shares will equal 20% or more of the number of shares or voting power outstanding prior to the issuance, or if certain\nspecified persons have a 5% or greater interest in the assets or company to be acquired (NASDAQ Listing Rule 5635(a));\n(b) issuances or potential issuances that will result in a change of control of us (NASDAQ Listing Rule 5635(b)); (c) issuances in\nconnection with equity compensation arrangements (NASDAQ Listing Rule 5635(c)); and (d) 20% or greater issuances in\ntransactions other than public offerings, as defined in the NASDAQ listing rules (NASDAQ Listing Rule 5635(d)). Under French law,\nour shareholders may approve issuances of equity, as a general matter, through the adoption of delegation of authority\nresolutions at the Company’s shareholders’ meeting pursuant to which shareholders may delegate their authority to the Board of\nDirectors to increase the Company’s share capital within specified parameters set by the shareholders, which may include a time\nlimitation to carry out the share capital increase, the cancellation of their preferential subscription rights to the benefit of named\npersons or a category of persons, specified price limitations and/or specific or aggregate limitations on the size of the share\ncapital increase. Due to differences between French law and corporate governance practices and NASDAQ Listing Rule 5635,\nthe Company follows French home country practice, rather than complying with this NASDAQ Listing Rule.\nIn addition to the oversight role of our Compensation Committee for questions of management compensation including by way\nof equity, under French law any option or restricted share plans or other share capital increases, whether for the benefit of senior\nmanagement or employees, may only be adopted by the Board of Directors pursuant to and within the limits of a shareholder\nresolution approving the related capital increase and delegating to the Board the authority to implement such operations. While\nNASDAQ rules require shareholder approval when a plan or other equity compensation arrangement is established or materially\namended, under French law our shareholders must decide any issuance of equity, as a general matter. We intend to follow our\nFrench home country practice and ask our shareholders to delegate their authority to issue incentive equity and define the final\nterms of any equity compensation plan or arrangements to our Board of Directors. We may, from time to time, ask for our\nshareholders’ subsequent approval on an equity compensation arrangement in order to obtain advantageous tax treatment or\notherwise. In addition, under French law, our Board of Directors must obtain the prior approval of our shareholders before\nestablishing or amending a plan or arrangement that would exceed the limits of the granted delegation.\nAs described above, a number of issues, which could be resolved directly by a board or its committees in the United States,\nrequire the additional protection of direct shareholder consultation in France.\nBecause we are a “foreign private issuer” as described above, our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer issue the\ncertifications required by Section 302 and Section 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 on an annual basis (with the filing of\nour annual report) rather than on a quarterly basis as would be the case of a US corporation filing quarterly reports on Form 10- Q.\nFrench corporate law provides that the Board of Directors must vote to approve a broadly defined range of transactions that\ncould potentially create conflicts of interest between Sanofi on the one hand and its directors and Chief Executive Officer on the\nother hand, which are then presented to shareholders for approval at the next annual meeting. This legal safeguard operates in\nplace of certain provisions of the NASDAQ listing rules.\n170 SANOFI FORM 20-F 2023\nPART II\nITEM 16G. Corporate Governance\nSanofi is governed by the French Commercial Code, which provides that an ordinary general meeting of the shareholders may\nvalidly deliberate when first convened if the shareholders present or represented hold at least one-fifth of the voting shares.\nIf it is reconvened, no quorum is required. The French Commercial Code further provides that the shareholders at an\nextraordinary general meeting may validly deliberate when first convened only if the shareholders present or represented hold at\nleast one-quarter of the voting shares and, if reconvened, one-fifth of the voting shares. Therefore, Sanofi will not follow\nNASDAQ Listing Rule 5620(c), which provides that the minimum quorum requirement for a meeting of shareholders is 331⁄ % of\n3\nthe outstanding common voting shares of the company. In accordance with the provisions of the French Commercial Code, the\nrequired majority for the adoption of a decision is a simple majority (for an ordinary general meeting of the shareholders) or a\ntwo-thirds majority (for an extraordinary general meeting) of the votes cast by the shareholders present or represented.\nThe Company has, pursuant to Rule 10D-1 under the Exchange Act, introduced a recovery policy for compensation erroneously\npaid to “executive officers” (as defined in Rule 10D-1(d) under the Exchange Act) based in whole or in part on any financial\nreporting measures pursuant to the applicable NASDAQ listing rules, Rule 10D-1 under the Exchange Act and applicable\ninterpretive guidance. For more information concerning our recovery policy for compensation erroneously paid to “executive\nofficers”, see also “Item 6. Directors, Senior Management and Employees – B. Compensations”. Our recovery policy for\ncompensation erroneously paid to “executive officers” is reproduced in full as Exhibit 97 to this annual report.\nItem 16H. Mine Safety Disclosure\nN/A\nItem 16I. Disclosure regarding foreign jurisdictions that prevent\ninspections\nN/A\nItem 16J. Insider Trading Policies\nPursuant to applicable SEC transition guidance, the disclosure required by Item 16J will be applicable to Sanofi starting the fiscal\nyear ending December 31, 2024.\nItem 16K. Cybersecurity\nRisk Management and Strategy\nSanofi has implemented a cybersecurity strategy involving various dedicated personnel and resources aimed at preventing,\ndetecting and responding to cyberattacks, as well as being able to recover promptly in the event of material impact following a\ncyberattack. Additionally, Sanofi has set up various cybersecurity processes applicable to subsidiaries within Sanofi group. Sanofi\nregularly updates its cybersecurity processes to address cybersecurity trends and threats. Cybersecurity processes have been\nestablished to address material cybersecurity risks, including in connection with the following areas:\n• information technology and solution usage;\n• access control;\n• patch management;\n• security on specific environments (i.e. cloud, virtualization, SAP, automated systems, IoT, etc.);\n• log management;\n• network security;\n• systems security standards;\n• remote access;\n• secure development of applications;\n• cryptography;\n• mobile devices;\n• third-party management (including cybersecurity requirements in contracts); and\n• incident management.\nSanofi utilizes security standards and frameworks (i.e. the NIST framework) and has established cross-functional risk control\ncapabilities to facilitate operational implementation aligned with its cybersecurity processes.\nSANOFI FORM 20-F 2023 171\nPART II\nItem 16K. Cybersecurity\nSanofi regularly analyses its Internet-based services and performs regular penetration tests and attack simulations to assess the\nprotections and the detections capabilities. The cybersecurity compliance status of computing assets connected to Sanofi’s\nnetwork is routinely consolidated for Sanofi's business units, including within manufacturing, and research and development sites.\nMonthly dashboards are published and shared within Sanofi’s different business units and global functions. Sanofi implements\ncorrective measures and improvement actions in response to these processes. Data classification and protection tools are in\nplace, such as the implementation of a specific process and technology aimed at detecting and responding to abnormal data\nflows.\nSanofi has set up a cybersecurity operation center in charge of detecting and responding to cybersecurity threats and attacks, as\nwell as orchestrating Sanofi-wide incident responses. Incident response trainings and simulations are run within Sanofi to be\nbetter prepared in case of a cybersecurity incident. In addition, Sanofi’s employees, who are the main users of Sanofi’s digital\nassets, are regularly trained to face cybersecurity threats and attacks. In the event of a cyberattack, Sanofi has established a plan\nthat includes criteria triggering the notification process for material cybersecurity incidents including from the cybersecurity\noperation center and the Chief Information Security Officer who can use the internal escalation channels to inform the\nmanagement and the Board of Directors and, as appropriate, the relevant regulatory bodies.\nWhen dealing with third parties, our main commercial contracts include cybersecurity clauses aimed at ensuring such third\nparties comply with Sanofi’s cybersecurity rules and requirements, especially when providing services to and processing data\nfrom Sanofi. Additionally, Sanofi set up a vendor’s risk assessment program to evaluate the digital maturity of a vendor, which\ncovers their business continuity as well as their related internal regulations, such as data privacy. As part of their contractual\ncommitments major vendors and partners must report to Sanofi any cybersecurity incident which may have a significant impact\nfor Sanofi. A dedicated process has been implemented for third parties’ networks interconnected with Sanofi’s network, aimed at\nlimiting any propagation of a cyberattack to Sanofi’s digital assets.\nSanofi’s cybersecurity risk management processes are integrated into its overall risk management system through its enterprise\nrisk management process, which seeks to identify and address material risks to the organization. Each year, specific risk\ncommittees identify the risks that affect Sanofi’s local businesses in each country it operates and Sanofi’s global functions, such\nas Research and Development or Manufacturing and Supply.\nAlthough Sanofi has put in place the cybersecurity processes described above, Sanofi remains exposed to cybersecurity attacks\nand incidents and misuse or manipulation of any of its IT systems, which could have a material adverse affect on its business\nstrategy, results of operations or financial condition (see “Item 3. Key Information — D. Risk Factors — Risks relating to our\nbusiness — Breaches of data security, disruptions of information technology systems and cyber threats could result in financial,\nlegal, business or reputational harm”).\nGovernance\nSanofi has appointed a Chief Information Security Officer who oversees Sanofi's information, cybersecurity, and technology\nsecurity. Our current Chief Information Security Officer has been working for Sanofi in this capacity since 2014 and has seventeen\nyears of experience in the cybersecurity industry, including eight years as the global head of cybersecurity at one of France’s\nlargest telecommunications companies. The Chief Information Security Officer is informed about and monitors the prevention,\ndetection, mitigation, and remediation of cybersecurity incidents through the cybersecurity operation center. He develops\nappropriate plans to mitigate such risks. Such plans are validated by the Chief Digital Officer and shared with the Executive\nCommittee.\nThe Chief Information Security Officer belongs to the digital division and directly reports to the Chief Digital Officer, a member of\nthe Executive Committee. In addition, the Chief Information Security Officer is a permanent member of the group Risk\nCommittee and reports on the cybersecurity risk to such group Risk Committee, to the Audit Committee and to the Executive\nCommittee regularly. The reporting covers various matters, such as the outcomes of audits on Sanofi’s information systems, the\nmain incidents encountered over the preceding period, Sanofi’s digital transformation or the cybersecurity strategy and\nframework for the coming years.\nThe group Risk Committee, comprised of the managers of Sanofi’s global business units, consolidates the risks identified by the\nspecific committees and targets the high priority risks Sanofi is facing. The group Risk Committee then allocates each risk to the\nrelevant Executive Committee member (i.e. the cybersecurity risk is allocated to the Chief Digital Officer as the relevant member\nof the Executive Committee, who manages the mitigation of such risk with the Chief Information Security Officer) and reports\nregularly to the Audit Committee. Following this identification and allocation process, the group Risk Committee reports on a\nquarterly basis to the Executive Committee on the progress of the mitigation plans.\nThe Audit Committee controls that the cybersecurity risks are well managed and reports on such management to the Board of\nDirectors. The Board of Directors is also informed of such risks, as well as other cybersecurity matters, through periodic reports\nfrom the Chief Digital Officer, the Head of the group Risk Committee, or the Chief Information Security Officer.\n172 SANOFI FORM 20-F 2023\nPART III\nITEM 17.

Those standards require that we plan and perform the\naudit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement,\nwhether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the\nconsolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such\nprocedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial\nstatements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management,\nas well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a\nreasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matters\nThe critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial\nstatements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or\ndisclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective or\ncomplex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated\nfinancial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate\nopinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.\nSANOFI FORM 20-F 2023 175\n2023 CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firms\nRecoverable amount of other intangible assets\nDescription Other intangible assets amounted to €24,319 million at December 31, 2023. Management recognized a net loss of €932 million\nof the Matter relating to impairment charges and reversals for the year ended December 31, 2023. As described in Notes B.6.1., D.4. and D.5. to\nthe consolidated financial statements, other intangible assets not yet available for use are tested for impairment annually and\nwhenever events or circumstances indicate that impairment might exist. Other intangible assets that generate separate cash flows\nand assets included in cash-generating units (CGUs) are assessed for impairment when events or changes in circumstances\nindicate that the asset or CGU may be impaired. Management estimates the recoverable amount of the asset and recognizes an\nimpairment loss if the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its recoverable amount. The recoverable amount of the asset is the\nhigher of its fair value less costs to sell or its value in use. Value in use is determined by management using estimated future cash\nflows generated by the asset or CGU which are discounted and prepared using the same methods as those used in the initial\nmeasurement of the assets and on the basis of medium-term strategic plans. Management cash flow projections include\nsignificant assumptions related to mid and long-term sales forecasts; perpetual growth or attrition rate, where applicable; discount\nrate; and probability of success of current research and development projects.\nThe principal considerations for our determination that auditing the recoverable amount of other intangible assets is especially\nchallenging, subjective, and required complex auditor judgment related to the significant judgments made by management when\ndeveloping the significant assumptions utilized in the future cash flow projections as described above.\nHow We Addressed Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall\nthe Matter in Our opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These audit procedures included obtaining an understanding of the process and\nAudit assessing the design and testing the operating effectiveness of controls relating to management’s other intangible assets\nimpairment assessment, including controls over the significant assumptions used in the impairment testing of the other intangible\nassets. These audit procedures also included, among others, evaluating the appropriateness of the discounted cash flow model;\ntesting the completeness, accuracy, and relevance of underlying data used in the model; and evaluating the significant\nassumptions used by management as described above. Evaluating management’s assumptions involved evaluating whether the\nassumptions used by management were reasonable by considering the current and past performance of other intangible assets in\ncomparison to management’s previous forecasts and current trends, the consistency of certain assumptions with external market\nand industry data, and whether these assumptions were consistent with evidence obtained in other areas of the audit such as\ninternal company communications and presentations and external communications. We involved our professionals with specialized\nskills and knowledge to assist us notably in the assessment of the discount rate used by management.\nValuation of the provisions for rebates relating to Sanofi’s business in the United States –\nMedicaid, Medicare and Managed Care\nDescription As described in Notes B.13.1. and D.23. to the consolidated financial statements, products sold in the United States are covered by\nof the Matter various Government and State programs (of which Medicaid and Medicare are the most significant) and are subject to commercial\nagreements with healthcare authorities and certain customers and distributors. Estimates of discounts and rebates incentives\n(hereinafter the “Rebates”) to be provided to customers under those arrangements are recognized as a reduction of gross sales in\nthe period in which the underlying sales are recognized. Provisions for the Medicaid, Medicare and Managed Care Rebates\namounted to €1,421 million, €1,099 million and €1,028 million, respectively, at December 31, 2023. The Rebates estimated by\nmanagement are based on the nature and patient profile of the underlying product; the applicable regulations or the specific\nterms and conditions of contracts with governmental authorities, wholesalers and other customers; historical data relating to\nsimilar contracts; past experience and sales growth trends for the same or similar products; actual inventory levels in distribution\nchannels, monitored by Sanofi using internal sales data and externally provided data; market trends including competition, pricing\nand demand.\nThe principal considerations for our determination that auditing the provisions for Rebates relating to the Company’s business in\nthe United States is especially challenging and required complex auditor judgment related to the significant judgment by\nmanagement due to significant measurement uncertainty involved in developing these provisions. These provisions are estimated\nbased on multiple factors as described above.\nHow We Addressed Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall\nthe Matter in Our opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These audit procedures included obtaining an understanding of the process and\nAudit assessing the design and testing the operating effectiveness of controls relating to management’s estimates of the provisions for\nRebates relating to the Company’s business in the United States, including controls over the assumptions used to estimate these\nRebates. These procedures also included, among others, developing an independent estimate of the provisions for Rebates by\nutilizing third party data on inventory levels in distribution channels, volume, changes to price, the terms of the specific rebate\nprograms, and the historical trend of actual rebate claims paid. The independent estimate was compared to the provisions\nrecorded by the Company. Additionally, these procedures included testing actual rebate claims paid and evaluating the\ncontractual terms of the Company’s rebate agreements.\n176 SANOFI FORM 20-F 2023\n2023 CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firms\nProvisions for product liability risks, litigation and other and contingent liabilities\nDescription of the Provisions for product liability risks, litigation and other were recorded in an amount of €1,283 million at December 31, 2023. As\nMatter described in Notes B.12., D.19.3. and D.22. to the consolidated financial statements, the Company records such provisions when an\noutflow of resources is probable and the amount of the outflow can be reliably estimated. The Company also discloses the\ncontingent liabilities in circumstances where management is unable to make a reasonable estimate of the expected financial effect\nthat will result from ultimate resolution of the proceeding, or a cash outflow is not probable.\nThe pharmaceutical industry is highly regulated, which increases the inherent risk of litigation and arbitration. The Company is\ninvolved in litigation, arbitration and other legal proceedings. These proceedings are typically related to litigation concerning\nproduct liability claims, intellectual property rights, competition law and trade practices, as well as claims under warranties or\nindemnification arrangements relating to business divestments. The issues raised by these claims are highly complex and subject\nto substantial uncertainties; therefore, the probability of loss and an estimation of damages are difficult to ascertain.\nThe principal considerations for our determination that auditing the provision for product liability risks, litigation and other, and\nauditing the contingent liabilities is especially challenging, subjective and required complex auditor judgment resulted from the\ndetermination that the measurement of the provisions can involve a series of complex judgments about future events and can rely\nheavily on estimates and assumptions by management. There is inherent uncertainty related to these cases and in estimating the\nlikelihood and outcome of the cases.\nHow We Addressed Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall\nthe Matter in Our opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These audit procedures included obtaining an understanding of the process and\nAudit assessing the design and testing the operating effectiveness of controls relating to management’s evaluation of the provisions for\nproduct liability risks, litigation and other, including controls over determining whether a loss is probable and whether the amount\nof loss can be reasonably estimated, as well as the need for and the level of financial statement disclosures. These procedures also\nincluded, among others, obtaining and evaluating the letters of audit inquiry with internal and external legal counsels, evaluating\nmanagement’s assessment regarding whether an unfavorable outcome is reasonably possible or probable and reasonably\nestimable through the evaluation of the legal letters and summaries of the proceedings and lawsuit correspondence. We also\nevaluated the Company’s disclosures for contingent liabilities.\nUncertain tax positions\nDescription of the As described in Notes B.22. and D.19.4. to the consolidated financial statements, the Company has recorded liabilities pertaining to\nMatter uncertain tax positions of €1,595 million at December 31, 2023. The Company operates in multiple tax jurisdictions, carrying out\npotentially complex transactions that require management to make judgments and estimates as to the tax impact of those\ntransactions. The positions adopted by the Company in tax matters are based on its interpretation of tax laws and regulations.\nSome of those positions may be subject to uncertainty. In such cases, the Company assesses the amount of the tax liability on the\nbasis of the following assumptions: that its position will be examined by one or more tax authorities on the basis of all relevant\ninformation; that a technical assessment is carried out with reference to legislation, case law, regulations, and established practice;\nand that each position is assessed individually (or collectively where appropriate), with no offset or aggregation between positions.\nThose assumptions are assessed on the basis of facts and circumstances existing at the end of the reporting period. When an\nuncertain tax liability is regarded as probable, it is measured on the basis of the Company’s best estimate.\nThe principal considerations for our determination that auditing uncertain tax positions is especially challenging, subjective and\nrequired complex auditor judgment related to the significant judgment by management when determining the liability for\nuncertain tax positions, including a high degree of estimation uncertainty of certain assumptions and interpretations of the tax\nlaws and regulations underlying the positions.\nHow We Addressed Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall\nthe Matter in Our opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These audit procedures included obtaining an understanding of the process and\nAudit assessing the design and testing the operating effectiveness of controls relating to the identification and recognition of the liability\nfor uncertain tax positions, management’s assessment and interpretation of tax laws and its evaluation of which tax positions may\nnot be sustained upon audit and controls over measurement of the liability. These procedures also included, among others, testing\nthe completeness and accuracy of the underlying data used in the calculation of the liability for uncertain tax positions and\nevaluating the assumptions used by management when determining its tax positions, the status of tax audits and investigations,\nand the potential impact of past claims. Our tax professionals assisted in evaluating management’s assessments by comparing the\npositions taken by management with tax regulations and past decisions from tax authorities and where applicable, evaluating\nopinions from the Company’s external tax advisors. We also evaluated the disclosures provided in the notes to the consolidated\nfinancial statements concerning uncertain tax positions.\n/s/ PricewaterhouseCoopers Audit /s/ Ernst & Young et Autres\nPricewaterhouseCoopers Audit Ernst & Young et Autres have served as the Company’s auditors since 1999 and 1986,\nrespectively.\nNeuilly-sur-Seine and Paris-La Défense, France, February 23, 2024\nSANOFI FORM 20-F 2023 177\n2023 CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firms\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firms\nTo the Shareholders and the Board of Directors of Sanofi,\nOpinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nWe have audited Sanofi and its subsidiaries’ (together the “Company”) internal control over financial reporting as of December 31,\n2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring\nOrganizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the “COSO criteria”). In our opinion, the Company maintained, in\nall material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023, based on the COSO criteria.\nAs indicated in Report of Management on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 15, management’s\nassessment and conclusion on the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting did not include the internal controls\nof QRIB Intermediate Holdings, LLC and its affiliates, which are included in the 2023 consolidated financial statements of the\nCompany and represented less than 1% of total assets as of December 31, 2023 and less than 1% of net sales for the year then\nended. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting of the Company also did not include an evaluation of the internal\ncontrol over financial reporting of QRIB Intermediate Holdings, LLC and its affiliates.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States)\n(“PCAOB”), the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of December 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021, the related consolidated\nincome statements, statements of comprehensive income, statements of changes in equity and statements of cash flows for\neach of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2023, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the\n“consolidated financial statements”) and our report dated February 23, 2024 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.\nBasis for Opinion\nThe Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its\nassessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Report of Management\non Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over\nfinancial reporting based on our audit. We are public accounting firms registered with the PCAOB and are required to be\nindependent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and\nregulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the\naudit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all\nmaterial respects.\nOur audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material\nweakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and\nperforming such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a\nreasonable basis for our opinion.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the\nreliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally\naccepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that\n(1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions\nof the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation\nof financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the\ncompany are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide\nreasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s\nassets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also,\nprojections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate\nbecause of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n/s/ PricewaterhouseCoopers Audit /s/ ERNST & YOUNG ET AUTRES\nNeuilly-sur-Seine and Paris-La Défense, France, February 23, 2024\n178 SANOFI FORM 20-F 2023\n2023 CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n2023 Consolidated financial statements\nThe financial statements are presented in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS).\nCONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS – ASSETS F-2\nCONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS – EQUITY AND LIABILITIES F-3\nCONSOLIDATED INCOME STATEMENTS F-4\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF COMPREHENSIVE INCOME F-5\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF CHANGES IN EQUITY F-6\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF CASH FLOWS F-8\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS F-10\nINTRODUCTION F-10\nA/ Basis of preparation F-10\nB/ Summary of significant accounting policies F-13\nC/ Principal alliances F-30\nD/ Presentation of the financial statements F-32\nE/ Principal accountants’ fees and services F-97\nF/ List of principal companies included in the consolidation during 2023 F-98\nG/ Events subsequent to December 31, 2023 F-101\nSANOFI FORM 20-F 2023 F-1\n2023 CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nConsolidated balance sheets - assets\nConsolidated balance sheets - assets\n(€ million) Note December 31, 2023 December 31, 2022 December 31, 2021\nProperty, plant and equipment D.3.1. 10,160 9,869 10,028\nRight-of-use assets D.3.2. 1,654 1,815 1,948\nGoodwill D.4. 49,404 49,892 48,056\nOther intangible assets D.4. 24,319 21,640 21,407\nInvestments accounted for using the equity method D.6. 424 677 250\nOther non-current assets D.7. 3,218 3,095 3,127\nNon-current income tax assets 188 242 175\nDeferred tax assets D.14. 6,427 5,381 4,598\nNon-current assets 95,794 92,611 89,589\nInventories D.9. 9,666 8,960 8,715\nAccounts receivable D.10. 8,433 8,424 7,568\nOther current assets D.11. 3,455 3,532 3,571\nCurrent income tax assets 391 374 612\nCash and cash equivalents D.13. - D.17.1. 8,710 12,736 10,098\nCurrent assets 30,655 34,026 30,564\nAssets held for sale or exchange D.8. 15 85 89\nTotal assets 126,464 126,722 120,242\nF-2 SANOFI FORM 20-F 2023\n2023 CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nConsolidated balance sheets - equity and liabilities\nConsolidated balance sheets – equity and liabilities\n(€ million) Note December 31, 2023 December 31, 2022 December 31, 2021\nEquity attributable to equity holders of Sanofi D.15. 74,040 74,784 68,681\nEquity attributable to non-controlling interests D.16. 313 368 350\nTotal equity 74,353 75,152 69,031\nLong-term debt D.17.1. 14,347 14,857 17,123\nNon-current lease liabilities D.17.2. 1,755 1,904 1,839\nNon-current liabilities related to business combinations\nand to non-controlling interests D.18. 501 674 577\nNon-current provisions and other non-current liabilities D.19. 7,602 6,341 6,721\nNon-current income tax liabilities D.19.4. 1,842 1,979 2,039\nDeferred tax liabilities D.14. 1,857 1,841 1,617\nNon-current liabilities 27,904 27,596 29,916\nAccounts payable 7,328 6,813 6,180\nCurrent liabilities related to business combinations\nand to non-controlling interests D.18. 208 105 137\nCurrent provisions and other current liabilities D.19.5. 13,741 12,021 11,217\nCurrent income tax liabilities 597 574 309\nCurrent lease liabilities D.17.2. 275 277 269\nShort-term debt and current portion of long-term debt D.17.1. 2,045 4,174 3,183\nCurrent liabilities 24,194 23,964 21,295\nLiabilities related to assets held for sale or exchange D.8. 13 10 —\nTotal equity and liabilities 126,464 126,722 120,242\nSANOFI FORM 20-F 2023 F-3\n2023 CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nConsolidated income statements\nConsolidated income statements\n(€ million) Note 2023 2022 2021\nNet sales D.35.1. 43,070 42,997 37,761\nOther revenues 3,374 2,392 1,414\nCost of sales (14,236) (13,695) (12,255)\nGross profit 32,208 31,694 26,920\nResearch and development expenses (6,728) (6,706) (5,692)\nSelling and general expenses (10,692) (10,492) (9,555)\nOther operating income D.25. 1,292 1,969 859\nOther operating expenses D.26.

International financial reporting standards (IFRS)\nThe consolidated financial statements cover the twelve-month periods ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021.\nIn accordance with Regulation No. 1606/2002 of the European Parliament and Council of July 19, 2002 on the application\nof international accounting standards, Sanofi has presented its consolidated financial statements in accordance with IFRS\nsince January 1, 2005. The term “IFRS” refers collectively to international accounting and financial reporting standards\n(IASs and IFRSs) and to interpretations of the interpretations committees (SIC and IFRIC) with mandatory application as of\nDecember 31, 2023.\nThe consolidated financial statements of Sanofi as of December 31, 2023 have been prepared in compliance with IFRS\nas issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) and with IFRS as endorsed by the European Union as of\nDecember 31, 2023.\nIFRS as endorsed by the European Union as of December 31, 2023 are available under the heading “IFRS Financial Statements”\nvia the following web link:\nhttps://www.efrag.org/Endorsement\nThe consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the IFRS general principles of fair presentation,\ngoing concern, accrual basis of accounting, consistency of presentation, materiality, and aggregation.\nA.2. New standards, amendments and interpretations\nA.2.1. New standards applicable from January 1, 2023\nThe following amendments are applicable from January 1, 2023, and have had no material impact: “Disclosure of Accounting\nPolicies” (amendment to IAS 1); “Definition of Accounting Estimates” (amendment to IAS 8); and “Deferred Tax Assets and\nLiabilities Arising from a Single Transaction” (amendment to IAS 12).\nOn May 23, 2023, the IASB issued “International Tax Reform—Pillar Two Model Rules”, an immediately applicable amendment\nto IAS 12 that was endorsed on November 9, 2023. The amendment relates to the effects of the global minimum corporate\nincome tax rate of 15% that will come into force in 2024, in accordance with the model framework of OECD Pillar Two.\nThe French Finance Bill for 2024 imposes a global minimum corporate income tax rate of 15% and introduces (i) a supplementary\nmultinational tax and (ii) a supplementary national tax for annual accounting periods commencing on or after December 31, 2023.\nGiven that the legislation had not come into force as of December 31, 2023, Sanofi is not liable for any current taxes in\nthat respect. In addition, Sanofi has not recognized any deferred taxes associated with the minimum tax, in accordance with\nthe temporary exemption available under the May 2023 amendment to IAS 12. At this stage, a material impact is expected in\nrespect of Sanofi's operations in France and Singapore, because Sanofi’s average effective tax rate in those countries was less\nthan 15% at the end of 2023. Other things being equal, applying the Pillar 2 rules in 2023 would have led to an increase of\napproximately 1.5 percentage points in the effective tax rate based on the Income before tax and investments accounted for\nusing the equity method.\nIFRS 17 (Insurance Contracts), issued on May 18, 2017 and applicable on or after January 1, 2023, does not apply to the Sanofi\nconsolidated financial statements because the insurance activities carried on by Sanofi’s captive insurance companies are\ninternal within the Sanofi group (the sole policyholders being subsidiaries of Sanofi), and hence are eliminated on consolidation.\nA.2.2. New pronouncements issued by the IASB and applicable from 2024 or later\nThis note describes standards, amendments and interpretations issued by the IASB that will have mandatory application in 2024\nor subsequent years, and Sanofi’s position regarding future application.\nOn September 22, 2022, the IASB issued an amendment to IFRS 16 (Leases), relating to lease liabilities in a sale-and-leaseback\narrangement, which is applicable at the earliest from January 1, 2024; it will not have a material impact on the Sanofi financial\nstatements, and Sanofi has not early adopted it.\nF-10 SANOFI FORM 20-F 2023\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nOn January 23, 2020, the IASB issued “Classification of Liabilities as Current or Non-current”, an amendment to IAS 1, and then\non October 31, 2022 issued “Non-current Liabilities with Covenants”, a further amendment to IAS 1. The amendments are\napplicable at the earliest from January 1, 2024; they will not have a material impact on the Sanofi financial statements, and Sanofi\nhas not early adopted them.\nOn May 25, 2023, the IASB issued \"Supplier Finance Arrangements\", an amendment to IAS 7 and IFRS 7, which is applicable at the\nearliest from January 1, 2024 (subject to endorsement by the European Union) and which relates to disclosures of information\nabout such arrangements. The amendment does not have a material impact on the Sanofi financial statements, and Sanofi will\nnot early adopt it.\nOn August 15, 2023, the IASB issued \"Lack of Exchangeability\", an amendment to IAS 21 (The Effect of Changes in Foreign\nExchange Rates), relating to how to determine the exchange rate when a currency is not exchangeable. The amendment is\napplicable at the earliest from January 1, 2025 (subject to endorsement by the European Union); it will not have a material impact\non the Sanofi financial statements, and Sanofi will not early adopt it.\nA.3. Use of estimates and judgments\nThe preparation of financial statements requires management to make reasonable estimates and assumptions based on\ninformation available at the date of the finalization of the financial statements. Those estimates and assumptions may affect the\nreported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses in the financial statements, and disclosures of contingent assets\nand contingent liabilities as of the date of the review of the financial statements. Examples of estimates and assumptions include:\n• amounts deducted from sales for projected sales returns, chargeback incentives, rebates and price reductions\n(see Notes B.13. and D.23.);\n• impairment of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets (see Notes B.6. and D.5.);\n• the valuation of goodwill and the valuation and estimated useful life of acquired intangible assets (see Notes B.3.2., B.4., D.4.\nand D.5.);\n• the measurement of contingent consideration receivable in connection with asset divestments (see Notes B.8.5. and D.12.)\nand of contingent consideration payable (see Notes B.3. and D.18.);\n• the measurement of financial assets and liabilities at amortized cost (see Note B.8.5.);\n• the amount of post-employment benefit obligations (see Notes B.23. and D.19.1.);\n• the amount of liabilities or provisions for restructuring, litigation, tax risks relating to corporate income taxes, and\nenvironmental risks (see Notes B.12., B.19., B.20., D.19. and D.22.); and\n• the amount of deferred tax assets resulting from tax losses available for carry-forward and deductible temporary differences\n(see Notes B.22. and D.14.).\nActual results could differ from these estimates.\nIn preparing the consolidated financial statements, Sanofi has also taken account of risks related to the effects of climate change\nand energy transition.\nAs part of its Planet Care program, Sanofi has committed to move towards carbon neutrality by 2030 and net zero emissions\nby 2045 for its Scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions. That involves:\n• aiming for a 55% reduction in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from Sanofi’s own activities (Scopes 1 & 2) and a 30%\nreduction in Scope 3 GHG emissions by 2030 (versus a 2019 baseline), and a 90% reduction in GHG emissions (all scopes)\nby 2045. These objectives have been validated by the Science Based Target initiative (STBi);\n• supplying all our sites with 100% renewably-sourced electricity by 2030;\n• promoting an eco-friendly vehicle fleet by 2030; and\n• engaging the Sanofi supply chain in reducing Scope 3 emissions.\nThe analysis of climate-related physical and transition risks facing Sanofi was updated in 2023 on the basis of three global\nwarming scenarios out to 2030 and 2050. A number of assumptions – on issues such as carbon costs, natural disasters, water\nstress, raw material scarcity and logistics disruption – were built into this analysis, which also takes account of certain capital\nexpenditures on mitigations derived from the Planet Care roadmap.\nIn preparing the consolidated financial statements, that analysis was taken into account as follows:\n• the value of intangible assets and property, plant and equipment was subject to impairment testing conducted at CGU level,\nas described in Note D.5. Certain climate-related assumptions, such as the evolution of energy costs, transitioning to\nsustainable agriculture, and waste management, are already built into the forecast used for impairment testing purposes. For\nthose assumptions not yet built into budgets, sensitivity analyses can be performed as needed;\n• the periodic reviews conducted on the useful lives of property, plant and equipment take account of environmental\nregulatory constraints, including not only GHG emissions but also physical risks;\n• environmental risks are covered by provisions on the basis described in Note D.19.3.; and\n• the credit facilities available to Sanofi as of December 31, 2023 incorporate performance objectives, including objectives\nrelated to cutting Sanofi’s carbon footprint, which could reduce the cost of debt if they are attained (see Note D.17.).\nSANOFI FORM 20-F 2023 F-11\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nIt is important to bear in mind that estimating climate change related risks involves an element of unpredictability. Uncertainties\nmay arise from factors such as changes in government policy, rapid technological change, and varied responses from\nstakeholders. That high level of uncertainty adds complexity to assessment of the potential impacts on our operations, and to\nhow those impacts are reflected in our budgets. Actual impacts on Sanofi’s profits and financial position could therefore differ\nfrom initial estimates.\nFinally, in line with its environmental protection objectives, Sanofi has initiated projects to build eco-design into its products so as\nto limit their environmental impacts over their entire life cycle. Those projects will require Sanofi to redefine all of its production\nmethods, and as such have also been built into definitions of the useful lives of Sanofi production facilities.\nA.4. Hyperinflation\nIn 2023, Sanofi continued to account for subsidiaries based in Venezuela using the full consolidation method, on the basis that\nthe criteria for control as specified in IFRS 10 (Consolidated Financial Statements) are still met. The contribution of the\nVenezuelan subsidiaries to the consolidated financial statements is immaterial.\nIn Argentina, the cumulative rate of inflation over the last three years is in excess of 100%, based on a combination of indices used\nto measure inflation in that country. Consequently, Sanofi has since July 1, 2018 treated Argentina as a hyperinflationary economy\nand has applied IAS 29. The impact of the resulting restatements is immaterial at Sanofi group level.\nIn Turkey, the cumulative rate of inflation over the last three years is in excess of 100% based on a combination of indices used to\nmeasure inflation in that country. Consequently, Sanofi has since January 1, 2022 treated Turkey as a hyperinflationary economy\nand has applied IAS 29. The impact of the resulting restatements is immaterial at Sanofi group level.\nA.5. Agreements relating to the recombinant COVID-19 vaccine candidate developed\nby Sanofi in collaboration with GSK\nOn February 18, 2020, Sanofi and the US Department of Health and Human Services extended their research and development\npartnership to leverage Sanofi’s previous development work on a SARS vaccine to attempt to unlock a fast path forward for\ndeveloping a COVID-19 vaccine. Under the terms of the collaboration, the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development\nAuthority (BARDA), part of the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response within the US Department of\nHealth and Human Services, is helping to fund the research and development undertaken by Sanofi.\nOn April 14, 2020, Sanofi and GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) entered into a collaboration agreement to develop a recombinant COVID-19\nvaccine candidate, with Sanofi contributing its S-protein COVID-19 antigen (based on recombinant DNA technology) and GSK\ncontributing its pandemic adjuvant technology. Sanofi is leading clinical development and the registration process for the\nvaccine.\nOn July 31, 2020, the recombinant COVID-19 vaccine candidate developed by Sanofi in collaboration with GSK was selected by\nthe US government’s Operation Warp Speed (OWS) program. Under the OWS, the US government is providing funds to support\nfurther development of the vaccine, including clinical trials and scaling-up of manufacturing capacity. Initially, the agreement\nalso provided for the supply of 100 million doses of the vaccine. In light of the evolving context of the pandemic (including\nvariants of the virus) and the availability of vaccines on the market, the parties decided to review the initial supply contract. At the\nend of 2023, the agreement was amended in respect of the supply clause, confirming that Sanofi had fulfilled its contractual\nobligations and setting the amount of compensation paid to Sanofi. On the basis of that signed amendment, Sanofi recognized\nan amount of €411 million within the line item Other revenues; that amount was paid to Sanofi in December 2023.\nSanofi has recognized the funding received from the US government as a deduction from the development expenses incurred, in\naccordance with IAS 20 (Accounting for Government Grants and Disclosure of Government Assistance).\nThe amount of government aid received from the US federal government and BARDA and recognized as a deduction from\ndevelopment expenses and other operating expenses was €59 million in 2023, compared with €265 million in 2022 and\n€147 million in 2021.\nIn September 2020, Sanofi and GSK signed pre-order contracts with the Canadian and UK governments and with the European\nUnion for doses of the vaccine candidate. During 2021, Sanofi and GSK contractualized with the Canadian and UK governments\nand with the European Union on the number of doses ordered.\nOn December 15, 2021, Sanofi and GSK announced positive preliminary data on their COVID-19 booster vaccine candidate and\nindicated that their Phase 3 trial was to continue, based on recommendations from an independent monitoring board.\nOn November 10, 2022, in line with the positive opinion issued by the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP)\nof the European Medicines Agency, the European Commission approved VIDPREVTYN Beta vaccine as booster for the\nprevention of COVID-19 in adults aged 18 years and older. Designed to provide broad protection against multiple variants, this\nprotein-based COVID-19 booster vaccine is based on the Beta variant antigen and includes GSK’s pandemic adjuvant.\nVIDPREVTYN Beta is indicated as a booster for active immunization against SARS-CoV-2 in adults who have previously received\nan mRNA or adenoviral COVID-19 vaccine.\nOn December 21, 2022, following the European Commission approval, the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency\n(MHRA) approved VIDPREVTYN Beta vaccine for the prevention of COVID-19 in adults aged 18 and over within the UK.\nF-12 SANOFI FORM 20-F 2023\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nIn accordance with IFRS 15 (see Note B.13.1.), Sanofi recognizes revenue when control over the product is transferred to the\ncustomer (for vaccines, transfer of control is determined by reference to the terms of release and acceptance of batches of\nvaccine). Payments received subsequent to signature of vaccine pre-order contracts relating to doses not yet delivered are\ncustomer contract liabilities (i.e. an obligation for the entity to supply goods to a customer, for which consideration has been\nreceived from the customer). They are presented within “Customer contract liabilities” in the balance sheet (see Note D.19.5.),\nand within “Net change in other current assets and other current liabilities” in the statement of cash flows.\nThe pre-order contracts for Canada, the United Kingdom and the European Union expired in 2023. The customer contract\nliabilities, which amounted to €269 million as of December 31, 2022 and €319 million as of December 31, 2021 (see Note D.19.5.,\n“Current provisions and other current liabilities”) were released to profit or loss in 2023, including an amount of €94 million\nclassified in Other revenue in respect of doses which there was no longer an obligation to deliver as of December 31, 2023.\nB/ Summary of significant accounting policies\nB.1. Basis of consolidation\nIn accordance with IFRS 10 (Consolidated Financial Statements), the consolidated financial statements of Sanofi include the\nfinancial statements of entities that Sanofi controls directly or indirectly, regardless of the level of the equity interest in those\nentities. An entity is controlled when Sanofi has power over the entity, exposure or rights to variable returns from its involvement\nwith the entity, and the ability to affect those returns through its power over the entity. In determining whether control exists,\npotential voting rights must be taken into account if those rights are substantive, in other words they can be exercised on a\ntimely basis when decisions about the relevant activities of the entity are to be taken.\nEntities consolidated by Sanofi are referred to as “subsidiaries”. Entities that Sanofi controls by means other than voting rights are\nreferred to as “consolidated structured entities”.\nIn accordance with IFRS 11 (Joint Arrangements), Sanofi classifies its joint arrangements (i.e. arrangements in which Sanofi\nexercises joint control with one or more other parties) either as a joint operation (in which case, Sanofi recognizes the assets and\nliabilities of the operation in proportion to its rights and obligations relating to those assets and liabilities) or as a joint venture.\nSanofi exercises joint control over a joint arrangement when decisions relating to the relevant activities of the arrangement\nrequire the unanimous consent of Sanofi and the other parties with whom control is shared.\nSanofi exercises significant influence over an entity when it has the power to participate in the financial and operating policy\ndecisions of that entity, but does not have the power to exercise control or joint control over those policies.\nIn accordance with IAS 28 (Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures), the equity method is used to account for joint ventures\n(i.e. entities over which Sanofi exercises joint control) and for associates (i.e. entities over which Sanofi exercises significant\ninfluence).\nUnder the equity method, the investment is initially recognized at cost, and subsequently adjusted to reflect changes in the net\nassets of the associate or joint venture. IAS 28 does not specify the treatment to be adopted on first-time application of the\nequity method to an investee following a step acquisition. Consequently, by reference to paragraph 10 of IAS 28, Sanofi has\nopted to apply the cost method, whereby the carrying amount of the investment represents the sum of the historical cost\namounts for each step in the acquisition. As of the date on which the equity method is first applied, goodwill (which is included in\nthe carrying amount of the investment) is determined for each acquisition step. The same applies to subsequent increases in the\npercentage interest in the equity-accounted investment.\nWhen the criteria of IFRS 5 are met, Sanofi recognizes the equity interest within the balance sheet line item Assets held for sale\nor exchange. The equity method is not applied to equity interests that are classified as held-for-sale assets.\nTransactions between consolidated companies are eliminated, as are intragroup profits.\nA list of the principal companies included in the consolidation in 2023 is presented in Note F.\nB.2. Foreign currency translation\nB.2.1. Accounting for foreign currency transactions in the financial statements of consolidated\nentities\nNon-current assets (other than receivables) and inventories acquired in foreign currencies are translated into the functional\ncurrency using the exchange rate prevailing at the acquisition date.\nMonetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated using the exchange rate prevailing at the end of\nthe reporting period. The gains and losses resulting from foreign currency translation are recorded in the income statement.\nHowever, foreign exchange gains and losses arising from the translation of advances between consolidated subsidiaries for which\nsettlement is neither planned nor likely to occur in the foreseeable future are recognized in equity, in the line item Change in\ncurrency translation differences.\nSANOFI FORM 20-F 2023 F-13\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nB.2.2. Foreign currency translation of the financial statements of foreign entities\nSanofi presents its consolidated financial statements in euros (€). In accordance with IAS 21 (The Effects of Changes in Foreign\nExchange Rates), each subsidiary accounts for its transactions in the currency that is most representative of its economic\nenvironment (the functional currency).\nAll assets and liabilities are translated into euros using the exchange rate of the subsidiary’s functional currency prevailing at the\nend of the reporting period. Income statements are translated using a weighted average exchange rate for the period, except in\nthe case of foreign subsidiaries in a hyperinflationary economy. The resulting currency translation difference is recognized as a\nseparate component of equity in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income, and is recognized in the income\nstatement only when the subsidiary is sold or is wholly or partially liquidated.\nB.3. Business combinations and transactions with non-controlling interests\nB.3.1. Accounting for business combinations, transactions with non-controlling interests and loss\nof control\nBusiness combinations are accounted for in accordance with IFRS 3 (Business Combinations) and IFRS 10 (Consolidated Financial\nStatements).\nBusiness combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method. Under this method, the acquiree’s identifiable assets and\nliabilities that satisfy the recognition criteria of IFRS 3 (Business Combinations) are measured initially at their fair values at the\ndate of acquisition, except for (i) non-current assets classified as held for sale (which are measured at fair value less costs to sell)\nand (ii) assets and liabilities that fall within the scope of IAS 12 (Income Taxes) and IAS 19 (Employee Benefits). Restructuring\nliabilities are recognized as a liability of the acquiree only if the acquiree has an obligation as of the acquisition date to carry out\nthe restructuring.\nThe principal accounting rules applicable to business combinations and transactions with non-controlling interests include:\n• acquisition-related costs are recognized as an expense, as a component of Operating income;\n• contingent consideration is recognized in equity if the contingent payment is settled by delivery of a fixed number\nof the acquirer’s equity instruments; otherwise, it is recognized in liabilities related to business combinations.\nContingent consideration is recognized at fair value at the acquisition date irrespective of the probability of payment. If the\ncontingent consideration was originally recognized as a financial liability, subsequent adjustments to the liability are\nrecognized in profit or loss in the line item Fair value remeasurement of contingent consideration, unless the adjustment is\nmade within the 12 months following the acquisition date and relates to facts and circumstances existing as of that date;\n• goodwill may be calculated on the basis of either (i) the entire fair value of the acquiree, or (ii) a share of the fair value of the\nacquiree proportionate to the interest acquired. This option is elected for each acquisition individually.\nPurchase price allocations are performed under the responsibility of management, with assistance from an independent valuer in\nthe case of major acquisitions. IFRS 3 does not specify an accounting treatment for contingent consideration arising from a\nbusiness combination made by an entity prior to the acquisition of control in that entity and carried as a liability in the acquired\nentity’s balance sheet. The accounting treatment applied by Sanofi to such a liability is to measure it at fair value as of the\nacquisition date and to report it in the line item Liabilities related to business combinations and to non-controlling interests,\nwith subsequent remeasurements recognized in profit or loss. This treatment is consistent with the accounting applied to\ncontingent consideration in the books of the acquirer.\nFinally, management may where it deems fit elect to apply the optional test to identify concentration of fair value permitted\nunder IFRS 3 in order to determine whether a transaction is a business combination within the meaning of IFRS 3, or merely the\nacquisition of an asset or of a group of similar assets.\nB.3.2. Goodwill\nThe excess of the cost of an acquisition over Sanofi’s interest in the fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities of the\nacquiree is recognized as goodwill at the date of the business combination. Goodwill arising on the acquisition of subsidiaries is\nshown in a separate balance sheet line item, whereas goodwill arising on the acquisition of investments accounted for using the\nequity method is recorded in Investments accounted for using the equity method.\nGoodwill arising on foreign operations is expressed in the functional currency of the country concerned and translated into euros\nusing the exchange rate prevailing at the end of the reporting period.\nIn accordance with IAS 36 (Impairment of Assets), goodwill is carried at cost less accumulated impairment (see Note B.6.).\nGoodwill is tested for impairment annually and whenever events or circumstances indicate that impairment might exist. Such\nevents or circumstances include significant changes more likely than not to have an other-than-temporary impact on the\nsubstance of the original investment.\nF-14 SANOFI FORM 20-F 2023\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nB.4. Other intangible assets\nOther intangible assets are initially measured at acquisition cost or production cost, including any directly attributable costs of\npreparing the asset for its intended use, or (in the case of assets acquired in a business combination) at fair value as of the date of\nthe business combination. Intangible assets are amortized on a straight line basis over their useful lives.\nThe useful lives of other intangible assets are reviewed at the end of each reporting period. The effect of any adjustment to\nuseful lives is recognized prospectively as a change in accounting estimate.\nAmortization of other intangible assets is recognized in the income statement within Amortization of intangible assets except\nfor amortization charged against (i) acquired or internally-developed software and (ii) other rights of an industrial or operational\nnature, which is recognized in the relevant classification of expense by function.\nSanofi does not own any intangible assets with an indefinite useful life, other than goodwill.\nIntangible assets (other than goodwill) are carried at cost less accumulated amortization and accumulated impairment, if any, in\naccordance with IAS 36 (see Note B.6.).\nB.4.1. Research and development not acquired in a business combination\nInternally generated research and development\nUnder IAS 38, research expenses are recognized in profit or loss when incurred.\nInternally generated development expenses are recognized as an intangible asset if, and only if, all the following six criteria can be\ndemonstrated: (a) the technical feasibility of completing the development project; (b) Sanofi’s intention to complete the project;\n(c) Sanofi’s ability to use the project; (d) the probability that the project will generate future economic benefits; (e) the availability\nof adequate technical, financial and other resources to complete the project; and (f) the ability to measure the development\nexpenditure reliably.\nDue to the risks and uncertainties relating to regulatory approval and to the research and development process, the six criteria\nfor capitalization are usually considered not to have been met until the product has obtained marketing approval from the\nregulatory authorities. Consequently, internally generated development expenses arising before marketing approval has been\nobtained, mainly the cost of clinical trials, are generally expensed as incurred within Research and development expenses.\nSome industrial development expenses (such as those incurred in developing a second-generation synthesis process) are\nincurred after marketing approval has been obtained, in order to improve the industrial process for an active ingredient. To the\nextent that the six IAS 38 criteria are considered as having been met, such expenses are recognized as an asset in the balance\nsheet within Other intangible assets as incurred. Similarly, some clinical trials, for example those undertaken to obtain a\ngeographical extension for a molecule that has already obtained marketing approval in a major market, may in certain\ncircumstances meet the six capitalization criteria under IAS 38, in which case the related expenses are recognized as an asset in\nthe balance sheet within Other intangible assets.\nSeparately acquired research and development\nPayments for separately acquired research and development are capitalized within Other intangible assets provided that they\nmeet the definition of an intangible asset: a resource that is (i) controlled by Sanofi, (ii) expected to provide future economic\nbenefits for Sanofi, and (iii) identifiable (i.e. it is either separable or arises from contractual or legal rights). Under paragraph 25\nof IAS 38, the first condition for capitalization (the probability that the expected future economic benefits from the asset will flow\nto the entity) is considered to be satisfied for separately acquired research and development. Consequently, upfront and\nmilestone payments to third parties related to pharmaceutical products for which marketing approval has not yet been obtained\nare recognized as intangible assets, and amortized on a straight line basis over their useful lives beginning when marketing\napproval is obtained.\nPayments under research and development arrangements relating to access to technology or to databases, and payments made\nto purchase generics dossiers, are also capitalized, and amortized over the useful life of the intangible asset.\nSubcontracting arrangements, payments for research and development services, and continuous payments under research and\ndevelopment collaborations which are unrelated to the outcome of that collaboration, are expensed over the service term.\nB.4.2. Other intangible assets not acquired in a business combination\nLicenses other than those related to pharmaceutical products and research projects, in particular software licenses, are\ncapitalized at acquisition cost, including any directly attributable cost of preparing the software for its intended use. Software\nlicenses are amortized on a straight line basis over their useful lives for Sanofi (three to five years).\nInternally generated costs incurred to develop or upgrade software are capitalized if the IAS 38 recognition criteria are satisfied,\nand amortized on a straight line basis over the useful life of the software from the date on which the software is ready for use.\nSANOFI FORM 20-F 2023 F-15\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nB.4.3. Other intangible assets acquired in a business combination\nOther intangible assets acquired in a business combination (in-process research and development, technology platforms, and\ncurrently marketed products) that are reliably measurable are identified separately from goodwill, measured at fair value, and\ncapitalized within Other intangible assets in accordance with IFRS 3 (Business Combinations) and IAS 38 (Intangible Assets). The\nrelated deferred tax liability is also recognized if a deductible or taxable temporary difference exists.\nIn-process research and development acquired in a business combination is amortized on a straight line basis over its useful life\nfrom the date of receipt of marketing approval.\nRights to technology platforms and to products currently marketed by Sanofi are amortized on a straight line basis over their\nuseful lives, determined (in particular for marketed products) on the basis of cash flow forecasts which take into account the\npatent protection period of the marketed product.\nB.5. Property, plant and equipment owned and leased\nB.5.1. Property, plant and equipment owned\nProperty, plant and equipment is initially measured and recognized at acquisition cost, including any directly attributable cost of\npreparing the asset for its intended use, or (in the case of assets acquired in a business combination) at fair value as of the date of\nthe business combination. The component-based approach to accounting for property, plant and equipment is applied. Under\nthis approach, each component of an item of property, plant and equipment with a cost which is significant in relation to the total\ncost of the item and which has a different useful life from the other components must be depreciated separately.\nAfter initial measurement, property, plant and equipment is carried at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment, except\nfor land which is carried at cost less impairment.\nSubsequent costs are not recognized as assets unless (i) it is probable that future economic benefits associated with those costs\nwill flow to Sanofi and (ii) the costs can be measured reliably.\nBorrowing costs attributable to the financing of items of property, plant and equipment, and incurred during the construction\nperiod, are capitalized as part of the acquisition cost of the item.\nGovernment grants relating to property, plant and equipment are deducted from the acquisition cost of the asset to which\nthey relate.\nThe depreciable amount of items of property, plant and equipment, net of any residual value, is depreciated on a straight line\nbasis over the useful life of the asset. The useful life of an asset is usually equivalent to its economic life.\nThe customary useful lives of property, plant and equipment are as follows:\nBuildings 15 to 40 years\nFixtures 10 to 20 years\nMachinery and equipment 5 to 15 years\nOther 3 to 15 years\nUseful lives and residual values of property, plant and equipment are reviewed annually. The effect of any adjustment to useful\nlives or residual values is recognized prospectively as a change in accounting estimate.\nDepreciation of property, plant and equipment is recognized as an expense in the income statement, in the relevant classification\nof expense by function.\nB.5.2. Property, plant and equipment leased\nEffective from January 1, 2019 leases contracted by Sanofi have been accounted for in accordance with IFRS 16 (Leases). Sanofi\nrecognizes a right-of-use asset and a lease liability for all of its lease contracts, except for (i) leases relating to low-value assets\nand (ii) short-term leases (12 months or less). Payments made in respect of leases not recognized on the balance sheet are\nrecognized as an operating expense on a straight line basis over the lease term.\nOn commencement of a lease, the liability for future lease payments is discounted at the incremental borrowing rate, which is a\nrisk-free rate adjusted to reflect the specific risk profile of each Sanofi entity. Because lease payments are spread over the lease\nterm, Sanofi applies a discount rate based on the duration of those payments.\nThe payments used to determine the liability for future lease payments exclude non-lease components, but include fixed\npayments that Sanofi expects to make to the lessor over the estimated lease term.\nAfter commencement of the lease, the liability for future lease payments is reduced by the amount of the lease payments made,\nand increased to reflect interest on the liability. In the event of a reassessment or modification of future lease payments, the lease\nliability is remeasured. The right-of-use asset – which is initially measured at cost including direct costs of the lessee,\nprepayments made at or prior to the commencement date, less lease incentives received and restoration costs – is depreciated\non a straight line basis over the lease term, and tested for impairment as required.\nSanofi recognizes deferred taxes in respect of right-of-use assets and lease liabilities.\nLeasehold improvements are depreciated over their economic life, which is capped at the lease term as determined\nunder IFRS 16.\nF-16 SANOFI FORM 20-F 2023\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nB.6. Impairment of property, plant and equipment, intangible assets, and investments\naccounted for using the equity method\nB.6.1. Impairment of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets\nIn accordance with IAS 36 (Impairment of Assets), assets that generate separate cash flows and assets included in cash-\ngenerating units (CGUs) are assessed for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset or CGU\nmay be impaired. A CGU is the smallest identifiable group of assets that generates cash inflows that are largely independent of\nthe cash inflows from other assets or groups of assets.\nUnder IAS 36, each CGU or group of CGUs to which goodwill is allocated must (i) represent the lowest level within the entity at\nwhich the goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes, and (ii) not be larger than an operating segment determined\nin accordance with IFRS 8 (Operating Segments), before application of the IFRS 8 aggregation criteria (see Note B.26.).\nQuantitative and qualitative indications of impairment (primarily relating to the status of the research and development portfolio,\npharmacovigilance, patent litigation, and the launch of competing products) are reviewed at the end of each reporting period. If\nthere is any internal or external indication of impairment, Sanofi estimates the recoverable amount of the asset or CGU.\nOther intangible assets not yet available for use (such as capitalized in-process research and development), and CGUs or groups\nof CGUs that include goodwill, are tested for impairment annually whether or not there is any indication of impairment, and more\nfrequently if any event or circumstance indicates that they might be impaired. Such assets are not amortized.\nWhen there is an internal or external indication of impairment, Sanofi estimates the recoverable amount of the asset and\nrecognizes an impairment loss if the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its recoverable amount. The recoverable amount of\nthe asset is the higher of its fair value less costs to sell or its value in use. To determine value in use, Sanofi uses estimates of future\ncash flows generated by the asset or CGU, prepared using the same methods as those used in the initial measurement of the\nasset or CGU on the basis of medium-term strategic plans.\nIn the case of goodwill, estimates of future cash flows are based on a six-year strategic plan and a terminal value. In the case of\nother intrangible assets, the period used is based on the economic life of the asset.\nEstimated cash flows are discounted at long-term market interest rates that reflect the best estimate by Sanofi of the time value\nof money, the risks specific to the asset or CGU, and economic conditions in the geographical regions in which the business\nactivity associated with the asset or CGU is located.\nCertain assets and liabilities that are not directly attributable to a specific CGU are allocated between CGUs on a basis that is\nreasonable, and consistent with the allocation of the corresponding goodwill.\nImpairment losses arising on property, plant and equipment, software and certain rights, are recognized within the appropriate\nincome statement line item according to the origin of the impairment.\nImpairment losses arising on other intangible assets (products, trademarks, technology platforms, acquired R&D) are recognized\nwithin Impairment of intangible assets in the income statement.\nB.6.2. Impairment of investments accounted for using the equity method\nIn accordance with IAS 28 (Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures), Sanofi determines whether investments accounted for\nusing the equity method may be impaired based on indicators such as default in contractual payments, significant financial\ndifficulties, probability of bankruptcy, or a prolonged or significant decline in quoted market price. If an investment is impaired,\nthe amount of the impairment loss is determined by applying IAS 36 (see Note B.6.1.) and recognized in Share of profit/(loss)\nfrom investments accounted for using the equity method.\nB.6.3. Reversals of impairment losses charged against property, plant and equipment, intangible\nassets, and investments accounted for using the equity method\nAt the end of each reporting period, Sanofi assesses whether events or changes in circumstances indicate that an impairment\nloss recognized in a prior period in respect of an asset (other than goodwill) or an investment accounted for using the equity\nmethod can be reversed. If this is the case, and the recoverable amount as determined based on the revised estimates exceeds\nthe carrying amount of the asset, Sanofi reverses the impairment loss only to the extent of the carrying amount that would have\nbeen determined had no impairment loss been recognized for the asset.\nReversals of impairment losses in respect of other intangible assets are recognized within the income statement line item\nImpairment of intangible assets, while reversals of impairment losses in respect of investments accounted for using the equity\nmethod are recognized within the income statement line item Share of profit/(loss) from investments accounted for using the\nequity method. Impairment losses taken against goodwill are never reversed, unless the goodwill is part of the carrying amount\nof an investment accounted for using the equity method.\nSANOFI FORM 20-F 2023 F-17\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nB.7. Assets held for sale or exchange and liabilities related to assets held for sale or\nexchange\nIn accordance with IFRS 5 (Non-Current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations), non-current assets and groups of\nassets are classified as held for sale in the balance sheet if their carrying amount will be recovered principally through a sale\ntransaction rather than through continuing use. Within the meaning of IFRS 5, the term “sale” also includes exchanges for other\nassets.\nNon-current assets or asset groups held for sale must be available for immediate sale in their present condition, subject only to\nterms that are usual and customary for sales of such assets, and a sale must be highly probable. Criteria used to determine\nwhether a sale is highly probable include:\n• the appropriate level of management must be committed to a plan to sell;\n• an active program to locate a buyer and complete the plan must have been initiated;\n• the asset must be actively marketed for sale at a price that is reasonable in relation to its current fair value;\n• completion of the sale should be foreseeable within the 12 months following the date of reclassification to Assets held for\nsale or exchange; and\n• actions required to complete the plan should indicate that it is unlikely that significant changes to the plan will be made or\nthat the plan will be withdrawn.\nBefore initial reclassification of the non-current asset (or asset group) to Assets held for sale or exchange, the carrying amounts\nof the asset (or of all the assets and liabilities in the asset group) must be measured in accordance with the applicable standards.\nSubsequent to reclassification to Assets held for sale or exchange, the non-current asset (or asset group) is measured at the\nlower of carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell, with any write-down recognized by means of an impairment loss. Once a\nnon-current asset has been reclassified as held for sale or exchange, it is no longer depreciated or amortized.\nIn a disposal of an equity interest leading to loss of control, all the assets and liabilities of the entity involved are classified as held-\nfor-sale assets or liabilities within the balance sheet line items Assets held for sale or exchange or Liabilities related to assets\nheld for sale or exchange, provided that the disposal satisfies the IFRS 5 classification criteria.\nThe profit or loss generated by a held-for-sale asset group is reported in a separate line item in the income statement for the\ncurrent period and for the comparative periods presented, provided that the asset group:\n• represents a separate major line of business or geographical area of operations; or\n• is part of a single coordinated plan to dispose of a separate major line of business or geographical area of operations; or\n• is a subsidiary acquired exclusively with a view to resale.\nIn accordance with IFRS 10, transactions between companies that are held for sale or treated as discontinued operations and\nother consolidated companies are eliminated.\nEvents or circumstances beyond Sanofi’s control may extend the period to complete the sale or exchange beyond one year\nwithout precluding classification of the asset (or disposal group) in Assets held for sale or exchange provided that there is\nsufficient evidence that Sanofi remains committed to the planned sale or exchange. Finally, in the event of changes to a plan of\nsale that requires an asset no longer to be classified as held for sale, IFRS 5 specifies the following treatment:\n• the assets and liabilities previously classified as held for sale are reclassified to the appropriate balance sheet line items, with\nno restatement of comparative periods;\n• each asset is measured at the lower of (a) its carrying amount before the asset was reclassified as held for sale, adjusted for\nany depreciation, amortization or revaluation that would have been recognized if the asset had not been reclassified as held\nfor sale, or (b) its recoverable amount at the date of reclassification;\n• the backlog of depreciation, amortization and impairment not recognized while non-current assets were classified as held for\nsale must be reported in the same income statement line item that was used to report impairment losses arising on initial\nreclassification of assets as held for sale and gains or losses arising on the sale of such assets. In the consolidated income\nstatement, those impacts are reported within the line item Other gains and losses, and litigation;\n• the net income of a business previously classified as discontinued or as held for sale or exchange and reported on a separate\nline in the income statement must be reclassified and included in net income from continuing operations, for all periods\npresented;\n• in addition, segment information relating to the income statement and the statement of cash flows (acquisitions of non-\ncurrent assets) must be disclosed in the notes to the financial statements in accordance with IFRS 8 (Operating Segments),\nand must also be restated for all prior periods presented.\nF-18 SANOFI FORM 20-F 2023\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nB.8. Financial instruments\nB.8.1. Non-derivative financial assets\nIn accordance with IFRS 9 (Financial Instruments) and IAS 32 (Financial Instruments: Presentation), Sanofi has adopted the\nclassification of non-derivative financial assets described below. The classification used depends on (i) the characteristics of the\ncontractual cash flows (i.e. whether they represent interest or principal) and (ii) the business model for managing the asset\napplied at the time of initial recognition.\nFinancial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income\nThese mainly comprise:\n• quoted and unquoted equity investments that Sanofi does not hold for trading purposes and that management has\ndesignated at “fair value through other comprehensive income” on initial recognition. Gains and losses arising from changes\nin fair value are recognized in equity within the statement of comprehensive income in the period in which they occur. When\nsuch instruments are derecognized, the previously-recognized changes in fair value remain within Other comprehensive\nincome, as does the gain or loss on divestment. Dividends received are recognized in profit or loss for the period, within the\nline item Financial income; and\n• debt instruments whose contractual cash flows represent payments of interest or repayments of principal, and which are\nmanaged with a view to collecting cash flows and selling the asset. Gains and losses arising from changes in fair value are\nrecognized in equity within the statement of comprehensive income in the period in which they occur. When such assets are\nderecognized, the cumulative gains and losses previously recognized in equity are reclassified to profit or loss for the period\nwithin the line items Financial income or Financial expenses.\nFinancial assets at fair value through profit or loss\nThese mainly comprise:\n• contingent consideration already carried in the books of an acquired entity or granted in connection with a business\ncombination;\n• instruments whose contractual cash flows represent payments of interest and repayments of principal, which are managed\nwith a view to selling the asset;\n• instruments that management has designated at “fair value through profit or loss” on initial recognition; and\n• quoted and unquoted equity investments: equity instruments that are not held for trading and which management did not\ndesignate at “fair value through other comprehensive income” on initial recognition, and instruments that do not meet the\nIFRS definition of “equity instruments”.\nGains and losses arising from changes in fair value are recognized in profit or loss within the line items Financial income or\nFinancial expenses. Dividends received are recognized in profit or loss for the period, within the line item Financial income.\nFair value of equity investments in unquoted entities\nOn initial recognition of an equity investment in an entity not quoted in an active market, the fair value of the investment is the\nacquisition cost. Cost ceases to be a representative measure of the fair value of an unquoted equity investment when Sanofi\nidentifies significant changes in the investee, or in the environment in which it operates. In such cases, an internal valuation is\ncarried out, based mainly on growth forecasts or by reference to similar transactions contracted with third parties.\nFinancial assets measured at amortized cost\nFinancial assets at amortized cost comprise instruments whose contractual cash flows represent payments of interest and\nrepayments of principal and which are managed with a view to collecting cash flows. The main assets in this category are loans\nand receivables. They are presented within the line items Other non-current assets, Other current assets, Accounts receivable\nand Cash and cash equivalents. Loans with a maturity of more than 12 months are presented in “Long-term loans and\nadvances” within Other non-current assets. These financial assets are measured at amortized cost using the effective interest\nmethod.\nImpairment of financial assets measured at amortized cost\nThe main assets involved are accounts receivable. Accounts receivable are initially recognized at the amount invoiced to the\ncustomer. Impairment losses on trade accounts receivable are estimated using the expected loss method, in order to take\naccount of the risk of payment default throughout the lifetime of the receivables. The expected credit loss is estimated\ncollectively for all accounts receivable at each reporting date using an average expected loss rate, determined primarily on the\nbasis of historical credit loss rates. However, that average expected loss rate may be adjusted if there are indications of a likely\nsignificant increase in credit risk. If a receivable is subject to a known credit risk, a specific impairment loss is recognized for that\nreceivable. The amount of expected losses is recognized in the balance sheet as a reduction in the gross amount of accounts\nreceivable. Impairment losses on accounts receivable are recognized within Selling and general expenses in the income\nstatement.\nSANOFI FORM 20-F 2023 F-19\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nB.8.2. Derivative instruments\nDerivative instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting are initially and subsequently measured at fair value, with\nchanges in fair value recognized in the income statement in Other operating income or in Financial income or Financial\nexpenses, depending on the nature of the underlying economic item which is hedged.\nDerivative instruments that qualify for hedge accounting are measured using the policies described in Note B.8.3. below.\nIFRS 13 (Fair Value Measurement) requires counterparty credit risk to be taken into account when measuring the fair value of\nfinancial instruments. That risk is estimated on the basis of observable, publicly-available statistical data.\nPolicy on offsetting\nIn order for a financial asset and a financial liability to be presented as a net amount in the balance sheet under IAS 32, there must\nbe:\n(a) a legally enforceable right to offset; and\n(b) the intention either to settle on a net basis, or to realize the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.\nB.8.3. Hedging\nAs part of its overall market risk management policy, Sanofi enters into various hedging transactions involving derivative or non-\nderivative instruments; these may include forward contracts, currency swaps or options, interest rate swaps or options, cross-\ncurrency swaps, and debt placings or issues.\nSuch financial instruments are designated as hedging instruments and recognized using the hedge accounting principles\nof IFRS 9 when (a) there is formal designation and documentation of the hedging relationship, of how the effectiveness of the\nhedging relationship will be assessed, and of the underlying market risk management objective and strategy; (b) the hedged item\nand the hedging instrument are eligible for hedge accounting; and (c) there is an economic relationship between the hedged\nitem and the hedging instrument, defined on the basis of a hedge ratio that is consistent with the underlying market risk\nmanagement strategy, and the residual credit risk does not dominate the value changes that result from that economic\nrelationship.\nFair value hedge\nA fair value hedge is a hedge of the exposure to changes in fair value of an asset, liability or firm commitment that is attributable\nto one or more risk components and could affect profit or loss.\nChanges in fair value of the hedging instrument and changes in fair value of the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk\ncomponents are generally recognized in the income statement, within Other operating income for hedges related to operating\nactivities, or within Financial income or Financial expenses for hedges related to investing or financing activities.\nCash flow hedge\nA cash flow hedge is a hedge of the exposure to variability in cash flows from an asset, liability or highly probable forecast\ntransaction that is attributable to one or more risk components and could affect profit or loss.\nChanges in fair value of the hedging instrument attributable to the effective portion of the hedge are recognized directly in\nequity in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income. Changes in fair value attributable to the ineffective portion of\nthe hedge are recognized in the income statement within Other operating income for hedges related to operating activities, and\nwithin Financial income or Financial expenses for hedges related to investing or financing activities.\nCumulative changes in fair value of the hedging instrument previously recognized in equity are reclassified to the income\nstatement when the hedged transaction affects profit or loss. Those reclassified gains and losses are recognized within Other\noperating income for hedges related to operating activities, and within Financial income or Financial expenses for hedges\nrelated to investing or financing activities.\nWhen a forecast transaction results in the recognition of a non-financial asset or liability, cumulative changes in the fair value of\nthe hedging instrument previously recognized in equity are incorporated in the initial carrying amount of that asset or liability.\nWhen the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised, the cumulative gain or loss previously recognized in\nequity remains separately recognized in equity and is not reclassified to the income statement, or recognized as an adjustment to\nthe initial cost of the related non-financial asset or liability, until the forecast transaction occurs. However, if Sanofi no longer\nexpects the forecast transaction to occur, the cumulative gain or loss previously recognized in equity is recognized immediately\nin profit or loss.\nHedge of a net investment in a foreign operation\nIn a hedge of a net investment in a foreign operation, changes in the fair value of the hedging instrument attributable to the\neffective portion of the hedge are recognized directly in equity in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income.\nChanges in fair value attributable to the ineffective portion of the hedge are recognized in the income statement within\nFinancial income or Financial expenses. When the investment in the foreign operation is sold, the changes in the fair value of\nthe hedging instrument previously recognized in equity are reclassified to the income statement within Financial income or\nFinancial expenses.\nF-20 SANOFI FORM 20-F 2023\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nCost of hedging\nAs part of its market risk management policy, Sanofi may designate currency options or interest rate options as hedging\ninstruments, the effectiveness of which is measured on the basis of changes in intrinsic value. In such cases, the time value of the\noption is treated as a hedging cost and accounted for as follows:\n• if the option includes a component that is not aligned on the critical features of the hedged item, the corresponding change\nin the time value is taken to profit or loss;\n• otherwise, the change in the time value is taken to equity within the statement of comprehensive income, and then:\n– if the hedged item is linked to a transaction that results in the recognition of a financial asset or liability, the change in the\ntime value is reclassified to profit or loss symmetrically with the hedged item, or\n– if the hedged item is linked to a transaction that results in the recognition of a non-financial asset or liability, the change in\nthe time value is incorporated in the initial carrying amount of that asset or liability, or\n– if the hedged item is linked to a period of time, the change in time value is reclassified to profit or loss on a straight line\nbasis over the life of the hedging relationship.\nIn the case of forward contracts and foreign exchange swaps, and of cross-currency swaps that qualify for hedge accounting on\nthe basis of changes in spot rates, Sanofi may elect for each transaction to use the option whereby the premium/discount or\nforeign currency basis spread are treated in the same way as the time value of an option.\nDiscontinuation of hedge accounting\nHedge accounting is discontinued when the eligibility criteria are no longer met (in particular, when the hedging instrument\nexpires or is sold, terminated or exercised), or if there is a change in the market risk management objective of the hedging\nrelationship.\nB.8.4. Non-derivative financial liabilities\nBorrowings and debt\nBank borrowings and debt instruments are initially measured at fair value of the consideration received, net of directly\nattributable transaction costs.\nSubsequently, they are measured at amortized cost using the effective interest method. All costs related to the issuance of\nborrowings or debt instruments, and all differences between the issue proceeds net of transaction costs and the value on\nredemption, are recognized within Financial expenses in the income statement over the term of the debt using the effective\ninterest method.\nLiabilities related to business combinations and to non-controlling interests\nThese line items record the fair value of (i) contingent consideration payable in connection with business combinations and\n(ii) commitments to buy out equity holders of subsidiaries, including put options granted to non-controlling interests.\nAdjustments to the fair value of commitments to buy out equity holders of subsidiaries, including put options granted to non-\ncontrolling interests, are recognized in equity.\nOther non-derivative financial liabilities\nOther non-derivative financial liabilities include trade accounts payable, which are measured at fair value (which in most cases\nequates to face value) on initial recognition, and subsequently at amortized cost.\nB.8.5. Fair value of financial instruments\nUnder IFRS 13 (Fair Value Measurement) and IFRS 7 (Financial Instruments: Disclosures), fair value measurements must be\nclassified using a hierarchy based on the inputs used to measure the fair value of the instrument. This hierarchy has three levels:\na. level 1: quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (without modification or repackaging);\nb. level 2: quoted prices in active markets for similar assets and liabilities, or valuation techniques in which all important inputs\nare derived from observable market data; and\nc. level 3: valuation techniques in which not all important inputs are derived from observable market data.\nSANOFI FORM 20-F 2023 F-21\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nThe table below shows the disclosures required under IFRS 7 relating to the measurement principles applied to financial\ninstruments.\nMethod used to determine fair value\nMarket data\nLevel in\nMeasurement fair value Valuation Valuation Exchange Interest\nNote Type of financial instrument principle hierarchy technique model rate rate\nFinancial assets measured at fair value Quoted\nD.7.\n(quoted equity instruments)\nFair value 1 Market value\nmarket price\nN/A\nFinancial assets measured at fair value Quoted market\nD.7.\n(quoted debt instruments)\nFair value 1 Market value\nprice\nN/A\nCost/\nFinancial assets measured at fair value Approach If cost ceases to be a representative measure of fair value, an\nD.7.\n(unquoted equity instruments)\nFair value 3\nbased on internal valuation is carried out, based mainly on comparables.\ncomparables\nThe fair value of contingent consideration receivable is\nFinancial assets measured at fair value\nRevenue-\ndetermined by adjusting the contingent consideration at\nD.7.\n(contingent consideration receivable)\nFair value 3 based\nthe end of the reporting period using the method described\napproach\nin Note D.7.3.\nFinancial assets measured at fair value\nQuoted market\nD.7. held to meet obligations under Fair value 1 Market value\nprice\nN/A\npost-employment benefit plans\nFinancial assets designated at fair value\nQuoted market\nD.7. held to meet obligations under deferred Fair value 1 Market value\nprice\nN/A\ncompensation plans\nThe amortized cost of long-term loans and advances and other\nLong-term loans and advances and other\nD.7.\nnon-current receivables\nAmortized cost N/A N/A non-current receivables at the end of the reporting period is\nnot materially different from their fair value.\nD.13.

Derecognition of financial instruments\nFinancial assets are derecognized when the contractual rights to cash flows from the asset have ended or have been transferred\nand when Sanofi has transferred substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the asset. If Sanofi has neither transferred\nnor retained substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of a financial asset, it is derecognized if Sanofi does not retain\ncontrol of the asset.\nA financial liability is derecognized when Sanofi’s contractual obligations in respect of the liability are discharged, cancelled or\nextinguished.\nB.8.7. Risks relating to financial instruments\nMarket risks in respect of non-current financial assets, cash equivalents, derivative instruments and debt are described in the\ndiscussions of risk factors presented in Item 3.D. and Item 11. of Sanofi’s annual report on Form 20-F for 2023.\nCredit risk is the risk that customers may fail to pay their debts. For a description of credit risk, refer to “We are subject to the risk\nof non-payment by our customers” within Item 3.D. and Item 11. of Sanofi’s annual report on Form 20-F for 2023.\nB.9. Inventories\nInventories are measured at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Cost is calculated using the weighted average cost method\nor the first-in, first-out method, depending on the nature of the inventory.\nThe cost of finished goods inventories includes costs of purchase, costs of conversion and other costs incurred in bringing the\ninventories to their present location and condition.\nNet realizable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business less the estimated costs of completion and\nthe estimated costs necessary to make the sale.\nDuring the launch phase of a new product, any inventories of that product are written down to zero pending regulatory approval,\nother than in specific circumstances which make it possible to estimate that there is a high probability at the end of the reporting\nperiod that the carrying amount of the inventories will be recoverable. The write-down is reversed once it becomes highly\nprobable that marketing approval will be obtained.\nB.10. Cash and cash equivalents\nCash and cash equivalents as shown in the consolidated balance sheet and statement of cash flows comprise cash, plus liquid\nshort-term investments that are readily convertible into cash and are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value in the\nevent of movements in interest rates.\nB.11. Treasury shares\nIn accordance with IAS 32, Sanofi treasury shares are deducted from equity, irrespective of the purpose for which they are held.\nNo gain or loss is recognized in the income statement on the purchase, sale, impairment or cancellation of treasury shares.\nB.12. Provisions for risks\nIn accordance with IAS 37 (Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets), Sanofi records a provision when it has a\npresent obligation, whether legal or constructive, as a result of a past event; it is probable that an outflow of resources\nembodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation; and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the\noutflow of resources.\nIf the obligation is expected to be settled more than 12 months after the end of the reporting period, or has no definite settlement\ndate, the provision is recorded within Non-current provisions and other non-current liabilities.\nProvisions relating to the insurance programs in which Sanofi’s captive insurance company participates are based on risk\nexposure estimates calculated by management, with assistance from independent actuaries, using IBNR (Incurred But Not\nReported) techniques. Those techniques use past claims experience, within Sanofi and in the market, to estimate future trends in\nthe cost of claims.\nContingent liabilities are not recognized, but are disclosed in the notes to the financial statements unless the possibility of an\noutflow of economic resources is remote.\nSanofi estimates provisions on the basis of events and circumstances related to present obligations at the end of the reporting\nperiod and of past experience, and to the best of management’s knowledge at the date of preparation of the financial\nstatements.\nReimbursements offsetting the probable outflow of resources are recognized as assets only if it is virtually certain that they will\nbe received. Contingent assets are not recognized.\nRestructuring provisions are recognized if Sanofi has a detailed, formal restructuring plan at the end of the reporting period and\nhas announced its intention to implement this plan to those affected by it.\nSANOFI FORM 20-F 2023 F-23\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nNo provisions are recorded for future operating losses.\nSanofi records non-current provisions for certain obligations, such as legal or constructive obligations, where an outflow of\nresources is probable and the amount of the outflow can be reliably estimated.\nIn the case of environmental risks, including at sites where operations are ongoing, Sanofi recognizes a provision where there is a\nviolation of integrity in respect of human health or the environment resulting from past contamination at a site that requires\nremediation. The amount of the provision is a best estimate of the future expenditures to be incurred on the remediation plan.\nWhere the effect of the time value of money is material, those provisions are measured at the present value of the expenditures\nexpected to be required to settle the obligation, calculated using a discount rate that reflects an estimate of the time value of\nmoney and the risks specific to the obligation.\nIncreases in provisions to reflect the effects of the passage of time are recognized within Financial expenses.\nB.13. Revenue recognition\nB.13.1. Net sales\nRevenue arising from the sale of goods is presented in the income statement within Net sales. Net sales comprise revenue from\nsales of pharmaceutical products, consumer healthcare products, active ingredients and vaccines, net of sales returns, of\ncustomer incentives and discounts, and of certain sales-based payments paid or payable to the healthcare authorities. Analyses\nof net sales are provided in Note D.35.1. “Segment Information”.\nIn accordance with IFRS 15 (Revenue from Contracts with Customers), such revenue is recognized when Sanofi transfers control\nover the product to the customer; control of an asset refers to the ability to direct the use of, and obtain substantially all of the\nremaining benefits from that asset. For the vast majority of contracts, revenue is recognized when the product is physically\ntransferred, in accordance with the delivery and acceptance terms agreed with the customer.\nFor contracts entered into by Sanofi Pasteur, transfer of control is usually determined by reference to the terms of release\n(immediate or deferred) and acceptance of batches of vaccine.\nIn the case of contracts with distributors, Sanofi does not recognize revenue when the product is physically transferred to the\ndistributor if the products are sold on consignment, or if the distributor acts as agent. In such cases, revenue is recognized when\ncontrol is transferred to the end customer, and the distributor’s commission is presented within the line item Selling and general\nexpenses in the income statement.\nThe amount of revenue recognized reflects the various types of price reductions or rights of return offered by Sanofi to its\ncustomers on certain products. Such price reductions and rights of return qualify as variable consideration under IFRS 15.\nIn particular, products sold in the United States are covered by various Government and State programs (such as Medicare and\nMedicaid) under which products are sold at a discount. Rebates are granted to healthcare authorities, and under contractual\narrangements with certain customers. Some wholesalers are entitled to chargeback incentives based on the selling price to the\nend customer, under specific contractual arrangements. Cash discounts may also be granted for prompt payment. Returns,\ndiscounts, incentives and rebates, as described above, are recognized in the period in which the underlying sales are recognized\nas a reduction of gross sales.\nThese amounts are calculated as follows:\n• the amount of chargeback incentives is estimated on the basis of the relevant subsidiary’s standard sales terms and\nconditions, and in certain cases on the basis of specific contractual arrangements with the customer;\n• the amount of rebates based on attainment of sales targets is estimated and accrued as each of the underlying sales\ntransactions is recognized;\n• the amount of price reductions under Government and State programs, largely in the United States, is estimated on the basis\nof the specific terms of the relevant regulations or agreements, and accrued as each of the underlying sales transactions is\nrecognized;\n• the amount of sales returns is calculated on the basis of management’s best estimate of the amount of product that will\nultimately be returned by customers. In countries where product returns are possible, Sanofi operates a returns policy that\nallows the customer to return products within a certain period either side of the expiry date (usually 12 months after the expiry\ndate). The amount recognized for returns is estimated on the basis of past experience of sales returns. Sanofi also takes into\naccount factors such as levels of inventory in its various distribution channels, product expiry dates, information about\npotential discontinuation of products, the entry of competing generics into the market, and the launch of over-the-counter\nmedicines. Most product return clauses relate solely to date-expired products, which cannot be resold and are destroyed.\nSanofi does not recognize a right of return asset in the balance sheet for contracts that allow for the return of time-expired\nproducts, since those products have no value.\nF-24 SANOFI FORM 20-F 2023\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nThe estimated amounts described above are recognized in the income statement within Net sales as a reduction of gross sales,\nand within Other current liabilities in the balance sheet. They are subject to regular review and adjustment as appropriate based\non the most recent data available to management. Sanofi believes that it has the ability to measure each of the above amounts\nreliably, using the following factors in developing its estimates:\n• the nature and patient profile of the underlying product;\n• the applicable regulations or the specific terms and conditions of contracts with governmental authorities, wholesalers and\nother customers;\n• historical data relating to similar contracts, in the case of qualitative and quantitative rebates and chargeback incentives;\n• past experience and sales growth trends for the same or similar products;\n• actual inventory levels in distribution channels, monitored by Sanofi using internal sales data and externally provided data;\n• the shelf life of Sanofi products; and\n• market trends including competition, pricing and demand.\nAn analysis of provisions for discounts, rebates and sales returns is provided in Note D.23.\nB.13.2. Other revenues\nThe line item Other revenues is used to recognize all revenue that falls within the scope of IFRS 15 but does not relate to sales of\nSanofi products.\nIt mainly comprises (i) royalties received from licensing intellectual property rights to third parties; (ii) VaxServe sales of products\nsourced from third-party manufacturers; and (iii) revenue received under agreements for Sanofi to provide manufacturing\nservices to third parties.\nRoyalties received under licensing arrangements are recognized over the period during which the underlying sales are\nrecognized.\nVaxServe is a Vaccines segment entity whose operations include the distribution within the United States of vaccines and\nother products manufactured by third parties. VaxServe sales of products sourced from third-party manufacturers are presented\nwithin Other revenues.\nB.14. Cost of sales\nCost of sales consists primarily of the industrial cost of goods sold, payments made under licensing agreements, and distribution\ncosts. The industrial cost of goods sold includes the cost of materials, depreciation of property, plant and equipment,\namortization of software, personnel costs, and other expenses attributable to production.\nB.15. Research and development\nNote B.4.1. “Research and development not acquired in a business combination” and Note B.4.3. “Other intangible assets\nacquired in a business combination” describe the principles applied to the recognition of research and development costs.\nContributions or reimbursements received from alliance partners are recorded as a reduction of Research and development\nexpenses.\nB.16. Other operating income and expenses\nB.16.1. Other operating income\nOther operating income includes the share of profits that Sanofi is entitled to receive from alliance partners in respect of\nproduct marketing agreements. It also includes revenues generated under certain agreements, which may include partnership,\nco-promotion arrangements and licenses not included in Other revenues.\nThis line item also includes realized and unrealized foreign exchange gains and losses on operating activities (see Note B.8.3.), and\noperating gains on disposals not regarded as major disposals (see Note B.20.).\nB.16.2. Other operating expenses\nOther operating expenses mainly comprise the share of profits that alliance partners are entitled to receive from Sanofi under\nproduct marketing agreements.\nB.17. Amortization and impairment of intangible assets\nB.17.1. Amortization of intangible assets\nThe expenses recorded in this line item comprise amortization charged against intangible assets (products, trademarks and\ntechnology platforms, see Note D.4.) whose contribution to Sanofi’s commercial, industrial and development functions cannot be\nseparately identified.\nSANOFI FORM 20-F 2023 F-25\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nAmortization of software, and of other rights of an industrial or operational nature, is recognized as an expense in the income\nstatement, in the relevant line items of expense by function.\nB.17.2. Impairment of intangible assets\nThis line item records impairment losses taken against intangible assets (products, trademarks, technology platforms and\nacquired research), and any reversals of such impairment losses.\nB.18. Fair value remeasurement of contingent consideration\nChanges in the fair value of contingent consideration that was (i) already carried in the books of an acquired entity, or (ii) granted\nin connection with a business combination and initially recognized as a liability in accordance with IFRS 3, are reported in profit or\nloss. Such adjustments are reported separately in the income statement, in the line item Fair value remeasurement of\ncontingent consideration.\nThis line item also includes changes in the fair value of contingent consideration receivable in connection with a divestment and\nclassified as a financial asset at fair value through profit or loss.\nFinally, it includes the effect of the unwinding of discount, and of exchange rate movements where the asset or liability is\nexpressed in a currency other than the functional currency of the reporting entity.\nB.19. Restructuring costs and similar items\nRestructuring costs are expenses incurred in connection with the transformation or reorganization of Sanofi’s operations or\nsupport functions. Such costs include collective redundancy plans, compensation to third parties for early termination of\ncontracts, and commitments made in connection with transformation or reorganization decisions. They also include accelerated\ndepreciation charges arising from site closures (including closures of leased sites), and losses on asset disposals resulting from\nsuch decisions.\nIn addition, this line item includes expenses incurred in connection with programs implemented as part of the transformation\nstrategy announced in December 2019 (and previously in November 2015), and intended primarily (i) to deliver a global\ninformation systems solution, further supported by the implementation from 2021 of Sanofi’s new digital strategy; and (ii) to\ncreate a standalone CHC entity and proceed to the proposed separation of the CHC business as announced when the new\nchapter in the Play to Win strategy was presented in October 2023.\nB.20. Other gains and losses, and litigation\nThe line item Other gains and losses, and litigation includes the impact of material transactions of an unusual nature or amount\nwhich Sanofi believes it necessary to report separately in the income statement in order to improve the relevance of the financial\nstatements, such as:\n• gains and losses on major disposals of property, plant and equipment, of intangible assets, of assets (or groups of assets and\nliabilities) held for sale, or of a business within the meaning of IFRS 3, other than those considered to be restructuring costs;\n• impairment losses and reversals of impairment losses on assets (or groups of assets and liabilities) held for sale, other than\nthose considered to be restructuring costs;\n• gains on bargain purchases;\n• costs relating to major litigation; and\n• pre-tax separation costs associated with the process of disinvesting from operations in the event of a major divestment.\nB.21. Financial expenses and income\nB.21.1. Financial expenses\nFinancial expenses mainly comprise interest charges on debt financing; negative changes in the fair value of certain financial\ninstruments (where changes in fair value are recognized in profit or loss); realized and unrealized foreign exchange losses on\nfinancing and investing activities; impairment losses on financial instruments; and any reversals of impairment losses on financial\ninstruments.\nFinancial expenses also include expenses arising from the unwinding of discount on long-term provisions, and the net interest\ncost related to employee benefits. This line item does not include commercial cash discounts, which are deducted from net sales.\nB.21.2. Financial income\nFinancial income includes interest and dividend income; positive changes in the fair value of certain financial instruments (where\nchanges in fair value are recognized in profit or loss); realized and unrealized foreign exchange gains on financing and investing\nactivities; and gains on disposals of financial assets at fair value through profit or loss.\nF-26 SANOFI FORM 20-F 2023\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nB.22. Income tax expense\nIncome tax expense includes all current and deferred taxes of consolidated companies.\nSanofi accounts for deferred taxes in accordance with IAS 12 (Income Taxes), using the methods described below:\n• deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized on taxable and deductible temporary differences, and on tax loss carry-\nforwards. Temporary differences are differences between the carrying amount of an asset or liability in the balance sheet and\nits tax base;\n• French business taxes include a value added based component: “CVAE” (Cotisation sur la Valeur Ajoutée des Entreprises).\nGiven that CVAE is (i) calculated as the amount by which certain revenues exceed certain expenses and (ii) borne primarily by\ncompanies that own intellectual property rights on income derived from those rights (royalties, and margin on sales to third\nparties and to Sanofi entities), it is regarded as meeting the definition of income taxes specified in IAS 12, paragraph 2 (“taxes\nwhich are based on taxable profits”);\n• deferred tax assets and liabilities are calculated using the tax rate expected to apply in the period when the corresponding\ntemporary differences are expected to reverse, based on tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the end of the\nreporting period;\n• deferred tax assets are recognized in respect of deductible temporary differences, tax losses available for carry-forward and\nunused tax credits to the extent that future recovery is regarded as probable. The recoverability of deferred tax assets is\nassessed on a case-by-case basis, taking into account the profit forecasts contained in Sanofi’s medium-term business plan;\n• a deferred tax liability is recognized for temporary differences relating to interests in subsidiaries, associates and joint\nventures, except in cases where Sanofi is able to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences. This applies\nin particular when Sanofi is able to control dividend policy and it is probable that the temporary differences will not reverse in\nthe foreseeable future;\n• no deferred tax is recognized on eliminations of intragroup transfers of interests in subsidiaries, associates or joint ventures;\n• each tax entity calculates its own net deferred tax position. All net deferred tax asset and liability positions are then\naggregated and shown in separate line items on the relevant side of the consolidated balance sheet. Deferred tax assets and\nliabilities are offset only if (i) Sanofi has a legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets and current tax liabilities, and\n(ii) the deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority;\n• deferred taxes are not discounted, except implicitly in the case of deferred taxes on assets and liabilities which are already\nimpacted by discounting. In addition, Sanofi has elected not to discount current taxes payable or receivable where the\namounts in question are payable or receivable in the long term;\n• withholding taxes on intragroup royalties and dividends, and on royalties and dividends collected from third parties, are\naccounted for as current income taxes.\nIn accounting for business combinations, Sanofi complies with IFRS 3 as regards the recognition of deferred tax assets after the\ninitial accounting period. Consequently, any deferred tax assets recognized by the acquiree after the end of that period in\nrespect of temporary differences or tax loss carry-forwards existing at the acquisition date are recognized in profit or loss.\nThe positions adopted by Sanofi in tax matters are based on its interpretation of tax laws and regulations. Some of those positions\nmay be subject to uncertainty. In such cases, Sanofi assesses the amount of the tax liability on the basis of the following\nassumptions: that its position will be examined by one or more tax authorities on the basis of all relevant information; that a\ntechnical assessment is carried out with reference to legislation, case law, regulations, and established practice; and that each\nposition is assessed individually (or collectively where appropriate), with no offset or aggregation between positions. Those\nassumptions are assessed on the basis of facts and circumstances existing at the end of the reporting period. When an uncertain\ntax liability is regarded as probable, it is measured on the basis of Sanofi’s best estimate and recognized as a liability; uncertain tax\nassets are not recognized. The amount of the liability includes any penalties and late payment interest. The line item Income tax\nexpense includes the effects of tax reassessments and tax disputes, and any penalties and late payment interest arising from\nsuch disputes that have the characteristics of income taxes within the meaning of paragraph 2 of IAS 12 (“taxes which are based\non taxable profits”). Tax exposures relating to corporate income taxes are presented separately within Non-current income tax\nliabilities (see Note D.19.4.).\nNo deferred taxation is recognized on temporary differences that are liable to be subject to US global intangible low\ntaxed income (GILTI) provisions. The related tax expense is recognized in the year in which it is declared in the tax return to the\nextent that it arises from the existence of non-US profits that exceed the theoretical return on investment specified in the\nGILTI provisions and are taxed at a rate lower than the applicable US tax rate.\nIn accordance with IAS 1 (Presentation of Financial Statements), current income tax assets and liabilities are presented as\nseparate line items in the consolidated balance sheet.\nB.23. Employee benefit obligations\nSanofi offers retirement benefits to employees and retirees. Such benefits are accounted for in accordance with IAS 19 (Employee\nBenefits).\nBenefits are provided in the form of either defined contribution plans or defined benefit plans. In the case of defined contribution\nplans, the cost is recognized immediately in the period in which it is incurred, and equates to the amount of the contributions paid\nby Sanofi. For defined benefit plans, Sanofi generally recognizes its obligations to pay pensions and similar benefits to employees\nas a liability, based on an actuarial estimate of the rights vested or currently vesting in employees and retirees, using the\nprojected unit credit method. Estimates are performed at least once a year, and rely on financial assumptions (such as discount\nSANOFI FORM 20-F 2023 F-27\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nrates) and demographic assumptions (such as life expectancy, retirement age, employee turnover, and the rate of salary\nincreases).\nObligations relating to other post-employment benefits (healthcare and life insurance) offered by Sanofi companies to\nemployees are also recognized as a liability based on an actuarial estimate of the rights vested or currently vesting in employees\nand retirees at the end of the reporting period.\nSuch liabilities are recognized net of the fair value of plan assets.\nIn the case of multi-employer defined benefit plans where plan assets cannot be allocated to each participating employer with\nsufficient reliability, the plan is accounted for as a defined contribution plan, in accordance with paragraph 34 of IAS 19.\nThe benefit cost for the period consists primarily of current service cost, past service cost, net interest cost, gains or losses arising\nfrom plan settlements not specified in the terms of the plan, and actuarial gains or losses arising from plan curtailments. Net\ninterest cost for the period is determined by applying the discount rate specified in IAS 19 to the net liability (i.e. the amount of\nthe obligation, net of plan assets) recognized in respect of defined benefit plans. Past service cost is recognized immediately in\nprofit or loss in the period in which it is incurred, regardless of whether or not the rights have vested at the time of adoption\n(in the case of a new plan) or of amendment (in the case of an existing plan).\nActuarial gains and losses on defined benefit plans (pensions and other post-employment benefits), also referred to\nas “Remeasurements of the net defined benefit liability (asset)”, arise as a result of changes in financial and demographic\nassumptions, experience adjustments, and the difference between the actual return and interest cost on plan assets. The impacts\nof those remeasurements are recognized in Other comprehensive income, net of deferred taxes; they are not subsequently\nreclassifiable to profit or loss.\nB.24. Share-based payment\nShare-based payment expense is recognized as a component of operating income, in the relevant classification of expense by\nfunction. In measuring the expense, the level of attainment of any performance conditions is taken into account.\nB.24.1. Stock option plans\nSanofi has granted a number of equity-settled share-based payment plans (stock option plans) to some of its employees. The\nterms of those plans may make the award contingent on the attainment of performance criteria for some of the grantees.\nIn accordance with IFRS 2 (Share-Based Payment), services received from employees as consideration for stock options are\nrecognized as an expense in the income statement, with the opposite entry recognized in equity. The expense corresponds to the\nfair value of the stock option plans, and is charged to income on a straight-line basis over the four-year vesting period of the plan.\nThe fair value of stock option plans is measured at the date of grant using the Black-Scholes valuation model, taking into account\nthe expected life of the options. The resulting expense also takes into account the expected cancellation rate of the options. The\nexpense is adjusted over the vesting period to reflect actual cancellation rates resulting from option-holders ceasing to be\nemployed by Sanofi.\nB.24.2. Employee share ownership plans\nSanofi may offer its employees the opportunity to subscribe to reserved share issues at a discount to the reference market price.\nShares awarded to employees under such plans fall within the scope of IFRS 2. Consequently, an expense is recognized at the\nsubscription date, based on the value of the discount offered to employees.\nB.24.3. Restricted share plans\nSanofi may award restricted share plans to certain of its employees. The terms of those plans may make the award contingent on\nthe attainment of performance criteria for some of the grantees.\nIn accordance with IFRS 2, an expense equivalent to the fair value of such plans is recognized in profit or loss on a straight line\nbasis over the vesting period of the plan, with the opposite entry recognized in equity. The vesting period is three years.\nThe fair value of restricted share plans is based on the quoted market price of Sanofi shares at the date of grant, adjusted for\nexpected dividends during the vesting period; it also takes account of any vesting conditions contingent on stock market\nperformance, measured using the Monte-Carlo valuation model. Other vesting conditions are taken into account in the estimate\nof the number of shares awarded during the vesting period; that number is then definitively adjusted based on the actual number\nof shares awarded on the vesting date.\nB.25. Earnings per share\nBasic earnings per share is calculated using the weighted average number of shares outstanding during the reporting period,\nadjusted on a time-weighted basis from the acquisition date to reflect the number of own shares held by Sanofi. Diluted earnings\nper share is calculated on the basis of the weighted average number of ordinary shares, computed using the treasury stock\nmethod.\nThis method assumes that (i) all outstanding dilutive options and warrants are exercised, and (ii) Sanofi acquires its own shares at\nthe quoted market price for an amount equivalent to the cash received as consideration for the exercise of the options or\nwarrants, plus the expense arising on unamortized stock options.\nF-28 SANOFI FORM 20-F 2023\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nB.26. Segment information\nIn accordance with IFRS 8 (Operating Segments), the segment information reported by Sanofi is prepared on the basis of internal\nmanagement data provided to our Chief Executive Officer, who is the chief operating decision maker of Sanofi. The performance\nof those segments is monitored individually using internal reports and common indicators.\nIn 2022, Sanofi reported three operating segments (Pharmaceuticals, Vaccines and Consumer Healthcare). The costs of the\nglobal support functions (Corporate Affairs, Finance, People & Culture, Legal, Ethics, Business Integrity & Global Security,\nInformation Solutions & Technology, Sanofi Business Services, etc.), which are mainly managed centrally at group-wide level,\nwere presented within the “Other” category.\nIn 2023, Sanofi reviewed the presentation of its segment information following adjustments to its internal reporting systems\nin order to reflect (i) progress on the “Play to Win” strategy leading to the creation of the standalone Consumer Healthcare\nGlobal Business Unit (GBU) which, in addition to integrated research, development and production functions now also has\nits own dedicated global support functions (including Finance, People & Culture, Legal, Ethics, Business Integrity & Global\nSecurity, Information Solutions & Technology, Global Business Services, etc.); and (ii) organizational changes to Sanofi’s\nManufacturing & Supply global function (previously known as Industrial Affairs).\nConsequently, with effect from January 1, 2023, Sanofi reports two operating segments: Biopharma and Consumer Healthcare.\nThe Biopharma operating segment comprises commercial operations and research, development and production activities\nrelating to the Specialty Care, General Medicines and Vaccines franchises, for all geographical territories. The segment’s results\ninclude the costs of global support functions that are not within the managerial responsibility of the Consumer Healthcare GBU.\nThe Consumer Healthcare operating segment comprises commercial operations relating to Consumer Healthcare products, and\nresearch, development and production activities and global support functions (as listed above) dedicated to the segment, for all\ngeographical territories. The Consumer Healthcare GBU segment’s results reflect all incurred costs of global support functions\nattributable to its business.\nThe “Other” category comprises reconciling items, primarily but not limited to (i) gains and losses on centralized foreign exchange\nrisk hedging transactions that cannot be allocated to the operating segments and (ii) gains and losses on retained commitments\nin respect of previously divested operations.\nInformation about operating segments for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021 is presented in Note D.35.,\n“Segment information”.\nB.27. Management of capital\nIn order to maintain or adjust the capital structure, Sanofi can adjust the amount of dividends paid to shareholders, repurchase its\nown shares, issue new shares, or issue securities giving access to its capital.\nThe following objectives are defined under the terms of Sanofi’s share repurchase programs:\n• the implementation of any stock option plan giving entitlement to purchase shares in the Sanofi parent company;\n• the allotment or sale of shares to employees under statutory profit sharing schemes and employee savings plans;\n• the consideration-free allotment of shares (i.e. restricted share plans);\n• the cancellation of some or all of the repurchased shares;\n• market-making in the secondary market by an investment services provider under a liquidity contract in compliance with the\nethical code recognized by the Autorité des marchés financiers (AMF);\n• the delivery of shares on the exercise of rights attached to securities giving access to the capital by redemption, conversion,\nexchange, presentation of a warrant or any other means;\n• the delivery of shares (in exchange, as payment, or otherwise) in connection with mergers and acquisitions;\n• the execution by an investment services provider of purchases, sales or transfers by any means, in particular via off-market\ntrading; or\n• any other purpose that is or may in the future be authorized under the applicable laws and regulations.\nSanofi is not subject to any constraints on equity capital imposed by third parties.\nTotal equity includes Equity attributable to equity holders of Sanofi and Equity attributable to non-controlling interests, as\nshown in the consolidated balance sheet.\nSanofi defines “Net debt” as (i) the sum of short-term debt, long-term debt and interest rate derivatives and currency derivatives\nused to hedge debt, minus (ii) the sum of cash and cash equivalents and interest rate derivatives and currency derivatives used to\nhedge cash and cash equivalents.\nSANOFI FORM 20-F 2023 F-29\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nC/ Principal alliances\nC.1. Alliance arrangements with Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Regeneron)\nCollaboration agreements on human therapeutic antibodies\nIn November 2007, Sanofi and Regeneron signed two agreements (amended in November 2009) relating to human therapeutic\nantibodies: (i) the Discovery and Preclinical Development Agreement, and (ii) the License and Collaboration Agreement, relating\nto clinical development and commercialization. Under the License and Collaboration Agreement, Sanofi had an option to develop\nand commercialize antibodies discovered by Regeneron under the Discovery and Preclinical Development Agreement.\nDiscovery and development\nBecause Sanofi decided not to exercise its option to extend the Discovery and Preclinical Development Agreement, that\nagreement expired on December 31, 2017.\nAs a result of Sanofi’s exercise of an option with respect to an antibody under the Discovery and Preclinical Development\nAgreement, such antibody became a “Licensed Product” under the License and Collaboration Agreement, pursuant to which\nSanofi and Regeneron co-develop the antibody with Sanofi initially being wholly responsible for funding the development\nprogram. On receipt of the first positive Phase 3 trial results for any antibody being developed under the License and\nCollaboration Agreement, the subsequent development costs for that antibody are split 80% Sanofi, 20% Regeneron. Amounts\nreceived from Regeneron under the License and Collaboration Agreement are recognized by Sanofi as a reduction in the line\nitem Research and development expenses. Co-development with Regeneron of the antibodies DUPIXENT, KEVZARA and\nREGN3500 (SAR440340 - itepekimab) is ongoing under the License and Collaboration Agreement as of December 31, 2023.\nOnce a product begins to be commercialized, and provided that the share of quarterly results under the agreement represents a\nprofit, Sanofi is entitled to an additional portion of Regeneron’s profit-share (capped at 20% of Regeneron’s share of quarterly\nprofits since April 1, 2022, and at 10% until March 31, 2022) until Regeneron has paid 50% of the cumulative development costs\nincurred by the parties in the collaboration (see Note D.21.1.).\nOn the later of (i) 24 months before the scheduled launch date or (ii) the first positive Phase 3 trial results, Sanofi and Regeneron\nshare the commercial expenses of the antibodies co-developed under the License and Collaboration Agreement.\nCommercialization\nSanofi is the lead party with respect to the commercialization of all co-developed antibodies, and Regeneron has certain option\nrights to co-promote the antibodies. Regeneron has exercised its co-promotion rights in the United States and in certain other\ncountries. Sanofi recognizes all sales of the antibodies. Profits and losses arising from commercial operations in the United States\nare split 50/50. Outside the United States, Sanofi is entitled to between 55% and 65% of profits depending on sales of the\nantibodies, and bears 55% of any losses. The share of profits and losses due to or from Regeneron under the agreement is\nrecognized within the line items Other operating income or Other operating expenses, which are components of Operating\nincome.\nIn addition, Regeneron is entitled to receive payments contingent on the attainment of specified levels of aggregate sales on all\nantibodies outside the United States, on a rolling twelve-month basis. A liability for those payments is recognized on the balance\nsheet when it is probable that the specified level of aggregate sales will be met. The opposite entry for that liability is capitalized\nwithin Other intangible assets on the balance sheet. Two payments of $50 million each were made in 2022, following\nattainment first of $2.0 billion and then of $2.5 billion in sales of all antibodies outside the United States on a rolling twelve-month\nbasis. The final milestone payment of $50 million, payable to Regeneron in the event that $3.0 billion in sales on a rolling twelve-\nmonth basis is attained, was made in 2023.\nAmendments to the collaboration agreements\nIn January 2018, Sanofi and Regeneron signed a set of amendments to their collaboration agreements, including an amendment\nthat allowed for the funding of additional programs on DUPIXENT and REGN3500 (SAR440340 – itepekimab) with an intended\nfocus on extending the current range of indications, finding new indications, and improving co-morbidity between multiple\npathologies.\nEffective April 1, 2020, Sanofi and Regeneron signed a Cross License and Commercialization Agreement for PRALUENT, whereby\nSanofi obtained sole ex-US rights to PRALUENT, and Regeneron obtained sole US rights to PRALUENT along with a right to 5%\nroyalties on Sanofi’s sales of PRALUENT outside the United States. Each party is solely responsible for funding the development,\nmanufacturing and commercialization of PRALUENT in their respective territories. Although each party has sole responsibility for\nsupplying PRALUENT in its respective territory, Sanofi and Regeneron entered into agreements to support manufacturing needs\nfor each other.\nEffective September 30, 2021, Sanofi and Regeneron signed an amendment to their collaboration agreement in order to specify\nallocations of responsibilities and associated resources between the two parties in connection with the co-promotion\nof DUPIXENT in certain countries. The terms of the collaboration relating to REGN3500 (SAR440340 – itepekimab) are\nunchanged.\nF-30 SANOFI FORM 20-F 2023\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nEffective July 1, 2022, Sanofi and Regeneron signed an amendment to their collaboration agreement in order to increase the\nadditional portion of Regeneron’s quarterly profit-share attributable to Sanofi from 10% to 20% with retroactive impact as of\nApril 1, 2022.\nImmuno-oncology (IO) collaboration agreements\nOn July 1, 2015, Sanofi and Regeneron signed two agreements – the IO Discovery and Development Agreement and the IO\nLicense and Collaboration Agreement (IO LCA) – relating to new antibody cancer treatments in the field of immuno-oncology.\nThe Amended IO Discovery Agreement, effective from December 31, 2018, was terminated through a Letter Amendment dated\nMarch 16, 2021 in which Sanofi formalized its opt-out from the BCMAxCD3 and MUC16xCD3 programs.\nLIBTAYO (cemiplimab)\nUnder the 2015 IO LCA as amended in January 2018, Sanofi and Regeneron committed funding of no more than $1,640 million,\nsplit on a 50/50 basis ($820 million per company), for the development of REGN2810 (cemiplimab, trademark LIBTAYO), a PD-1\ninhibitor antibody. The funding was raised to $1,840 million by way of amendment effective on September 30, 2021. Regeneron\nwas responsible for the commercialization of LIBTAYO in the United States, and Sanofi in all other territories. Sanofi has exercised\nits option to co-promote LIBTAYO in the United States. In 2021, Regeneron exercised its option to co-promote LIBTAYO in\ncertain other countries.\nThe IO LCA also provided for a one-time milestone payment of $375 million by Sanofi to Regeneron in the event that sales of a\nPD-1 product were to exceed, in the aggregate, $2 billion in any consecutive 12-month period.\nUnder the IO LCA Sanofi and Regeneron shared equally in profits and losses generated by the commercialization of collaboration\nproducts, except that Sanofi was entitled to an additional portion of Regeneron’s profit-share (capped at 10% of Regeneron’s\nshare of quarterly profits) until Regeneron had paid 50% of the cumulative development costs incurred by the parties under the\nIO Discovery Agreement, as amended.\nLIBTAYO is approved in the United States and Europe for the treatment of two types of locally advanced or metastatic skin\ncancer (cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma and basal cell carcinoma) and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). It is also approved\nin Brazil and Canada as a second line treatment for recurring or metastatic cervical cancer. In the fourth quarter of 2022, it was\napproved in the United States in association with chemotherapy for the treatment of NSCLC, and in Europe and Japan as a\nsecond line treatment for recurring or metastatic cervical cancer. LIBTAYO is currently approved in more than 30 countries.\nIn June 2022, Sanofi and Regeneron restructured their IO LCA. Under the terms of the Amended and Restated IO LCA,\nRegeneron holds exclusive worldwide licensing rights to LIBTAYO with effect from July 1, 2022.\nIn July 2022, Sanofi received as consideration an upfront payment of $900 million (€856 million), which was recognized within\nOther operating income on the date of receipt. The same line item also includes a regulatory milestone payment of $100 million\n(€96 million) following the US FDA approval in November 2022 of LIBTAYO in combination with chemotherapy as a first line\ntreatment for NSCLC. In addition, Sanofi is entitled to royalties of 11% and to milestone payments (€116 million in 2023, €111 million\nin 2022) linked to global net sales of LIBTAYO; those royalties are recognized within Other operating income in line with the\npattern of sales. All of the cash inflows relating to the above items (€196 million in 2023, €952 million in 2022) are presented\nwithin Net cash provided by/(used in) operating activities in the consolidated statement of cash flows.\nThe amendment to the terms of the IO LCA resulted in Sanofi recognizing an accelerated amortization charge of €226 million\nin 2022; this was allocated to the LIBTAYO product rights included within the residual carrying amount of the intangible asset\nrecognized in July 2015 to reflect rights to an antibody targeting the immune checkpoint receptor PD-1 (programmed cell death\nprotein-1) under the Sanofi/Regeneron alliance.\nThe transaction also includes a time-limited transitional services agreement with Regeneron which includes manufacturing,\ndistribution (for which Sanofi acts as agent), and promotion.\nInvestor agreement\nIn 2014 and 2020, Sanofi and Regeneron amended the investor agreement entered into by the two companies in 2007. Under\nthe terms of the amendments, Sanofi accepted various restrictions, including “standstill” provisions that contractually prohibit\nSanofi from seeking to directly or indirectly exert control of Regeneron or acquiring more than 30% of Regeneron’s capital stock\n(consisting of the outstanding shares of common stock and the shares of Class A stock). This prohibition remains in place until the\nearlier of (i) the later of the fifth anniversaries of the expiration or earlier termination of the ZALTRAP collaboration agreement\nwith Regeneron (related to the development and commercialization of ZALTRAP) or the collaboration agreement with Regeneron\non monoclonal antibodies (see “Collaboration agreements on human therapeutic antibodies” above), each as amended or\n(ii) other specified events.\nStarting in 2018 Sanofi began to sell shares of Regeneron stock and announced on May 29, 2020 the closing of its sale of\n13 million shares of Regeneron common stock in a registered offering and a private sale to Regeneron (see Note D.2.).\nPursuant to subsequent sales in 2022, Sanofi no longer holds any shares of Regeneron stock, as of December 31, 2023.\nSANOFI FORM 20-F 2023 F-31\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nC.2. Agreements on the commercialization of BEYFORTUS (nirsevimab, previously\nMEDI8897) in the US\nOn March 1, 2017, Sanofi and AstraZeneca entered into an agreement to develop and commercialize a monoclonal antibody\n(MEDI8897, nirsevimab) for the prevention of Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) associated illness in newborns and infants.\nUnder the terms of the agreement, Sanofi made an upfront payment of €120 million in March 2017, a development milestone\npayment of €30 million in the third quarter of 2019, a regulatory milestone payment of €25 million associated with the approval of\nBEYFORTUS (nirsevimab) by the EMA in Europe in November 2022, and a regulatory milestone payment of €65 million associated\nwith the approval of BEYFORTUS (nirsevimab) by the US FDA in July 2023. In addition, Sanofi could pay up to €375 million if sales\nobjectives are met. Those amounts are recognized as a component of the value of the intangible asset when payment becomes\nprobable. During 2023, an amount of €25 million was recognized as an accrued expense further to a contractual threshold being\npassed.\nThe agreement also specifies that AstraZeneca is responsible for development and manufacturing, and Sanofi for\ncommercialization. Sanofi recognizes the sales and cost of sales (purchases of finished products from AstraZeneca) and shares\nthe Alliance’s commercial profits (i) 50/50 in major territories and (ii) based on 25% of net sales in other territories. The share of\ncommercial profits and losses due to or from AstraZeneca is recognized as a component of operating income, within the line\nitems Other operating income or Other operating expenses. In addition, Sanofi and AstraZeneca share development costs\n50/50, with Sanofi’s portion recognized within the income statement line item Research and development expenses.\nOn April 9, 2023, Sanofi and AstraZeneca simplified their contractual agreements for the development and commercialization of\nBEYFORTUS (nirsevimab) in the US. Sanofi thereby obtained control of all commercial rights to BEYFORTUS (nirsevimab) in the\nUS, and ended the sharing of commercial profits between the two partners in that territory. In line with the terms of the revised\nagreements and in accordance with IAS 38, Sanofi recognized an intangible asset of €1.6 billion for the fair value of the additional\nUS rights. On the same date, AstraZeneca and Sobi ended their participation agreement, signed in 2018, which transferred the\neconomic rights for the US territory to Sobi.\nSanofi simultaneously entered into an agreement with Sobi relating to direct royalties on US net sales of BEYFORTUS\n(nirsevimab). In line with the terms of that agreement, on April 9, 2023 Sanofi recognized a financial liability amounting to\n€1.6 billion. That liability is classified as a financial liability at amortized cost under IFRS 9. Other than royalty payments,\nsubsequent movements in the liability comprise (i) the unwinding of discount and (ii) changes in estimates of future cash outflows\nfor royalty payments. Those movements will be recognized in the income statement within Net financial income/(expenses) in\naccordance with paragraph B.5.4.6 of IFRS 9.\nAs of December 31, 2023 the liability was remeasured by an amount of €541 million, reflecting the strong success of the US launch\nof BEYFORTUS (nirsevimab), which led to sales forecasts being revised upward from the initial estimate. The resulting adjustment\nwas recognized within Financial expenses.\nFor territories other than the US (except for China, which is now considered a “major market,” with profits/losses shared 50/50\nwith AstraZeneca), the existing agreement between AstraZeneca and Sanofi continues to govern the principal terms of the\ncollaboration: Sanofi recognizes the sales and cost of sales and shares the Alliance’s commercial profits with AstraZeneca.\nIn May 2023, data from the HARMONIE Phase 3b study confirmed that nirsevimab prevents infant hospitalizations due to RSV\nwith consistent and high efficacy.\nBEYFORTUS (nirsevimab) was approved in Europe in November 2022, and in the United States on July 17, 2023.\nD/ Presentation of the financial statements\nD.1. Principal changes in the scope of consolidation in 2023\nAcquisition of Provention Bio, Inc.\nOn March 13, 2023, Sanofi entered into a merger agreement with Provention Bio, Inc. (Provention), a US-based publicly traded\nbiopharmaceutical company developing therapies to prevent and intercept immune-mediated diseases including type 1 diabetes.\nUnder the terms of the agreement, Sanofi acquired the outstanding shares of Provention common stock for $25.00 per share in\nan all-cash transaction valued at approximately $2.8 billion.\nThe acquisition of Provention was completed on April 27, 2023, with Sanofi holding all of the shares of Provention on expiration of\nthe tender offer.\nSanofi applied the optional test to identify concentration of fair value under paragraph B7A of IFRS 3. The transaction was\naccounted for as an acquisition of a group of assets, given that the principal asset (teplizumab-mzwv, commercialized in the\nUnited States under the name TZIELD) concentrates substantially all of the fair value of the acquired set of activities and assets.\nUnder the terms of a share purchase agreement entered into by Sanofi and Provention in February 2023, Sanofi already held an\nequity interest in Provention, representing approximately 3% of Provention’s share capital. On the date Sanofi obtained control of\nProvention, that equity interest was remeasured at a price of $25.00 per share, representing a total amount of $68 million. The\nimpact of the remeasurement was recognized in Other comprehensive income.\nF-32 SANOFI FORM 20-F 2023\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nThe acquisition price for the shares not already held was $2,806 million. Out of the total price (including the fair value of the\nshares already held), $2,810 million was allocated to TZIELD and recognized within Other intangible assets. The difference\nbetween that amount and the acquisition price corresponds to the other assets acquired and liabilities assumed as part of the\ntransaction, after taking account of the previously-held shares and acquisition-related costs.\nThe impact of this acquisition as reflected within the line item Acquisitions of consolidated undertakings and investments\naccounted for using the equity method in the consolidated statement of cash flows is a net cash outflow of $2,722 million.\nAcquisition of QRIB Intermediate Holdings, LLC\nOn July 28, 2023, Sanofi announced that it had acquired QRIB Intermediate Holdings, LLC (QRIB), the owner of QUNOL, a\nmarket-leading US-based health & wellness brand. The acquisition strengthened Sanofi's Consumer Healthcare (CHC) operations\nin the Vitamin, Mineral and Supplements (VMS) category.\nThe acquisition of QRIB by Sanofi was completed on September 29, 2023, at a purchase price of $1,419 million.\nThe provisional purchase price allocation led to the recognition of goodwill of €475 million, determined as follows:\n(€ million) Fair value at acquisition date\nOther intangible assets 774\nOther current and non-current assets and liabilities 90\nCash and cash equivalents 8\nDeferred taxes, net (5)\nNet assets of QRIB Intermediate Holdings, LLC 867\nGoodwill 475\nPurchase price 1,342\nThe other acquired intangible assets identified consist of the QUNOL brand.\nGoodwill mainly represents the expected future profits attributable to the development of the VMS platform in the United States\nas a result of the integration of QRIB into the Sanofi group.\nThe entire amount of goodwill is deductible for tax purposes over a period of 15 years.\nSince the acquisition date, QRIB has generated net sales of €71 million, and has made an immaterial impact on consolidated net\nincome.\nThe acquisition-related costs were recognized in profit or loss during 2023 within the line item Other operating expenses; the\namount involved was immaterial.\nThe impact of this acquisition is reflected in Acquisitions of consolidated undertakings and investments accounted for using\nthe equity method in the consolidated statement of cash flows, and represents a net cash outflow of $1,410 million.\nSANOFI FORM 20-F 2023 F-33\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nD.2. Principal changes in the scope of consolidation in 2022 and 2021\nD.2.1. Principal changes in the scope of consolidation in 2022\nAcquisition of Amunix Pharmaceuticals, Inc.\nOn February 8, 2022, Sanofi acquired the entire share capital of the immuno-oncology company Amunix Pharmaceuticals, Inc.\n(Amunix), thereby gaining access to Amunix’s innovative PRO-XTEN technology and a promising pipeline of immunotherapies.\nThe acquisition price of Amunix comprises a fixed cash payment of €970 million, plus contingent consideration in the form of\nmilestone payments based on attainment of certain future development objectives of up to $225 million, the fair value of which\nas of the acquisition date was €156 million. In accordance with IFRS 3, this contingent purchase consideration was recognized in\nLiabilities related to business combinations and non-controlling interests (see Note D.18.).\nThe final purchase price allocation led to the recognition of €609 million of goodwill, determined as follows:\n(€ million) Fair value at acquisition date\nOther intangible assets 493\nOther current and non-current assets and liabilities (13)\nCash and cash equivalents 118\nDeferred taxes, net (81)\nNet assets of Amunix 517\nGoodwill 609\nPurchase price 1,126\n“Other intangible assets” comprise PRO-XTEN, an innovative universal protease-releasable masking technology platform for the\ndiscovery and development of transformative cytokine therapies and T-cell engager (TCE) immunotherapies for patients with\ncancer. In 2023, an impairment loss was taken against the PRO-XTEN platform, in line with a strategic decision to de-prioritize\ncertain R&D programs (see Note D.5., \"Impairment of intangible assets and property, plant and equipment’).\nGoodwill mainly represents the value of Amunix’s upstream research and development pipeline of immuno-oncology therapies\nbased on next-generation conditionally activated biologics, especially when combined with Sanofi’s existing oncology portfolio.\nThe goodwill generated on this acquisition does not give rise to any deduction for income tax purposes.\nAmunix has no commercial operations.\nThe impact of this acquisition as reflected within the line item Acquisitions of consolidated undertakings and investments\naccounted for using the equity method in the consolidated statement of cash flows is a cash outflow of €852 million.\nEUROAPI - Loss of control and accounting implications\nOn March 17, 2022, the Sanofi Board of Directors approved a decision to put to a shareholder vote the proposed distribution\nin kind of approximately 58% of the share capital of EUROAPI, thereby confirming Sanofi’s commitment (announced in\nFebruary 2020) to discontinue its active pharmaceutical ingredient operations. As part of the same corporate action and on the\nsame date, Sanofi entered into an investment agreement with EPIC Bpifrance, which undertook to acquire from Sanofi – via the\nFrench Tech Souveraineté fund – a 12% equity interest in EUROAPI at a price not exceeding €150 million and to be determined on\nthe basis of the volume weighted average price (VWAP) of EUROAPI shares on the Euronext Paris regulated market over\nthe thirty-day period starting from the date of initial listing, i.e. May 6, 2022. On completion of those transactions, Sanofi holds an\nequity interest of 30.1% in EUROAPI, which it has undertaken to retain for at least two years from the date of the distribution,\nsubject to the customary exceptions. With effect from that date, Sanofi exercises significant influence over EUROAPI as a result\nof (i) its equity interest, and (ii) having one representative on the EUROAPI Board of Directors.\nOn May 3, 2022, the General Meeting of Sanofi shareholders approved the decision of the Board of Directors to distribute\napproximately 58% of the share capital of EUROAPI in the form of an exceptional dividend in kind.\nOn May 10, 2022, the payment date of the dividend in kind in the days following the admission to listing of EUROAPI shares, those\nSanofi shareholders who had retained their Sanofi shares received 1 EUROAPI share per 23 Sanofi shares, representing in\ntotal 57.88% of the share capital of EUROAPI. As of that date, Sanofi lost control over the EUROAPI entities, based on an\nassessment of the criteria specified in IFRS 10 (Consolidated financial statements). The assets and liabilities of EUROAPI, which\nsince March 17, 2022 had been presented as assets and liabilities held for sale within the Sanofi statement of financial position in\naccordance with IFRS 5 (Non-Current Assets Held for Sale), were deconsolidated. In addition, because EUROAPI operations do\nnot constitute a discontinued operation under IFRS 5, the contribution from EUROAPI has not been presented within separate\nline items in the income statement and statement of cash flows or in information for prior comparative periods. The contribution\nof EUROAPI operations to the consolidated net sales of Sanofi in the year ended December 31, 2021 was €486 million.\nF-34 SANOFI FORM 20-F 2023\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nThe principal consequences of the deconsolidation of EUROAPI are described below:\n• the derecognition of the carrying amount of all the assets and liabilities of EUROAPI, representing a net amount\nof €1,227 million as of May 10, 2022. This includes goodwill of €164 million, determined in accordance with IAS 36 (“Impairment\nof Assets”), which was historically allocated to the Pharmaceuticals cash generating unit (CGU), and which for the purposes of\nthe deconsolidation was allocated using an alternative method based on the relative values of goodwill as of the date of\nconsolidation (the “notional goodwill method”). That method was considered more appropriate to the capital-intensive nature\nof EUROAPI operations than the method based on the relative values of EUROAPI operations and the retained portion of\nthe CGU;\n• a reduction in Equity attributable to equity holders of Sanofi reflecting the distribution in kind, measured at €793 million\nbased on the weighted average price of €14.58 per share as of the date of delivery of the EUROAPI shares to Sanofi\nshareholders and corresponding to the fair value of the distribution in accordance with IFRIC 17 (Distribution of Non-Cash\nAssets to Owners);\n• a cash inflow of €150 million from the divestment of 12% of the share capital of EUROAPI to EPIC Bpifrance as of the\nsettlement date of the shares, i.e. June 17, 2022;\n• the recognition in the statement of financial position, within the line item Investments accounted for using the equity\nmethod, of the retained 30.1% equity interest in EUROAPI at an amount of €413 million, determined on the basis of the\nweighted average price of €14.58 per share and representing the fair value of the equity interest in accordance with IFRS 10;\n• the reclassification within the net gain/loss on deconsolidation of unrealized foreign exchange losses amounting\nto €35 million arising on EUROAPI subsidiaries, in accordance with IAS 21 (The Effects of Changes in Foreign Exchange Rates);\n• the recognition of transaction-related costs and of the effects of undertakings made under agreements entered into\nwith EUROAPI setting out the principles and terms of the legal reorganization carried out ahead of the date of\ndeconsolidation. The principal undertakings made to EUROAPI relate to compensation for:\n– environmental remediation obligations on non-operational chemical sites in France transferred to EUROAPI, amounting\nto €14 million, and\n– regulatory compliance costs relating to certain state-of-the-art active pharmaceutical ingredients of EUROAPI, capped\nat €15 million.\nThese elements collectively resulted in a pre-tax loss on deconsolidation of €3 million, presented within the line item Other gains\nand losses, and litigation in the income statement. The tax effect of the deconsolidation was a net gain of €111 million, presented\nwithin the line item Income tax expense in the income statement.\nThe cash impact of the deconsolidation of EUROAPI, presented within the line item Disposals of consolidated undertakings\nand investments accounted for using the equity method in the statement of cash flows, was a net cash inflow of €101 million.\nSanofi has entered into an agreement with EUROAPI for the manufacture and supply of active pharmaceutical ingredients,\nintermediates and other substances, which took effect on October 1, 2021 and expires five years after the loss of control. Under\nthe terms of the agreement, Sanofi committed to target annual net sales of approximately €300 million for a list of specified\nactive ingredients until the agreement expires in 2026. As of December 31, 2022, that commitment amounted to €1.1 billion.\nAs of the date of deconsolidation, the 30.1% equity interest in EUROAPI is accounted for using the equity method in accordance\nwith IAS 28 (Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures), and the share of EUROAPI profits or losses arising from application of\nthe equity method is excluded from “Business operating income”, the non-IFRS financial indicator used internally by Sanofi to\nmeasure the performance of its operating segments.\nD.2.2. Principal changes in the scope of consolidation in 2021\nAcquisition of Kymab\nOn April 8, 2021, Sanofi acquired the entire share capital of Kymab for an upfront payment of $1.1 billion (€973 million) and up\nto $350 million contingent upon reaching certain development milestones.\nSanofi applied the optional test to identify concentration of fair value under paragraph B7A of IFRS 3. The transaction was\naccounted for as an asset acquisition given that the principal asset (the KY1005 project, currently in Phase 2 clinical\ndevelopment, and relating to the human monoclonal antibody OX40L, an essential regulator of the immune system) concentrates\nsubstantially all of the fair value of the acquired set of activities and assets.\nOf the total acquisition price paid, €965 million was allocated to Other intangible assets in accordance with IAS 38. The\ndifference between that amount and the acquisition price corresponds to the other assets acquired and liabilities assumed as\npart of the transaction.\nThe impact of this acquisition as reflected within the line item Acquisitions of consolidated undertakings and investments\naccounted for using the equity method in the consolidated statement of cash flows is a net cash outflow of €932 million.\nSANOFI FORM 20-F 2023 F-35\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nAcquisition of Kiadis\nOn November 2, 2020, Sanofi and Kiadis, a biopharmaceutical company developing novel \"off-the-shelf\" natural killer (NK) cell\ntherapies for patients with life-threatening diseases, entered into a definitive agreement whereby Sanofi was to make a public\noffer to acquire the entire share capital of Kiadis, i.e. 61 million shares, at a cash price of €5.45 per share.\nThe acquisition was approved unanimously by the Boards of Directors of Sanofi and Kiadis, and 95.03% of the share capital of\nKiadis had been tendered into the offer as of April 16, 2021. As of the end of the post-closing acceptance period on April 29, 2021,\nSanofi held 97.39% of the share capital of Kiadis, and proceeded to buy out the remaining non-controlling shareholders. As\nof December 31, 2022, Sanofi held 100.00% of the share capital of Kiadis.\nSanofi applied the optional test to identify concentration of fair value under paragraph B7A of IFRS 3. The transaction was\naccounted for as an asset acquisition given that the principal asset (the K-NK technology platform) concentrates substantially all\nof the fair value of the acquired set of activities and assets. In 2023, an impairment loss was recognized against the K-NK\ntechnology platform to reflect the impact of the strategic decision to de-prioritize certain R&D programs (see Note D.5.,\n\"Impairment of intangible assets and property, plant and equipment\").\nOf the total acquisition price paid, €339 million was allocated to Other intangible assets in accordance with IAS 38. The\ndifference between that amount and the acquisition price corresponds to the other assets acquired and liabilities assumed as\npart of the transaction.\nThe impact of this acquisition as reflected within the line item Acquisitions of consolidated undertakings and investments\naccounted for using the equity method in the consolidated statement of cash flows is a net cash outflow of €326 million.\nAcquisition of Tidal\nOn April 9, 2021, Sanofi acquired Tidal Therapeutics, a privately owned, pre-clinical stage biotech company with a unique mRNA-\nbased approach for in vivo reprogramming of immune cells.

The\ndifference between that amount and the acquisition price corresponds to the other assets acquired and liabilities assumed as\npart of the transaction.\nThe impact of this acquisition as reflected within the line item Acquisitions of consolidated undertakings and investments\naccounted for using the equity method in the consolidated statement of cash flows is a net cash outflow of €135 million.\nAcquisition of Translate Bio\nOn August 3, 2021, Sanofi entered into a definitive agreement with Translate Bio, a clinical-stage mRNA therapeutics company,\nunder which Sanofi was to acquire all outstanding shares of Translate Bio for $38 per share. The Sanofi and Translate Bio Boards\nof Directors unanimously approved the transaction.\nThe acquisition of Translate Bio by Sanofi was completed on September 14, 2021, with Sanofi holding the entire share capital of\nTranslate Bio upon expiration of the squeeze-out procedure.\nThe final purchase price allocation, as presented in the table below, led to the recognition of goodwill of €2,118 million:\n(€ million) Fair value at acquisition date\nOther intangible assets 396\nDeferred tax liabilities (93)\nOther current and non-current assets and liabilities 235\nCash and cash equivalents 247\nShire contingent consideration liability (see Note D.18.) (323)\nNet assets of Translate Bio 462\nGoodwill 2,118\nPurchase price 2,580\nThe other intangible assets mainly comprise a messenger RNA technological platform applied to the development of vaccines\nand therapeutic agents.\nGoodwill mainly represents the effects of expected future synergies and other benefits to be derived from the integration of\nTranslate Bio into the Sanofi group, in particular by accelerating the delivery of development programs.\nThe goodwill generated on this acquisition did not give rise to any deduction for income tax purposes.\nF-36 SANOFI FORM 20-F 2023\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nTranslate Bio has no commercial operations.\nThe impact of this acquisition as reflected within the line item Acquisitions of consolidated undertakings and investments\naccounted for using the equity method in the consolidated statement of cash flows is a net cash outflow of €2,333 million.\nUnder the terms of the collaboration agreement between Sanofi and Translate Bio as announced on June 23, 2020, Sanofi held\nan equity interest of approximately 5% in Translate Bio. As of the date when Sanofi obtained control of Translate Bio, that interest\nwas remeasured at the purchase price of $38 per share. The change in fair value was recognized within Other comprehensive\nincome, in accordance with paragraph 42 of IFRS 3 (see Note D.7.).\nAcquisition of Kadmon\nOn September 8, 2021, Sanofi entered into a definitive merger agreement with Kadmon, a biopharmaceutical company that\ndiscovers, develops and markets transformative therapies for disease areas with significant unmet medical needs. Shareholders\nof Kadmon common stock received $9.50 per share in cash, representing a transaction valued at $1.9 billion on a fully-diluted\nbasis. The Sanofi and Kadmon Boards of Directors unanimously approved the transaction.\nThe acquisition of Kadmon by Sanofi was completed on November 9, 2021, with Sanofi holding the entire share capital of\nKadmon upon expiration of the squeeze-out procedure.\nSanofi applied the optional test to identify concentration of fair value under paragraph B7A of IFRS 3. The transaction was\ntherefore accounted for as an asset acquisition given that the principal asset (belumosudil, commercialized in the United States\nunder the brand name REZUROCK) concentrates substantially all of the fair value of the acquired set of activities and assets.\nOf the total acquisition price paid, €1,739 million was allocated to Other intangible assets in accordance with IAS 38. The\ndifference between that amount and the acquisition price corresponds to the other assets acquired and liabilities assumed as\npart of the transaction.\nThe impact of this acquisition as reflected within the line item Acquisitions of consolidated undertakings and investments\naccounted for using the equity method in the consolidated statement of cash flows is a net cash outflow of €1,575 million.\nAcquisition of Origimm\nOn December 3, 2021, Sanofi acquired the entire share capital of Origimm Biotechnology GmbH, a privately owned Austrian\nbiotechnology company specializing in the discovery of virulent skin microbiome components and antigens from bacteria that\ncause skin diseases such as acne, for an upfront payment of €55 million and up to €95 million contingent upon reaching certain\ndevelopment and regulatory milestones.\nSanofi applied the optional test to identify concentration of fair value under paragraph B7A of IFRS 3. The transaction was\ntherefore accounted for as an asset acquisition given that the principal asset (the group of Propionibacterium acnes antigens)\nconcentrates substantially all of the fair value of the acquired set of activities and assets.\nNearly €55 million of the acquisition price paid was allocated to Other intangible assets in accordance with IAS 38. The\ndifference between that amount and the acquisition price corresponds to the other assets acquired and liabilities assumed as\npart of the transaction.\nThe impact of this acquisition as reflected within the line item Acquisitions of consolidated undertakings and investments\naccounted for using the equity method in the consolidated statement of cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2021 is a\nnet cash outflow of €50 million.\nSANOFI FORM 20-F 2023 F-37\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nD.3.

Impairment of intangible assets and property, plant and equipment\nGoodwill\nWhen testing goodwill annually for impairment, the recoverable amount is determined for each of the two segments (Biopharma\nand Consumer Healthcare) on the basis of value in use, as derived from discounted estimates of the future cash flows in\naccordance with the policies described in Note B.6.1.\nThe value in use of each segment was determined by applying an after-tax discount rate to estimated future after-tax cash flows.\nA separate discount rate is used for each segment to reflect the specific economic conditions of that segment.\nThe rates used for impairment testing in 2023 were 7.00% for the Consumer Healthcare segment and 7.25% for the Biopharma\nsegment; an identical value in use for Sanofi as a whole would be obtained by applying a uniform 7.2% rate to two segments.\nThe pre-tax discount rates applied to estimated pre-tax cash flows are calculated by iteration from the previously-determined\nvalue in use. Those pre-tax discount rates were 9.3% for the Consumer Healthcare segment and 10.0% for the Biopharma\nsegment, and equate to a uniform rate of 9.9% for Sanofi as a whole.\nThe assumptions used in testing goodwill for impairment are reviewed annually. Apart from the discount rate, the principal\nassumptions used in 2023 were as follows:\n• the perpetual growth rates applied to future cash flows were zero for the Biopharma segment, and 1% for the Consumer\nHealthcare segment;\n• Sanofi also applies assumptions on the probability of success of current research and development projects, and more\ngenerally on its ability to renew the product portfolio in the longer term.\nValue in use (determined as described above) is compared with the carrying amount, and this comparison is then subjected to\nsensitivity analyses by reference to the principal parameters, including:\n• changes in the discount rate;\n• changes in the perpetual growth rate; and\n• fluctuations in operating margin.\nNo impairment of goodwill would need to be recognized in the event of a reasonably possible change in the assumptions used\nin 2023.\nA value in use calculation for each of the segments would not result in an impairment loss using:\n• a discount rate up to 2.8 percentage points above the rates actually used; or\n• a perpetual growth rate up to 4.9 percentage points below the rates actually used; or\n• an operating margin up to 7.2 percentage points below the rates actually used.\nNo impairment losses were recognized against goodwill in the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 or 2021.\nOther intangible assets\nWhen there is evidence that an asset may have become impaired, the asset’s value in use is calculated by applying an after-tax\ndiscount rate to the estimated future after-tax cash flows from that asset. For the purposes of impairment testing, the tax cash\nflows relating to the asset are determined using a notional tax rate incorporating the notional tax benefit that would result from\namortizing the asset if its value in use were regarded as its depreciable amount for tax purposes. Applying after-tax discount\nrates to after-tax cash flows gives the same values in use as would be obtained by applying pre-tax discount rates to pre-tax\ncash flows.\nThe after-tax discount rates used in 2023 for impairment testing of other intangible assets in the Biopharma and Consumer\nHealthcare segments were obtained by adjusting Sanofi’s weighted average cost of capital to reflect specific country and\nbusiness risks, giving after-tax discount rates in a range from 7.25% to 8.25%.\nIn most instances, there are no market data that would enable fair value less costs to sell to be determined other than by means\nof developing a similar estimate based on future cash flows. Consequently, recoverable amount is in substance equal to value in\nuse. The estimates used to determine value in use are sensitive to assumptions specific to the nature of the asset and to Sanofi's\nactivities. Apart from the discount rate, the principal assumptions used in 2023 were as follows:\n• mid-term and long-term forecasts;\n• perpetual growth or attrition rates, when applicable; and\n• probability of success of current research and development projects.\nThe assumptions used in testing intangible assets for impairment are reviewed at least annually.\nF-44 SANOFI FORM 20-F 2023\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nIn 2023, 2022 and 2021, impairment testing of other intangible assets (excluding software) resulted in the recognition of net\nimpairment losses as shown below:\n(€ million) 2023 2022 2021\nImpairment of other intangible assets, net of reversals (excluding software) 932 (454) 192\nMarketed products — (1,561) 42\nBiopharma(b) — (1,526) 1\nConsumer Healthcare — (35) 41\nResearch and development projects and technology platforms(a)(b)(c) 896 1,107 150\nOthers 36 — —\n(a) For 2023, this amount mainly comprises an impairment loss of €833 million, reflecting the impact of the strategic decision to de-prioritize certain R&D\nprograms, in particular those related to the NK Cell and PRO-XTEN technology platforms.\n(b) For 2022, this amount mainly comprises a reversal of €2,154 million of impairment losses taken against ELOCTATE and BIVV001 (assets belonging to the\nELOCTATE franchise), consisting of €1,554 million for marketed products and €600 million for research and development projects respectively. In 2019,\nthe launch of competing products for ELOCTATE led Sanofi to update its sales forecasts for products belonging to the franchise, as a result of which\nimpairment losses of €2.8 billion were recognized against the assets in question. The reversal reflects the approval by the FDA on February 22, 2023 of\nALTUVIIIO (the commercial name of efanesoctocog alpha, corresponding to the BIVV001 project), which was submitted in 2022.\n(c) For 2022, this amount mainly comprises:\n– an impairment loss of €1,586 million taken against the development project for SAR444245 (non-alpha interleukin-2), recognized following revised\ncash flow projections reflecting unfavorable developments in the launch schedule;\n– the €600 million reversal relating to the BIVV001 project (see above).\nFor 2021, this line relates to the discontinuation of the development of sutimlimab in the treatment of Immune Thrombocytopenic Purpura (ITP), and to\nthe termination of various research projects in Vaccines.\nProperty, plant and equipment\nImpairment losses taken against property, plant and equipment are disclosed in Note D.3.\nRisks and opportunities related to climate change\nSanofi has identified specific plausible scenarios to assess climate risks and opportunities liable to impact its activities in the\nmedium and longer term.\nThese include:\n• an Aggressive Mitigation scenario, based on global collaboration to start reducing emissions immediately to meet Paris\nAgreement goals (limit temperature increase to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels), generating risks related to transitioning to a\nlower carbon economy and entailing extensive policy, legal, technology, and market changes to address mitigation and\nadaptation requirements;\n• a No Climate Action scenario (leading to global warming of 4°C above pre-industrial levels by 2100), with event-driven\nphysical risks resulting from climate change or longer term shifts in climate patterns leading to potential financial implications\nsuch as direct damage to assets and indirect impacts from supply chain disruption; changes in water availability, and in the\nsourcing or quality of resources; food security; and extreme temperature changes affecting premises, operations, supply\nchain, transport needs, and employee safety; and\n• a Most Likely scenario, encompassing fragmented regional efforts to start reducing emissions but not at a sufficient level to\nmeet Paris Agreement goals (emissions continue to increase but at a slowed rate, leading to a 2.8°C temperature increase).\nThe importance and likelihood of such risks have been assessed and have not led Sanofi to identify any material impact that could\ngenerate a risk of impairment of the assets of Sanofi’s CGUs.\nD.6.

Consequently, Sanofi recognizes a\ndeferred tax liability on the reserves of French and foreign subsidiaries (approximately €60.4 billion) which it regards as likely to be distributed in the\nforeseeable future. In determining the amount of the deferred tax liability as of December 31, 2023, Sanofi took into account changes in the ownership\nstructure of certain subsidiaries, and the effects of changes in the taxation of dividends in France, following the ruling of the Court of Justice of\nthe European Union in the Steria case and the resulting amendments to the 2015 Finance Act. As of December 31, 2023, this line includes a deferred tax\nliability arising from temporary differences on investments in subsidiaries which Sanofi expects will reverse in connection with the proposed separation\nof the Consumer Healthcare business, as announced in October 2023 (see Note D.30.).\n(c) Includes deferred tax assets related to restructuring provisions, amounting to €286 million as of December 31, 2023, €256 million as of\nDecember 31, 2022, and €226 million as of December 31, 2021.\n(d) Includes deferred taxes arising on the spread tax deduction of R&D expenses, amounting to €1,331 million as of December 31, 2023 and €742 million as\nof December 31, 2022.\nThe reserves of Sanofi subsidiaries that would be taxable if distributed but for which no distribution is planned, and for which no\ndeferred tax liability has therefore been recognized, totaled €10.0 billion as of December 31, 2023, compared with €10.6 billion as\nof December 31, 2022 and €10.0 billion as of December 31, 2021.\nMost of Sanofi’s tax loss carry-forwards are available indefinitely. For a description of policies on the recognition of deferred tax\nassets, refer to Note B.22. For each tax consolidation, the recognition of deferred tax assets is determined on the basis of profit\nforecasts that are consistent with Sanofi’s medium-term strategic plan, and taking into consideration the tax consequences of\nthe strategic opportunities available to Sanofi within the period of availability of tax loss carry-forwards and the specific\ncircumstances of each tax consolidation. Deferred tax assets relating to tax loss carry-forwards as of December 31, 2023\namounted to €2,729 million, of which €1,203 million were not recognized (including €473 million in respect of capital losses). This\ncompares with €2,650 million as of December 31, 2022 (of which €1,144 million were not recognized) and €2,391 million as\nof December 31, 2021 (of which €875 million were not recognized).\nF-50 SANOFI FORM 20-F 2023\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nThe table below shows when tax losses available for carry-forward are due to expire:\n(€ million) Tax losses available for carry-forward(a)\n2024 6\n2025 7\n2026 34\n2027 23\n2028 126\n2029 and later 8,737\nTotal as of December 31, 2023 8,933\nTotal as of December 31, 2022 8,503\nTotal as of December 31, 2021 7,644\n(a) Excluding tax loss carry-forwards on asset disposals. Such carry-forwards amounted to €5 million as of December 31, 2023, €5 million as of\nDecember 31, 2022 and €5 million as of December 31, 2021.\nUse of tax loss carry-forwards is limited to the entity in which they arose. In jurisdictions where tax consolidations are in place, tax\nlosses can be netted against taxable income generated by entities in the same tax consolidation.\nDeferred tax assets not recognized (primarily because their future recovery was not regarded as probable given the expected\nresults of the entities in question) amounted to €1,062 million in 2023, €995 million in 2022 and €615 million in 2021.\nD.15.

The fair value of this contingent\nconsideration is determined by applying the royalty percentage stipulated in the contract to discounted sales projections. If\nthe discount rate were to fall by one percentage point, the fair value of the MSD contingent consideration liability would\nincrease by approximately 1%;\n• a contingent consideration liability towards Shire Human Genetic Therapies Inc. (Shire) arising from Sanofi’s acquisition of\nTranslate Bio in September 2021. In a business combination carried out in December 2016 and predating the acquisition of\ncontrol by Sanofi, Translate Bio (then called Rana Therapeutics, Inc.) acquired from Shire the intellectual property rights\nrelating to the latter’s Messenger RNA Therapeutics (MRT) program. As of December 31, 2023, Shire was entitled to receive\nthe following potential payments:\n– milestone payments contingent on the launch of products based on MRT technology, and on the attainment of a specified\nlevel of sales of those products, and\n– a percentage of sales of those products.\nThe fair value of the Shire liability was measured at €441 million as of December 31, 2023, compared with €380 million as\nof December 31, 2022 and €354 million as of December 31, 2021; it was determined by applying the contractual terms to\ndevelopment and sales projections which were weighted to reflect the probability of success, and discounted. If the discount\nrate were to fall by one percentage point, the fair value of the Shire liability would increase by approximately 12%;\n• the contingent consideration liability arising from the 2022 acquisition of Amunix. The fair value of the liability is determined\non the basis of the nominal value of payments due subject to the attainment of specified development milestones. The\nliability was measured at €137 million as of December 31, 2023 compared with €165 million as of December 31, 2022. If the\ndiscount rate were to fall by one percentage point, the fair value of the liability would increase by approximately 1%.\nThe Bayer contingent consideration liability arising from Sanofi’s acquisition of Genzyme in 2011 was extinguished during 2023 in\naccordance with the contractual terms.\nThe table below sets forth the maximum amount of contingent consideration payable in respect of already-marketed products:\nDecember 31, 2023 Payments due by period\nLess than From 1 to From 3 to More than\n(€ million) Total 1 year 3 years 5 years 5 years\nCommitments relating to contingent consideration in\nconnection with business combinations 133 69 64 — —\nThe nominal amount of contingent consideration was €604 million as of December 31, 2022 and €689 million as of\nDecember 31, 2021.\nD.19.

Given the method used to calculate royalties payable, an increase or decrease in sales forecasts would lead to a\nproportionate change in the amount of the liability. The nominal value of payments estimated to be due within more than one year but less than five\nyears is €1,112 million; the nominal value of payments estimated to be due after more than five years is €2,860 million.\nNon-current income tax liabilities are described in Note D.19.4., and other current liabilities in Note D.19.5.\nF-64 SANOFI FORM 20-F 2023\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nThe table below sets forth movements in non-current provisions for the reporting periods presented:\nProvisions for\npensions and\nother post- Provisions\nemployment for other Restructuring Other\nbenefits long-term provisions provisions\n(€ million) (D.19.1.) benefits (D.19.2.)

Provisions for pensions and other post-employment benefits\nSanofi offers its employees pension plans and other post-employment benefit plans. The specific features of the plans (benefit\nformulas, fund investment policy and fund assets held) vary depending on the applicable laws and regulations in each country\nwhere the employees work. These employee benefits are accounted for in accordance with IAS 19 (see Note B.23.).\nSanofi’s pension obligations in four major countries represented approximately 89% of the total value of the defined-benefit\nobligation and approximately 88% of the total value of plan assets as of December 31, 2023. The features of the principal\ndefined-benefit plans in each of those four countries are described below.\nFrance\nLump-sum retirement benefit plans\nAll employees working for Sanofi in France are entitled on retirement to a lump-sum payment, the amount of which depends both\non their length of service and on the rights guaranteed by collective and internal agreements. The employee’s final salary is used\nin calculating the amount of these lump-sum retirement benefits. These plans represent approximately 39% of Sanofi’s total\nobligation in France.\nSANOFI FORM 20-F 2023 F-65\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nDefined-benefit pension plans\nThese plans provide benefits from the date of retirement. Employees must fulfil a number of criteria to be eligible for these\nbenefits. All of these plans are now closed. These plans represent approximately 61% of Sanofi’s total obligation in France.\nGermany\nTop-up defined-benefit pension plan\nThe benefits offered under this pension plan are wholly funded by the employer (there are no employee contributions) via a\nContractual Trust Agreement (CTA), under which benefits are estimated on the basis of a career average salary. Employees are\nentitled to receive an annuity under this plan if their salary exceeds the social security ceiling. The amount of the pension is\ncalculated by reference to a range of vesting rates corresponding to salary bands. The plan also includes disability and death\nbenefits. This plan represents approximately 60% of Sanofi’s total obligation in Germany.\nSanofi-Aventis plus (SAV plus)\nA top-up pension plan (SAV plus) replaced a previous top-up defined-benefit plan. New entrants joining the plan after\nApril 1, 2015 contribute to a defined-contribution plan that is partially funded via the company’s CTA.\nAll employees whose salary exceeds the social security ceiling are automatically covered by the plan. The employer’s contribution\nis 14% of the amount by which the employee’s salary exceeds the social security ceiling.\nMulti-employer plan (Pensionskasse)\nThis is a defined-benefit plan treated as a defined-contribution plan, in accordance with the accounting policies described\nin Note B.23. Currently, contributions cover the level of annuities. Only the portion relating to the future revaluation\nof the annuities is included in the defined-benefit pension obligation. The obligation relating to this revaluation amounted\nto €744 million as of December 31, 2023, versus €652 million as of December 31, 2022 and €877 million as of December 31, 2021.\nThis plan represents approximately 26% of Sanofi’s total defined-benefit obligation in Germany.\nUnited States\nDefined-benefit pension plans\nIn the United States, there are two types of defined-benefit plan:\n• “qualified” plans within the meaning of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA), which provide\nguaranteed benefits to eligible employees during retirement, and in the event of death or disability. Employees can elect to\nreceive a reduced annuity, in exchange for an annuity to be paid in the event of their death to a person designated by them.\nAn annuity is also granted under the plan if the employee dies before retirement age. Eligible employees do not pay any\ncontributions. These plans are closed to new entrants, and the vesting of rights for future service periods is partially frozen.\nThese plans represent approximately 59% of Sanofi’s total obligation in the United States;\n• “non-qualified” plans within the meaning of ERISA provide top-up retirement benefits to some eligible employees depending\non the employee’s level of responsibility and subject to a salary cap. These plans represent approximately 14% of Sanofi’s total\nobligation in the United States.\nHealthcare cover and life insurance\nSanofi companies provide some eligible employees with healthcare cover and life insurance during the retirement period (the\ncompany’s contributions are capped at a specified level). These plans represent approximately 27% (or €412 million) of Sanofi’s\ntotal obligation and 3% (or €23 million) of total plan assets in the United States.\nUnited Kingdom\nDefined-benefit pension plans\nSanofi operates a number of pension plans in the United Kingdom that reflect past acquisitions. The most significant\narrangements are defined-benefit plans that have been closed since October 1, 2015. With effect from that date, employees can\nno longer pay into these plans.\nUnder these defined-benefit plans, an annuity is paid from the retirement date. This annuity is calculated on the basis of the\nemployee’s length of service as of September 30, 2015, and of the employee’s final salary (or salary on the date he or she leaves\nSanofi).\nThe rates used for the vesting of rights vary from member to member. For most members, rights vest at the rate of 1.25% or 1.50%\nof final salary for each qualifying year of service giving entitlement. The notional retirement age varies according to the category\nto which the member belongs, but in most cases retirement is at age 65. Members may choose to retire before or after the\nnotional retirement age (60 years), in which case the amount of the annual pension is adjusted to reflect the revised estimate of\nthe length of the retirement phase. Pensions are usually indexed to the Retail Price Index (RPI). Members paid a fixed-percentage\ncontribution into their pension plan (the percentage varied according to the employee category), and the employer topped up\nthe contribution to the required amount. These plans represent approximately 100% of Sanofi’s total obligation in the United\nKingdom.\nFor service periods subsequent to October 1, 2015, employees belong to a new defined-contribution plan.\nF-66 SANOFI FORM 20-F 2023\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nActuarial assumptions used to measure Sanofi’s obligations\nActuarial valuations of Sanofi’s benefit obligations were computed by management with assistance from external actuaries as\nof December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021.\nThose calculations were based on the following financial and demographic assumptions:\n2023 2022 2021\nFrance Germany US UK France Germany US UK France Germany US UK\nDiscount 2.95% to 2.95% to 3.55% to 3.55% to\n0.10% 0.10%\nrate(a)(b) 3.15% 3.15% 4.75% 4.50% 3.75% 3.75% 4.90% 4.75% 1.10t %o 1.10t %o 2.70% 1.90%\nGeneral\ninflation 2.20% 2.20% — 3.05% 2.50% 2.50% — 3.25% 1.95% 1.95% — 3.30%\nrate(c)\nPension\nbenefit 2.20% 2.20% — 2.90% 2.50% 2.50% — 3.00% 1.95% 1.95% — 3.15%\nindexation\nH coe sa tl thcare 4.00% 3.29%\n3.50% to\ninflation\n— — to — — — to — — —\n4.50%\n—\nrate(d) 9.75% 6.56%\nRetirement 62\n63\n55 60 62\n63\n55 60 62\n62\n55 60\nage to 67 to 70 to 65 to 67 to 70 to 65 to 67 to 70 to 65\nRP2012\nRP2012 RP2012\nM tao br leta lity\nT TG\nG\n0H 5F/ He 2u 0b 1e 8Rc GTk\nMP\nW2P h0r io\nt2\nej 1.\nSAP S3S\nT TG\nG\n0H 5F/ He 2u 0b 1e 8Rc GTk\nMP\nW2P h0r io\nt2\nej 1.\nSAP S3S\nT TG\nG\n0H 5F/ He 2u 0b 1e 8Rc GTk\nMG P.\nW\n2SP\n0c\nhr\na\n2\nio\ntl\n0\neej.\nSAP S3S\nCollar Collar\nCollar\n(a) The discount rates used were based on market rates for high quality corporate bonds with a duration close to that of the expected benefit payments\nunder the plans.

This policy aims\nto ensure the best fit between the assets held on the one hand, and the associated liabilities and expected future payments to\nplan members on the other. To meet this aim, Sanofi operates a risk monitoring and management strategy (mainly focused on\ninterest rate risk and inflation risk), while investing a growing proportion of assets in high-quality

The agreement provides internal\ntransfer and outplacement opportunities for employees whose jobs are undergoing transformation, and also includes an end-\nof-career paid leave program and an external retraining program. Most of the provisions charged in 2022 relate to this plan,\nwhich began to be implemented in 2022. The provisions charged in 2023 reflect adjustments to the job profiles deemed to be\n\"sensitive\"; the reversals recognized during 2023 are due mainly to the Borne Law, which raises the retirement age to 64 and\nhence disqualifies some participants eligible under previous legislation (in light of the maximum period for portage workers);\n• collectively-agreed separation programs involving a number of legal entities announced at the end of June 2020 as part of\nthe rollout of the “Play to Win” strategy; these include an end-of-career paid leave plan and an external retraining program,\nand were still ongoing during 2023. In addition, Sanofi-Aventis Recherche & Développement (i) announced a voluntary\nredundancy program in 2020 in connection with the reorganization of R&D operations in France, which was implemented\nin 2021, and (ii) signed a collectively-agreed termination program in 2021 as part of the rollout of the “Play to Win” strategy;\nthese programs, which cover support functions, include an end-of-career paid leave plan and an end-of-career transition\nplan;\n• programs announced in 2019 relating to (i) R&D (Sanofi-Aventis Recherche & Développement) and (ii) sales forces\n(the “SAF 2019” plan implemented by Sanofi-Aventis France);\n• collectively-agreed separation programs announced in 2018 relating to the reorganization of support functions\n(“Horizon 2020” plan).\nThe remainder of the provision for France comprises termination benefits associated with previously-announced programs (early\nretirement plans and end-of-career transition plans).\nThe provision includes the present values of:\n• gross annuities for self-funded plans;\n• employer’s social security charges on early retirement annuities for all plans (outsourced and self-funded); and\n• the levy charged on those annuities under the “Fillon” law (only for plans with termination of employment contracts).\nThe average residual portage periods under these plans were 2.22 years, 2.60 years and 1.94 years as of December 31, 2023, 2022\nand 2021, respectively.\nThe main other countries covered by restructuring provisions are Germany, Japan and the United States.\nF-72 SANOFI FORM 20-F 2023\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nThe timing of future termination benefit payments is as follows:\nDecember 31, 2023 Benefit payments by period\nLess than 1 to 3 to More than\n(€ million) Total 1 year 3 years 5 years 5 years\nEmployee termination benefits\n• France 611 215 315 79 2\n• Other countries 357 302 47 7 1\nTotal 968 517 362 86 3\nDecember 31, 2022 Benefit payments by period\nLess than 1 to 3 to More than\n(€ million) Total 1 year 3 years 5 years 5 years\nEmployee termination benefits\n• France 804 185 412 207 —\n• Other countries 235 189 36 8 2\nTotal 1,039 374 448 215 2\nDecember 31, 2021 Benefit payments by period\nLess than 1 to 3 to More than\n(€ million) Total 1 year 3 years 5 years 5 years\nEmployee termination benefits\n• France 614 269 288 53 4\n• Other countries 329 207 106 14 2\nTotal 943 476 394 67 6\nD.19.3.

Quotas are managed as a production cost, and as such are recognized in inventory at a zero value (if received free\nof charge) and at acquisition cost (if bought on the market). As of December 31, 2023, no liability was recognized, and quotas\nvalued at €3 million were held in inventory.\n“Product liability risks, litigation and other” mainly comprises provisions for risks relating to product liability (including IBNR\nprovisions as described in Note B.12.), government investigations, regulatory or antitrust law claims, contingencies arising from\nbusiness divestitures (other than environmental risks), and remediation costs related to leases.\nThe main pending legal and arbitral proceedings and government investigations are described in Note D.22.\nA full risk and litigation assessment is performed with the assistance of Sanofi’s legal advisers, and provisions are recorded as\nrequired by circumstances in accordance with the principles described in Note B.12.\nSANOFI FORM 20-F 2023 F-73\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nD.19.4.

The termination took effect\non February 5 ,2023.\nIn addition, under the collaboration agreement with Regeneron on monoclonal antibodies (see Note C.1.), Sanofi is entitled to\nreceive an additional share of quarterly profits (capped at 10% of Regeneron’s share of quarterly profits until March 31, 2022, and\nthereafter at 20%), until Regeneron has paid 50% of the cumulative development costs incurred by the parties to the alliance.\nAs of December 31, 2023 this represented total commitments received of €2.1 billion (versus €2.7 billion as of December 31, 2022),\nagainst cumulative development costs of €8.6 billion.\nSanofi entered into an agreement with Royalty Pharma in December 2014 relating to development programs, under which\nRoyalty Pharma bore a portion of the remaining development costs of the project on a quarterly basis in return for royalties on\nfuture sales. The products in development under that agreement have been launched in territories including the United States\nand Europe, marking the end of the joint development programs.\nOn February 27, 2017, Sanofi and Lonza announced a strategic partnership in the form of a joint venture (BioAtrium AG) to build\nand operate a large-scale mammalian cell culture facility for monoclonal antibody production in Visp, Switzerland. An initial\ninvestment of approximately €0.3 billion to finance construction of the facility, split 50/50 between the two partners, has now\nbeen made in full. In addition, Sanofi could pay BioAtrium AG in the region of €0.6 billion over the 2023-2031 period as its share\nof operating expenses and the cost of producing future batches.\nIn February 2014, pursuant to the “Pandemic Influenza Preparedness Framework for the sharing of influenza viruses and access to\nvaccines and other benefits” (still effective as of December 31, 2023), Sanofi Pasteur and the World Health Organization (WHO)\nsigned a bilateral “Standard Material Transfer Agreement” (SMTA 2). This agreement stipulates that Sanofi Pasteur will, during\ndeclared pandemic periods, (i) donate 7.5% of its real-time production of pandemic vaccines against any strain with potential to\ncause a pandemic, and (ii) reserve a further 7.5% of such production on affordable terms. The agreement cancels and replaces all\npreceding commitments to donate pandemic vaccines to the WHO.\nD.21.2. Off balance sheet commitments relating to financing activities\nCredit facilities\nUndrawn credit facilities are as follows:\nDecember 31, 2023 Expiry\nLess than 1 to 3 to More than\n(€ million) Total 1 year 3 years 5 years 5 years\nGeneral-purpose credit facilities 8,000 — — 4,000 4,000\nAs of December 31, 2023, total credit facilities amounted to €8,000 million (versus €8,000 million as of December 31, 2022\nand €8,000 million as of December 31, 2021).\nGuarantees\nThe table below shows the amount of guarantees given and received:\n(€ million) 2023 2022 2021\nGuarantees given: 3,936 3,815 3,794\n• Guarantees provided to banks in connection with credit facilities 1,067 1,007 1,042\n• Other guarantees given 2,869 2,808 2,752\nGuarantees received (1,272) (1,229) (1,149)\nD.21.3. Off balance sheet commitments relating to asset acquisitions and divestments, and to\nchanges in the scope of consolidation\nAs of December 31, 2023, Sanofi had received commitments amounting in aggregate to €0.3 billion in respect of (i) divestments\nof assets relating to transactions not yet finalized as of that date and (ii) contingent consideration arising under past agreements.\nOff balance sheet commitments of a financing nature with associates and joint ventures are disclosed in Note D.6.\nOff-balance sheet commitments relating to securities classified in the categories Equity instruments at fair value through other\ncomprehensive income and Unquoted debt securities not meeting the definition of equity instruments are respectively disclosed\nin Notes D .7.1. and D.7.3..\nThe maximum amount of contingent consideration relating to business combinations is disclosed in Note D.18.\nF-80 SANOFI FORM 20-F 2023\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nD.22. Legal and arbitral proceedings\nSanofi and its affiliates are involved in litigation, arbitration and other legal proceedings. These proceedings typically are related\nto product liability claims, intellectual property rights (particularly claims against generic companies seeking to limit the patent\nprotection of Sanofi products), competition law and trade practices, commercial claims, employment and wrongful discharge\nclaims, tax assessment claims, waste disposal and pollution claims, and claims under warranties or indemnification arrangements\nrelating to business divestitures. Provisions related to legal and arbitral proceedings are recorded in accordance with the\nprinciples described in Note B.12.\nMost of the issues raised by these claims are highly complex and subject to substantial uncertainties; therefore, the probability of\nloss and an estimation of damages are difficult to ascertain. Contingent liabilities are cases for which either we are unable to\nmake a reasonable estimate of the expected financial effect that will result from ultimate resolution of the proceeding, or a cash\noutflow is not probable. In either case, a brief description of the nature of the contingent liability is disclosed and, where\npracticable, an estimate of its financial effect, an indication of the uncertainties relating to the amount and timing of any outflow,\nand the possibility of any reimbursement are provided in application of paragraph 86 of IAS 37.\nIn the cases that have been settled or adjudicated, or where quantifiable fines and penalties have been assessed, we have\nindicated our losses or the amount of provision accrued that is the estimate of the probable loss.\nIn a limited number of ongoing cases, while we are able to make a reasonable estimate of the expected loss or range of the\npossible loss and have accrued a provision for such loss, we believe that publication of this information on a case-by-case basis or\nby class would seriously prejudice the Company’s position in the ongoing legal proceedings or in any related settlement\ndiscussions. Accordingly, in those cases, we have disclosed information with respect to the nature of the contingency but have\nnot disclosed our estimate of the range of potential loss, in accordance with paragraph 92 of IAS 37.\nThese assessments can involve a series of complex judgments about future events and can rely heavily on estimates and\nassumptions. Our assessments are based on estimates and assumptions that have been deemed reasonable by management. We\nbelieve that the aggregate provisions recorded for the above matters are adequate based upon currently available information.\nHowever, given the inherent uncertainties related to these cases and involved in estimating contingent liabilities, we could in the\nfuture incur judgments that could have a material adverse effect on our net income in any particular period.\nLong term provisions are disclosed in Note D.19. They include:\n• provisions for product liability risks, litigation and other amount to €1,283 million in 2023. These provisions are mainly related\nto product liabilities, government investigations, competition law, regulatory claims, warranties in connection with certain\ncontingent liabilities arising from business divestitures other than environmental matters and other claims;\n• provisions for environmental risks and remediation amount to €493 million in 2023, the majority of which are related to\ncontingencies that have arisen from business divestitures.\na) Products\nSanofi Pasteur Hepatitis B Vaccine Product Litigation\nSince 1996, more than 180 lawsuits have been filed in various French civil courts against Sanofi Pasteur and/or Sanofi\nPasteur MSD S.N.C., the former French subsidiary of Sanofi, and the latter a joint venture company with Merck & Co., Inc. now\nterminated, for which past ongoing litigation is now managed by the originating party. In such lawsuits, the plaintiffs allege that\nthey suffer from a variety of neurological disorders and autoimmune diseases, including multiple sclerosis and Guillain-Barré\nsyndrome as a result of receiving the hepatitis B vaccine.\nIn January 2018, the Appeal Court of Bordeaux found a causal link between hepatitis B vaccine and multiple sclerosis.\nIn July 2019, the French Supreme Court (Cour de cassation) cancelled the judgment of the Appeal Court of Bordeaux and\nreferred the case back to the Appeal Court of Toulouse. On March 30, 2022, the Appeal Court of Toulouse dismissed all the\nplaintiff’s claims.\nAs of December 31, 2023, there were six ongoing lawsuits related to Sanofi Pasteur hepatitis B vaccine.\nTAXOTERE Product Litigation in the US\nAs of December 31, 2023, there were approximately 6,770 ingesting plaintiffs cases remaining in courts across the country.\nLawsuits have been filed against affiliates of Sanofi under US state law for personal injuries allegedly sustained in connection\nwith the use of TAXOTERE. The actions are held in several jurisdictions around the country. In 2021, there were two bellwether\ntrials as part of a federal multi-district litigation in the Eastern District of Louisiana both resulting in jury verdicts in Sanofi's favor.\nIn 2023, Sanofi settled approximately 100 individual cases.\nIt is not possible, at this stage, to assess with certainty the outcome of these lawsuits.\nTAXOTERE – Mississippi Attorney General Litigation in the US\nIn October 2018, the Attorney General for the State of Mississippi filed a civil action in Hinds County, Mississippi, Chancery Court\nagainst various Sanofi Defendants related to TAXOTERE. The State asserts one cause of action based on the Mississippi\nConsumer Protection Act (MCPA) and seeks a permanent injunction prohibiting Defendants’ conduct and civil penalties of up\nto $10,000 for each violation. Sanofi filed a motion to dismiss the entire action in Hinds County, Mississippi, Chancery Court,\nwhich is currently pending.\nIt is not possible, at this stage, to assess with certainty the outcome of these lawsuits.\nSANOFI FORM 20-F 2023 F-81\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nZANTAC Litigation in the US\nIn September 2019, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) announced it was investigating the claims of an online\npharmacy’s Citizen Petition that the medication ZANTAC (the brand name for ranitidine) used for stomach heartburn contains or\ncan generate the chemical N-Nitrosodimethylamine (NDM), an alleged human carcinogen. As a precautionary measure, Sanofi\ninitiated a voluntary recall of branded over-the-counter ZANTAC in October 2019. Concurrent with FDA’s investigation, multiple\npersonal injury lawsuits and class actions alleging that ZANTAC causes various cancers and seeking damages for either alleged\npersonal injuries or alleged economic injuries were filed. Federal court cases were coordinated into a Multi-District Litigation\n(MDL) in the Southern District of Florida in February 2020.\nOn December 6, 2022, the MDL Court granted Sanofi and other defendants’ Daubert and summary judgment motions. As a\nresult, the Court entered final judgment in all cases involving plaintiffs’ five designated cancers and dismissed the class action\ncases. Based on the preliminary estimates, more than 12,000 plaintiffs have filed notices to appeal the Daubert ruling in the\nEleventh Circuit. The MDL Court subsequently dismissed all pending cases alleging a non-designated cancer for failure to serve\nexpert reports.\nOther cases are pending in various state courts. The majority of the state court plaintiffs have cases pending in Delaware, where a\nhearing on defendants’ Daubert motions to exclude plaintiffs’ experts was scheduled for January 2024. Trials are scheduled\nin 2024 in single-plaintiff cases in several states. No ZANTAC case has gone to trial to date.\nOverall, there are currently around 3,280 product liability “complaints” filed. These complaints encompass 26,984 individual\nproduct liability “plaintiffs” who have all filed against Sanofi. The vast majority of these plaintiffs participated in the MDL Court’s\ncensus registry program, allege cancers that the plaintiffs’ leadership decided not to designate and pursue in the MDL, and have\nsince filed their complaints in state courts. Additional cases may be filed.\nIn addition, in November 2019, Sanofi received a Civil Investigative Demand (CID) related to this issue from the Arizona Attorney\nGeneral. Sanofi provided responses in December 2019 and July 2020 and has not received any follow-up requests.\nIn June 2020, the New Mexico Attorney General filed a complaint against Sanofi, the previous marketing authorization holders for\nbranded ZANTAC, a dozen generic manufacturers, and several retailers. The complaint brings claims for alleged violations of the\nNew Mexico Unfair Practices Act, violations of the New Mexico False Advertising Act, violations of the New Mexico Public\nNuisance Statute, common law public nuisance, and negligence. Trial in the case is scheduled for September 2025.\nIn June 2020, Sanofi received a notice from the US Department of Justice Civil Division and US Attorney’s Office for the Eastern\nDistrict of Pennsylvania of an investigation into allegations that pharmaceutical manufacturers violated the False Claims\nAct, 31 U.S.C. § 3729, in relation to the drug ZANTAC and ranitidine hydrochloride through alleged failure to disclose to the\nfederal government information about the potential presence of NDMA. In response to the notice, Sanofi provided information\nand documents including applications and communications with FDA, in August 2020. Sanofi has not received any subsequent\nrequests from the federal government.\nIn November 2020, the Mayor and City Council of Baltimore filed a complaint against Sanofi, the previous marketing\nauthorization holders for branded ZANTAC, generic manufacturers, and several retailers. The complaint alleges violations of the\nMaryland Consumer Protection statute, public nuisance, and negligence. Trial in the case is scheduled for June 2025.\nIn January 2021, Sanofi was served with the Center for Environmental Health’s Second Amended Complaint alleging\nProposition 65 violations. The case is pending in California Superior Court in Alameda County, and no trial date has been set.\nIt is not possible, at this stage, to assess with certainty the outcome of these lawsuits.\nZANTAC Litigation in Canada\nBetween 2019 and 2022, seven proposed class actions naming some or all of Sanofi Consumer Health Inc., Sanofi-Aventis Canada\nInc., Chattem (Canada) Inc., Sanofi and Sanofi Pasteur Limited as Defendants, relating to ranitidine were filed in courts in various\nCanadian provinces. The cases allege that proposed class members suffered personal injury from the ingestion of ranitidine, and\nseek damages in unspecified amounts, disgorgement of profits, restitution in the amount of the purchase price of ZANTAC and\nsubrogated damages on behalf of provincial health insurers for health care costs related to ranitidine use.\nIn May 2023, in the proceedings pending before the Supreme Court of British Columbia, the Court dismissed the action, ruling\nthat there is no scientific support for plaintiff’s claims. After this ruling, the Superior Court of Quebec stayed the corresponding\nproposed ZANTAC class proceedings in Quebec until the result of the US Multi-District Litigation (MDL) appeal is announced\nor October 15, 2024 (whichever comes first).\nIt is not possible, at this stage, to assess with certainty the outcome of the remaining lawsuits.\nGOLD BOND Product Litigation in the US\nOver the last few years, Sanofi affiliates have been named in product liability actions in the United States regarding the alleged\npresence of asbestos in talc products originating from past acquisitions. A certain number of these claims were also dismissed\nduring that time. As of December 31, 2023, there were approximately 500 product liability ongoing actions. To date, no cases\nhave proceeded to trial.\nIt is not possible, at this stage, to assess with certainty the outcome of these lawsuits.\nF-82 SANOFI FORM 20-F 2023\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nDEPAKINE Product Litigation in France\nCivil proceedings\nAs of December 31, 2023, 79 families brought a civil claim involving 133 people exposed in utero to sodium valproate against a\nFrench affiliate of Sanofi seeking indemnification under French law for personal injuries allegedly suffered by children in\nconnection with the use of sodium valproate by their mothers during pregnancy to treat their epilepsy (DEPAKINE). These actions\nare held in several jurisdictions in France.\nThirty lawsuits are in progress on the merits, the most advanced was tried at the French Supreme Court level which issued\nin November 2019 a ruling sending the case before the Paris Appeal Court to rule on Sanofi’s argument on the compliance of\nthe product with mandatory regulations, as well as on the question of defectiveness of the product and the assessment of\ndamages. In January 2023, the Paris Appeal Court ordered a stay in the proceedings until the submission of the second expert\nopinion report as part of the criminal investigation (see below).\nSeven first instance rulings on the merits were handed down in 2022 by the Judicial Tribunal of Nanterre. In three cases, the\nCourt declared the judicial expert report null and void and the Court dismissed one claim in another case.\nConcerning three other cases relating to births that occurred between 2005 and 2009, the Court held, on the basis of a non-\nfault liability, that Sanofi was liable in light of the wording of the patient information leaflet. Provisional compensation amounts\nwere set in the range of €0.1 million to €0.5 million.\nAll the judgments have been appealed and are still pending.\nIn the class action lawsuit filed in May 2017 by the APESAC (Association des Parents d’Enfants souffrant du Syndrome de l’Anti-\nConvulsivant) against the French affiliate, the Judicial Tribunal of Paris ruled on January 5, 2022 that a class is admissible,\nretaining Sanofi’s liability between 1984 and January 2006 for malformations and between 2001 and January 2006 for neuro-\ndevelopmental disorders (NDD). This decision is based on the conclusions of a criminal expert report within the frame of ongoing\ncriminal proceeding, for which the Chambre de l’Instruction of the Appeal Court of Paris had ordered a counter-expertise\n(see below). The APESAC, Sanofi and its insurers appealed the Judicial Tribunal of Paris’ ruling related to the class action.\nOn July 21, 2021, the Judicial Tribunal of Créteil (France) dismissed a claim for damages brought against Sanofi regarding a child\nborn in 1995. The Judicial Tribunal considered that the risk of occurrence of NDD in children born to mother exposed to sodium\nvalproate during pregnancy was not demonstrated by the state of scientific knowledge at the time of her pregnancy. This\ndecision was appealed and the proceeding is now pending before the Appeal Court of Paris, which had ordered a stay in the\nproceeding until the end of the criminal investigation.\nIn July 2020 and December 2022, a collective redress against the French affiliate was filed by 64 families which represents\n273 claimants including 100 people exposed in utero, seeking indemnification for a prejudice of anxiety. In September 2023,\n27 people exposed to sodium valproate in utero and 56 indirect victims requested the withdrawal of their claims. The trial hearing\nis set for June 6, 2024.\nCriminal investigation\nA criminal investigation was initiated in May 2015 before the Paris Civil Court. In January 2020, the French affiliate of Sanofi was\nindicted for aggravated deception and involuntary injuries and in July 2020 for involuntary manslaughter. In July 2020, a judicial\nsupervision of the affiliate was ordered, together with the implementation of financial guarantees. In November 2020, the Health\nAuthority (ANSM) was similarly indicted for involuntary injuries and involuntary manslaughters.\nOn March 9, 2022, the Chambre de l’Instruction of the Appeal Court of Paris (Cour d’appel) ruled that certain complaints for\ninvoluntary manslaughter and several others for aggravated deception and involuntary injuries were time-barred. The Public\nProsecutor, as well as the civil parties, have brought the matter before the Chambre Criminelle of the Supreme Court (Cour de\ncassation). In September 2022, the investigating judges appointed two experts for a counter-expertise following the Chambre de\nl’Instruction’s ruling handed down end of 2021. Since 2022, several individual medical assessments have been ordered by the\ninvestigating judge.\nIn June 2023, the Chambre Criminelle of the French Supreme Court (Cour de cassation) confirmed the Paris Court of Appeal’s\ndecision (Chambre de l’Instruction) dated March 2022 which had ruled that certain complaints for involuntary manslaughter and\nseveral others for aggravated deception and involuntary injuries were time-barred. In August 2023, Sanofi received the counter\nexpertise report and sent its comments in November 2023.\nPublic compensation scheme\nIn 2017, the French government set up a public compensation scheme to indemnify patients for damages suffered in connection\nwith the prescription of sodium valproate and its derivatives. The scheme was further amended through the 2020 Finance Law,\nwith notably the introduction of presumptions of default for lack of information of the mother since 1982 for malformations and\nsince 1984 for NDD. The scheme was amended again through the 2021 Finance Law in order to increase the maximum premium\napplicable in case of refusal to make an offer (or insufficient offer) which would be deemed unjustified by a court ruling.\nThe committee of the compensation scheme has issued several final opinions holding the French affiliate liable for damages\neither in full or in part along with the French State, and, in some cases, healthcare practitioners. The French affiliate disagreed\nwith the committee’s conclusions and has accordingly not offered indemnification to the claimants who have received\ncompensation from the ONIAM (Office National d’Indemnisation des Accidents Médicaux). The ONIAM is now seeking\nreimbursement from Sanofi who has filed legal actions to oppose ONIAM’s payment orders.\nSANOFI FORM 20-F 2023 F-83\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nAdministrative Actions\nIn July 2020, March and June 2021, the Montreuil Administrative Court had held the French State liable in five administrative\nproceedings initiated by families against the State. In March 2021, the Administrative Court did not retain any lack of information\nof the mother regarding the risk of neurodevelopmental disorders for births in 1999 and in 2002, based on the state of scientific\nknowledge at the time. However, regarding the risk of malformations, liabilities were retained against the State, the healthcare\nprofessionals and Sanofi, notably for discrepancy between the SmPC (Summary of the Product Characteristics) and the patient\nleaflet. In other cases involving births in 2005-2008, the liability of the State was retained for both malformations and\nneurodevelopmental disorders, and partially exonerated, taking into account the roles of healthcare practitioners and Sanofi.\nGiven that the French affiliate was not a party to these administrative proceedings, its arguments (i.e. notably several requests\nfrom the French affiliate to the Health Authorities to reinforce warnings to healthcare professionals and patients in relation to\nDEPAKINE) were not considered. All rulings were appealed by the claimants. Sanofi has filed requests for voluntary intervention in\nthese proceedings to present its arguments before the Administrative Court of Appeal. In one proceeding, the claimants decided\nto withdraw their claims.\nIt is not possible, at this stage, to make a reliable assessment of the outcome of these cases.\nDEPAKINE Product Litigation in other EU countries and in the UK\nIn Switzerland, eleven families have filed a civil claim for damages concerning seventeen people exposed in utero. Some of them\nalso involve the claimants’ physicians. In November 2022, one action was declared time-barred by the judge. The claimant\nappealed this court decision on the merit. The appeal is on-going.\nIn Spain, there are six ongoing actions relating to thirteen children. In March 2022, in one trial, the Court condemned Sanofi to\nindemnify four patients. Sanofi appealed this decision. In January 2023, in another trial filed by one patient, the Appeal Court\nconfirmed the first instance's decision and dismissed the claim. The other actions are still at a preliminary stage.\nIn Belgium, there are two civil proceedings (currently on hold) and a criminal complaint against X and against Sanofi.\nIn Ireland, there are two cases in Pre-Action stage and two civil claims on-going.\nIn the United Kingdom, there are three cases in the Pre-Action stage in Great Britain and one civil claim ongoing in Northern\nIreland.\nIt is not possible, at this stage, to assess reliably the outcome of these cases.\nDENGVAXIA (Philippines)\nSince early 2018 up to present date, several claims were filed in the Philippines by parents of deceased children whose deaths\nwere allegedly due to vaccination with DENGVAXIA. Early March 2019, 2020 and 2022, the Philippine Department of Justice\n(DOJ) prosecution panel announced it had found probable cause to indict several Sanofi employees/former employees and\nformer Government officials for “reckless imprudence” resulting in homicides. Since then, several criminal actions have been filed\nin court as a result of this finding and are pending at various stages of the legal procedure. Petitions for Review to the DOJ\nSecretary have been filed and the said petitions remain pending. Meanwhile, the majority of the respondents have challenged the\njurisdiction of the lower court where the first eight cases had been assigned and this issue is now filed with the Supreme Court.\nThere are several claims that have not yet been filed in any court despite resolutions by the DOJ that there is probable cause.\nb) Patents\nRamipril Canada Patent Litigation\nSanofi was involved in a number of legal proceedings involving companies which market generic ALTACE (ramipril) in\nCanada. In 2004, Sanofi unsuccessfully brought Notice of Compliance proceedings (NOC proceedings) at the end of which\neight manufacturers obtained marketing authorizations from the Canadian Minister of Health for generic versions of ramipril in\nCanada. Sanofi filed unsuccessful patent infringement actions against all those companies and ultimately Sanofi was liable for\ndamages under Section 8. Sanofi made payment in complete satisfaction of those awards.\nIn June 2011, Apotex commenced an action in the Ontario Superior Court of Justice asserting damages under the Ontario Statute\nof Monopolies, the UK Statute of Monopolies, and the Trade-marks Act (the “Ontario Action”).\nAt the request of the parties, in June 2021, the Court ordered that the action be stayed in view of the lower court’s decision in\nMarch in the Apotex vs. Lilly case. In the Lilly case, the Court dismissed Apotex’s Statute of Monopolies claim by way of summary\njudgment. In April 2023, the Canadian Supreme Court denied Apotex’s application for leave to appeal in the Lilly case and based\non the Supreme Court decision, Apotex’s claim no longer has any basis. Sanofi is seeking the court’s assistance to conclude the\ncase and recover appropriate costs.\nPRALUENT (alirocumab)-related Amgen Patent Litigation in the US\nIn 2014, Amgen filed four separate complaints against Sanofi and Regeneron in the US District Court for the District of Delaware\n(“District Court”) asserting patent infringement relating to Sanofi and Regeneron’s PRALUENT product. Together these\ncomplaints alleged that PRALUENT infringed seven patents for antibodies targeting PCSK9 and sought injunctive relief and\nunspecified damages.\nIn February 2021, the Federal Circuit affirmed the District Court’s ruling invalidating the Amgen asserted patent claims.\nIn November 2021, Amgen filed a petition with the US Supreme Court, asking it to overturn the Federal Circuit decision.\nOn November 4, 2022, the US Supreme Court granted Amgen’s petition for review. In May 2023, the Supreme Court issued a\nunanimous decision in favor of Sanofi and Regeneron regarding the patent infringement actions filed in 2014 by Amgen relating\nto Sanofi and Regeneron’s PRALUENT product. Sanofi is in the process of seeking certain legal costs from Amgen.\nF-84 SANOFI FORM 20-F 2023\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nPRALUENT (alirocumab)-related Amgen Patent Litigation in Europe\nIn June 2023, Amgen filed an action for infringement of EP 3 666 797 against Sanofi and Regeneron concerning PRALUENT in\nthe Munich Local Division of the Unified Patent Court. Amgen seeks a permanent injunction and unspecified damages and\ncompensation from March 1, 2023. In June 2023, Sanofi filed a revocation action attacking the validity of EP 3 666 797 in the\nMunich Central Division of the Unified Patent Court. These cases are underway: a hearing in the revocation action is scheduled\nin June 2024 and a hearing in the infringement action is scheduled for October 2024.\nJEVTANA (cabazitaxel)-related patent litigation in the US\nJEVTANA is currently covered by four Orange Book listed patents US 7,241,907, US 8,927,592, US 10,583,110 and US 10,716,777.\nIn May to July 2020, Sanofi filed patent infringement suits under Hatch-Waxman against 12 generic filers asserting the ‘110 patent\nand the ‘777 patent in the US District Court for the District of Delaware, adding the '592 patent after its amended claims issued\nin August 2021. Sanofi reached settlement agreements with most of the defendants and went to trial against the remaining\ndefendant Sandoz on the ‘777 patent in January 2023. In June 2023, the US District Court for the District of Delaware issued a\ndecision in favor of Sanofi in connection with the JEVTANA patent litigation against Sandoz and on August 2, 2023, Sandoz\nappealed to the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. On October 5, 2023, Sanofi and Sandoz filed a joint stipulation\nvoluntarily dismissing Sandoz’s Appeal, bringing this matter to final conclusion.\nPLAVIX Litigation (Commonwealth) in Australia\nIn August 2007, GenRX (a subsidiary of Apotex) obtained registration of a generic clopidogrel bisulfate product on the Australian\nRegister of Therapeutic Goods. At the same time, GenRX filed a patent invalidation action with the Federal Court of Australia,\nseeking revocation of Sanofi’s Australian enantiomer patent claiming clopidogrel salts (a “nullity action”). In September 2007,\nSanofi obtained a preliminary injunction from the Federal Court preventing commercial launch of this generic clopidogrel\nbisulfate product until judgment on the substantive issues of patent validity and infringement.\nIn August 2008, the Australian Federal Court confirmed that the claim in Sanofi’s Australian enantiomer patent directed to\nclopidogrel bisulfate (the salt form in PLAVIX) was valid and the patent infringed. On appeal, the Full Federal Court of Australia\nheld in September 2009 that all claims in the patent are invalid. Sanofi’s appeal to the Australia High Court was denied\nin March 2010. On conclusion of the proceedings in 2010, the Sanofi patent was invalidated.\nIn April 2013, the Australian Department of Health and Ageing (“Commonwealth”) filed an application before the Federal\nCourt of Australia seeking payment of damages from Sanofi related to the Apotex preliminary injunction.\nSanofi and BMS settled the patent litigation with Apotex in November 2014. In April 2020, the Commonwealth’s claim was\ndismissed. In May 2020, the Commonwealth filed a Notice of Appeal to the Full Court of the Federal Court. On appeal, the\nCommonwealth reduced its claim to a range of AUD223.3 million (€137.8 million) to AUD280.2 million (€172.9 million) which,\ninclusive of interest to December 31, 2023, ranges from AUD360.5 million (€218.0 million) to AUD487.5 million (€294.3 million).\nIn June 2023, the Full Court of the Federal Court of Australia unanimously dismissed the Commonwealth’s appeal following its\napplication seeking payment of damages from Sanofi/BMS related to the preliminary injunction. On July 24, 2023,\nthe Commonwealth filed an application for special leave to appeal to the High Court of Australia, which was granted\non December 18, 2023.\nc) Other litigation\nPLAVIX (clopidogrel) – Attorney General Action in Hawaii\nIn March 2014, the Hawaii Attorney General (AG) filed a complaint that sets forth allegations related to the sale and marketing of\nand variability of response to PLAVIX. The Hawaii AG specifically alleged that PLAVIX had a diminished effect in patients of\ncertain genetic backgrounds and that Sanofi and BMS had failed to make an earlier disclosure of this information.\nIn February 2021, the Court issued its decision, imposing penalties in the total amount of $834,012,000 against both Sanofi and\nBristol Myers Squibb (BMS), with $417,006,000 being apportioned to each company. In June 2021, Sanofi and BMS appealed\nthis judgment. The appeal was transferred directly to the Hawaii Supreme Court. In March 2023, the Hawaii Supreme Court\nvacated the judgment and ordered a new trial. A second trial was concluded in October 2023 and Sanofi is expecting a decision\nin Q1 2024. To the extent there is a new judgment entered by the court, this would be split evenly with BMS.\nPLAVIX (clopidogrel)-related litigation in France\nIn France, in the claim concerning allegations that Sanofi’s communication and promotional practices inhibited the entry on\nthe market of generics of clopidogrel (the active ingredient of PLAVIX), the French Antitrust Authority issued its decision\non May 14, 2013, imposing on Sanofi a fine of €40.6 million. This decision was confirmed by the Supreme Court (Cour de\ncassation) in 2016. As a consequence of the May 2013 ruling, claims were filed by Sandoz and by Teva in 2014 before the\nCommercial Court of Paris for compensation of their alleged damages: loss of margin and other ancillary damages. In June and\nNovember 2016 respectively, settlement agreements were entered into with Sandoz and Teva. Consequently, they subsequently\nwithdrew their civil claims, jointly and severally. In September 2017, Sanofi and its French affiliate received a summons before\nthe Paris Commercial Court from the French Caisse Nationale d’Assurance Maladie – CNAM (French Social Security)\nclaiming €115.8 million for their alleged damages. On October 1, 2019, the Paris Commercial Court dismissed the CNAM’s action as\ntime barred. On February 9, 2022, the Paris Court of Appeals overturned the Paris Commercial Court's ruling, finding the CNAM’s\naction as not time-barred and designated an expert to determine the amount of damages. The expert report is expected to be\nissued in March 2024.\nSANOFI FORM 20-F 2023 F-85\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n340B Drug Pricing Program in the United States\nSanofi is currently involved in several matters relating to the 340B program in the US (a federal program that requires drug\nmanufacturers to supply certain products to certain “covered entities” at reduced prices). In 2021, Sanofi filed a lawsuit against\nthe Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA), and certain of\ntheir administrators in the US District Court for the District of New Jersey challenging (i) HHS’s December 2020 Advisory\nOpinion (AO) stating that drug manufacturers are legally obligated to deliver discounts under the 340B program to an unlimited\nnumber of contract pharmacies; (ii) HHS’s December 2020 Administrative Dispute Resolution (ADR) Rule; and (iii) HRSA’s\nMay 2021 letter to Sanofi concluding that Sanofi’s 340B integrity initiative (under which Sanofi collects limited, de-identified,\nclaims data on 340B-priced drugs dispensed by contract pharmacies) violates section 340B and that Sanofi has therefore\n“overcharged” certain covered entities. The court issued its opinion in November 2021, upholding HRSA’s conclusion in\nthe May 2021 letter, but did not impose any fines, penalties or refund obligations against Sanofi for any “overcharges”. The court\nalso rejected Sanofi’s challenge to the ADR Rule and dismissed its challenge to the AO as moot. Sanofi appealed the court’s\ndecision to the Third Circuit Court of Appeals (Third Circuit) and the government filed a cross-appeal.\nIn January 2023, the Third Circuit held that Sanofi’s restrictions on delivery to contract pharmacies do not violate Section 340B. It\nalso enjoined HHS from enforcing against Sanofi its reading of Section 340B in the AO and the May 2021 violation letter. As to\nSanofi’s challenge to the 340B ADR rule, the Third Circuit held in favor of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS)\nand HHS is in the process of revising the ADR rule (HRSA has sent the final rule to the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs\nfor review). The Third Circuit remanded the case back to the US District Court for the District of New Jersey (District Court) and\non May 24, 2023, the District Court issued an injunction and declaratory judgment consistent with the Third Circuit’s opinion. This\nruling concluded the case as to Sanofi; however similar cases brought by other manufacturers remain pending.\nADR Proceedings\nIn January 2021, the National Association of Community Health Centers (NACHC) filed an ADR proceeding before HRSA on\nbehalf of a number of covered entities, seeking to require Sanofi and AstraZeneca to supply contract pharmacies with 340B\ndiscounts without conditions. On August 10, 2022, the ADR panel granted the motions to dismiss filed both by Sanofi and\nAstraZeneca, holding that the Delaware district court’s decision granting AstraZeneca’s motion for summary judgment precluded\nNACHC’s ADR claims against both AstraZeneca and Sanofi.\nIn September 2023, the University of Washington Medical Center and Harborview Medical Center filed a petition for monetary\nand equitable relief against Sanofi before the ADR Panel. The petition alleges that Sanofi has violated Section 340B of the Public\nHealth Service Act, 42 U.S.C. § 256b, by imposing data reporting requirements on “Covered Entities” that are authorized under\nthat statute to receive discounts on certain prescription drugs and that in June 2023, Sanofi further restricted access to 340B\ndiscounted drugs. The parties are waiting for a panel to be assigned to the case.\nIn September 2021, HRSA referred Sanofi (as well as other manufacturers) to the HHS Office of the Inspector General (OIG) in\naccordance with the 340B Program Ceiling Price and Civil Monetary Penalties Final Rule. The Third Circuit’s decision and the\nDistrict Court’s injunction and declaratory judgment (described above) would preclude action against Sanofi based on the\nparticular program at issue in the Third Circuit case.\nIn February 2021, the Vermont Attorney General issued a Civil Investigative Subpoena seeking certain information about Sanofi’s\nparticipation in the 340B Drug Pricing Program. Sanofi cooperated with this investigation, including producing documents to the\nVermont Attorney General’s office.\nMosaic Health\nIn July 2021, Mosaic Health Inc. and Central Virginia Health Services (covered entities) filed a nationwide antitrust class action\ncomplaint against Sanofi and three other manufacturers in the United States District Court for the Western District of New York.\nPlaintiffs allege that Sanofi and the other defendants conspired to eliminate favorable 340B pricing, particularly with respect to\ndiabetes therapies. On September 2, 2022, the court granted Defendants’ motion to dismiss the complaint. On October 3, 2022,\nplaintiff filed a motion for leave to file a second amended complaint. On February 1, 2024, the Court denied plaintiffs’ motion for\nleave to file an amended complaint and dismissed the case. An appeal by plaintiffs is expected.\nAdventist Health System/West\nIn June 2023, Adventist Health System/West sued several drug manufacturing companies, including Sanofi-Aventis US LLC,\nSanofi US Services Inc. and Genzyme Corporation, alleging that the companies violated state and federal False Claims Acts\nthrough overcharging for 340B Program drugs in violation of federal “penny pricing” policy. The manufacturers jointly moved to\ndismiss.\nPreliminary investigation by the Parquet National Financier (PNF) in France\nIn November 2023, Sanofi learnt through the press of an ongoing preliminary investigation by the French financial prosecutor\n(Parquet National Financier – PNF) started in March 2023 relating to allegations regarding Sanofi’s financial communication on\nthe launch of DUPIXENT at the end of 2017. Sanofi considers these allegations as groundless and is cooperating with the PNF to\nrespond to the potential questions relating to the ongoing investigation.\nF-86 SANOFI FORM 20-F 2023\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nd) Contingencies arising from certain mergers & acquisitions transactions\nAs a result of divestitures, the Company is subject to a number of ongoing contractual and legal obligations regarding the state of\nthe sold businesses, their assets, and their liabilities, some of which may be subject to dispute.\nAventis CropScience Retained Liabilities\nThe sale by Aventis Agriculture SA and Hoechst GmbH (both legacy companies of Sanofi) of their aggregate 76% participation in\nAventis CropScience Holding (ACS) to Bayer and Bayer CropScience AG (BCS), the wholly owned subsidiary of Bayer which holds\nthe ACS shares, was effective on June 3, 2002. The Stock Purchase Agreement (SPA) dated October 2, 2001, contained\ncustomary representations and warranties with respect to the sold business, as well as a number of indemnifications subject to\nlimitation periods and caps, in particular with respect to environmental liabilities for which some outstanding claims from Bayer\nremain unresolved.\nInfraserv Hoechst Retained Liabilities\nBy the Asset Contribution Agreement dated December 19/20, 1996, as amended in 1997, Hoechst contributed all lands, buildings,\nand related assets of the Hoechst site at Frankfurt Hoechst to Infraserv GmbH & Co. Hoechst KG. Infraserv Hoechst undertook to\nindemnify Hoechst against environmental liabilities at the Hoechst site and with respect to certain landfills. As consideration for\nthe indemnification undertaking, Hoechst transferred to Infraserv Hoechst approximately €57 million to fund reserves. In 1997,\nHoechst also agreed it would reimburse current and future Infraserv Hoechst environmental expenses up to €143 million. As a\nformer operator of the land and as a former user of the landfills, Hoechst may ultimately be liable for costs of remedial action in\nexcess of this amount.\nBoehringer Ingelheim (BI) Consumer Healthcare Liabilities\nSanofi and Boehringer Ingelheim (BI) have agreed upon respective indemnification obligations for liabilities as part of the swap of\nSanofi’s Animal Health (AH) business for BI’s Consumer Health Care (CHC) business in January 2017 and under a Global\nSettlement Agreement concluded in September 2019 regarding notably the offset of respective AH and CHC claims notified\nunder the SPAs.\nIn February 2020, BI initiated an arbitration against Sanofi seeking indemnification for losses it could incur as a result of the\nZANTAC litigation in the US (see above). In an award rendered on June 19, 2023, the arbitral tribunal irrevocably dismissed BI’s\nindemnification claim against Sanofi and confirmed that Sanofi shall not be liable to indemnify BI for any potential losses in\nrelation to the ongoing ZANTAC litigation in the U.S. The case is closed.\nSANOFI FORM 20-F 2023 F-87\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nD.23.

Financial relations with Sanofi’s\nprincipal shareholders fall within the ordinary course of business and were immaterial in the years ended December 31, 2023,\n2022 and 2021.\nNote F.1. lists the principal companies controlled by Sanofi; those companies are fully consolidated, as described in Note B.1.\nTransactions between those companies, and between the parent company and its subsidiaries, are eliminated when preparing\nthe consolidated financial statements.\nTransactions with companies over which Sanofi has significant influence, and with joint ventures, are presented in Note D.6.\nKey management personnel include corporate officers and the members of the Executive Committee (an average of 10 members\nin 2023, and 11 in 2022 and in 2021).\nThe table below shows, by type, the compensation paid to key management personnel:\n(€ million) 2023 2022 2021\nShort-term benefits(a) 36 31 33\nPost-employment benefits 2 2 2\nShare-based payment 8 19 20\nTotal recognized in profit or loss 46 52 55\n(a) Compensation, employer’s social security contributions, directors’ compensation, and any termination benefits (net of reversals of termination benefit\nobligations).\nThe table below shows the aggregate obligation as of December 31 for each period presented for individuals who hold or have\nheld executive positions within Sanofi during that period.\n(€ million) 2023 2022 2021\nAggregate top-up pension obligation in favor of certain corporate officers and of Executive\nCommittee members 10 10 28\nAggregate termination benefits and lump-sum retirement benefits in favor of key management\npersonnel 6 5 7\nD.34. Disclosures about major customers and credit risk\nCredit risk is the risk that customers (wholesalers, distributors, pharmacies, hospitals, clinics or government agencies) may fail to\npay their debts; for Sanofi, that risk is mainly concentrated on amounts receivable from wholesalers in the United States. Sanofi\nmanages credit risk by vetting customers in order to set credit limits and risk levels, and asking for guarantees or insurance where\nnecessary; performing controls; and monitoring qualitative and quantitative indicators of accounts receivable balances, such as\nthe period of credit taken and overdue payments.\nSales generated by Sanofi with its biggest customers, in particular certain wholesalers in the United States, represented 27% of\nnet sales in 2023. The three largest customers respectively accounted for approximately 11%, 9% and 7% of Sanofi's net sales\nin 2023 (12%, 8% and 7% in 2022; 10%, 7% and 6% in 2021).\nSANOFI FORM 20-F 2023 F-91\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nD.35. Segment information\nAs indicated in Note B.26., Sanofi has two operating segments with effect from January 1, 2023: Biopharma and Consumer\nHealthcare.\nIn 2022, Sanofi reported three operating segments (Pharmaceuticals, Vaccines and Consumer Healthcare). The costs of the\nglobal support functions (Corporate Affairs, Finance, People & Culture, Legal, Ethics, Business Integrity & Global Security,\nInformation Solutions & Technology, Sanofi Business Services, etc.), which are mainly managed centrally at group-wide level,\nwere presented within the “Other” category.\nIn 2023, Sanofi reviewed the presentation of its segment information following adjustments to its internal reporting systems in\norder to reflect (i) progress on the “Play to Win” strategy leading to the creation of the standalone Consumer Healthcare Global\nBusiness Unit (GBU) which, in addition to integrated research, development and production functions now also has its own\ndedicated global support functions (including Finance, People & Culture, Legal, Ethics, Business Integrity & Global Security,\nInformation Solutions & Technology, Global Business Services, etc.); and (ii) organizational changes to Sanofi’s Manufacturing &\nSupply global function (previously known as Industrial Affairs).\nConsequently, with effect from January 1, 2023, Sanofi reports two operating segments: Biopharma and Consumer Healthcare.\nThe Biopharma operating segment comprises commercial operations and research, development and production activities\nrelating to the Specialty Care, General Medicines and Vaccines franchises, for all geographical territories. The segment’s results\ninclude the costs of global support functions that are not within the managerial responsibility of the Consumer Healthcare GBU.\nThe Consumer Healthcare operating segment comprises commercial operations relating to Consumer Healthcare products, and\nresearch, development and production activities and global support functions (as listed above) dedicated to the segment, for all\ngeographical territories. The Consumer Healthcare GBU segment’s results reflect all incurred costs of global support functions\nattributable to its business.\nThe “Other” category comprises reconciling items, primarily but not limited to (i) gains and losses on centralized foreign exchange\nrisk hedging transactions that cannot be allocated to the operating segments and (ii) gains and losses on retained commitments\nin respect of previously divested operations.\nF-92 SANOFI FORM 20-F 2023\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nD.35.1.

(Inhibrx), a publicly traded, clinical-\nstage biopharmaceutical company focused on developing a broad pipeline of novel biologic therapeutic candidates in oncology\nand orphan diseases (the Merger Agreement), pursuant to which Sanofi has agreed to acquire Inhibrx following the spin-off of\nInhibrx's non-INBRX-101 assets and liabilities into a new publicly traded company (\"New Inhibrx\"). Under the terms of the Merger\nAgreement, Sanofi has agreed to: (i) provide Inhibrx's stockholders with consideration of $30 per share of Inhibrx common stock\nat the closing of the merger (approximately $1.7 billion), and to additionally issue one non-transferable contingent value right per\nshare of Inhibrx common stock, which will entitle its holder to receive a deferred cash payment of $5, conditioned upon the\nachievement of a regulatory milestone (approximately $0.3 billion, if the regulatory milestone is achieved); (ii) pay off Inhibrx’s\noutstanding third-party debt (approximately $0.2 billion); and (iii) provide a capital contribution to New Inhibrx (up to $0.2 billion).\nAt the closing of the merger, Sanofi will acquire 100% of the equity interests in Inhibrx, which will become a 100% wholly owned\nsubsidiary of Sanofi. In addition, Inhibrx will retain a minority stake (approximately 8% equity interest) in New Inhibrx. INBRX-101 is\na human recombinant protein that holds the promise of allowing Alpha-1 Antitrypsin Deficiency (AATD) patients to achieve\nnormalization of serum AAT levels with less frequent (monthly vs. weekly) dosing. AATD is an inherited rare disease characterized\nby low levels of AAT protein, predominantly affecting the lung with progressive deterioration of the tissue. INBRX-101 may help to\nreduce inflammation and prevent further deterioration of lung function in affected individuals. INBRX-101 acquisition is expected\nto support Sanofi’s portfolio growth strategy and complements the Company’s 30-year heritage in rare diseases and track record\nin immunology and inflammation. The transaction is subject to various closing conditions, including the receipt of regulatory\napprovals and completion of the spin-off of New Inhibrx. Assuming satisfaction of those closing conditions, Sanofi currently\nanticipates that the transaction will close in the second quarter of 2024.\nSANOFI FORM 20-F 2023
