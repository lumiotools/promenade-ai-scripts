This decrease was mainly due to the timing of expected job awards, mix in backlog, and, to a lesser extent, lower steel prices. Our Precast business achieved record third quarter revenue and gross margins that improved over the prior quarter by 140 basis points to 23.5%, and saw remarkable strength on the residential side despite facing challenges in the non-residential portion. As we enter the traditionally slower period for Precast, the order book has only seen a slight drop, which speaks to the ongoing resilience of this segment.\"\n\nMontross continued, \"We expect the fourth quarter for the SPP business to be stronger than we have seen in recent years, and the Precast business to continue to perform well by historical standards with stable margins. Overall, we are optimistic about our ability to finish the year on a strong note, positioning us well for continued growth.\"\n\n**Third****Quarter 2024 Financial Results**\n\n_Consolidated_\n\n  * Net sales increased 9.7% to $130.2 million from $118.7 million in the third quarter of 2023.\n  * Gross profit increased 40.0% to a record of $27.0 million, or 20.8% of net sales, from $19.3 million, or 16.3% of net sales, in the third quarter of 2023.\n  * Net income was $10.3 million, or $1.02 per diluted share, compared to $5.8 million, or $0.58 per diluted share, in the third quarter of 2023.\n\n\n\n_Engineered Steel Pressure Pipe Segment (SPP)_\n\n  * SPP net sales increased 6.7% to $85.9 million from $80.5 million in the third quarter of 2023 driven by an 18% increase in tons produced resulting from an improved bidding environment coupled with changes in project timing, partially offset by a 9% decrease in selling price per ton due to lower raw materials costs.\n  * SPP gross profit increased 52.4% to $16.6 million, or 19.4% of SPP net sales, from $10.9 million, or 13.6% of SPP net sales, in the third quarter of 2023 primarily due to increased volume and changes in product mix.\n  * SPP backlog was $231 million as of September 30, 2024 compared to $282 million as of June 30, 2024 and $253 million as of September 30, 2023.

The Company will broadcast its second quarter 2024 earnings conference call on Thursday, August 1, 2024 at 7:00 a.m. PT.\n\n[ ![Northwest Pipe Company Logo \\(PRNewsfoto/Northwest Pipe Company\\)](https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/1162112/Northwest_Pipe_Company_Logo.jpg) ](https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/1162112/Northwest_Pipe_Company_Logo.html)\n\n**Management Commentary**\n\n\"Our second quarter results were very strong despite the weather-related challenges we encountered in Texas which disrupted production, shipping, and order intake,\" said Scott Montross, President and Chief Executive Officer of Northwest Pipe Company. \"We delivered record quarterly revenue of $89.5 million in our Steel Pressure Pipe business and enjoyed continued strength in the residential side of our Precast business despite persistent interest rate headwinds. In addition, record quarterly profitability levels, coupled with effective working capital management, led to strong free cash flow _4_ generation of $16.2 million in the second quarter, up significantly versus last year. The SPP segment benefitted from the strong pipeline of bidding opportunities in the first half of this year. We expect our SPP business to remain strong for the rest of 2024. In Precast, reduced production and shipments on the non-residential construction portion of our business at Park offset much of the strength we saw on the residential side at Geneva, primarily due to multiple severe weather events in Texas. Following a slow first half of the year in Precast, we are expecting a stronger third quarter with improving revenue and gross margins.\"\n\n**Second****Quarter 2024 Financial Results**\n\n_Consolidated_\n\n  * Net sales increased 11.3% to $129.5 million from $116.4 million in the second quarter of 2023. \n  * Gross profit increased 14.8% to a record of $25.8 million, or 19.9% of net sales, from $22.5 million, or 19.3% of net sales, in the second quarter of 2023.\n  * Net income was $8.6 million, or $0.86 per diluted share, compared to $7.4 million, or $0.74 per diluted share, in the second quarter of 2023.\n\n\n\n_Engineered Steel Pressure Pipe Segment (SPP)_\n\n  * SPP net sales increased 15.9% to a quarterly record of $89.5 million from $77.3 million in the second quarter of 2023 driven by a 56% increase in tons produced resulting from an improved bidding environment coupled with changes in project timing, partially offset by a 26% decrease in selling price per ton due to a combination of lower raw materials costs and product mix.\n  * SPP gross profit increased 35.1% to $17.0 million, or 19.0% of SPP net sales, from $12.6 million, or 16.3% of SPP net sales, in the second quarter of 2023 primarily due to increased volume and changes in product mix.\n  * SPP backlog was $282 million as of June 30, 2024 compared to $255 million as of March 31, 2024 and $292 million as of June 30, 2023.
