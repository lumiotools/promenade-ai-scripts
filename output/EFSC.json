LOUIS--(BUSINESS WIRE)--  Jim Lally, President and Chief Executive Officer of Enterprise Financial Services Corp (Nasdaq: EFSC) (the “Company” or “EFSC”), said today upon the release of EFSC’s third quarter earnings, “We are proud of our third quarter results, with a stable net interest margin, expansion in net interest income and an 11% increase in diluted earnings per share over the linked quarter. Our consistent return profile increased tangible book value per share 25% on an annualized basis from the linked quarter, and 20% over the prior year’s third quarter. With the strength of our balance sheet and capital position as a foundation, I believe we are well positioned to continue executing on the opportunities within our markets.” \n\n**Highlights**\n\n  * **Earnings** - Net income in the third quarter 2024 was $50.6 million, an increase of $5.1 million and $5.9 million compared to the linked and prior year quarters, respectively. Earnings per diluted common share for the third quarter 2024 was $1.32, compared to $1.19 and $1.17 for the linked and prior year quarters, respectively. Adjusted diluted earnings per common share 1 was $1.29 for the third quarter 2024, compared to $1.21 and $1.17 for the linked and prior year quarters, respectively. \n\n\n  * **Pre-provision net revenue (“PPNR”) 1 ** - PPNR of $65.1 million in the third quarter 2024 increased $1.8 million from the linked quarter and was relatively stable with the prior year quarter. The increase from the linked quarter was primarily due to higher noninterest income from sales of other real estate owned, and higher net interest income that benefited from an increase in average earning assets. The increase in operating revenue was partially offset by an increase in noninterest expense, primarily variable deposit services costs and employee compensation and benefits. \n\n\n  * **Net interest income and net interest margin (“NIM”)** - Net interest income of $143.5 million for the third quarter 2024 increased $2.9 million and $1.8 million from the linked and prior year quarters, respectively. Compared to the linked quarter, net interest income for the third quarter 2024 increased primarily due to higher interest-earning asset balances and an additional day in the quarter. NIM was 4.17% for the third quarter 2024, compared to 4.19% and 4.33% for the linked and prior year quarters, respectively. The total cost of deposits of 2.18% for the third quarter 2024 increased 2 basis points and 34 basis points from the linked and prior year quarters, respectively. \n\n\n  * **Noninterest income** - Noninterest income of $21.4 million for the third quarter 2024 increased $5.9 million and $9.3 million from the linked and prior year quarters, respectively. The increase from the linked and prior year quarters was primarily due to an increase in tax credit income, a net gain on the sale of other real estate owned and an increase in income on community development investments. \n\n\n  * **Noninterest expense** - Noninterest expense of $98.0 million for the third quarter 2024 increased $4.0 million and $9.4 million from the linked and prior year quarters, respectively. The increase from the linked and prior year quarters was primarily driven by higher employee compensation and variable deposit servicing costs. The Company continues to have success in recruiting new relationship managers and in deposit generation from existing relationships, both of which have contributed to an increase in average deposit balances. The increase from the prior year quarter was also affected by expenses related to the core system conversion. \n\n\n  * **Loans** - Loans totaled $11.1 billion at September 30, 2024, an increase of $79.9 million from the linked quarter and an increase of $463.1 million from the prior year quarter. Average loans totaled $11.0 billion for both the current and linked quarter and $10.5 billion in the prior year quarter. \n\n\n  * **Asset quality** - The allowance for credit losses to total loans was 1.26% at September 30, 2024, compared to 1.27% at June 30, 2024 and 1.34% at September 30, 2023. The ratio of nonperforming assets to total assets was 0.22% at September 30, 2024, compared to 0.33% and 0.40% at June 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively. The provision for credit losses recorded in the third quarter 2024 was $4.1 million, compared to $4.8 million and $8.0 million for the linked and prior year quarters, respectively. \n\n\n  * **Deposits** - Deposits totaled $12.5 billion at September 30, 2024, an increase of $182.9 million from the linked quarter. Excluding brokered certificates of deposits, deposits increased $196.9 million. Average deposits were $12.5 billion, $12.3 billion and $11.9 billion for the current, linked and prior year quarters, respectively. At September 30, 2024, noninterest-bearing deposit accounts totaled $3.9 billion, or 31.6% of total deposits, and the loan to deposit ratio was 88.9%. \n\n\n  * **Liquidity** - The total available on- and off-balance-sheet liquidity was approximately $5.8 billion at September 30, 2024. On-balance-sheet liquidity consisted of cash of $426.4 million and $1.4 billion in unpledged investment securities at September 30, 2024. Off-balance-sheet liquidity consisted of $1.2 billion available through the Federal Home Loan Bank, $2.6 billion available through the Federal Reserve and $140.0 million through correspondent bank lines. The Company also has an unused $25.0 million revolving line of credit and maintains a shelf registration allowing for the issuance of various forms of equity and debt securities. \n\n\n  * **Capital** - Total shareholders’ equity was $1.8 billion and the tangible common equity to tangible assets ratio 2 was 9.50% at September 30, 2024, compared to 9.18% at June 30, 2024. Enterprise Bank & Trust remains “well-capitalized,” with a common equity tier 1 ratio of 12.5% and a total risk-based capital ratio of 13.6% at September 30, 2024. The Company’s common equity tier 1 ratio and total risk-based capital ratio were 11.9% and 14.8%, respectively, at September 30, 2024. \n\n\n\nThe Company’s board of directors approved a quarterly dividend of $0.28 per common share, payable on December 31, 2024 to shareholders of record as of December 16, 2024. The board of directors also declared a cash dividend of $12.50 per share of Series A Preferred Stock (or $0.3125 per depositary share) representing a 5% per annum rate for the period commencing (and including) September 15, 2024 to (but excluding) December 15, 2024. The dividend will be payable on December 15, 2024 and will be paid on December 16, 2024 to holders of record of Series A Preferred Stock as of November 29, 2024. \n\n___________________  \n---  \n1 ROATCE, tangible common equity to tangible assets, tangible book value per share, adjusted diluted earnings per share and PPNR are non-GAAP measures.

Interest income includes net loan fees of $2.6 million, $2.2 million, and $3.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, June 30, 2024, and September 30, 2023, respectively.   \n2 Non-taxable income is presented on a fully tax-equivalent basis using a tax rate of approximately 25%. The tax-equivalent adjustments were $2.1 million for each of the three months ended September 30, 2024, June 30, 2024, and September 30, 2023, respectively.   \n  \nNet interest income of $143.5 million for the third quarter 2024 increased $2.9 million and $1.8 million from the linked and prior year quarters, respectively. Net interest income on a tax equivalent basis was $145.6 million, $142.6 million and $143.7 million for the current, linked and prior year quarters, respectively. The increase from the linked and prior quarters reflects the benefit of higher yields combined with organic growth. In late September 2024 the Federal Reserve reduced the federal funds target rate by 50 basis points. In response, since the Company maintains an asset-sensitive balance sheet, deposit pricing has been adjusted to partially mitigate the impact on income from the repricing of variable rate loans. \n\nInterest income increased $4.7 million during the third quarter 2024 due to increases in all interest earning categories, including loans, securities and interest earning cash accounts. Interest income increased primarily due to an increase in average balances compared to the linked quarter. Continued success in deposit generation has increased liquidity, which has been primarily deployed into the securities portfolio. \n\nThe average interest rate of new loan originations in the third quarter 2024 was 7.84%, a decrease of 23 basis points from the linked quarter. Investment purchases in the third quarter 2024 had a weighted average, tax equivalent yield of 4.97%. \n\nInterest expense increased $1.7 million in the third quarter 2024 primarily due to an increase in deposit interest expense, partially offset by a decline in interest expense on borrowings. The average cost of interest-bearing deposits was 3.22%, an increase of 3 basis points compared to the linked quarter. The total cost of deposits, including noninterest-bearing demand accounts, was 2.18% during the third quarter 2024, compared to 2.16% in the linked quarter. \n\nNIM, on a tax equivalent basis, was 4.17% in the third quarter 2024, a decrease of 2 basis points from the linked quarter and a decrease of 16 basis points from the prior year quarter.

The increase from the linked and prior year quarters was primarily due to an increase in tax credit income from a positive change in credits carried at fair value, and a net gain on the sale of other real estate that is included in Other income. Tax credit income varies based on transaction volumes and fair value changes on credits carried at fair value. \n\nThe following table presents a comparative summary of the major components of other income for the periods indicated: \n\nLinked quarter comparison  |  Prior year comparison   \n---|---  \nQuarter ended  |  Quarter ended   \n_($ in thousands)_ |  September 30, 2024  |  June 30, 2024  |  Increase (decrease)  |  September 30, 2023  |  Increase (decrease)   \nGain on sales of other real estate owned  |  $  |  3,159  |  $  |  —  |  $  |  3,159  |  100  |  %  |  $  |  —  |  $  |  3,159  |  100  |  %   \nBOLI  |  1,123  |  855  |  268  |  31  |  %  |  822  |  301  |  37  |  %   \nCommunity development investments  |  1,177  |  381  |  796  |  209  |  %  |  338  |  839  |  248  |  %   \nPrivate equity fund distributions  |  614  |  411  |  203  |  49  |  %  |  181  |  433  |  239  |  %   \nServicing fees  |  539  |  594  |  (55  |  )  |  (9  |  )%  |  701  |  (162  |  )  |  (23  |  )%   \nSwap fees  |  17  |  217  |  (200  |  )  |  (92  |  )%  |  54  |  (37  |  )  |  (69  |  )%   \nGain on SBA loan sales  |  —  |  —  |  —  |  —  |  %  |  1,514  |  (1,514  |  )  |  (100  |  )%   \nMiscellaneous income  |  1,718  |  1,533  |  185  |  12  |  %  |  1,787  |  (69  |  )  |  (4  |  )%   \nTotal other income  |  $  |  8,347  |  $  |  3,991  |  $  |  4,356  |  109  |  %  |  $  |  5,397  |  $  |  2,950  |  55  |  %   \n  \nThe increase in other income from the linked and prior year quarters was primarily driven by a $3.2 million net gain on the sale of other real estate in the third quarter 2024 and higher community development income. Community development income and private equity fund distributions are not consistent sources of income and fluctuate based on distributions from the underlying funds. The increase from the prior year quarter was partially offset by a decline in the gain on SBA loan sales that were transacted in the prior year. \n\n**Noninterest Expense**\n\nThe following table presents a comparative summary of the major components of noninterest expense for the periods indicated: \n\nLinked quarter comparison  |  Prior year comparison   \n---|---  \nQuarter ended  |  Quarter ended   \n_($ in thousands)_ |  September 30, 2024  |  June 30, 2024  |  Increase (decrease)  |  September 30, 2023  |  Increase (decrease)   \nEmployee compensation and benefits  |  $  |  45,359  |  $  |  44,524  |  $  |  835  |  2  |  %  |  $  |  40,771  |  $  |  4,588  |  11  |  %   \nDeposit costs  |  23,781  |  21,706  |  2,075  |  10  |  %  |  20,987  |  2,794  |  13  |  %   \nOccupancy  |  4,372  |  4,197  |  175  |  4  |  %  |  4,198  |  174  |  4  |  %   \nCore conversion expense  |  1,375  |  1,250  |  125  |  10  |  %  |  —  |  1,375  |  100  |  %   \nOther expense  |  23,120  |  22,340  |  780  |  3  |  %  |  22,688  |  432  |  2  |  %   \nTotal noninterest expense  |  $  |  98,007  |  $  |  94,017  |  $  |  3,990  |  4  |  %  |  $  |  88,644  |  $  |  9,363  |  11  |  %   \n  \nEmployee compensation and benefits increased $0.8 million from the linked quarter primarily due to an increase in the number of work days in the quarter and the success in recruiting new relationship bankers. Deposit costs relate to certain specialized deposit businesses that receive an earnings credit allowance for deposit related expenses that are impacted by interest rates and average balances. Deposit costs increased $2.1 million from the linked quarter primarily due to an increase of $151.6 million in average deposit vertical balances from the linked quarter. Expenses related to the core system conversion for the current and linked quarters were $1.4 million and $1.3 million, respectively, due to the continued progress on the project, which is expected to be completed during the fourth quarter 2024. \n\nThe increase in noninterest expense of $9.4 million from the prior year quarter was primarily due to an increase in the associate base, merit increases throughout 2023 and 2024, an increase in variable deposit costs due to higher earnings credit rates and average balances, and additional expenses incurred related to the core system conversion. \n\nFor the third quarter 2024, the core efficiency ratio 5 was 58.4%, compared to 58.1% for the linked quarter and 56.2% for the prior year quarter. \n\n___________________  \n---  \n5 Core efficiency ratio is a non-GAAP measure. Refer to discussion and reconciliation of this measure in the accompanying financial tables.   \n  \n**Income Taxes**\n\nThe effective tax rate was 19.4%, compared to 20.5% and 21.7% in the linked and prior year quarters, respectively. The decrease in the effective tax rate from the linked and prior year quarters was driven by tax credit opportunities the Company has deployed as part of its tax planning strategy. \n\n**Capital**\n\nThe following table presents total equity and various capital ratios for the most recent five quarters: \n\nAt   \n---  \n_($ in thousands)_ |  September 30, 2024*  |  June 30, 2024  |  March 31, 2024  |  December 31, 2023  |  September 30, 2023   \nShareholders’ equity  |  $  |  1,832,011  |  $  |  1,755,273  |  $  |  1,731,725  |  $  |  1,716,068  |  $  |  1,611,880   \nTotal risk-based capital to risk-weighted assets  |  14.8  |  %  |  14.6  |  %  |  14.3  |  %  |  14.2  |  %  |  14.1  |  %   \nTier 1 capital to risk weighted assets  |  13.2  |  %  |  13.0  |  %  |  12.8  |  %  |  12.7  |  %  |  12.6  |  %   \nCommon equity tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets  |  11.9  |  %  |  11.7  |  %  |  11.4  |  %  |  11.3  |  %  |  11.2  |  %   \nLeverage ratio  |  11.2  |  %  |  11.1  |  %  |  11.0  |  %  |  11.0  |  %  |  10.9  |  %   \nTangible common equity to tangible assets  |  9.50  |  %  |  9.18  |  %  |  9.01  |  %  |  8.96  |  %  |  8.51  |  %   \n*Capital ratios for the current quarter are preliminary and subject to, among other things, completion and filing of the Company’s regulatory reports and ongoing regulatory review.   \n  \nTotal equity was $1.8 billion at September 30, 2024, an increase of $76.7 million from the linked quarter. Tangible common book value per share was $37.26 at September 30, 2024, compared to $35.02 and $31.06 at June 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively. \n\nThe Company’s regulatory capital ratios continue to exceed the “well-capitalized” regulatory benchmark. Capital ratios for the current quarter are subject to, among other things, completion and filing of the Company’s regulatory reports and ongoing regulatory review. \n\n**Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures**\n\nThe Company’s accounting and reporting policies conform to generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (“GAAP”) and the prevailing practices in the banking industry. However, the Company provides additional financial measures, such as tangible common equity, PPNR, ROATCE, core efficiency ratio, the tangible common equity to tangible assets ratio, tangible book value per common share, estimated insured deposits and adjusted diluted earnings per share, in this release that are considered “non-GAAP financial measures.” Generally, a non-GAAP financial measure is a numerical measure of a company’s financial performance, financial position, or cash flows that exclude (or include) amounts that are included in (or excluded from) the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP. \n\nThe Company considers its tangible common equity, PPNR, ROATCE, core efficiency ratio, the tangible common equity to tangible assets ratio, tangible book value per common share, estimated insured deposits and adjusted diluted earnings per share, collectively “core performance measures,” presented in this earnings release and the included tables as important measures of financial performance, even though they are non-GAAP measures, as they provide supplemental information by which to evaluate the impact of certain non-comparable items, and the Company’s operating performance on an ongoing basis. Core performance measures exclude certain other income and expense items, such as the FDIC special assessment, core conversion expenses, merger-related expenses, facilities charges, and the gain or loss on the sale of other real estate owned and investment securities, that the Company believes to be not indicative of or useful to measure the Company’s operating performance on an ongoing basis. The attached tables contain a reconciliation of these core performance measures to the GAAP measures. The Company believes that the tangible common equity to tangible assets ratio provides useful information to investors about the Company’s capital strength even though it is considered to be a non-GAAP financial measure and is not part of the regulatory capital requirements to which the Company is subject. \n\nThe Company believes these non-GAAP measures and ratios, when taken together with the corresponding GAAP measures and ratios, provide meaningful supplemental information regarding the Company’s performance and capital strength. The Company’s management uses, and believes that investors benefit from referring to, these non-GAAP measures and ratios in assessing the Company’s operating results and related trends and when forecasting future periods. However, these non-GAAP measures and ratios should be considered in addition to, and not as a substitute for or preferable to, ratios prepared in accordance with GAAP. In the attached tables, the Company has provided a reconciliation of, where applicable, the most comparable GAAP financial measures and ratios to the non-GAAP financial measures and ratios, or a reconciliation of the non-GAAP calculation of the financial measures for the periods indicated. \n\n**Conference Call and Webcast Information**\n\nThe Company will host a conference call and webcast at 10:00 a.m. Central Time on Tuesday, October 22, 2024.

Such forward-looking statements are based on management’s current expectations and beliefs concerning future developments and their potential effects on the Company including, without limitation, plans, strategies and goals, and statements about the Company’s expectations regarding revenue and asset growth, financial performance and profitability, loan and deposit growth, liquidity, yields and returns, loan diversification and credit management, shareholder value creation and the impact of acquisitions. \n\nForward-looking statements are typically identified by words such as “believe,” “expect,” “anticipate,” “intend,” “outlook,” “estimate,” “forecast,” “project,” “pro forma”, “pipeline” and other similar words and expressions. Forward-looking statements are subject to numerous assumptions, risks and uncertainties, which change over time. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made. Because forward-looking statements are subject to assumptions and uncertainties, actual results or future events could differ, possibly materially, from those anticipated in the forward-looking statements and future results could differ materially from historical performance. They are neither statements of historical fact nor guarantees or assurances of future performance. While there is no assurance that any list of risks and uncertainties or risk factors is complete, important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements include the following, without limitation: the Company’s ability to efficiently integrate acquisitions into its operations, retain the customers of these businesses and grow the acquired operations, as well as credit risk, changes in the appraised valuation of real estate securing impaired loans, outcomes of litigation and other contingencies, exposure to general and local economic and market conditions, high unemployment rates, higher inflation and its impacts (including U.S. federal government measures to address higher inflation), U.S. fiscal debt, budget and tax matters, and any slowdown in global economic growth, risks associated with rapid increases or decreases in prevailing interest rates, our ability to attract and retain deposits and access to other sources of liquidity, consolidation in the banking industry, competition from banks and other financial institutions, the Company’s ability to attract and retain relationship officers and other key personnel, burdens imposed by federal and state regulation, changes in legislative or regulatory requirements, as well as current, pending or future legislation or regulation that could have a negative effect on our revenue and businesses, including rules and regulations relating to bank products and financial services, changes in accounting policies and practices or accounting standards, changes in the method of determining LIBOR and the phase out of LIBOR, natural disasters, terrorist activities, war and geopolitical matters (including the war in Israel and potential for a broader regional conflict and the war in Ukraine and the imposition of additional sanctions and export controls in connection therewith), or pandemics, and their effects on economic and business environments in which we operate, including the related disruption to the financial market and other economic activity, and those factors and risks referenced from time to time in the Company’s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”), including in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, and the Company’s other filings with the SEC. The Company cautions that the preceding list is not exhaustive of all possible risk factors and other factors could also adversely affect the Company’s results. \n\nFor any forward-looking statements made in this press release or in any documents, EFSC claims the protection of the safe harbor for forward-looking statements contained in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. \n\nReaders are cautioned not to place undue reliance on any forward-looking statements. Except to the extent required by applicable law or regulation, EFSC disclaims any obligation to revise or publicly release any revision or update to any of the forward-looking statements included herein to reflect events or circumstances that occur after the date on which such statements were made. \n\n**ENTERPRISE FINANCIAL SERVICES CORP**  \n---  \n**CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL SUMMARY

October 21, 2024 – Jim Lally, President and Chief Executive Officer of Enterprise Financial Services\nCorp (Nasdaq: EFSC) (the “Company” or “EFSC”), said today upon the release of EFSC’s third quarter earnings,\n“We are proud of our third quarter results, with a stable net interest margin, expansion in net interest income and an\n11% increase in diluted earnings per share over the linked quarter. Our consistent return profile increased tangible\nbook value per share 25% on an annualized basis from the linked quarter, and 20% over the prior year’s third\nquarter. With the strength of our balance sheet and capital position as a foundation, I believe we are well positioned\nto continue executing on the opportunities within our markets.”\nHighlights\n• Earnings - Net income in the third quarter 2024 was $50.6 million, an increase of $5.1 million and\n$5.9 million compared to the linked and prior year quarters, respectively. Earnings per diluted common\nshare for the third quarter 2024 was $1.32, compared to $1.19 and $1.17 for the linked and prior year\nquarters, respectively. Adjusted diluted earnings per common share1 was $1.29 for the third quarter 2024,\ncompared to $1.21 and $1.17 for the linked and prior year quarters, respectively.\n1 ROATCE, tangible common equity to tangible assets, tangible book value per share, adjusted diluted earnings per share and PPNR are non-\nGAAP measures. Please refer to discussion and reconciliation of these measures in the accompanying financial tables.\n• Pre-provision net revenue (“PPNR”)1 - PPNR of $65.1 million in the third quarter 2024 increased\n$1.8 million from the linked quarter and was relatively stable with the prior year quarter. The increase from\nthe linked quarter was primarily due to higher noninterest income from sales of other real estate owned, and\nhigher net interest income that benefited from an increase in average earning assets. The increase in\noperating revenue was partially offset by an increase in noninterest expense, primarily variable deposit\nservices costs and employee compensation and benefits.\n• Net interest income and net interest margin (“NIM”) - Net interest income of $143.5 million for the\nthird quarter 2024 increased $2.9 million and $1.8 million from the linked and prior year quarters,\nrespectively. Compared to the linked quarter, net interest income for the third quarter 2024 increased\nprimarily due to higher interest-earning asset balances and an additional day in the quarter. NIM was 4.17%\nfor the third quarter 2024, compared to 4.19% and 4.33% for the linked and prior year quarters,\nrespectively. The total cost of deposits of 2.18% for the third quarter 2024 increased 2 basis points and 34\nbasis points from the linked and prior year quarters, respectively.\n• Noninterest income - Noninterest income of $21.4 million for the third quarter 2024 increased $5.9 million\nand $9.3 million from the linked and prior year quarters, respectively. The increase from the linked and\nprior year quarters was primarily due to an increase in tax credit income, a net gain on the sale of other real\nestate owned and an increase in income on community development investments.\n• Noninterest expense - Noninterest expense of $98.0 million for the third quarter 2024 increased\n$4.0 million and $9.4 million from the linked and prior year quarters, respectively. The increase from the\nlinked and prior year quarters was primarily driven by higher employee compensation and variable deposit\nservicing costs. The Company continues to have success in recruiting new relationship managers and in\ndeposit generation from existing relationships, both of which have contributed to an increase in average\ndeposit balances. The increase from the prior year quarter was also affected by expenses related to the core\nsystem conversion.\n• Loans - Loans totaled $11.1 billion at September 30, 2024, an increase of $79.9 million from the linked\nquarter and an increase of $463.1 million from the prior year quarter. Average loans totaled $11.0 billion for\nboth the current and linked quarter and $10.5 billion in the prior year quarter.\n• Asset quality - The allowance for credit losses to total loans was 1.26% at September 30, 2024, compared\nto 1.27% at June 30, 2024 and 1.34% at September 30, 2023. The ratio of nonperforming assets to total\nassets was 0.22% at September 30, 2024, compared to 0.33% and 0.40% at June 30, 2024 and\nSeptember 30, 2023, respectively. The provision for credit losses recorded in the third quarter 2024 was\n$4.1 million, compared to $4.8 million and $8.0 million for the linked and prior year quarters, respectively.\n• Deposits - Deposits totaled $12.5 billion at September 30, 2024, an increase of $182.9 million from the\nlinked quarter. Excluding brokered certificates of deposits, deposits increased $196.9 million. Average\ndeposits were $12.5 billion, $12.3 billion and $11.9 billion for the current, linked and prior year quarters,\nrespectively. At September 30, 2024, noninterest-bearing deposit accounts totaled $3.9 billion, or 31.6% of\ntotal deposits, and the loan to deposit ratio was 88.9%.\n• Liquidity - The total available on- and off-balance-sheet liquidity was approximately $5.8 billion at\nSeptember 30, 2024. On-balance-sheet liquidity consisted of cash of $426.4 million and $1.4 billion in\nunpledged investment securities at September 30, 2024. Off-balance-sheet liquidity consisted of $1.2 billion\navailable through the Federal Home Loan Bank, $2.6 billion available through the Federal Reserve and\n$140.0 million through correspondent bank lines. The Company also has an unused $25.0 million revolving\nline of credit and maintains a shelf registration allowing for the issuance of various forms of equity and debt\nsecurities.\n2\n• Capital - Total shareholders’ equity was $1.8 billion and the tangible common equity to tangible assets\nratio2 was 9.50% at September 30, 2024, compared to 9.18% at June 30, 2024.

Net interest income on a tax equivalent basis was $145.6 million,\n$142.6 million and $143.7 million for the current, linked and prior year quarters, respectively. The increase from the\nlinked and prior quarters reflects the benefit of higher yields combined with organic growth.

Interest income increased primarily due to\nan increase in average balances compared to the linked quarter. Continued success in deposit generation has\nincreased liquidity, which has been primarily deployed into the securities portfolio.\nThe average interest rate of new loan originations in the third quarter 2024 was 7.84%, a decrease of 23 basis points\nfrom the linked quarter. Investment purchases in the third quarter 2024 had a weighted average, tax equivalent yield\nof 4.97%.\nInterest expense increased $1.7 million in the third quarter 2024 primarily due to an increase in deposit interest\nexpense, partially offset by a decline in interest expense on borrowings.

Deposit costs relate\nto certain specialized deposit businesses that receive an earnings credit allowance for deposit related expenses that\nare impacted by interest rates and average balances. Deposit costs increased $2.1 million from the linked quarter\nprimarily due to an increase of $151.6 million in average deposit vertical balances from the linked quarter.

However, the Company provides\nadditional financial measures, such as tangible common equity, PPNR, ROATCE, core efficiency ratio, the tangible\ncommon equity to tangible assets ratio, tangible book value per common share, estimated insured deposits and\nadjusted diluted earnings per share, in this release that are considered “non-GAAP financial measures.” Generally, a\nnon-GAAP financial measure is a numerical measure of a company’s financial performance, financial position, or\ncash flows that exclude (or include) amounts that are included in (or excluded from) the most directly comparable\nmeasure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP.\nThe Company considers its tangible common equity, PPNR, ROATCE, core efficiency ratio, the tangible common\nequity to tangible assets ratio, tangible book value per common share, estimated insured deposits and adjusted\ndiluted earnings per share, collectively “core performance measures,” presented in this earnings release and the\nincluded tables as important measures of financial performance, even though they are non-GAAP measures, as they\nprovide supplemental information by which to evaluate the impact of certain non-comparable items, and the\n5 Core efficiency ratio is a non-GAAP measure. Refer to discussion and reconciliation of this measure in the accompanying financial tables.\n9\nCompany’s operating performance on an ongoing basis. Core performance measures exclude certain other income\nand expense items, such as the FDIC special assessment, core conversion expenses, merger-related expenses,\nfacilities charges, and the gain or loss on the sale of other real estate owned and investment securities, that the\nCompany believes to be not indicative of or useful to measure the Company’s operating performance on an ongoing\nbasis. The attached tables contain a reconciliation of these core performance measures to the GAAP measures. The\nCompany believes that the tangible common equity to tangible assets ratio provides useful information to investors\nabout the Company’s capital strength even though it is considered to be a non-GAAP financial measure and is not\npart of the regulatory capital requirements to which the Company is subject.\nThe Company believes these non-GAAP measures and ratios, when taken together with the corresponding GAAP\nmeasures and ratios, provide meaningful supplemental information regarding the Company’s performance and\ncapital strength. The Company’s management uses, and believes that investors benefit from referring to, these non-\nGAAP measures and ratios in assessing the Company’s operating results and related trends and when forecasting\nfuture periods.

Such forward-looking statements may include projections based on management’s current\nexpectations and beliefs concerning future developments and their potential effects on the Company including, without limitation, plans, strategies and\ngoals, and statements about the Company’s expectations regarding revenue and asset growth, financial performance and profitability, loan and deposit\ngrowth, liquidity, yields and returns, loan diversification and credit management, shareholder value creation and the impact of acquisitions.\nForward-looking statements are typically identified by words such as “believe,” “expect,” “anticipate,” “intend,” “outlook,” “estimate,” “forecast,” “project,”\n“pro forma,” “pipeline” and other similar words and expressions. Forward-looking statements are subject to numerous assumptions, risks and uncertainties,\nwhich change over time. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made. Because forward-looking statements are subject to\nassumptions and uncertainties, actual results or future events could differ, possibly materially, from those anticipated in the forward-looking statements and\nfuture results could differ materially from historical performance. They are neither statements of historical fact nor guarantees or assurances of future\nperformance.

However, the Company provides other financial measures, such as tangible common equity,\nPPNR, ROATCE, ROAA, PPNR return on average assets (“PPNR ROAA”), allowance for coverage ratio adjusted for guaranteed loans, the\ntangible common equity ratio, and tangible book value per common share, in this release that are considered “non-GAAP financial\nmeasures.” Generally, a non-GAAP financial measure is a numerical measure of a company’s financial performance, financial position, or cash\nflows that exclude (or include) amounts that are included in (or excluded from) the most directly comparable measure calculated and\npresented in accordance with GAAP.\nThe Company considers its tangible common equity, PPNR, ROATCE, ROAA, PPNR ROAA, allowance for coverage ratio adjusted for\nguaranteed loans, the tangible common equity ratio, and tangible book value per common share, collectively “core performance measures,”\npresented in this earnings release and the included tables as important measures of financial performance, even though they are non-GAAP\nmeasures, as they provide supplemental information by which to evaluate the impact of certain non-comparable items, and the Company’s\noperating performance on an ongoing basis. Core performance measures exclude certain other income and expense items, such as the FDIC\nspecial assessment, merger-related expenses, facilities charges, and the gain or loss on sale of investment securities, that the Company\nbelieves to be not indicative of or useful to measure the Company’s operating performance on an ongoing basis. The attached tables contain\na reconciliation of these core performance measures to the GAAP measures. The Company believes that the tangible common equity ratio\nprovides useful information to investors about the Company’s capital strength even though it is considered to be a non-GAAP financial\nmeasure and is not part of the regulatory capital requirements to which the Company is subject.\nThe Company believes these non-GAAP measures and ratios, when taken together with the corresponding GAAP measures and ratios,\nprovide meaningful supplemental information regarding the Company’s performance and capital strength. The Company’s management\nuses, and believes that investors benefit from referring to, these non-GAAP measures and ratios in assessing the Company’s operating results\nand related trends and when forecasting future periods. However, these non-GAAP measures and ratios should be considered in addition to,\nand not as a substitute for or preferable to, ratios prepared in accordance with GAAP. In the attached tables, the Company has provided a\nreconciliation of, where applicable, the most comparable GAAP financial measures and ratios to the non-GAAP financial measures and ratios,\nor a reconciliation of the non-GAAP calculation of the financial measures for the periods indicated.\n25\nReconciliation of Non-GAAP\nFinancial Measures\nQuarter ended\nSeptember 30, June 30, March 31,

[Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the call over to Jim Lally, President and\nCEO. You may begin.\nJames Brian Lally\nPresident, CEO & Director\nWell, thank you, Jeremy, and thank you all very much for joining us this morning, and welcome to our\n2024, 3rd quarter earnings call. Joining me this morning is Keene Turner, EFSC's Chief Financial Officer\nand Chief Operating Officer; Scott Goodman, President of Enterprise Bank & Trust; and Doug Bauche,\nChief Credit Officer of Enterprise Bank & Trust.\nBefore we begin, I would like to remind everybody on the call that a copy of the release and the\naccompanying presentation can be found on our website. The presentation and earnings release were\nfurnished on SEC Form 8-K yesterday. Please refer to Slide 2 of the presentation titled Forward-Looking\nStatements and our most recent 10-K and 10-Q for reasons why actual results may vary from any\nforward-looking statements that we make today.\nOur strong financial performance continued in the third quarter. Our diversified business model delivered\nEPS of $1.32, which compares favorably to the $1.19 in the linked quarter and $1.17 in the third quarter\nof 2023. As important, we experienced a stable net interest margin continued expansion of net interest\nincome and a 25% annualized increase to our tangible book value per share from the linked quarter.\nNeedless to say, I'm very pleased with these results and they set us up well to finish this year very strong\nand enter 2025 with a great deal of momentum. Like we've stated during previous earnings calls and\ninvestor meetings over the last several years, we've worked diligently to diversify our business model\nsuch that we do not have to depend on any one business, market or asset class to produce high-quality\nearnings. Our third quarter financial performance is a result of this strategy, and we will continue to refine\nand improve on the strategy for quarters and years to come.\nOur financial scorecard begins on Slide 3. For the quarter, we earned net income of $50.6 million or $1.32\nper diluted share, and we produced an adjusted return on assets of 1.32% and a pre-provision return\non assets of 1.74%. This was an improvement over a very strong result for the first 2 quarters. Our net\ninterest income increased $2.9 million to $143.5 million.\nLooking back over the last 2 years, we've been able to hold this number at or around $140 million despite\nchallenging competitive and interest rate conditions. This reflects the strength of the franchise that we've\nbuilt, and we remain in a position to produce high-quality earnings to consistently improve shareholder\nvalue through deep rooted client relationships. Our stable net interest income was aided by the defense of\nour net interest margin at 4.17%. This is a direct result of our appropriately priced, stable deposit base and\nour ability to originate commensurate to the needs of our clients but priced well amid the current interest\nrate environment.\nKeene will provide much more detail on these results in his comments, along with our strategy as to how\nwe plan to defend this amid a declining interest rate environment that we expect to continue over the\nnext several quarters. Last quarter, I discussed the wait-and-see mindset of most of our client base with\nrespect to significant financial moves. This continues to have an impact on our loan growth.\nFor the quarter, we saw loans grow by $80 million or 3% on an annualized basis. This includes a $46\nmillion decline in our Agricultural portfolio, which will continue to widen down. Based on the conversations\nthat we are having with our clients, what I believe is a bit of pent-up demand, I'm confident that we will\nget back to our mid-single-digit growth in the quarters ahead. In the meantime, we'll maintain our credit\nand pricing discipline while we continue to sell with our value-added approach.\nCopyright © 2024 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.\nspglobal.com/marketintelligence 3\nENTERPRISE FINANCIAL SERVICES CORP FQ3 2024 EARNINGS CALL OCT 22, 2024\nDeposit growth continues to be a bright spot for our company. For the second quarter in a row, we're able\nto grow customer deposits close to $200 million. In fact, we've expanded customer deposit balances in 4\nof the last 5 quarters. In addition to our continued strong performance in our national deposit verticals,\nwe experienced solid growth in our geographic markets, too. The cost and composition of the deposit base\nremains stable and has significantly aided in the continued growth in our earnings and profitability.\nThe quarterly cost of deposits was 2.18%, and our level of DDA to total deposits remained right at 32%, a\nlevel we've maintained for the last 5 quarters. Last quarter, I spoke to my confidence in our ability to grow\nour balance sheet at the mid- to high single-digit pace with a caveat that loan growth would likely follow --\nthe block we follow in the mid- to late fourth quarter and maybe even into 2025. 90 days later, I am still\nconfident in this growth rate Loan pipelines are building, and they should only continue to grow with the\nadditions of new RMs and teams.\nYou will hear much more about where we are seeing opportunities in Scott's comments. Another strength\nof our company is our well-positioned balance sheet, which provides for great flexibility with respect to\ncapital planning, capital levels at quarter end remained stable and strong, with our tangible common\nequity to tangible assets ratio of 9.5%, as impressive was our 14.16% adjusted return on tangible\ncommon equity, while growing our ratio of tangible common equity to total assets by close to 1% over the\nlast year.\nTangible book value per common share was $37.26, a 25% annualized increase for the quarter. Given\nthe strength of our earnings and our confidence in our continued execution, we increased the dividend by\n$0.01 per share in the fourth quarter of 2024 to $0.28 per share and will return an additional $9.7 million\nto shareholders during the quarter through common stock repurchases.\nI would characterize the credit quality of our portfolio is strong and stable. Nonperforming assets\ndecreased $15.2 million when compared to the linked quarter. This sizable decrease was primarily\nattributable to the sale of our largest piece of OREO in which we recorded a gain in excess of $3 million.\nAs you can see from the data presented, our ratios of NPLs on total loans and NPAs and total assets are at\nthe lowest levels in the last year.\nWe've been able to achieve this while maintaining strong allowance for credit losses of 1.26% of total\nloans. Slide 5 shows where we are focusing for the foreseeable future. Our focus remains on taking care of\nthe great clients we've accumulated over our 36-year history, while adding those family-owned businesses\nthat cherish high-touch consultative relationships. Doing this day in and day out, will lead to several more\nquarters of really strong performance and the continued building of franchise value. We will not alter our\ncredit discipline to chase growth and we'll be cognizant of current market pricing trends to make sure we\ncontinue to protect and grow our client base.\n2 weeks ago, we executed on our core conversion, careful planning and execution of this plan by our\nteam facilitated a smooth transition to our new system. While the core project was a singularly long\nand extensive project for us, our culture is one of continuous improvement and process innovation. And\nwhile we are pleased to have completed this milestone, we will jump back into an array of projects and\nopportunities that improve the client experience and make us more efficient.\nThe fruits of our recruiting efforts, especially in our higher growth markets and higher profit specialized\nbusinesses are beginning to pay off. We continue to onboard several new RMs and full teams in our\nWestern markets and we'll continue to capitalize on disruption caused by M&A in all of our markets.\nSimilarly, we are being very strategic with our adds to our specialized lending teams and our national\ndeposit verticals, focusing on those areas that provide the greatest shareholder value combined with\nthe businesses that have been the most disrupted due to M&A or banks have decided to disinvest or\ndisregarding the business in total.\nWe will aggressively pursue more of these opportunities through the end of 2024 and into 2025. Before\nhanding the call to Scott, I would like to provide a little perspective on how our clients are performing and\nto provide a view of the overall economy from their vantage point. For the most part, our clients continue\nto do well, from large general and subcontractors to mid-market manufacturers and distributors, 2024\nwill be another solid year for most. What has changed in the last 90 days is that we are having many\nCopyright © 2024 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.\nspglobal.com/marketintelligence 4\nENTERPRISE FINANCIAL SERVICES CORP FQ3 2024 EARNINGS CALL OCT 22, 2024\nmore strategic conversations about expansion succession and acquisitions than we had in the previous\n2 quarters. This informs us the opportunity to exist and that these 2 companies will flex their approach\nto these opportunities once they understand whether or not the upcoming elections have any impact on\nthem.\nLast quarter, I mentioned that our CRE clients were anxious to get new projects underway and take a\nlonger viewpoint, now that the near-term rates have begun to decline. This has manifested itself for\nseveral new wins throughout our footprint and most asset classes besides office CRE. Overall, I like the\ntempo that we are seeing in our business and feel good about our team's ability to consistently produce\nquality opportunities that will ultimately lead to consistent sound balance sheet growth.\nWe enjoy great reputation and corresponding market share of middle market businesses in our mature\ngeographies and specialized lending businesses. As such, I am confident that we will continue to get\nmore than our fair share of corresponding opportunities. Our newer markets and higher-growth areas will\nprovide similar levels of opportunities while we continue to build our reputation in these markets. This\nblend is what gives me high confidence that we will continue to grow and earn at a predictable rate while\ncontinuing to compound tangible book value at a higher level than our peers over the foreseeable future.\nWith that, I would like to turn the call over to Scott Goodman. Scott?\nScott R. Goodman\nPresident\nThank you, Jim, and good morning, everyone. Starting with loans. As you heard, we posted net growth\nof $80 million in Q3. This growth, which is outlined on Slide 6 and 7 was relatively well balanced Between\nC&I and Commercial Real Estate, which are our major metro markets this quarter.\nAt a high level, gross new loan production continued at a healthy pace, but net growth was muted\nsomewhat by the planned runoff of our Ag portfolio and several expected larger paydowns this quarter\nassociated with opportunities to exit marginal credits. As Jim outlined, new C&I lending opportunities\ncentered heavily around businesses, transitioning ownership or investing for growth through acquisition\nand expansion, while balances on revolving lines of credit were relatively flat from the prior quarter.\nWith interest rates moving down, we're also seeing the resurgence of some commercial real estate\nprojects that were previously in a holding pattern, particularly within our higher-growth Western markets.\nTurning to the specialty lending verticals. Life insurance premium finance had a strong quarter, growing\n$34 million. In addition to scheduled premium fundings on the existing book, we also originated several\nlarge new loans from our established base of referral partners.\nDespite elevated competitive pressures from the larger regional banks, typically competing on price in this\nspace, our model of consistent execution and speed of delivery, which we've built over several decades,\ncontinues to deliver a steady pipeline of new opportunities and consistent growth. The Sponsored Finance\nportfolio declined by $47 million in the quarter. As I've mentioned in prior quarters this year, growth in\nthis space has been dampened by a number of competitive and environmental factors, namely, radically\nSponsors have accelerated the sale of portfolio of companies in 2024, following the previous year of 2023,\nin which we saw almost no churn in the existing book.\nAdditionally, elevated short-term rates, which are predominantly used in this space, squeezed the price\ndifferentiation between the subordinated and senior lenders, leading to higher usage of unitranche and\nother mezzanine sources in the capital stack. These factors also created more competition among senior\nlenders and in some cases, have led to credit structures and pricing that are beyond our risk tolerance.\nOver time, this specialty has and will provide growth consistent with our global targets. However, given\nour nearly 20 years of experience in this space, we understand this can be a cyclical business and we're\nprepared to exercise appropriate discipline to protect the credit quality of our book, and again, maintain\nthe consistency that is valued by our Sponsor partners.\nThe Tax Credit portfolio was down modestly due to scheduled paydowns on project loans as expected in a\nseasonally soft quarter, but is positioned to show some growth as it is traditional heading into Q4.

Midwestern markets were most heavily impacted by the aforementioned\nplanned reduction on our ag portfolio and the other anticipated paydowns. Aside from these factors,\nproduction was solid with originations trending up from the prior quarters of this year.\nHighlights for Q3 include the acquisition financing for construction materials client and refinancing of a\nseasoned CRE project coming out of the secondary marketing structure in Kansas City, as well as an ESAP\nconversion for a long time C&I specialty manufacturing client in St. Louis.\nGrowth in our Southwestern market continues at a solid pace, with loans up $31 million or 7.5%\nannualized in Q3 and posting growth of 14.8% on a year-over-year basis. Generally speaking, this region\ncontinues to benefit from the higher level of economic growth within the Phoenix, Dallas and Las Vegas\nMetro markets. Growth also includes a continuing sale of construction fundings on commercial real estate\nprojects, which we've been originating over the past 12 to 18 months. In addition, we originated new\nloans for established Phoenix clients in the car Watch, multifamily and health care businesses this quarter.\nOur Western region of Southern California posted solid growth of $96 million in Q3 and is up $185 million\nor 10.5% year-over-year. Growth in this market has steadily increased as we are now seeing traction\nboth from larger legacy acquired clients as well as relationships originated by the new talent that Jim\nmentioned that has been added over the prior 2 years.\nGrowth in Commercial Real Estate this quarter is coming from fundings on commercial construction loans\noriginated in prior quarters, as well as additional capacity for new real estate opportunities such as loans\nto seasoned operators with multifamily, senior living and industrial storage. Alternatively, newer talent\nis predominantly C&I focused, onboarding new relationships during Q3 in the private lending, aerospace\nmanufacturing and commercial electric spaces.\nDeposits are profiled on Slide 9, which shows growth of $183 million or 6% annualized for the quarter.\nFocusing on core growth, exclusive of brokered funds customer deposits are up $770 million or 6.9%\nyear-over-year. Balances were stable in the lower cost, noninterest DDA and savings account types, while\ngrowth was most prominent in interest-bearing DDA and money market accounts. This growth has not\ncome at the expense of an inflated rate or hot money strategy, but rather from continued efforts to add\nnew clients and a value-added sales process to expand our existing account relationships.\nYou'll hear more from Keene in his comments on our progress and continuing efforts to control deposit\ncosts. Another highlight this quarter is the performance of our geographic regions which contributed\nnearly 70% of the growth this period. This is broken now on Slide 10. The Midwestern markets increased\ndeposit balances $94 million in Q3 and have now grown deposits 2% year-over-year. In addition to several\nsignificant new commercial deposit relationships, we are having focused and intentional discussions\nwith our top clients to aggregate their excess funds with our bank and educate them on the overall rate\nenvironment to protect our existing balances as rates fall.\nBalances also grew in our Western region of Southern California, increasing $42 million or 14%\nannualized. Generally, growth came from the onboarding of new commercial and private banking\nrelationships as well as the stabilization of existing accounts that had run down early in the year, from\nclients deploying excess cash for working capital. The deposit verticals contributed $60 million of growth\nfor the quarter, primarily due to increased balances within the Property Management segment.\nThese verticals are further broken out on Slide 11, which shows an overall portfolio that is well balanced\nbetween the 3 major lines of business. Growth in Q3, all the strong performance trend within the Property\nManagement segment as we attract new accounts to our existing management company relationships. We\ncontinue to also benefit from traction relating to the Florida branch, which was opened in 2023, allowing\nus now to bring on new accounts, both from existing and new clients operating in that state.\nLastly, I'll comment on the funding mix, which is profiled on Slide 12. And highlights both the\ndiversification and steady DDA component of our major client channels, representing 32% of the total.\nGrowth for the year has been weighted in lower cost account types. And we see -- we continue to see\na slowdown in the shifting of balances to higher-yielding products. I am encouraged by the proactive\nCopyright © 2024 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc.

Keene?\nKeene S. Turner\nSenior EVP & CFO\nThanks, Scott, and good morning, everyone. Turning to Slide 13. We reported earnings per share of\n$1.32 in the third quarter on net income of $51 million. Reported earnings included the impact of core\nconversion-related expenses of $1.4 million as well as a $3 million gain on the sale of OREO property.\nExcluding these items, adjusted earnings per share was $1.29 per share, an $0.08 increase from the\nsecond quarter. Operating revenue contributed a meaningful increase to EPS in the quarter, driven\nfrom our continued success in deposit generation an expanded net interest income and an increase in\nnoninterest income. Similar to last quarter, our strong client deposit growth allowed us to modestly\ndecrease usage of wholesale borrowings and to invest excess liquidity in the securities portfolio.\nThe provision for credit losses decreased from the prior quarter as total loans have remained relatively\nstable and nonperforming loan balances have declined. Noninterest expense increased in the quarter due\nto higher compensation expense and an increase in variable deposit servicing costs.\nDuring the third quarter, we had more working days. We were active in recruiting relationship managers\nand we expanded average balances within the national deposit variables.\nTurning to Slide 14. Net interest income was $143.5 million in the third quarter, an increase of $3 million\ncompared to the linked quarter. Interest income increased $4.7 million during the quarter as a result of\ngrowth in average earning assets and improvement in asset yields. Loan income grew $2.3 million from\nthe linked period mainly due to higher average balances and an additional day of earnings. This was\ninclusive of approximately $0.5 million of an unfavorable change in amortization of purchase accounting\nmarks.\nThe average interest rate on loans originated in the third quarter was 7.84% and continues to add to the\noverall loan yield of 6.95% for the quarter. Earnings on securities grew $1.4 million from the linked period\non higher average balances and improved yields. We continue to invest additional funds during the third\nquarter while the portfolio yield also continued to benefit from higher rates on cash flow reinvestment.\nThe average tax equivalent yield on purchases in the quarter was 4.97%. The increase in average cash\nbalances generated an additional $1 million in interest during the period.\nMore details follow on Slide 15. Interest expense grew only $1.7 million in the quarter, primarily as a\nresult of higher average deposit balances. Deposit expense increased $2.4 million, led by higher average\nbalances and a slight uptick in rate on interest-bearing checking and money market accounts. The overall\ncost of interest-bearing deposits was up 3 basis points from the linked period, while the total cost of\ndeposits has increased by 2 basis points.\nInterest and other borrowed funds decreased nearly $1 million in the quarter as a result of lower balances\nin both customer repo and short-term FHLB debt. The resulting net interest margin for the quarter was\n4.17%, a decrease of only 2 basis points from the linked quarter. Earning asset yields declined by 2 basis\npoints, mainly due to the change in the earning asset mix from higher cash and investment balances.\nA 2 basis point improvement in loan yield was offset by the negative change in purchase accounting. Our\ncost of liabilities increased by 2 basis points compared to the linked period as deposit growth was more\nconcentrated in higher cost interest-bearing checking and money market accounts. As note, if we isolate\npurchase accounting impact, NIM was stable quarter-over-quarter. The Federal Reserve reduced the Fed\nfunds rate by 50 basis points in September, beginning what is expected to be a series of interest rate cuts.\nWhile we observed minimal impact in the third quarter results, we do expect to see modest net interest\nmargin compression moving forward. It's also worth noting that we have some hedges and other\nstructural factors in place that will further delay or mitigate the perceived sensitivity at a 61% variable\nCopyright © 2024 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.\nspglobal.com/marketintelligence 7\nENTERPRISE FINANCIAL SERVICES CORP FQ3 2024 EARNINGS CALL OCT 22, 2024\nrate loan portfolio. At a high level, we have hedged a part of the portfolio, we have embedded loan floors\nand a portion of the variable rate portfolio has longer-term reset dates. Adjusting for those items in our\ninvestment portfolio, we have approximately $5.4 billion of interest-earning assets compared to $8.8\nbillion of interest-bearing liabilities that have the ability to be repriced in under 1 year.\nAs we discussed on our last call, each quarter point reduction in the Fed funds were exposed or 5 to 10\nbasis points of net interest margin loss or $2 million to $3 million of quarterly net interest income on the\nexisting balance sheet. However, with the initial 50 basis point move already made, we have worked hard\nto manage to a better impact in the upcoming quarter. As the market adjusts to lower interest rates, we\nexpect funding costs to be more responsive to additional Fed booms.\nThe declining Fed funds rate will also lead to reductions in deposit-related noninterest expenses.\nApproximately half of the underlying balances are indexed to the Fed funds rate and each 25 basis points\nof Fed funds equates to approximately $1 million of quarterly expense, albeit with a brief 1-month lag.\nSo net, we expect pretax income to decline less than $1 million to $2 million for every 25 basis points of\nsubsequent Fed fund changes on a quarterly basis. At that level, we estimate that our planned balance\nsheet growth will replace lost earnings from interest rate reductions.\nWith that in mind, as we look over the course of 2025 and plan for additional multiple Fed cuts within\nthe next 4 quarters, we see net interest margin initially still above 4% and then drifting into the high 3%\nrange thereafter. We also expect that in that time frame to improve the quarterly run rate of deposit costs\nby more than $5 million to $7 million before any additional growth in balances.\nWith that, we'll move on to Slide 16, which reflects our credit trends. Credit trends remain well managed\nand indicate the strength of our diversified loan portfolio. Net charge-offs were $3.9 million or 14 basis\npoints of average loans for the quarter, a level that's below our longer-term average. Nonperforming\nassets improved to 22 basis points of total assets compared to 33 basis points at the end of June. The\nimproved asset quality trends, along with net charge-offs and improvement in the economic outlook,\nresulted in a provision for credit losses of $4.1 million, a decline of $1 million from the prior quarter.\nSlide 17 presents the allowance for credit losses. The allowance for credit losses represented 1.26% of\nloans or 1.38% when adjusting for government guaranteed SBA loans. We continue to use a weighted\neconomic forecast that leans more towards a downside scenario, and we believe that's appropriate in this\nenvironment.\nOn Slide 18, third quarter fee income of $21 million was an increase of $6 million from the second quarter,\ndriven primarily by tax credit income, which was higher from a decline in 10-year SOFR's impact on\ncredits carried at fair value, at $3.2 million gain on the sale of other real estate and higher community\ndevelopment income.\nTurning to Slide 19, noninterest expense of $98 million was an increase of $4 million from the second\nquarter driven primarily from compensation and benefits and deposit servicing expenses. Additionally,\nincluded in the current quarter was $1.4 million of core conversion-related expenses compared to $1.3\nmillion in the second quarter. Deposit servicing expenses were $2.1 million higher compared to the linked\nquarter due to $152 million of growth in average balances on the deposit verticals, while the related\nearnings credit percentage was largely unchanged until the September Fed funds interest rate reduction.\nCompensation and benefits was $0.8 million higher due to an increase in the number of working days\nin the quarter and further investment in the associate base. The third quarter's core efficiency ratio was\nrelatively stable at 58.4% compared to 58.1% for the linked quarter. Our capital metrics are shown on\nSlide 20. We continue to manage our excess capital and repurchase 195,000 shares at an average price of\n$49.73 or approximately $10 million in total. We have approximately 1.5 million shares remaining under\nour existing plan, and we'll continue to monitor our level and manage some of our excess position.\nAnd by that, I mean the amount that's greater than 9% TCE through share repurchases. In summary, this\nwas another strong quarter for the company. Client deposit generation was robust as planned, and we\nhave taken appropriate steps to partially mitigate the impact of declining rates on our earnings, while\nexpenses and credit remain well managed. We have consistently posted strong profitability, and this\nquarter was no exception. We had an adjusted return on average tangible common equity of over 14%, at\nCopyright © 2024 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.\nspglobal.com/marketintelligence 8\nENTERPRISE FINANCIAL SERVICES CORP FQ3 2024 EARNINGS CALL OCT 22, 2024\n1.3% adjusted return on average assets, and our pre-provision earnings increased to over $65 million in\nthe quarter or 1.7% of average assets. I think it's also worth noting that the level of pre-provision net\nrevenue is consistent with the prior year quarter. Thanks for your attention today. And with that, we'll\nopen the line for analyst questions.\nCopyright © 2024 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.\nspglobal.com/marketintelligence 9\nENTERPRISE FINANCIAL SERVICES CORP FQ3 2024 EARNINGS CALL OCT 22, 2024\nQuestion and Answer\n....................................................................................................................................................................\nOperator\n[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Jeff Rulis from D.A. Davidson.\nUnknown Analyst\nThis is actually Ryan Pan on for Jeff today. Going over to the net charge-offs at 14 basis points of average\nloans. What was the makeup of those charge-offs?\nScott R. Goodman\nPresident\nYes, Ryan. good morning. The charge-offs in the quarter were largely concentrated in one multifamily\nacquired loan in Southern California. You might recall the relationship in the fourth quarter of 2023, we\nhad some unsecured exposure to a developer. This was the residual commercial real estate secured debt.\nExposure of about $17 million that we charged down to $3 million and have a receiver in place and are\nworking through the process right now to control and monetize the asset and dispose of them.\nUnknown Analyst\nOkay. Got it. On the expense side, so will we see additional expenses from conversion? And what would\nthat 2025 outlook on run rate or year-to-year growth look like there?\nKeene S. Turner\nSenior EVP & CFO\nYes. So we're at $1.3 million of core-related expenses in the quarter, roughly $1.5 million, and there's\nanother $1.5 million coming in the fourth quarter. But sequentially, given the expected reduction in deposit\nservice charges, we expect noninterest expense to be leveled. And then I think depending on what you're\nthinking in terms of future cuts, every 25 basis points is going to be a $1 million improvement in the\ndeposit service charge line item. So we actually think that, that will either keep expenses flat-ish next year\ndepending on how many reductions you get or could actually lead to some lower expenses overall. And\nthen I think absent -- we'll get compensation changes and some quarterly items in the first quarter that\nwill be a little bit seasonal heavy. But otherwise, I think generally, we expect the rest of the expenses to\nnot move around a whole lot and be pretty well controlled.\nUnknown Analyst\nGot it. And lastly, so how is that loan pipeline building quarter-to-quarter? And then what does that\nmomentum look like going into 2025?\nScott R. Goodman\nPresident\nYes, Ryan, this is Scott. I can answer that. As I said in my comments, I feel very good about the\nproduction levels of new commitments. Those are solid. I think they're in line with what we would\ntraditionally expect and that would traditionally result in targeted net growth, net of the offsetting factors\nthat I mentioned, right? So the ag portfolio certainly is an offsetting factor. I think we're still not seeing\nbusinesses use revolving lines of credit at historical rates, which we would expect to maybe change as\nrates come down. CRE development has been slow, and I mentioned the issues in sponsor finance. So I\nthink as all of that cycles back around the norms, we're currently producing at levels that would result in\nour targeted net growth expectation.\nJames Brian Lally\nPresident, CEO & Director\nCopyright © 2024 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.\nspglobal.com/marketintelligence 10\nENTERPRISE FINANCIAL SERVICES CORP FQ3 2024 EARNINGS CALL OCT 22, 2024\nI would just add, Ryan, too, that the composition of that is very evenly spread throughout the company.\nThat's intentional that we're not leading in any one market or asset class like I mentioned, this is a plan\nthat in terms of our recruiting and we're focusing that there is a bit of structure relative to that growth.\nOperator\nOur next question comes from the line of Andrew Liesch from Piper Sandler.\nAndrew Brian Liesch\nPiper Sandler & Co., Research Division\nSorry if I missed this earlier, did you say the balance of agricultural loans that are still left in the portfolio?\nJames Brian Lally\nPresident, CEO & Director\nWe've reduced it by about $50 million this quarter down to about $140 million in total.\nAndrew Brian Liesch\nPiper Sandler & Co., Research Division\nOkay. Very helpful. It sounds like you've been active hiring some C&I commercial business lending teams.\nI'm just curious what -- are there any regions that you're focusing more on? Are these concentrated in one\narea? Or is it across the franchise?\nScott R. Goodman\nPresident\nAndrew, it's Scott. Predominantly in our Western markets. We added, I believe, 14 client-facing\nassociates this quarter. Some of those did fill open positions. But I would say majority were opportunistic\ninvestments. California predominantly, a couple in Arizona, a couple maybe in the specialties. But I think\nwe just see talent is in play, particularly when banks are going through M&A or senior management\nturnover, or in some cases, stressed banks, predominantly out West that are still dealing with liquidity or\nconcentration issues. And it's just putting talent in play. So positions like Commercial RMs, some private\nbankers, our treasury management salespeople that support our C&I strategy and some business banking,\nwe've been able to add in all those areas, both from a team perspective as well as individual bankers.\nSo I think for bankers coming out of those organizations, our model really resonated out West. And I think\nthe window is open now, but it will be closed eventually. So I think we're being opportunistic.\nAndrew Brian Liesch\nPiper Sandler & Co., Research Division\nGot it. That's very helpful. Good to hear Jim, you mentioned your commentary early in the call on some\nclients looking to expand their businesses as they look into '25. Was that also a comment on credit quality\nif businesses and your clients are looking to expand, does that mean you feel pretty good about the credit\noutlook as well?\nJames Brian Lally\nPresident, CEO & Director\nI'm very bullish on our credit outlook as it relates to this client base we're talking about. These are well-\nestablished businesses who are looking at generational opportunities from one generation to the next,\nwhether they use ESOP, whether they sell from one generation to the next, whether they use private\nequity. These conversations are becoming more prevalent day in and day out. In addition to that, Andrew,\nI think we're seeing opportunities also to attract new clients relative to our posture in that regard. We're\nnot changing how we underwrite. I think it's just being out there ahead of the decision to do this as we\ntalk about stay around the room, call the best companies you know, add value along the way because we\nknow that these opportunities eventually come about, and we want to make sure we're there with the best\nCopyright © 2024 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc.

Could you just kind of go back over what\nyou were saying? So your expectation here for the fourth quarter, do you think you could maintain a 4\nhandle on the margin? And then with the expectation that we're going to have a couple of cuts this quarter\nand maybe 25 basis points each quarter going through '25, it will have a drift downward into the -- did\nyou say the high 3.90s for the high 3s?\nKeene S. Turner\nSenior EVP & CFO\nYes, that's accurate. I would say that in the other factor to consider, Damon, in the fourth quarter is\nthat we're going to probably get some year-end seasonal deposit growth. And so there will also be some\nmargin declination due to remixing. So all else equal, margin down 5 to 10 basis points, and then there\nmight be some remixing in there. And then yes, I think we expect to defend call it, into the 3.90s with\nfuture cuts. And what we're looking at here is 5 cuts additionally from today. So I think that generally lines\nup with what you articulated in your question there.\nDamon Paul DelMonte\nKeefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division\nOkay. Great. Appreciate that. And then with regards to the fee income, do you still have kind of a full year\noutlook for the tax credit income to be kind of close to the $9 million to $10 million range?\nKeene S. Turner\nSenior EVP & CFO\nYes. I would say, Damon, at the very end of the quarter at 9/30, I would have said, yes, 1-year SOFR has\nmoved 30 basis points against us. And so that's going to eat into some of the fourth quarter income we're\ngoing to see. I'd say we're in the $3 million range this quarter, and we're probably looking at a similar\nrange for next quarter. So that's -- it's going to be a little bit short, unfortunately, in that line item. But\nI think when rates settle down, I think that 10% is probably still a good number overall moving forward\nbased on activity, but it looks like we're going to be short this year.\nDamon Paul DelMonte\nKeefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division\nOkay. Great. And then I guess, lastly, with regards to kind of how we think about provisioning in the\nreserve level, you had obviously a pretty sizable cleanup there in NPAs and they're down to only 30 basis\npoints of loans in OREO. Do you still feel you're going to kind of maintain the mid-120 reserve level? And\ndo we kind of think about provision as just being more of a function of loan growth?\nKeene S. Turner\nSenior EVP & CFO\nYes. I would say, I think we feel good about credit quality and where it is. And I think we also want to\nbe prudent with the level of reserves that we have. So I don't see us letting reserves move down and\nbenefiting from that through the P&L. And I don't see us backing away from wanting to have a little bit of\nwhat I'll say is some conservatism built into the portfolio. Earnings are good, and we've got the ability to\ncontinue to provide and still drive strong earnings.\nSo some of it is going to depend on just what categories we have to growth in, there's some areas like\nSBA and Life Insurance where that drives a little bit lighter reserve when there's growth there. But\nCopyright © 2024 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.\nspglobal.com/marketintelligence 12\nENTERPRISE FINANCIAL SERVICES CORP FQ3 2024 EARNINGS CALL OCT 22, 2024\notherwise, if you get a current blend of where we are today, I would imagine that on -- with any -- without\nany deterioration, you're going to put $115 million to $120 million on new loans. So that's how I would\nthink about it.\nOperator\nOur next question comes from Brian Martin from Janney.\nBrian Joseph Martin\nJanney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division\nKeene, maybe just on that deposit related expense line item, I guess, just to be clear, the 50 basis point\nreduction we saw in rates last quarter, is that -- so the current run rate on the deposit expenses, is that\ninclusive of that reduction related to that? Or it's not fully in the number right now as you're kind of\nthinking about that line item?\nKeene S. Turner\nSenior EVP & CFO\nYes. The third quarter number, Brian, wouldn't really reflect any reduction in that number. We wouldn't\nhave moved rates on those customers until October. So you'll have that reduction coming. I'll say though\nthat if you look at what happened though, there is going to be some overall average balance growth here\nin the fourth quarter.\nSo what would be a $2 million on a same-store basis, it's probably more like 1.5 million sequentially just\nbecause of the average balance growth. But that, for lack of a better term, ECR rate will be coming down\nparticularly as we've got about half of those accounts in and of themselves index with Fed funds and we\nknow those are going to move down.\nBrian Joseph Martin\nJanney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division\nYes. Got you. And outside of that reduction, Keene, just as far as thinking about the net growth in -- if we\nfactor in the reduction in our rate outlook on the deposit expenses, how much should the deposit expenses\njust organically grow in a year to kind of either offset or mitigate however you want to look at it kind of\nwhat we're going to factor in on the rate reduction side.\nKeene S. Turner\nSenior EVP & CFO\nYes, Brian, it's probably $2 million to $3 million of when we go a year out with some of the growth rate.\nIf we have another year similar to what we've had this year, you'll get the reduction, but you'll have\neffectively a couple of million dollars into that because you'll have new deposits that are earning albeit a\nlower allowance, but still an allowance on those balances. It's a couple of hundred million dollars, $200\nmillion to $300 million of annual production there is what we expect.\nBrian Joseph Martin\nJanney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division\nOkay. And if you said earlier, can you just -- if it all makes sense. I mean $6 million to $7 million reduction\nfrom those because of the rate cuts and then offset by maybe $2 million or $3 million of growth. So\nthe net is -- the difference on those 2 is just big picture, how to think about were those deposit-related\nexpenses shake out?\nKeene S. Turner\nSenior EVP & CFO\nYes. I mean I think all of these, Brian, if you don't -- if there was no balance sheet growth, you'd be down\nsomething like $8 million loss year-over-year. And I think that $6 million to -- $5 million to $7 million or\nmidpoint of $6 million is sort of where we've got some growth in it, but you've got essentially 5 more cuts\nCopyright © 2024 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.\nspglobal.com/marketintelligence 13\nENTERPRISE FINANCIAL SERVICES CORP FQ3 2024 EARNINGS CALL OCT 22, 2024\nis kind of the baseline forecast we're using just to characterize around that number and how we're looking\nat it.\nBrian Joseph Martin\nJanney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division\nGot you. Okay. That's perfect. I appreciate all the color, Keene, that's helpful. And then in terms of just --\nand maybe you said this Keene, and I didn't catch it, but as far as kind of just the dollars of NII and kind\nof the stability you've seen, is your expectation right now? It sounds like maybe you said this, was at 25%\nis above 24% in terms of NII full year?\nKeene S. Turner\nSenior EVP & CFO\nI think that's going to really -- with -- let's say this, if you've got 5 cuts and you have low single-digit loan\ngrowth, you're probably with day count and some of the other factors, you're probably going to have a\nlittle bit of declination, call it, from the current level of net interest income on a quarterly basis. And it's\ngoing to maybe get back to a level by the third quarter of next year.\nYou've got a little bit more robust growth. There's a chance that you'll grow that quarterly run rate\nstarting in second and third quarter of next year. We don't fully outrun it. But when you look at pretax\nincome, depending on what level of growth is there, you might be neutral to pretax income with the 2 rate\nsensitive line items being net interest income and then the deposit noninterest expense.\nBrian Joseph Martin\nJanney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division\nGot you. Okay. That's helpful. And maybe just one for Jim, I guess, for Scott. It sounds like the new hires,\nI guess, that you're bringing on, it sounded as though, Jim, your comments that the customers you have\nare, I guess, more looking optimistic about growth next year, and then given that all the talent you guys\narticulated brought on board, I mean, is your expectation that can contribute to maybe a little bit greater\ngrowth rate than you're thinking, Jim, in terms of what you're seeing from your existing base, which\nalready sounded like it was picking back up.\nJames Brian Lally\nPresident, CEO & Director\nSo I say it's better than our expectation is better than the runway we see today. Scott has talked about\nproduction, is right on plan. It's also what the mitigants to that production. But I do think given the talent\nthat we're bringing on, we should expect that mid-single-digit return for 2025.\nOperator\nAll right. That does conclude all the questions that we have in our queue. So I'll turn the call back over to\nJim Lally and the team.\nJames Brian Lally\nPresident, CEO & Director\nThanks, Jeremy, and thank all of you for joining us this morning. Thank you for your interest in our\ncompany. We look forward to talking to you very soon, if not before the end of the year, we'll talk to you in\nthe first quarter of 2025. Thanks again, and have a great day.\nOperator\nThat does conclude today's call. Have a pleasant day, everybody.\nCopyright © 2024 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc.
