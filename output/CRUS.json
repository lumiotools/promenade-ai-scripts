(NASDAQ: CRUS) today posted on its website at [investor.cirrus.com](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Finvestor.cirrus.com%2Fhome%2Fdefault.aspx&esheet=54146875&newsitemid=20241104344379&lan=en-US&anchor=investor.cirrus.com&index=1&md5=45d605c20e16dac07cb4a42dff8a5a94) the quarterly Shareholder Letter that contains the complete financial results for the second quarter of fiscal year 2025, which ended September 28, 2024, as well as the company’s current business outlook. \n\n“Cirrus Logic reported record revenue and earnings per share for the September quarter. Revenue was near the top end of our guidance range due to strong demand for products shipping into smartphones,” said John Forsyth, Cirrus Logic president and chief executive officer. “In addition to our outstanding financial results, during the quarter, we started shipping our next-generation custom boosted amplifier and first 22-nanometer smart codec in recently launched smartphones. We also made excellent progress in the laptop market as we secured our first high-volume mainstream design win with our latest PC codec and began shipping our first power product in multiple tier-one customers’ devices. With an extensive product portfolio and a compelling roadmap of future products, we believe Cirrus Logic is well-positioned to capitalize on the many opportunities ahead of us to further broaden our technology and market reach.” \n\n**Reported Financial Results – Second Quarter FY25**\n\n  * Revenue of $541.9 million; \n  * GAAP and non-GAAP gross margin of 52.2 percent; \n  * GAAP operating expenses of $150.7 million and non-GAAP operating expenses of $126.8 million; and \n  * GAAP earnings per share of $1.83 and non-GAAP earnings per share of $2.25. \n\n\n\nA reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financial information is included in the tables accompanying this press release. \n\n**Business Outlook – Third Quarter FY25**\n\n  * Revenue is expected to range between $480 million and $540 million; \n  * GAAP gross margin is forecasted to be between 51 percent and 53 percent; and \n  * Combined GAAP R&D and SG&A expenses are anticipated to range between $148 million and $154 million, including approximately $22 million in stock-based compensation expense and $2 million in amortization of acquired intangibles, resulting in a non-GAAP operating expense range between $124 million and $130 million. \n\n\n\nCirrus Logic will host a live Q&A session at 5 p.m. EST today to discuss its financial results and business outlook.

As you've seen in the press release, Cirrus\nLogic delivered record revenue and earnings per share for the September quarter. Revenue was $541.9 million,\nnear to the top end of our guidance range, due to strong demand for products shipping into smartphones. In a\nmoment, I'm going to hand the call over to Ulf to discuss the financial results for the September quarter in greater\ndetail, as well as our outlook for the December quarter. But before we get to that, I'd like to make a few remarks\nregarding our recent progress.\nAs many of you are aware, our long-term strategy for growing the company is based around three broad\nprinciples. First, maintaining leadership in our core flagship smartphone audio business. Second, continuing our\nexpansion in areas of high-performance, mixed-signal functionality in smartphones. And third, leveraging those\naudio and high-performance, mixed signal capabilities to penetrate and grow in new markets.\nIn our flagship smartphone audio business this past quarter, we were particularly excited to begin shipping our\nnext generation custom boosted amplifier and our first 22-nanometer smart codec in recently launched\nsmartphones. The new amplifier provides significant power and efficiency improvements, while the smart codec,\nin addition to being Cirrus Logic's first 22-nanometer product of any kind, delivers meaningful advances in audio\nand mixed signal processing capabilities. Together, these components showcase years of engineering dedication\nand close collaboration with our customer, and they contribute meaningfully to the power efficiency and\nextraordinary audio quality of our customers new products. We anticipate that both components will ship from\nmultiple smartphone generations, and in doing so, provide us with an enduring and substantial revenue stream in\nthe years ahead.\nLooking beyond audio, we are enthusiastic about the potential to grow content in smartphones with our high-\nperformance, mixed-signal solutions. Our progress in this area is evident in the continued success of our camera\ncontroller product line. Since the introduction of our first camera controller in calendar year 2020, our camera\ncontent has continued to increase in value over time. With the recent smartphone launch, we are benefiting from\na more favorable overall mix of smartphones on the market that include our camera controllers. We see\nconsiderable potential to add further value in this area, as we identify more opportunities to enhance system\nperformance and help enable advanced camera features.\nBeyond camera controllers, we also believe that advanced power sensing and battery related technologies\nrepresent excellent opportunities for us, and we continue to invest in a number of R&D programs that are focused\non these areas. We anticipate that the investments that we are making in this space today will contribute to\nproduct diversification and expand our footprint in these product categories in the future.\nThe third element of our strategy is focused on expanding into new applications and markets outside of\nsmartphones. In this area, we continue to be excited about the opportunities we see in our laptop business. While\nwe are still in the early stages of revenue contribution from our recently introduced laptop components, we were\n3\n1-877-FACTSET www.callstreet.com Copyright © 2001-2024 FactSet CallStreet, LLC\nCirrus Logic, Inc.\n(CRUS) Corrected Transcript\nQ2 2025 Earnings Call 04-Nov-2024\npleased with our progress during the September quarter. That progress included securing our first high-volume\nmainstream design win with our latest PC codec, which combines cutting edge hardware with advanced\nalgorithms for superior audio playback. We were also proud to ship our first power product designed specifically\nfor laptops in multiple Tier 1 customers' devices.\nAdditionally, during the quarter, we saw the introduction of a new laptop from a top tier laptop OEM that\nexemplifies the breadth of our content opportunity in this market in that it features eight Cirrus Logic components,\nincluding a codec, multiple audio amplifiers, and multiple power converter chips. We anticipate many more\ncustomer product introductions in the laptop space in the coming months, and are excited about the opportunity\nthis market represents.\nAnd with that, let me now turn the call over to Ulf to provide an overview of our financial results as well as the\noutlook.\n......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nUlf Habermann\nInterim Chief Financial Officer & Chief Accounting Officer, Cirrus Logic, Inc.\nThank you, John; and good afternoon, everyone. I will start with the summary of our financial results for our\nsecond quarter fiscal 2025, and then provide guidance for Q3 FY 2025.\nIn Q2, FY 2025, we delivered record revenue for the September quarter of $541.9 million, near the high-end of\nour guidance range. On a sequential basis, revenue was up 45% due to higher unit volumes associated with new\nsmartphone launches. On a year-over-year basis, sales were up 13%, driven by higher smartphone unit volumes\nand increased revenue associated with next generation products. Also, as we indicated in Q1 FY 2025 in our\nShareholder Letter when comparing our September quarter to the equivalent quarter last year, we would note that\nin FY 2025, our September quarter began and ended one week later. Therefore, it encompassed one week more\nof higher volume production associated with typical seasonal product ramps.\nTurning to gross profit and gross margins. Non-GAAP gross profit in the quarter was $282.9 million, and non-\nGAAP gross margin was 52.2%. On a sequential basis, the gross margin increase of 160 basis points was mostly\ndriven by favorable product mix. The 90-basis point increase year-over-year was largely due to favorable product\nmix. This was offset, in part, by higher supply chain costs.\nNow, I'll turn to operating expenses. Non-GAAP operating expense for the second quarter was $126.8 million. On\na sequential basis. OpEx was up $8.8 million, primarily due to higher variable compensation and product\ndevelopment costs. This was offset by a reduction in employee-related expenses. On a year-over-year basis,\noperating expense was up $12.3 million, largely due to higher employee-related expenses, increased variable\ncompensation, and higher product development costs. Non-GAAP operating income for the quarter was $156.2\nmillion, or 28.8% of revenue.\nTurning now to taxes. For the September quarter, our non-GAAP tax rate was 23.8%, in line with our previous\nguidance.\nAnd lastly, on the P&L, non-GAAP net income was $125.3 million, resulting in record earnings per share for the\nSeptember quarter of $2.25 as the higher revenue and profitability flowed through to the bottom line.\nLet me now turn to the balance sheet. Our balance sheet continues to be strong, and we ended the September\nquarter with $706.6 million in cash and investments. Our ending cash and investment balance was down $38\n4\n1-877-FACTSET www.callstreet.com Copyright © 2001-2024 FactSet CallStreet, LLC\nCirrus Logic, Inc.\n(CRUS) Corrected Transcript\nQ2 2025 Earnings Call 04-Nov-2024\nmillion from the prior quarter, primarily due to cash spent on share repurchases, partially offset by cash generated\nfrom operations. We continue to have no debt outstanding and have $300 million undrawn on our revolver.\nOur inventory balance at the end of the second quarter was $271.8 million, up from $232.6 million in Q1 FY 2025.\nDays of inventory were down slightly sequentially, and we ended the quarter with approximately 96 days of\ninventory. Looking ahead in Q3 FY 2025, you can expect a slight increase in inventory dollars from the prior\nquarter. If you would also note, as we move through FY 2025 and into FY 2026, we expect inventory to increase\nas we continue to fulfill demand and manage our wafer purchase commitments per our long-term capacity\nagreement with GlobalFoundries.\nTurning to cash flow. Cash flow from operations was $8.2 million in the September quarter, and CapEx was\nroughly $2.7 million, resulting in non-GAAP free cash flow margin of roughly 1%. For the trailing 12-month period,\ncash flow from operations was $579.6 million and CapEx was roughly $30.4 million. This resulted in non-GAAP\nfree cash flow margin of roughly 29%.\nOn the share buyback front, in Q2, we utilized $50 million to repurchase approximately 356,000 shares of our\ncommon stock at an average price of approximately $140. At the end of Q2 FY 2025, the company had $224.1\nmillion remaining in its share repurchase authorization. We expect to continue to return capital in the form of stock\nrepurchases, which we believe will provide a long-term benefit to shareholders going forward.\nNow, onto the guidance. For Q3 of FY 2025, we expect revenue in the range of $480 million to $540 million. I\nwould like to take a moment to highlight a couple of factors influencing our revenue guidance.\nFirst, when comparing our December quarter outlook to the equivalent quarter last year, guidance reflects one\nlast week of revenue as FY 2024 was a 53-week fiscal year. And second, as a result of the additional week last\nyear, the timing of the end of our fiscal quarters in FY 2025 has shifted, therefore the September quarter included\none more week of higher volume production associated with typical seasonal product ramps.\nMoving on to gross margin. GAAP gross margin is expected to range from 51% to 53%. Non-GAAP operating\nexpense is expected to range from $124 million to $130 million. On a sequential and year-over-year basis,\nguidance reflects increases in product development costs, which are partially offset by lower variable\ncompensation and a reduction in employee-related expenses. We will continue to control discretionary spending\nwhile investing strategically in product development to drive long-term growth. We expect our FY 2025 non-GAAP\ntax rate to be approximately 22% to 24%, unchanged from our previous guidance. This range is slightly higher\nthan our FY 2024 tax rate, which was impacted by a favorable catch-up benefit related to updated IRS guidance\non the R&D capitalization rule.\nIn closing, we delivered outstanding results for the September quarter. We are pleased with the progress we have\nmade this year, and remain focused on executing our strategy that we believe will enable the company to grow\nboth revenue and profitability during the long term.\nBefore we begin the Q&A, I would like to note that while we understand there is an interest related to our largest\ncustomer, in accordance with Cirrus Logic Company policy, we will not discuss specifics about our business\nrelationship.\nWith that, let me now turn the call to Chelsea to start the Q&A session.\n......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\n5\n1-877-FACTSET www.callstreet.com Copyright © 2001-2024 FactSet CallStreet, LLC\nCirrus Logic, Inc.\n(CRUS) Corrected Transcript\nQ2 2025 Earnings Call 04-Nov-2024\nChelsea Heffernan\nVice President-Investor Relations, Cirrus Logic, Inc.\nThanks, Ulf. We will now start the Q&A portion of the earnings call. Please limit yourself to a single question and\none follow-up. Operator, we are now ready to take questions.\n......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nQUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION\nOperator: The floor is now open for questions. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of\nChristopher Rolland of Susquehanna. Your line is open.\n......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nChristopher Rolland Q\nAnalyst, Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP\nHey. Guys. Thanks for the question. So, I do think I understand the extra week in September and the effect there,\nbut still this is, for December, a larger than typical seasonal decline. I guess maybe you can talk about the\ninterplay there, between content, your content expectations, what was actually delivered, versus, like, build\npatterns, whether you had shipped ahead there versus just unusual weakness in units. And then, as we think\nabout March, I know you don't want to guide a quarter ahead, but given that that seasonality is all messed up for\nDecember, March is typically down high 20s, how should we think about that, just given the messed up\nDecember? Thanks.\n......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nJohn Forsyth A\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Cirrus Logic, Inc.\nThanks, Chris. I think the various kind of moving pieces make sense on December, but there's a bit of unpacking\nto do, so let me just do that and then circle around to the rest of your question. So, there were at least three\nfactors when we look at the December year-on-year comps. So, first, this September quarter that we're reporting\nhad one more week of the higher volume production that is associated with the peak ramp period for us as a\nconsequence of it coming later in the year because FY 2024 was a 53-week fiscal year for us. So, that's one\nfactor; just meant there was a week of higher-volume, higher-value stuff in September than we would normally\nsee.\nThen the second thing to think about when comparing year-over-year is that, of course, the December quarter in\nfiscal 2024 was a 14-week quarter. So, that that also influences the comps.\nThen, a final point, which I think I talked to on the last call, is that in the December quarter last year we saw more\nAndroid production than we would normally see in that period, that was due to a large Android customer ramping\ntheir product earlier than they normally do.\nSo, there were various factors that contributed to record-breaking December last year and then obviously to the\ncomps that, that we've faced this December. But I think when you look across the sequence of – obviously the\nquarter boundary is different as it relates to the ramp; but the numbers, taken together, kind of look fairly robust.\nSo, if you take the first three fiscal quarters of this year using the midpoint of our December guide, then that\ncompares – that's slightly up on the first three fiscal quarters of last year, for example. So, as you say, the\nseasonal picture is somewhat different, but more than anything that's a function of these factors that I've outlined.\n6\n1-877-FACTSET www.callstreet.com Copyright © 2001-2024 FactSet CallStreet, LLC\nCirrus Logic, Inc.\n(CRUS) Corrected Transcript\nQ2 2025 Earnings Call 04-Nov-2024\nSo, when it comes to the March seasonality and our expectations there, yeah, to your point, as you know, I need\nto make the obligatory comment that we don't guide more than one quarter out. And the December quarter and\nthe March quarter are the hardest to guide for us because they really depend on what the demand looks like as\nwe go through the holiday period for the various key products that have been recently launched. So, as a\nconsequence of that, as you allude to historically, there's been a fairly big spread of seasonality there. We've\nseen anything from down 11% to down 40%, I think, over the past several years, with probably an average\nshaking out around 30%. But we really have no color to give on March at this point. So, I'll have to leave it there\nfor now and obviously update you with much more detail when we get around to reporting the December quarter.\n......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nChristopher Rolland Q\nAnalyst, Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP\nUnderstood, John. Maybe the next one for Ulf. So, on the wafer obligations, I think there are like mid 500s in\n2024. You get some relief next year, I think, high 300s. The inventory that you're building that's, I imagine, on that\n2024 number, just as it's higher. As we move into next year, would you expect any inventory built, or are we all\nout of the clear there on that side? And then, any anything else, any other pain points or things to think about on\nthe wafer obligations? Thanks.\n......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nUlf Habermann A\nInterim Chief Financial Officer & Chief Accounting Officer, Cirrus Logic, Inc.\nYeah. So, we have to fulfill those wafer obligations, as you stated. And you can see, our minimum commitment\nschedules out there as well in the K. But, yeah, we expect to build inventory into early FY 2026 as well. But that's\nall inventory that we expect to sell long term, right? That's all long-term selling products that we're building in that\nwith Global.\n......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Tore Svanberg of Stifel. Your line is open.\n......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nTore Egil Svanberg Q\nAnalyst, Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.\nYes. Thank you. So, John, I appreciate you can't talk a lot about your largest customer, but it is a bit of an unusual\ntime where they're kind of updating their operating systems and their product cycle is kind of on the go, right? So,\nI'm just wondering if that has created any unusual linearity for you, whether it's staging inventory or lead times\nbecause it is a bit unusual. So, I'm just wondering if that has created anything unusual for you as a supplier.\n......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nJohn Forsyth A\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Cirrus Logic, Inc.\nI think it's a little hard to judge that, Tore. The biggest impacts, I think, for us that shapes this September-\nDecember transition is really the fact that September comes – our September quarter ended a little later. We think\nthat's the major factor there, obviously, with new content coming online this year and as I referred to in my\nopening remarks, more favorable mix regarding camera controllers, there is a lot of build, over the past few\nmonths, obviously. It's a significant amount of material on content, which we've ramped there. But I think we're still\nin the very early innings of those products. There's obviously still actually some very exciting features yet to be\nlaunched, and we've yet to go into the holiday period, so I wouldn't want to call it more than that until we're on the\nother side of that period, Tore.\n......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nTore Egil Svanberg Q\nAnalyst, Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.\n7\n1-877-FACTSET www.callstreet.com Copyright © 2001-2024 FactSet CallStreet, LLC\nCirrus Logic, Inc.\n(CRUS) Corrected Transcript\nQ2 2025 Earnings Call 04-Nov-2024\nWell, that's fair. And just as a follow-up and I'll use sort of what's happening in the laptop to try to understand what\ncould potentially happen in the smartphone. I know it usually happens the other way around, but you did talk\nabout selling in a new laptop now basically a codec amplifiers and power conversion ICs. And I'm a little bit\nintrigued about the power conversion ICs. Is this something that you expect to expand on in the smartphone\nmarket in 2025?\n......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nJohn Forsyth A\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Cirrus Logic, Inc.\nThat's a great question. So, let me let about that product in particular, and maybe also just put it within context of\nall the product offerings that we have in the laptop space right now. We're shipping, today, audio codecs,\namplifiers, haptics drivers. And now, in this quarter, we began shipping power conversion chips as well. So, those\nfour different product categories, which we're really excited about. I think on a previous call I highlighted when one\nof our customers launched a product with seven Cirrus Logic chips in it, which included haptics drivers, amplifiers\nand a codec. It did not include power chips.\nSo, now I'm talking about eight, which includes, codec amplifiers and power chips, but no haptics. So, hopefully,\none day we will be here talking to you about a laptop that contains all of these. But, of course, we are very excited\nabout the range of opportunities that having all these products represents. The power chip itself has its origins in\nsome of the IP that we acquired as part of the Lion Semiconductor transaction a few years ago. It's a switch-cap\nDC-DC converter with very, very high efficiency compared to [indiscernible] (23:57) legacy products and\narchitectures for DC-DC conversion. But what that really translates into is less power being lost through heat and\nless heat being generated within the laptop and needing to be dissipated.\nSo, very attractive, both from the user perspective and the industrial design perspective. And that's really a big\npart of what got it on the Lunar Lake reference design. And that's driving some of these initial design [ph] ends\n(24:27) that we've seen. It's not always necessarily a 1-to-1 attach rate. We've seen in that case that I talked\nabout with the OEM that launched a product with eight chips in it. There are three of our power conversion chips\nin there, and that represents a significant quantity of revenue and ASP for us.\nAs to whether or not that kind of chip finds its way into smartphones, we do sell power-related products in\nsmartphones today, both some – one custom chip, as you know. It's not a classic power conversion chip like this\none. And in the general market, we are, by and large, focused on – I don't think we'll see quite this chip coming to\nsmartphones. By and large, in the smartphone space, we're focused on a couple of things. Really, really, high\nprecision stuff, either side of the battery. And then, in the general market, we typically focus on selling products\nthat we have today, given that the R&D dollars that we are deploying in the power space, we feel a better\ndeployed targeting the laptop market, as we see that as being a larger overall opportunity for us.\n......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Thomas O'Malley of Barclays. Your line is open.\n......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nThomas O'Malley Q\nAnalyst, Barclays Capital, Inc.\nHey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. My first one is just on seasonality into the last fiscal quarter as well. I\nknow you guys want to stay away from guiding there, but just if I take kind of the better end of the historical\nseasonality kind of down 11% in the March quarter and I look at where that puts you as a business, like you're still\nkind of growing mid-single digits in fiscal year 2025. So, I don't think you've updated really your expectations on\nthe content side for this year. And I think that you had a couple really nice upgrades there. So, what would explain\n8\n1-877-FACTSET www.callstreet.com Copyright © 2001-2024 FactSet CallStreet, LLC\nCirrus Logic, Inc.\n(CRUS) Corrected Transcript\nQ2 2025 Earnings Call 04-Nov-2024\nthe difference, I guess, between the initial outlook of a strong content year and kind of that fiscal year, even at the\nbest type of seasonality in March, not being up kind of high single digits, low double digits.\n......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nJohn Forsyth A\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Cirrus Logic, Inc.\nWell, we really just guide based on what we see, Tom. I'm not going to guide further out, but we really just base\nthat on what we see, in terms of backlog from our customers and our conversations throughout the supply chain.\nSo, we really just have to see how we go through this holiday period. We certainly are delighted with the\nexecution, the ramp and the quality of the products that we brought to market on this cycle. And then, of course,\nwe have a more favorable mix in the camera space. But, yeah, we'll just have to see how that translates into\nresults as we go forwards and get on the other side of the December quarter.\n......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nThomas O'Malley Q\nAnalyst, Barclays Capital, Inc.\nHelpful. And then on the PC side, you had talked about tens of millions of dollars kind of exiting this year. Could\nyou maybe talk about how that's been tracking so far? And then as you look kind of into next year, are you still in\nkind of the tens of millions of dollars range or do you think that you have more confidence kind of sitting here\ntoday versus where you were three or six months ago on that side? Thank you.\n......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nJohn Forsyth A\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Cirrus Logic, Inc.\nThanks, Tom. Well, the phrase tens of millions obviously encompasses a fairly broad range. My comment about\nthis fiscal year was that we were tracking to – we were targeting low tens of millions. We're tracking to that, I'm\nvery pleased to say. And we do think we're in the very early stages of seeing our [indiscernible] (28:20) PC-\nfocused products, this generation of products that we've developed across the different domains that I talked\nabout. We're in the early stages of seeing them come to market now, but we are seeing them come to market.\nAnd I anticipate, early in the coming calendar year, we'll see a really great range of product launches from\ncustomers incorporating more Cirrus content. So, those will land in terms of revenue impact, more in – they'll have\nmore – greater impact on fiscal 2026, obviously, so we'll give more color on that in due course as we get closer to\nfiscal 2026. But so far, it's certainly tracking with our expectations. And the momentum we have is really exciting.\nSo, we're anticipating a meaningful step-up in fiscal 2026 from where we've been tracking in fiscal 2025.\n......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nOperator: Your last question comes from the line of Ananda Baruah of Loop Capital. Your line is open.\n......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nAnanda Baruah Q\nAnalyst, Loop Capital Markets LLC\nYeah. Thanks, guys, for taking the question. Yeah, I guess just one for me. Is there any context you can provide\nor sort of useful way to think about as you think forward with [indiscernible] (29:41) on the smartphone side? If the\ngrowth coming forward and this is big picture, this is not next year, but it will be driven both from, I guess, the\ncontent side or the unit side, more disproportionately? I guess really trying to think about where the bigger\nopportunity is for the company. Thanks. If one is bigger than the other. Thanks.\n......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nJohn Forsyth A\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Cirrus Logic, Inc.\nThank you. Ananda. Well, we run the company on the basis that we want to be able to grow and be positioned for\ngrowth if units are flat, that's our objective. Obviously, if there's a units tailwind, so much the better. If there's a\n9\n1-877-FACTSET www.callstreet.com Copyright © 2001-2024 FactSet CallStreet, LLC\nCirrus Logic, Inc.\n(CRUS) Corrected Transcript\nQ2 2025 Earnings Call 04-Nov-2024\nsignificant upgrade cycle because of features, our customers are delivering them, that's great. But we want to be\npositioned well even if smartphone units remained flat. And although that won't mean necessarily content\nadditions every year, we do, on a second cycle, obviously get a tailwind because multiple generations of phones\nare on sale at any given time, and we get into the second cycle of new content.\nBut we also believe when we look forward that there are significant opportunities for both incremental additions to\nsockets that we have today which add more value and for the capturing of new sockets that we haven't served\nbefore. And so, when I talk about some of our R&D investments in those areas and obviously some of that is – for\nexample, camera; some of that is in the power space and there are others beyond that. Then that's the kind of\nthing I have in mind. So, we do believe there are great opportunities out there where we can lead on technology,\nlead on architecture, deliver better solutions than, our customers have had in the past. And, obviously bring our\nexecution to bear on that as well. So, I think the opportunity, even in a flat units world, remains very constructive\nfor us over the long run.\n......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nAnanda Baruah Q\nAnalyst, Loop Capital Markets LLC\nThat's really, really useful context. I really appreciate it. Yeah, that's it for me. That's great. Thank you so much.\n......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nChelsea Heffernan\nVice President-Investor Relations, Cirrus Logic, Inc.\nAnd with that, we'll end the Q&A session, and I will now turn the call back to John for his final remarks.\n......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nJohn Forsyth\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Cirrus Logic, Inc.\nThank you Chelsea.\nIn summary, in Q2 fiscal 2025, Cirrus Logic delivered record revenue and earnings per share for the September\nquarter, and continued our solid progress in each of the three key areas of our long-term strategy. We remain\nvery excited about the opportunities in front of us, and we thank you for your continued interest in our progress. I'd\nalso like to thank all of our employees for their incredible dedication and commitment. Before we close, I'd also\nlike to note that we will be participating in Barclays 22nd Annual Global Technology Conference on December 12\nin San Francisco. Please check our investor website for the details on that.\nFinally, I'd like to thank everybody for participating today.

          "content": "Q2 FY25\nLetter to Shareholders\nNovember 4, 2024\nNovember 4, 2024\nDear Shareholders,\nIn Q2 FY25, Cirrus Logic delivered record revenue and EPS for the September quarter, driven by strong\ndemand for products shipping into smartphones and a higher-volume production week associated with\ntypical seasonal product ramps. Revenue was $541.9 million, up 45 percent quarter over quarter and up\n13 percent year over year. GAAP and non-GAAP operating profit were 24.3 percent and 28.8 percent,\nrespectively, while GAAP and non-GAAP earnings per share were $1.83 and $2.25, respectively.\nDuring the quarter, our next-generation custom boosted amplifier and first 22-nanometer smart codec\nstarted shipping in recently launched smartphones. We also passed key milestones related to our laptop\nbusiness as we secured our first high-volume mainstream design win with our latest PC codec and began\nshipping our first power product specifically designed for laptops in multiple tier-one customers’ devices.\nOne of these new devices includes eight Cirrus Logic components, representing the breadth of our\ncontent opportunity in this market. While we are in the early stages of revenue contribution from our\nrecently introduced laptop components, we are pleased with our progress to date. Furthermore, we plan\nto continue leveraging our mixed-signal design and advanced low-power signal processing expertise to\ncapitalize on future growth opportunities.\nFigure A: Cirrus Logic Q2 FY25\nQ2 FY25 GAAP Adj. Non-GAAP*\nRevenue $541.9 $541.9\nGross Profit $282.6 $0.3 $282.9\nGross Margin 52.2% 52.2%\nOperating Expense $150.7 ($23.9) $126.8\nOperating Income $131.9 $24.3 $156.2\nOperating Profit 24.3% 28.8%\nInterest Income $8.1 $8.1\nOther Income $— $—\nIncome Tax Expense $37.9 $1.1 $39.0\nNet Income $102.1 $23.2 $125.3\nDiluted EPS $1.83 $0.42 $2.25\n*Complete GAAP to Non-GAAP reconciliations available on page 11\nNumbers may not sum due to rounding\n$ millions, except EPS\nRevenue and Gross Margin\nRevenue for the September quarter was $541.9 million, up 45 percent quarter over quarter and up 13\npercent year over year. Q2 FY25 revenue was near the top end of our guidance range due to strong\ndemand for products shipping into smartphones. The increase in revenue on a sequential basis reflects\nhigher unit volumes associated with new smartphone launches. The year-over-year increase in sales was\ndriven by higher smartphone unit volumes and increased revenue associated with next-generation\nproducts. As we indicated in our Q1 FY25 shareholder letter, when comparing our September quarter to\nthe equivalent quarter last year, we would note that in FY25 our September quarter began and ended\none week later. Thus, it encompassed one week more of the higher-volume production associated with\ntypical seasonal product ramps.\nQ2 FY25 Letter to Shareholders 2\nIn the December quarter, we expect revenue to range from $480 million to $540 million, down six\npercent sequentially and down 18 percent year over year at the midpoint. When comparing our\nDecember quarter outlook to the equivalent quarter last year, guidance reflects one less week of revenue\nas FY24 was a 53-week fiscal year.\nIn Q2 FY25, revenue derived from our audio and high performance mixed-signal (HPMS) product lines\nrepresented 58 percent and 42 percent of total revenue, respectively. One customer contributed\napproximately 90 percent of total revenue in Q2 FY25. Our relationship with our largest customer remains\noutstanding, with continued strong design activity across a wide range of products. While we understand\nthere is intense interest in this customer, in accordance with our policy, we do not discuss specifics about\nthis business.\nFigure B: Cirrus Logic Revenue ($M) Q3 FY23 to Q3 FY25\n$700\n$619\n$591\n$600\n$542\n$510*\n$481\n$500\n$400 $373 $372 $374\n$317\n$300\n$200\n$100\n$0\nQ3/FY23 Q4/FY23 Q1/FY24 Q2/FY24 Q3/FY24 Q4/FY24 Q1/FY25 Q2/FY25 Q3/FY25\nAudio High-Performance Mixed-Signal\n*Midpoint of guidance as of November 4, 2024\nGAAP gross margin in the September quarter was 52.2 percent, compared to 50.5 percent in Q1 FY25 and\n51.3 percent in Q2 FY24. Non-GAAP gross margin in the September quarter was 52.2 percent, compared\nto 50.6 percent in Q1 FY25 and 51.3 percent in Q2 FY24. On a sequential basis, the 160-basis point\nincrease was mostly driven by a favorable product mix. On a year-over-year basis, the 90-basis point\nincrease was largely due to a favorable product mix, offset in part by higher supply chain costs. In the\nDecember quarter, we expect gross margin to range from 51 percent to 53 percent.\nQ2 FY25 Letter to Shareholders 3\nOperating Profit, Tax, and EPS\nOperating profit for Q2 FY25 was 24.3 percent on a GAAP basis and 28.8 percent on a non-GAAP basis.\nGAAP operating expense was $150.7 million and included $22.1 million in stock-based compensation and\n$1.9 million in amortization of acquisition intangibles. On a sequential basis, GAAP operating expense\nincreased by $8.6 million primarily due to higher variable compensation and product development costs.\nThis was offset by a reduction in employee-related expenses and the absence of a lease impairment. On a\nyear-over-year basis, GAAP operating expense increased by $9.9 million largely due to higher employee-\nrelated expenses, increased variable compensation, and higher product development costs. This was\noffset by the absence of restructuring costs. Non-GAAP operating expense for the quarter was $126.8\nmillion, up $8.8 million sequentially and $12.3 million year over year. The company’s total headcount\nexiting Q2 was 1,672.\nCombined GAAP R&D and SG&A expenses for Q3 FY25 are expected to range from $148 million to $154\nmillion, including approximately $22 million in stock-based compensation expense and $2 million in\namortization of acquisition intangibles, resulting in a non-GAAP operating expense range between $124\nmillion and $130 million.\nFigure C: GAAP R&D and SG&A Expenses ($M)/Headcount Q3 FY23 to Q3 FY25\n1,702 1,719\n$160 1,660 1,644 1,637 1,625 1,651 1,672\n$140\n$120\n$100\n$80\n$60\n$40\n$20\n$0\nQ3 FY23 Q4 FY23 Q1 FY24 Q2 FY24 Q3 FY24 Q4 FY24 Q1 FY25 Q2 FY25 Q3 FY25\nR&D SG&A Expense* Headcount\n*Reflects midpoint of combined R&D and SG&A guidance as of November 4, 2024\nFor the September quarter, GAAP tax expense was $37.9 million on GAAP pre-tax income of $140.0\nmillion, resulting in an effective tax rate of 27.0 percent. Non-GAAP tax expense for the quarter was $39.0\nmillion on non-GAAP pre-tax income of $164.3 million, resulting in a non-GAAP effective tax rate of 23.8\npercent. The GAAP and non-GAAP effective tax rates for the September quarter were unfavorably\nQ2 FY25 Letter to Shareholders 4\nimpacted by a provision of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 that requires companies to capitalize and\namortize R&D expenses rather than deduct them in the current year. We continue to anticipate that the\nimpact of capitalized R&D will become less pronounced as additional years of R&D expenses are\namortized. We estimate that our FY25 non-GAAP effective tax rate will range from approximately 22\npercent to 24 percent.\nGAAP earnings per share for the September quarter was $1.83, compared to earnings per share of $0.76\nthe prior quarter and $1.34 in Q2 FY24. Non-GAAP earnings per share for the September quarter was\n$2.25, versus $1.12 in Q1 FY25 and $1.80 in Q2 FY24.\nBalance Sheet\nOur cash and investment balance at the end of Q2 FY25 was $706.6 million, down from $744.6 million the\nprior quarter and $352.5 million in Q2 FY24. Cash flow from operations for the September quarter was\n$8.2 million. During the quarter, we repurchased 356,432 shares at an average price of $140.26,\nreturning $50.0 million of cash to shareholders in the form of buybacks. At the end of Q2 FY25, the\ncompany had $224.1 million remaining in its share repurchase authorization. Over the long term, we\nexpect strong cash flow generation, and we will continue to evaluate potential uses of this cash, including\ninvesting in the business to pursue organic growth opportunities, M&A, and returning capital to\nshareholders through share repurchases.\nQ2 FY25 inventory was $271.8 million, up from $232.6 million in Q1 FY25. In Q3 FY25, we expect a slight\nincrease in inventory dollars from the prior quarter. As we move through FY25 and into FY26 we expect\ninventory to increase as we continue to fulfill demand and manage our wafer purchase commitments per\nour long-term capacity agreement with GlobalFoundries.\nCompany Strategy\nWe remain committed to our three-pronged strategy for growing our business: first, maintaining our\nleadership position in smartphone audio; second, increasing HPMS content in smartphones; and third,\nleveraging our strength in audio and HPMS to expand into additional applications and markets with both\nexisting and new components.\nAudio in Smartphones\nThis quarter we were particularly excited to see our next-generation custom boosted amplifier and our\nfirst 22-nanometer smart codec begin shipping in recently-launched smartphones. This custom boosted\namplifier utilizes an innovative new architecture to deliver significant power and efficiency improvements\nwhile also reducing board space and the overall bill of materials for our customer’s products. The\ntransition to a more advanced technology node for the smart codec enables design flexibility while also\nmaking meaningful improvements in performance, size, and power consumption. We are focused on\nconsistently delivering high-quality products and expect both of these components to ship for multiple\nsmartphone generations, providing us with sustained revenue contribution in the coming years.\nAdditionally, a leading Android OEM introduced their latest flagship smartphone this past quarter\nfeaturing two of our boosted amplifiers. While the majority of our general market R&D investments are\nfocused on developing products for new markets, we continue to engage with customers on next-\ngeneration flagship smartphones with our general market audio components.\nQ2 FY25 Letter to Shareholders 5\nHPMS in Smartphones\nLooking beyond audio, we are excited about expanding our content in smartphones with HPMS solutions,\nwhich are expected to provide growth opportunities and revenue diversification. While we have several\nHPMS investments, our camera controllers have been a key product in driving this expansion. Since\nlaunching our first camera controller in 2020, the value of our camera-related content has steadily\nincreased over time, including with the recent launch of new flagship smartphones. We were delighted to\nsee the camera technology continue to be featured as an important differentiator in the new generation\nof devices. In this product cycle, we are benefiting from a more favorable overall mix of smartphones on\nthe market that include our camera controllers. Our customer engagement and close engineering\ncollaboration around our camera technology remains strong and we are working to identify further\nopportunities to enable advanced functionality and improve overall system performance. We are also\npleased to see leading Android OEMs introduce a variety of flagship smartphones that utilize our HPMS\ncomponents this fall. We continue to believe that there are opportunities for us in advanced power,\nsensing, and battery-related technologies, and we have a number of R&D programs underway that are\nfocused on these areas. Customer engagement on these opportunities is encouraging, and we are actively\npursuing sockets where we can deliver more efficient and flexible solutions through the integration of\ndigital processing and control alongside analog circuits. Looking ahead, we anticipate that the investments\nwe are making in this space today will continue to drive product diversification and revenue growth in the\nfuture.\nExpanding Audio and HPMS into New Applications and Markets\nOutside of smartphones, we are committed to leveraging our intellectual property and engineering\ncapabilities to expand into new applications and markets. We continue to gain traction in the laptop\nmarket, where the desire for higher-quality audio and the trend towards thinner, lighter, and more\nenergy-efficient designs, make our components increasingly attractive. These trends combined with the\nemergence of AI-enabled laptop platforms create numerous opportunities that Cirrus Logic can capitalize\non, particularly related to power efficiency and user experience features. While we are in the early stages\nof revenue contribution from our recently introduced laptop components, we are on track with our\nexpectations in this market and passed several key milestones during the quarter. That progress included\nsecuring our first high-volume mainstream design win with our latest PC codec that features both our\nbest-in-class hardware as well as audio algorithms for enhanced audio playback and speaker tuning to\nensure optimal performance. Additionally, we are pleased to have begun shipping our first power product\nspecifically designed for laptops in multiple tier-one customers’ devices. One of these new laptops has\neight Cirrus Logic components, including a codec, amplifiers, and power conversion ICs. This laptop\nshowcases the breadth of our content opportunity as our solutions enable compelling user experiences\nand improve battery life. We are encouraged by the strong customer engagement in this space and\nanticipate a growing number of end products featuring our components to come to market over the next\nyear.\nWhile laptops represent a significant growth opportunity outside of smartphones, we continue to see\nexcitement surrounding our recently launched series of high-performance audio data converters. These\ncomponents advance our long-held market leadership in audio performance and deliver differentiating\nfeatures without compromising on power efficiency. We are engaged with dozens of customers and\nexpect the first devices featuring the components to come to market in early 2025. Expanding on this\nworld class portfolio, we also have multiple new products being introduced in the coming quarters\ntargeting professional audio, consumer, and industrial end markets. Looking ahead, we expect to leverage\nour portfolio of technologies to expand our reach in additional applications and markets.\nQ2 FY25 Letter to Shareholders 6\nSummary and Guidance\nFor the December quarter we expect the following results:\n• Revenue to range between $480 million and $540 million;\n• GAAP gross margin to be between 51 percent and 53 percent; and\n• Combined GAAP R&D and SG&A expenses to range between $148 million and $154 million,\nincluding approximately $22 million in stock-based compensation expense and $2 million in\namortization of acquisition intangibles, resulting in a non-GAAP operating expense range between\n$124 million and $130 million.\nIn conclusion, we delivered strong financial results in Q2 FY25 while also continuing to execute on our\nstrategy to drive product and market diversification. During the quarter, we started shipping our next-\ngeneration custom boosted amplifier and first 22-nanometer smart codec, benefited from a more\nfavorable overall mix of smartphones on the market with our camera content, and passed several key\nmilestones with our laptop business. With a strong lineup of existing components and our investment in\nnew products, we are excited about the opportunities that will contribute to our continued success in the\ncoming years.\nSincerely,\nJohn Forsyth Ulf Habermann\nPresident & Interim Chief Financial Officer\nChief Executive Officer\nConference Call Q&A Session\nCirrus Logic will host a live Q&A session at 5 p.m. EST today to answer questions related to its financial\nresults and business outlook.

As you've seen in the press release, Cirrus\nLogic delivered record revenue and earnings per share for the September quarter. Revenue was $541.9 million,\nnear to the top end of our guidance range, due to strong demand for products shipping into smartphones. In a\nmoment, I'm going to hand the call over to Ulf to discuss the financial results for the September quarter in greater\ndetail, as well as our outlook for the December quarter. But before we get to that, I'd like to make a few remarks\nregarding our recent progress.\nAs many of you are aware, our long-term strategy for growing the company is based around three broad\nprinciples. First, maintaining leadership in our core flagship smartphone audio business. Second, continuing our\nexpansion in areas of high-performance, mixed-signal functionality in smartphones. And third, leveraging those\naudio and high-performance, mixed signal capabilities to penetrate and grow in new markets.\nIn our flagship smartphone audio business this past quarter, we were particularly excited to begin shipping our\nnext generation custom boosted amplifier and our first 22-nanometer smart codec in recently launched\nsmartphones. The new amplifier provides significant power and efficiency improvements, while the smart codec,\nin addition to being Cirrus Logic's first 22-nanometer product of any kind, delivers meaningful advances in audio\nand mixed signal processing capabilities. Together, these components showcase years of engineering dedication\nand close collaboration with our customer, and they contribute meaningfully to the power efficiency and\nextraordinary audio quality of our customers new products. We anticipate that both components will ship from\nmultiple smartphone generations, and in doing so, provide us with an enduring and substantial revenue stream in\nthe years ahead.\nLooking beyond audio, we are enthusiastic about the potential to grow content in smartphones with our high-\nperformance, mixed-signal solutions. Our progress in this area is evident in the continued success of our camera\ncontroller product line. Since the introduction of our first camera controller in calendar year 2020, our camera\ncontent has continued to increase in value over time. With the recent smartphone launch, we are benefiting from\na more favorable overall mix of smartphones on the market that include our camera controllers. We see\nconsiderable potential to add further value in this area, as we identify more opportunities to enhance system\nperformance and help enable advanced camera features.\nBeyond camera controllers, we also believe that advanced power sensing and battery related technologies\nrepresent excellent opportunities for us, and we continue to invest in a number of R&D programs that are focused\non these areas. We anticipate that the investments that we are making in this space today will contribute to\nproduct diversification and expand our footprint in these product categories in the future.\nThe third element of our strategy is focused on expanding into new applications and markets outside of\nsmartphones. In this area, we continue to be excited about the opportunities we see in our laptop business. While\nwe are still in the early stages of revenue contribution from our recently introduced laptop components, we were\n3\n1-877-FACTSET www.callstreet.com Copyright © 2001-2024 FactSet CallStreet, LLC\nCirrus Logic, Inc.\n(CRUS) Corrected Transcript\nQ2 2025 Earnings Call 04-Nov-2024\npleased with our progress during the September quarter. That progress included securing our first high-volume\nmainstream design win with our latest PC codec, which combines cutting edge hardware with advanced\nalgorithms for superior audio playback. We were also proud to ship our first power product designed specifically\nfor laptops in multiple Tier 1 customers' devices.\nAdditionally, during the quarter, we saw the introduction of a new laptop from a top tier laptop OEM that\nexemplifies the breadth of our content opportunity in this market in that it features eight Cirrus Logic components,\nincluding a codec, multiple audio amplifiers, and multiple power converter chips. We anticipate many more\ncustomer product introductions in the laptop space in the coming months, and are excited about the opportunity\nthis market represents.\nAnd with that, let me now turn the call over to Ulf to provide an overview of our financial results as well as the\noutlook.\n......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nUlf Habermann\nInterim Chief Financial Officer & Chief Accounting Officer, Cirrus Logic, Inc.\nThank you, John; and good afternoon, everyone. I will start with the summary of our financial results for our\nsecond quarter fiscal 2025, and then provide guidance for Q3 FY 2025.\nIn Q2, FY 2025, we delivered record revenue for the September quarter of $541.9 million, near the high-end of\nour guidance range. On a sequential basis, revenue was up 45% due to higher unit volumes associated with new\nsmartphone launches. On a year-over-year basis, sales were up 13%, driven by higher smartphone unit volumes\nand increased revenue associated with next generation products. Also, as we indicated in Q1 FY 2025 in our\nShareholder Letter when comparing our September quarter to the equivalent quarter last year, we would note that\nin FY 2025, our September quarter began and ended one week later. Therefore, it encompassed one week more\nof higher volume production associated with typical seasonal product ramps.\nTurning to gross profit and gross margins. Non-GAAP gross profit in the quarter was $282.9 million, and non-\nGAAP gross margin was 52.2%. On a sequential basis, the gross margin increase of 160 basis points was mostly\ndriven by favorable product mix. The 90-basis point increase year-over-year was largely due to favorable product\nmix. This was offset, in part, by higher supply chain costs.\nNow, I'll turn to operating expenses. Non-GAAP operating expense for the second quarter was $126.8 million. On\na sequential basis. OpEx was up $8.8 million, primarily due to higher variable compensation and product\ndevelopment costs. This was offset by a reduction in employee-related expenses. On a year-over-year basis,\noperating expense was up $12.3 million, largely due to higher employee-related expenses, increased variable\ncompensation, and higher product development costs. Non-GAAP operating income for the quarter was $156.2\nmillion, or 28.8% of revenue.\nTurning now to taxes. For the September quarter, our non-GAAP tax rate was 23.8%, in line with our previous\nguidance.\nAnd lastly, on the P&L, non-GAAP net income was $125.3 million, resulting in record earnings per share for the\nSeptember quarter of $2.25 as the higher revenue and profitability flowed through to the bottom line.\nLet me now turn to the balance sheet. Our balance sheet continues to be strong, and we ended the September\nquarter with $706.6 million in cash and investments. Our ending cash and investment balance was down $38\n4\n1-877-FACTSET www.callstreet.com Copyright © 2001-2024 FactSet CallStreet, LLC\nCirrus Logic, Inc.\n(CRUS) Corrected Transcript\nQ2 2025 Earnings Call 04-Nov-2024\nmillion from the prior quarter, primarily due to cash spent on share repurchases, partially offset by cash generated\nfrom operations. We continue to have no debt outstanding and have $300 million undrawn on our revolver.\nOur inventory balance at the end of the second quarter was $271.8 million, up from $232.6 million in Q1 FY 2025.\nDays of inventory were down slightly sequentially, and we ended the quarter with approximately 96 days of\ninventory. Looking ahead in Q3 FY 2025, you can expect a slight increase in inventory dollars from the prior\nquarter. If you would also note, as we move through FY 2025 and into FY 2026, we expect inventory to increase\nas we continue to fulfill demand and manage our wafer purchase commitments per our long-term capacity\nagreement with GlobalFoundries.\nTurning to cash flow. Cash flow from operations was $8.2 million in the September quarter, and CapEx was\nroughly $2.7 million, resulting in non-GAAP free cash flow margin of roughly 1%. For the trailing 12-month period,\ncash flow from operations was $579.6 million and CapEx was roughly $30.4 million. This resulted in non-GAAP\nfree cash flow margin of roughly 29%.\nOn the share buyback front, in Q2, we utilized $50 million to repurchase approximately 356,000 shares of our\ncommon stock at an average price of approximately $140. At the end of Q2 FY 2025, the company had $224.1\nmillion remaining in its share repurchase authorization. We expect to continue to return capital in the form of stock\nrepurchases, which we believe will provide a long-term benefit to shareholders going forward.\nNow, onto the guidance. For Q3 of FY 2025, we expect revenue in the range of $480 million to $540 million. I\nwould like to take a moment to highlight a couple of factors influencing our revenue guidance.\nFirst, when comparing our December quarter outlook to the equivalent quarter last year, guidance reflects one\nlast week of revenue as FY 2024 was a 53-week fiscal year. And second, as a result of the additional week last\nyear, the timing of the end of our fiscal quarters in FY 2025 has shifted, therefore the September quarter included\none more week of higher volume production associated with typical seasonal product ramps.\nMoving on to gross margin. GAAP gross margin is expected to range from 51% to 53%. Non-GAAP operating\nexpense is expected to range from $124 million to $130 million. On a sequential and year-over-year basis,\nguidance reflects increases in product development costs, which are partially offset by lower variable\ncompensation and a reduction in employee-related expenses. We will continue to control discretionary spending\nwhile investing strategically in product development to drive long-term growth. We expect our FY 2025 non-GAAP\ntax rate to be approximately 22% to 24%, unchanged from our previous guidance. This range is slightly higher\nthan our FY 2024 tax rate, which was impacted by a favorable catch-up benefit related to updated IRS guidance\non the R&D capitalization rule.\nIn closing, we delivered outstanding results for the September quarter. We are pleased with the progress we have\nmade this year, and remain focused on executing our strategy that we believe will enable the company to grow\nboth revenue and profitability during the long term.\nBefore we begin the Q&A, I would like to note that while we understand there is an interest related to our largest\ncustomer, in accordance with Cirrus Logic Company policy, we will not discuss specifics about our business\nrelationship.\nWith that, let me now turn the call to Chelsea to start the Q&A session.\n......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\n5\n1-877-FACTSET www.callstreet.com Copyright © 2001-2024 FactSet CallStreet, LLC\nCirrus Logic, Inc.\n(CRUS) Corrected Transcript\nQ2 2025 Earnings Call 04-Nov-2024\nChelsea Heffernan\nVice President-Investor Relations, Cirrus Logic, Inc.\nThanks, Ulf. We will now start the Q&A portion of the earnings call. Please limit yourself to a single question and\none follow-up. Operator, we are now ready to take questions.\n......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nQUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION\nOperator: The floor is now open for questions. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of\nChristopher Rolland of Susquehanna. Your line is open.\n......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nChristopher Rolland Q\nAnalyst, Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP\nHey. Guys. Thanks for the question. So, I do think I understand the extra week in September and the effect there,\nbut still this is, for December, a larger than typical seasonal decline. I guess maybe you can talk about the\ninterplay there, between content, your content expectations, what was actually delivered, versus, like, build\npatterns, whether you had shipped ahead there versus just unusual weakness in units. And then, as we think\nabout March, I know you don't want to guide a quarter ahead, but given that that seasonality is all messed up for\nDecember, March is typically down high 20s, how should we think about that, just given the messed up\nDecember? Thanks.\n......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nJohn Forsyth A\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Cirrus Logic, Inc.\nThanks, Chris. I think the various kind of moving pieces make sense on December, but there's a bit of unpacking\nto do, so let me just do that and then circle around to the rest of your question. So, there were at least three\nfactors when we look at the December year-on-year comps. So, first, this September quarter that we're reporting\nhad one more week of the higher volume production that is associated with the peak ramp period for us as a\nconsequence of it coming later in the year because FY 2024 was a 53-week fiscal year for us. So, that's one\nfactor; just meant there was a week of higher-volume, higher-value stuff in September than we would normally\nsee.\nThen the second thing to think about when comparing year-over-year is that, of course, the December quarter in\nfiscal 2024 was a 14-week quarter. So, that that also influences the comps.\nThen, a final point, which I think I talked to on the last call, is that in the December quarter last year we saw more\nAndroid production than we would normally see in that period, that was due to a large Android customer ramping\ntheir product earlier than they normally do.\nSo, there were various factors that contributed to record-breaking December last year and then obviously to the\ncomps that, that we've faced this December. But I think when you look across the sequence of – obviously the\nquarter boundary is different as it relates to the ramp; but the numbers, taken together, kind of look fairly robust.\nSo, if you take the first three fiscal quarters of this year using the midpoint of our December guide, then that\ncompares – that's slightly up on the first three fiscal quarters of last year, for example. So, as you say, the\nseasonal picture is somewhat different, but more than anything that's a function of these factors that I've outlined.\n6\n1-877-FACTSET www.callstreet.com Copyright © 2001-2024 FactSet CallStreet, LLC\nCirrus Logic, Inc.\n(CRUS) Corrected Transcript\nQ2 2025 Earnings Call 04-Nov-2024\nSo, when it comes to the March seasonality and our expectations there, yeah, to your point, as you know, I need\nto make the obligatory comment that we don't guide more than one quarter out. And the December quarter and\nthe March quarter are the hardest to guide for us because they really depend on what the demand looks like as\nwe go through the holiday period for the various key products that have been recently launched. So, as a\nconsequence of that, as you allude to historically, there's been a fairly big spread of seasonality there. We've\nseen anything from down 11% to down 40%, I think, over the past several years, with probably an average\nshaking out around 30%. But we really have no color to give on March at this point. So, I'll have to leave it there\nfor now and obviously update you with much more detail when we get around to reporting the December quarter.\n......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nChristopher Rolland Q\nAnalyst, Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP\nUnderstood, John. Maybe the next one for Ulf. So, on the wafer obligations, I think there are like mid 500s in\n2024. You get some relief next year, I think, high 300s. The inventory that you're building that's, I imagine, on that\n2024 number, just as it's higher. As we move into next year, would you expect any inventory built, or are we all\nout of the clear there on that side? And then, any anything else, any other pain points or things to think about on\nthe wafer obligations? Thanks.\n......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nUlf Habermann A\nInterim Chief Financial Officer & Chief Accounting Officer, Cirrus Logic, Inc.\nYeah. So, we have to fulfill those wafer obligations, as you stated. And you can see, our minimum commitment\nschedules out there as well in the K. But, yeah, we expect to build inventory into early FY 2026 as well. But that's\nall inventory that we expect to sell long term, right? That's all long-term selling products that we're building in that\nwith Global.\n......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Tore Svanberg of Stifel. Your line is open.\n......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nTore Egil Svanberg Q\nAnalyst, Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.\nYes. Thank you. So, John, I appreciate you can't talk a lot about your largest customer, but it is a bit of an unusual\ntime where they're kind of updating their operating systems and their product cycle is kind of on the go, right? So,\nI'm just wondering if that has created any unusual linearity for you, whether it's staging inventory or lead times\nbecause it is a bit unusual. So, I'm just wondering if that has created anything unusual for you as a supplier.\n......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nJohn Forsyth A\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Cirrus Logic, Inc.\nI think it's a little hard to judge that, Tore. The biggest impacts, I think, for us that shapes this September-\nDecember transition is really the fact that September comes – our September quarter ended a little later. We think\nthat's the major factor there, obviously, with new content coming online this year and as I referred to in my\nopening remarks, more favorable mix regarding camera controllers, there is a lot of build, over the past few\nmonths, obviously. It's a significant amount of material on content, which we've ramped there. But I think we're still\nin the very early innings of those products. There's obviously still actually some very exciting features yet to be\nlaunched, and we've yet to go into the holiday period, so I wouldn't want to call it more than that until we're on the\nother side of that period, Tore.\n......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nTore Egil Svanberg Q\nAnalyst, Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.\n7\n1-877-FACTSET www.callstreet.com Copyright © 2001-2024 FactSet CallStreet, LLC\nCirrus Logic, Inc.\n(CRUS) Corrected Transcript\nQ2 2025 Earnings Call 04-Nov-2024\nWell, that's fair. And just as a follow-up and I'll use sort of what's happening in the laptop to try to understand what\ncould potentially happen in the smartphone. I know it usually happens the other way around, but you did talk\nabout selling in a new laptop now basically a codec amplifiers and power conversion ICs. And I'm a little bit\nintrigued about the power conversion ICs. Is this something that you expect to expand on in the smartphone\nmarket in 2025?\n......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nJohn Forsyth A\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Cirrus Logic, Inc.\nThat's a great question. So, let me let about that product in particular, and maybe also just put it within context of\nall the product offerings that we have in the laptop space right now. We're shipping, today, audio codecs,\namplifiers, haptics drivers. And now, in this quarter, we began shipping power conversion chips as well. So, those\nfour different product categories, which we're really excited about. I think on a previous call I highlighted when one\nof our customers launched a product with seven Cirrus Logic chips in it, which included haptics drivers, amplifiers\nand a codec. It did not include power chips.\nSo, now I'm talking about eight, which includes, codec amplifiers and power chips, but no haptics. So, hopefully,\none day we will be here talking to you about a laptop that contains all of these. But, of course, we are very excited\nabout the range of opportunities that having all these products represents. The power chip itself has its origins in\nsome of the IP that we acquired as part of the Lion Semiconductor transaction a few years ago. It's a switch-cap\nDC-DC converter with very, very high efficiency compared to [indiscernible] (23:57) legacy products and\narchitectures for DC-DC conversion. But what that really translates into is less power being lost through heat and\nless heat being generated within the laptop and needing to be dissipated.\nSo, very attractive, both from the user perspective and the industrial design perspective. And that's really a big\npart of what got it on the Lunar Lake reference design. And that's driving some of these initial design [ph] ends\n(24:27) that we've seen. It's not always necessarily a 1-to-1 attach rate. We've seen in that case that I talked\nabout with the OEM that launched a product with eight chips in it. There are three of our power conversion chips\nin there, and that represents a significant quantity of revenue and ASP for us.\nAs to whether or not that kind of chip finds its way into smartphones, we do sell power-related products in\nsmartphones today, both some – one custom chip, as you know. It's not a classic power conversion chip like this\none. And in the general market, we are, by and large, focused on – I don't think we'll see quite this chip coming to\nsmartphones. By and large, in the smartphone space, we're focused on a couple of things. Really, really, high\nprecision stuff, either side of the battery. And then, in the general market, we typically focus on selling products\nthat we have today, given that the R&D dollars that we are deploying in the power space, we feel a better\ndeployed targeting the laptop market, as we see that as being a larger overall opportunity for us.\n......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Thomas O'Malley of Barclays. Your line is open.\n......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nThomas O'Malley Q\nAnalyst, Barclays Capital, Inc.\nHey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. My first one is just on seasonality into the last fiscal quarter as well. I\nknow you guys want to stay away from guiding there, but just if I take kind of the better end of the historical\nseasonality kind of down 11% in the March quarter and I look at where that puts you as a business, like you're still\nkind of growing mid-single digits in fiscal year 2025. So, I don't think you've updated really your expectations on\nthe content side for this year. And I think that you had a couple really nice upgrades there. So, what would explain\n8\n1-877-FACTSET www.callstreet.com Copyright © 2001-2024 FactSet CallStreet, LLC\nCirrus Logic, Inc.\n(CRUS) Corrected Transcript\nQ2 2025 Earnings Call 04-Nov-2024\nthe difference, I guess, between the initial outlook of a strong content year and kind of that fiscal year, even at the\nbest type of seasonality in March, not being up kind of high single digits, low double digits.\n......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nJohn Forsyth A\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Cirrus Logic, Inc.\nWell, we really just guide based on what we see, Tom. I'm not going to guide further out, but we really just base\nthat on what we see, in terms of backlog from our customers and our conversations throughout the supply chain.\nSo, we really just have to see how we go through this holiday period. We certainly are delighted with the\nexecution, the ramp and the quality of the products that we brought to market on this cycle. And then, of course,\nwe have a more favorable mix in the camera space. But, yeah, we'll just have to see how that translates into\nresults as we go forwards and get on the other side of the December quarter.\n......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nThomas O'Malley Q\nAnalyst, Barclays Capital, Inc.\nHelpful. And then on the PC side, you had talked about tens of millions of dollars kind of exiting this year. Could\nyou maybe talk about how that's been tracking so far? And then as you look kind of into next year, are you still in\nkind of the tens of millions of dollars range or do you think that you have more confidence kind of sitting here\ntoday versus where you were three or six months ago on that side? Thank you.\n......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nJohn Forsyth A\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Cirrus Logic, Inc.\nThanks, Tom. Well, the phrase tens of millions obviously encompasses a fairly broad range. My comment about\nthis fiscal year was that we were tracking to – we were targeting low tens of millions. We're tracking to that, I'm\nvery pleased to say. And we do think we're in the very early stages of seeing our [indiscernible] (28:20) PC-\nfocused products, this generation of products that we've developed across the different domains that I talked\nabout. We're in the early stages of seeing them come to market now, but we are seeing them come to market.\nAnd I anticipate, early in the coming calendar year, we'll see a really great range of product launches from\ncustomers incorporating more Cirrus content. So, those will land in terms of revenue impact, more in – they'll have\nmore – greater impact on fiscal 2026, obviously, so we'll give more color on that in due course as we get closer to\nfiscal 2026. But so far, it's certainly tracking with our expectations. And the momentum we have is really exciting.\nSo, we're anticipating a meaningful step-up in fiscal 2026 from where we've been tracking in fiscal 2025.\n......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nOperator: Your last question comes from the line of Ananda Baruah of Loop Capital. Your line is open.\n......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nAnanda Baruah Q\nAnalyst, Loop Capital Markets LLC\nYeah. Thanks, guys, for taking the question. Yeah, I guess just one for me. Is there any context you can provide\nor sort of useful way to think about as you think forward with [indiscernible] (29:41) on the smartphone side? If the\ngrowth coming forward and this is big picture, this is not next year, but it will be driven both from, I guess, the\ncontent side or the unit side, more disproportionately? I guess really trying to think about where the bigger\nopportunity is for the company. Thanks. If one is bigger than the other. Thanks.\n......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nJohn Forsyth A\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Cirrus Logic, Inc.\nThank you. Ananda. Well, we run the company on the basis that we want to be able to grow and be positioned for\ngrowth if units are flat, that's our objective. Obviously, if there's a units tailwind, so much the better. If there's a\n9\n1-877-FACTSET www.callstreet.com Copyright © 2001-2024 FactSet CallStreet, LLC\nCirrus Logic, Inc.\n(CRUS) Corrected Transcript\nQ2 2025 Earnings Call 04-Nov-2024\nsignificant upgrade cycle because of features, our customers are delivering them, that's great. But we want to be\npositioned well even if smartphone units remained flat. And although that won't mean necessarily content\nadditions every year, we do, on a second cycle, obviously get a tailwind because multiple generations of phones\nare on sale at any given time, and we get into the second cycle of new content.\nBut we also believe when we look forward that there are significant opportunities for both incremental additions to\nsockets that we have today which add more value and for the capturing of new sockets that we haven't served\nbefore. And so, when I talk about some of our R&D investments in those areas and obviously some of that is – for\nexample, camera; some of that is in the power space and there are others beyond that. Then that's the kind of\nthing I have in mind. So, we do believe there are great opportunities out there where we can lead on technology,\nlead on architecture, deliver better solutions than, our customers have had in the past. And, obviously bring our\nexecution to bear on that as well. So, I think the opportunity, even in a flat units world, remains very constructive\nfor us over the long run.\n......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nAnanda Baruah Q\nAnalyst, Loop Capital Markets LLC\nThat's really, really useful context. I really appreciate it. Yeah, that's it for me. That's great. Thank you so much.\n......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nChelsea Heffernan\nVice President-Investor Relations, Cirrus Logic, Inc.\nAnd with that, we'll end the Q&A session, and I will now turn the call back to John for his final remarks.\n......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nJohn Forsyth\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Cirrus Logic, Inc.\nThank you Chelsea.\nIn summary, in Q2 fiscal 2025, Cirrus Logic delivered record revenue and earnings per share for the September\nquarter, and continued our solid progress in each of the three key areas of our long-term strategy. We remain\nvery excited about the opportunities in front of us, and we thank you for your continued interest in our progress. I'd\nalso like to thank all of our employees for their incredible dedication and commitment. Before we close, I'd also\nlike to note that we will be participating in Barclays 22nd Annual Global Technology Conference on December 12\nin San Francisco. Please check our investor website for the details on that.\nFinally, I'd like to thank everybody for participating today. Goodbye.\n......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call.
