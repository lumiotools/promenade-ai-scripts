Reports 2024 Nine-Month Financial Results\n\nCompany Release - 10/17/2024 4:15 PM ET\n\nDownload the PDF version PDF Format (opens in new window)\n\nMIDDLEFIELD, Ohio, Oct. 17, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Middlefield Banc Corp. (NASDAQ: MBCN) today reported financial results for the nine months ended September 30, 2024.\n\n**2024 Nine-Month Financial Highlights** (on a year-over-year basis):\n\n  * Net income was $10.7 million, compared to $13.8 million\n  * Pre-tax, pre-provision net income(1) was $14.7 million, compared to $19.0 million\n  * Earnings were $1.32 per diluted share, compared to $1.70 per diluted share\n  * Net interest income after the provision for credit losses was $42.9 million, compared to $47.4 million\n  * Noninterest income increased 4.1% to $5.3 million, compared to $5.1 million\n  * Total loans increased 3.9% to a record $1.50 billion, compared to $1.45 billion\n  * Total deposits increased 3.8% to a record $1.51 billion, compared to $1.46 billion\n  * Return on average assets annualized was 0.77%, compared to 1.06%\n  * Return on average equity annualized was 6.90%, compared to 9.43%\n  * Return on average tangible common equity(1) was 8.68%, compared to 11.92%\n  * Nonperforming assets to total assets increased to 1.62% from 0.75%\n  * Allowance for credit losses was 1.50% of total loans, compared to 1.45%\n  * Equity to assets strengthened to 11.34%, compared to 10.80%\n  * Book value increased 9.1% to $26.11 from $23.94 per share\n  * Tangible book value(1) increased 12.1% to $20.87 from $18.62 per share\n\n\n\n**(1)** See non-GAAP reconciliation under the section “GAAP to Non-GAAP Reconciliations”\n\nRonald L. Zimmerly, Jr., President and Chief Executive Officer, stated, “We ended the third quarter of 2024 with record total assets and deposits, as well as a record book value per share. These results reflect our team’s dedication and commitment to serve customers throughout our Central, Western and Northeast Ohio markets. We ended the quarter with higher charge-offs and non-performing loans, associated with one customer. As a result, the provision for credit losses increased during the third quarter and reduced after tax earnings by $0.12 per diluted share. Despite these one-time impacts, we produced strong levels of core profitability, including the highest level of pre-tax pre-provision income in the past four quarters.”\n\n“I am pleased with the progress we are making maintaining appropriate funding costs and controlling noninterest expense, as our quarterly cost of funds declined sequentially for the first time in ten quarters, and noninterest expense was at the lowest level in six quarters. We expect the economic environment will remain fluid over the near-term, and as we look to 2025, we will continue to focus on supporting our communities, strategically allocating capital, maintaining disciplined underwriting standards, and prudently managing expenses,” concluded Mr. Zimmerly.\n\n**Income Statement** Net interest income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, decreased $4.7 million to $45.1 million, compared to $49.8 million for the same period last year. The net interest margin for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, was 3.50%, compared to 4.09% last year. Net interest income for the 2024 third quarter decreased $894,000 to $15.1 million, compared to $16.0 million for the 2023 third quarter. The net interest margin for the 2024 third quarter was 3.46%, compared to 3.82% for the same period of 2023.\n\nFor the nine months ended September 30, 2024, noninterest income increased $211,000 to $5.3 million, compared to $5.1 million for the same period in 2023. Noninterest income for the 2024 third quarter was $1.7 million, compared to $1.8 million for the same period the previous year.\n\nNoninterest expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, was $35.7 million, compared to $36.0 million for the same period in 2023. For the 2024 third quarter, noninterest expense was $11.9 million, compared to $12.1 million for the 2023 third quarter.\n\nNet income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, was $10.7 million, or $1.32 per diluted share, compared to $13.8 million, or $1.70 per diluted share, for the same period last year. Net income for the 2024 third quarter was $2.3 million, or $0.29 per diluted share, compared to $3.8 million, or $0.47 per diluted share, for the same period last year.\n\nFor the nine months ended September 30, 2024, pre-tax, pre-provision net income was $14.7 million, compared to $19.0 million last year. For the 2024 third quarter, pre-tax, pre-provision net income was $4.9 million, compared to $5.7 million for the same period of 2023. (See non-GAAP reconciliation under the section “GAAP to Non-GAAP Reconciliations”.)\n\n**Balance Sheet** Total assets at September 30, 2024, increased 3.6% to $1.86 billion, compared to $1.79 billion at September 30, 2023. Total loans at September 30, 2024, were $1.50 billion, compared to $1.45 billion at September 30, 2023. The 3.9% year-over-year increase in total loans was primarily due to higher non-owner occupied and residential real estate loans.\n\nTotal liabilities at September 30, 2024, increased 3.0% to $1.65 billion, compared to $1.60 billion at September 30, 2023. Total deposits at September 30, 2024, were $1.51 billion, compared to $1.46 billion at September 30, 2023. The 3.8% year-over-year increase in deposits was primarily due to growth in money market and time deposits, partially offset by declines in noninterest-bearing and interest-bearing demand and savings accounts. Noninterest-bearing demand deposits were 25.8% of total deposits at September 30, 2024, compared to 29.1% at September 30, 2023. At September 30, 2024, the Company had brokered deposits of $86.5 million, compared to $53.5 million at September 30, 2023.\n\nThe investment securities available-for-sale portfolio was $169.9 million at September 30, 2024, compared with $159.4 million at September 30, 2023.\n\nMr. Ranttila, Chief Financial Officer, stated, “We continue to look at opportunities to proactively strengthen our balance sheet and improve our cost of funds. In addition, since December 31, 2023, deposits have increased 6.0%, while our Federal Home Loan Bank (“FHLB”) advances have decreased by 35.0%. This is the lowest level of FHLB advances in over a year. In addition, during the quarter, we received approval to use the Federal Reserve Board’s discount window, adding a new and efficient liquidity provider. The combination of high levels of potentially liquid assets, cash flows from operations, and additional borrowing capacity continues to provide us with excellent liquidity levels to support our long-term growth strategies and our legacy of returning excess capital to shareholders.”\n\nMiddlefield's CRE portfolio included the following categories at September 30, 2024:\n\n**Balance**| **Percent of**| **Percent of**  \n---|---|---  \n**CRE Category**| (in thousands)| **CRE Portfolio**| **Loan Portfolio**  \nMulti-Family| $| 94,798| 13.8| %| 6.3| %  \nOffice Space| 75,149| 10.9| %| 5.0| %  \nShopping Plazas| 69,762| 10.1| %| 4.6| %  \nSelf-Storage| 56,041| 8.1| %| 3.7| %  \nHospitality| 39,840| 5.8| %| 2.6| %  \nSenior Living| 23,069| 3.3| %| 1.5| %  \nOther| 330,611| 48.0| %| 22.0| %  \nTotal CRE| $| 689,270| 100.0| %| 45.7| %  \n  \n**Stockholders' Equity and Dividends** At September 30, 2024, stockholders' equity was $210.7 million, compared to $193.7 million at September 30, 2023. The 8.8% year-over-year increase in stockholders' equity was primarily from higher retained earnings and an improvement in the unrealized losses on the available-for-sale investment portfolio, partially offset by stock acquired under the Company's stock repurchase program. On a per-share basis, shareholders' equity at September 30, 2024, was $26.11, compared to $23.94 at September 30, 2023.\n\nAt September 30, 2024, tangible stockholders' equity(1) was $168.5 million, compared to $150.6 million at September 30, 2023. On a per-share basis, tangible stockholders' equity(1) was $20.87 at September 30, 2024, compared to $18.62 at September 30, 2023. (1)See non-GAAP reconciliation under the section “GAAP to Non-GAAP Reconciliations”.\n\nFor the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company declared cash dividends of $0.60 per share, totaling $4.8 million. \n\nFor the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company repurchased 43,858 shares of its common stock, at an average price of $24.00 per share. There were no repurchases during the third quarter of 2024.\n\nAt September 30, 2024, the Company's equity-to-assets ratio was 11.34%, compared to 10.80% at September 30, 2023.\n\n**Asset Quality**\n\nFor the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company recorded a provision for credit losses of $2.2 million, versus a provision for credit losses of $2.4 million for the same period last year. For the 2024 third quarter, the Company recorded a provision for credit losses of $2.2 million, compared to a provision for credit losses of $1.1 million for the same period of 2023.\n\nNet charge-offs were $1.3 million, or 0.11% of average loans, annualized, for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to net charge-offs of $87,000, or 0.01% of average loans, annualized, for the same period last year. Net charge-offs were $1.4 million, or 0.36% of average loans, annualized, for the 2024 third quarter, compared to net recoveries of $16,000, or 0.00% of average loans, annualized, for the same period of 2023. The higher net charge-offs were due to the partial charge-off of one loan during the 2024 third quarter. \n\nNonperforming loans at September 30, 2024, were $30.1 million, compared to $7.7 million at September 30, 2023. Nonperforming assets at September 30, 2024, were $30.1 million, compared to $13.5 million at September 30, 2023. The increase in nonperforming assets is primarily the result of a $13.5 million loan moved to nonaccrual in the 2024 third quarter, subsequent to the partial charge-off noted in the previous paragraph. The allowance for credit losses at September 30, 2024, stood at $22.5 million, or 1.50% of total loans, compared to $21.0 million, or 1.45% of total loans at September 30, 2023. The increase in the allowance for credit losses was mainly from changes in projected loss drivers, prepayment assumptions, curtailment expectations over the reasonable and supportable forecast period, and geographic footprint of unemployment data, as well as an overall increase in total loans.\n\nMichael Ranttila stated, “Nonperforming assets during the third quarter were impacted by a $13.5 million loan. Combined with the two previously disclosed relationships that moved to nonaccrual in the second quarter of 2024, these three customers accounted for $20.2 million of nonperforming assets at September 30, 2024. We believe these relationships do not indicate a trend in the markets we serve, our portfolio, or underwriting standards. Despite this increase, we remain well reserved for potential credit losses with an allowance for credit losses to total loans of 1.50% at September 30, 2024, which was up slightly from both the same period a year ago, and the quarter ended June 30, 2024.”\n\n**About Middlefield Banc Corp.**\n\nMiddlefield Banc Corp., headquartered in Middlefield, Ohio, is the Bank holding Company of The Middlefield Banking Company, with total assets of $1.86 billion at September 30, 2024.
