(Nasdaq: HUMA), a clinical-stage biotechnology platform company developing universally implantable, bioengineered human tissue at commercial scale, announced the publication of clinical results evaluating the efficacy and safety of the acellular tissue engineered vessel (ATEV) in the repair of extremity civilian and military injuries in _JAMA Surgery_ , an American Medical Association peer-reviewed journal. The publication “Bioengineered Human Arteries for the Repair of Vascular Injuries” describes two clinical studies in which the ATEV demonstrated benefits in terms of patency (blood flow), limb salvage, and infection resistance compared to synthetic graft benchmarks in the treatment of acute vascular injuries of the extremities.\n\n“The development of a vascular conduit that resists infection and remodels into native arteries is an extraordinary technological advancement that will have a huge impact on the quality of trauma care around the world,” said Charles J. Fox, MD, FACS, Director of Vascular Surgery at the University of Maryland Capital Region, a clinical investigator in the Humacyte V005 trauma clinical trial. “The ATEV is perfectly sized to treat most injuries, has excellent handling properties, and reduces time necessary to save both life and limbs. Finally, an innovative technology has been developed for battlefield vascular injuries using a tissue engineered human arterial replacement that can resist infections that are so prevalent in modern combat zones. The ATEV shows promise to reduce amputation rates since an alternative conduit for war injuries is often needed but up until now has not been a good option.”\n\nThe _JAMA Surgery_ publication described the results of two studies in which the ATEV was evaluated in patients with extremity vascular trauma. The V005 clinical trial was a single-arm study conducted in the United States and Israel in patients with arterial injuries resulting from gun shots, workplace injuries, car accidents, or other traumatic events for whom the standard of care, saphenous vein, was not feasible or available to use as a bypass graft. The V017 single-arm clinical trial evaluated patient outcomes from a humanitarian program which patients with wartime injuries were treated in Ukraine. As single-arm studies, the comparators for the ATEV results were a systematic literature review and meta-analysis of studies conducted with synthetics grafts, providing a current treatment benchmark comparison. In a meta-analysis combining the V005 and V017 trials, the ATEV demonstrated higher patency with a 30-day secondary patency rate of 91.5% for the extremity patients compared to 78.9% historically reported for synthetic grafts. For the secondary comparison of amputation rates, the ATEV demonstrated an improvement with a rate of 4.5% for extremity patients compared to 24.3% historically reported for synthetic grafts. For the secondary comparison of infection, the ATEV demonstrated an improvement with a reduced rate of 0.9% for the extremity patients compared to 8.4% historically reported for synthetic grafts. In summary, researchers concluded that the 30-day outcomes in civilian and military trauma patients indicate superior secondary patency, limb salvage, and resistance to infection of the ATEV conduit compared to synthetic grafts.\n\n\"I believe that the ATEV will revolutionize vascular trauma care and be profoundly beneficial to our patients,\" said Rishi Kundi, MD, Chief of Vascular and Endovascular Trauma at the University of Maryland's R Adams Cowley Shock Trauma Center. \"Based on my personal experience so far, the ATEV will allow reconstruction that is currently impracticable because of contamination or infection; moreover, it will make reconstruction that we are now forced to perform with prosthetic or even biologic grafts more successful. I am excited about the promise that the ATEV holds for the long-term experience and outcomes of our patients.\"\n\nAlso published were longer-term follow-up results from the V005 and V017 studies. The ATEV was observed to be mechanically durable and does not appear to dilate or become stenotic over time. Long-term outcomes for secondary patency, limb salvage, freedom from conduit infection, and patient survival were evaluated by Kaplan-Meier analysis. The average follow-up duration for patients receiving the ATEV for extremity trauma is 334.4 days, with a total patient exposure of 61.3 years. These results showcased the potential of the ATEV to retain patency over the longer duration of follow up. No ATEV infections or patient deaths were reported after month three.\n\n“If approved by the FDA, the ATEV will be the preferred conduit for complex extremity vascular injuries, and particularly those at risk for infection.” said Ernest E. Moore, MD, FACS, Director of Research at the Ernest E. Moore Shock Trauma Center at Denver Health, a clinical investigator in the V005 trial. “I look forward to the ATEV being available for use in my practice.”\n\nEvaluation of the safety of the ATEV indicated no safety signals attributable to ATEV mechanical weakness, contamination, or immune rejection. Overall, Adverse Events (AEs) and Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) were consistent with patients suffering from acute injuries. Adverse Events of Special Interest (AESIs) including thrombosis, rupture, aneurysm, and pseudoaneurysm, occurred at rates that were consistent with reports of other vascular conduits, including autologous vein and synthetic grafts. The meta-analysis combing the V005 and V017 trials showed a 30-day rate of death in ATEV patients of 3.5%, comparable to the 3.4% rate historically reported for synthetic grafts. There were no deaths attributable to the ATEV.\n\nThe ATEV is an investigational, first-in-class bioengineered human tissue that is designed to be a universally implantable vascular conduit for use in arterial replacement and repair, and for use as hemodialysis access. While harvesting vein from a trauma patient requires critical surgical time, the ATEV is designed to be available immediately, off-the-shelf. A Biologics License Application for the ATEV in a vascular trauma indication is currently under review by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA).\n\nThe ATEV is an investigational product and has not been approved for sale by the FDA or any other regulatory agency.\n\n**About Humacyte**\n\nHumacyte, Inc.

(Nasdaq: HUMA), a clinical-stage biotechnology platform company developing universally implantable, bioengineered human tissue at commercial scale, announced the presentation of positive preclinical results of the small-diameter (3.5mm) acellular tissue engineered vessel (sdATEV) in a non-human primate model of coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). In the six-month preclinical CABG model the sdATEV was observed to sustain patency (blood flow), recellularized with the animals’ host cells, and remodeled to effectively reduce the initial size mismatch between the sdATEV and the animals’ native artery.\n\nThe preclinical results were presented in a poster titled “Acellular Tissue Engineered Vessels as Conduits for Coronary Artery Bypass Grafting” at The American Heart Association’s (AHA) _Scientific Sessions 2024_ meeting on Saturday, November 16, 2024, in Chicago, IL by two of the study researchers, Rob Kirkton, PhD, Humacyte Director of New Product Development and Alan Kypson, MD, FACS, FACC, Cardiothoracic Surgeon, UNC REX Hospital.\n\nIn the preclinical study, the sdATEV was implanted between the aorta and right coronary artery (RCA) in five baboons to simulate a CABG procedure. Animals were followed for six months after sdATEV implantation and all sdATEVs maintained patency throughout the study. The baboon study provided an effective model for demonstrating the feasibility, mechanical durability and capacity for host-cell remodeling of the sdATEV for CABG. After implantation, the sdATEV was observed to recellularize with host cells and remodel to form a multi-layered tissue including transanastomotic neomedial tissue that effectively reduced the initial size mismatch with the RCA. The neomedial tissue observed at six months was predominantly composed of quiescent contractile smooth muscle cells under a lining of functional endothelial cells.\n\n“Our results show that the sdATEV not only supports coronary blood flow but also host recellularization and adaptive remodeling in a challenging preclinical surgical model,” said Dr. Kirkton.\n\nThere are over 400,000 CABG procedures each year in the United States and the surgery has been shown to improve the survival and quality of life for many patients with coronary artery disease. The current conduits used for CABG are autologous vessels including the left internal mammary artery and saphenous vein, which is used in 80-90% of CABG surgeries. However, saphenous vein graft (SVG) patency at one year is often as low as 75% and SVG harvest can result in surgical wound infection potentially leading to prolonged hospital stay, need for revascularization, and limb-loss. In addition, a number of patients do not have usable saphenous vein available for surgical bypass.\n\n“This study suggests that the sdATEV may be a promising off-the-shelf alternative to saphenous vein grafts in CABG, which is a major unmet clinical need,” said Dr. Kypson.\n\nThe ATEV is an investigational product and has not been approved for sale by the FDA or any other regulatory agency.\n\n**About Humacyte**\n\nHumacyte, Inc. (Nasdaq: HUMA) is developing a disruptive biotechnology platform to deliver universally implantable bioengineered human tissues, advanced tissue constructs, and organ systems designed to improve the lives of patients and transform the practice of medicine. Humacyte develops and manufactures acellular tissues to treat a wide range of diseases, injuries, and chronic conditions. Humacyte’s initial product candidates, a portfolio of ATEVs, are currently in late-stage clinical trials targeting multiple vascular applications, including vascular trauma repair, arteriovenous (AV) access for hemodialysis, and peripheral artery disease. A Biologics License Application for the ATEV in the vascular trauma indication is currently under review by the FDA and was granted Priority Review. Preclinical development is also underway in coronary artery bypass grafts, pediatric heart surgery, treatment of type 1 diabetes, and multiple novel cell and tissue applications. Humacyte’s 6mm ATEV for AV access in hemodialysis was the first product candidate to receive the FDA’s Regenerative Medicine Advanced Therapy (RMAT) designation and has also received FDA Fast Track designation. Humacyte’s 6mm ATEV for urgent arterial repair following extremity vascular trauma and for advanced PAD also have received an RMAT designations. The ATEV received priority designation for the treatment of vascular trauma by the U.S. Secretary of Defense.
